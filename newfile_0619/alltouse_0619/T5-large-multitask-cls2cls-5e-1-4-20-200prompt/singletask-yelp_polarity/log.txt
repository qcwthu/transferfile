The person at the desk informed me that I do not have to call for pick-up service because it is noted on the ticket and to be sure to be at the designated location by 11:30 PM. The night of my pick-up we went to the designated pick up area at 11:20 PM.  At 11:26 PM I called just to check if the shuttle would be on time.  The dispatcher informed me that they are running about 5 to 10 minutes late.  At 11:40 PM I called back and asked for an update.  The dispatcher informed me that the shuttle driver came by at 11:35 PM and no one was there.  I informed the dispatcher that we have been out front from 11:20 PM and the door man of the hotel was out front since 11:00 PM and no airport shuttle came by. We had to catch a cab to the airport.  If they can lie about this,  I hate to think what else they would do.  I will attempt to get reimbursement for my cab fare which I think they will not do.  A follow up review to follow after I talk to them.   Paul Y.
