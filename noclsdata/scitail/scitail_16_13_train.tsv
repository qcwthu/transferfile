sentence 1: Dispersion is controlled by diffusion, which is the movement from areas of high to low concentrations, and by mixing, which is the movement of air in the space. [SEP] sentence 2: Diffusion is the term for the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.	entailment
sentence 1: Chondrite meteorites, such as the one found in Monahans and the Zag, are thought to comprise some of the most primitive ingredients from the early period of the solar system, and the water in the crystals could date as far back as 4.5 billion years. [SEP] sentence 2: Meteorites are often comprised of remnants of the earliest material that formed in the solar system.	entailment
sentence 1: Populations can be defined as the collection of all the individuals of a given species that live together in a particular habitat. [SEP] sentence 2: All members of a species living together form a(n) population.	entailment
