summarize: Dear Rick,  I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you about my Cash Balance Plan. My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up this Sunday, December 9. The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right. HR (Sheila Walton) told me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid severance. With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable now. HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning. Benefits stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I would vest. HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is. If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on vacation and terminated after the 9th. I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday. I feel that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of information and loads of unanswered questions. I do not see myself in a position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up. 	Carol North

summarize: Scott Yule advised that ANG system contracted for roughly 290 M2/day of new delivery capacity (210 to PGT & 80 to Southern Crossing). The Alberta system will expand by 222 M2/day plus an additional 37 M2/day for LRS 2 service. No capacity was relinquished. All of this is timed to come on line with the 2002 PGT expansion. Can you tell from the queue that I forwarded to you -  What is the split between Shippers going to PGT versus Southern Crossing? Thanks, 	ANG/Nova Expansions
summarize: Jeff: Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this  since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the  Revolver. Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor. My  objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this  language and that this deal does not create a new standard.

summarize: Gavyn Davies, via Helen Turley, has asked me to give you some guidance as to what you might include in your presentations at the meeting on October 31st. I do so with trepidation, since I am sure that you know more about your subject than I do, so please regard the following merely as suggestions to be ignored if you deem it appropriate to do so. We have blocked out two hours (9-11AM) to discuss market opportunities for Enron in Spain and Germany. My understanding is that Oscar will go first, as he has a plane to catch. I would suggest that each of you plan on speaking for about 30 (no more than 40) minutes, so as to leave time for questions from what will be a lively audience of Enron executives. You might want to begin with a general description of the political situation, followed by a description of the present and future state of the economy in each country. Then, you might turn to a more specific discussion of matters of interest to Enron: the state of regulation and deregulation of energy markets, the areas you consider should be of interest to Enron as business opportunities, etc. I do hope this is of help 	Enron meeting

summarize: Deer All:  I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to  fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response). B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head  of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they  were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and  doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm. Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking  for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out  there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and  would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys. He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I  don't care about that. Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could  proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up  taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two  spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this  spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be  the fall back plan. Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please. Erik.

summarize: I have talked to Penny Price 614-460-5540 about the letter COH sent to our customers. We estimate we have lost 5-10% of our customers effective for January because of this letter. She was to have their attorney, Dave Keenan, call me but I haven't heard from him yet. I told her we will want a clarifying letter to go out and a retraction to the statement "Enron may or may not be able to supply your customer needs." A gas contact at the OH PUC is Kerry Adkins 614-752-9374. I have told other staffers of the problem ( Tamara Turkenton of Consumer Services) and she gave me Kerry's name. 	Columbia of Ohio
summarize: there is, in effect, no monthly update to speak of. we have heard no word whether the other parties have finalized their settlement in priniciple, but note that  there have been no filings with the court. there also have been no communications from the court, either about a case conference or a rescheduled date for the motion hearing. we don't see any reason to push the court, so we'll let you know more when we know more. call or e-mail with any concerns or questions. 	monthly update
summarize: Lisa,  I feel so bad right now. I never wanted anything but to be with you  and love you the rest of my life. I wish we knew how important it was to  communicate with each other over the past years. I think we are both guilty  of not communicating. It is easier to talk to some besides each other about  certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been  built up over our portion of a lifetime together. It hurts to now clearly  understand this after things have happened. I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may  accept it as final. I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely  work on this relationship. I want us to talk and do things together. You  are my one true love. 	Future
summarize: Here's a first stab at the LOI. I just guessed on the attachment. I have a couple of questions:  Any thought as to how we get/split money (other than the obvious up side for  us)?

summarize: Question:  We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch  storage for the 2000 tax year. I found out yesterday that ENA handles  no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that. Do you know  what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year? We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage. I assume this would  all be for CES/New Power. If you know of any other Sonat storages we had for  the 2000 tax year, please let me know. Brenda will fax the Koch storage tax bill to you. Thanks 	Storage
