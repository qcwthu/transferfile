summarize: Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else  FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it. The Thursday rehearing  order dramatically changes how the "shipper must have title" rule applies to  acquisitions of upstream capacity. I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly  allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity  under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules. FERC specifically held that   the "shipper must have title" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe  treats the acquired capacity "as though it were part of its own system". (p.  61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity  from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be  done without advance Commission approval. Now, FERC explains that it did  not intend a "blanket waiver" of the shipper must have title policy. Pipes  can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only  if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational  needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism. If the  acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service  under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the "must  have title" policy is required (see FN 20 and text). We are right back to  where we started. I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely  to grant waivers of the "must have title" policy than in the past, but I  don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and  resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.

summarize: Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS. Since  Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him  in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain  a mention of the transition:  Example:   Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS. He will be  transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce  assumes his responsibilities for EBS. The current trading staff for EBS will  report to Barry effective with his start date in May. I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out  of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading  operations and that Barry will report to John Echols. So sounds as if that  is clarified. 	Announcement on Barry Pearce's role
summarize: To all Corporate Committee Members: As a Committee Member, you are asked to thumb through your rolodex and find those contacts that would be most interested in supporting the Contemporary Arts Museum. This year, we would like to start the thinking process before the November 1st meeting to avoid leaving out any potential targets. Therefore, we are asking that each of you identify three to five possible companies with your contact names and fax or email them to Amber Winsor at awinsor@camh.org or 713-284-8275 by 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, October 30, 2001. We will approach these companies to join as a corporate member at the $1000, $2500, $5000 or $10,000 levels. You can decide which level to ask for and you will be a signature on the request letter. At the meeting, we will identify co-signers to help improve the chances for a successful response from these prospects. FYI - for those of you who cannot attend the November 1st  meeting, this step is even more important. It will bring your voice and ideas to the meeting if you can't be there in person. Thank you.

This causes CES to be long or short depending on  the conversion factor.

summarize: I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion. I was pretty  impressed with her. The only down side is that her inability to sit for the  Texas bar is a hangup for a lawyer position. I suggested that she also look  into getting her license in New York or D.C. as I think those jurisdictions  are less reluctant to allow non-U.S. lawyers to sit for the bar than Texas  is. I'll talk to Mike Moran, Dot McCoppin, Britt Davis and Shelley Corman  regaring possible positions in GPG. Have you thought about Steve Kean's  group? They might be able to use someone like Emma.

summarize: Hi, My name is Kevin Jackson and I had an idea while at the Body shop today. Would it be possible to propose that Enron operate as a subsidiary of Dynegy, with the option to become an independent company after two years? Without understanding the details of the merger conversations and options, it is my feeling that this could be beneficial for both companies. Enron would obtain the cash infusion that it need, maintaining the culture and pulse of what makes us leaders; and Dynegy would retain its stock value and increase its bottom line profitability by having Enron as a substantial asset to its overall business portfolio. We as employees of Enron are here because we are proud of a culture that sets us apart from any other company in the world. Regardless of what is going on around us, we can still stand proud of what we have accomplished and the great talent pool we have here. I know times are tough for you now as it is for us all, but we will survive and I support and trust your vision that made us a great company. Thanks and I am interested in your feedback.

summarize: It was determined by a vote of the Forum Moderators at our meeting May 8th to form a new Forum (Forum VIII). This decision was based on the current Forum membership (81); the number of new members wishing to participate; and the number of prospective members currently in process. The new Forum affords a unique opportunity for existing members. In an effort to blend the experience of new members with seasoned Forum members, we are looking for the following:      a)	A member who wishes to change Forums      b)	Current Forum member having 3 years or less      eligibility remaining in YPO who would like to      help mentor an additional Forum. We are considering that this may give a member the opportunity to interact with other Houston YPOers or perhaps re-invigorate an individual's Forum experience. If you have any interest, please contact me by May 22nd. Please know that all questions, thoughts, or expressions of interest will be held by me in strict confidence. By way of process, the new Forum will participate in the draw with the other Forums who have indicated they need members. They will select first in the order. We trust that this process will give the new Forum an immediate opportunity to be successful. Thank you for your cooperation. 	New Forum
summarize: Item 1. Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form reg= arding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our s= chedule. (g)=09Setoff. (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early T= ermination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in eith= er case, "X") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any=  amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, "Y= ") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this A= greement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), = any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's A= ffiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obliga= tion) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s). The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respe= ct of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent o= f any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates. X will give Y noti= ce of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after t= he setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not a= ffect the validity of the setoff. For purposes of this Section, "Owed" sha= ll mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of wh= ether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Terminat= ion Date. Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by=  X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rat= e of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, = would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being convert= ed. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that o= bligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant pa= rty accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained. Nothing in=  this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security inter= est except as may be provided under applicable law. This setoff provision = shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting= , offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to whi= ch X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by=  operation of law, contract or otherwise). Each of the parties represents = and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral = part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the=  parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions. Each of the part= ies further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of i= tself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of=  its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Sectio= n and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agr= eement as it relates to this Section. (B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreeme= nt, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, sha= ll not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amo= unt under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party=  receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (whi= ch may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any=  kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined her= ein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any pay= ments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affil= iates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha= ve been fully and finally satisfied. The following are three areas of questions. A. Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section=  7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's "priority" position (assumin= g Bank has filed a financing statement)? Is the analysis below correct? 1. Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff=  rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof= f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20  2. Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h= as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent? =20 B. Assume a master netting agreement is in place. I believe our assignmen= t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we=  may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste= r agreement and transactions "as security". Please review and advise of an= y particular language you think should be added. =20  C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) p= rovision via our schedule, or is it necessary? For example, adding at the=  end of 7(b), ";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subje= ct [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all = rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section]." Item 2. Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master nettin= g agreement? 	Setoff and ISDA Section 7(b) Transfer Provision; Comments on New  Draft of Master Netting

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the  filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its  parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and  Exchange Commission. The utility said in the filing that it "retains control of its assets and is  authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being  subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court." A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail  prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back  debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale  power costs to consumers.
