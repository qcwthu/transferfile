summarize: Danny,  Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business. The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction. We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group. This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group. Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group. If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa. This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people). We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk. I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.

summarize: During the weekend of October 6 and 7, 2001 the Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating all production users off the current hardware (Solar) that houses their home and application directories (no production databases are affected, but client software will be) to new hardware. This migration requires a total system outage of approximately 6 hours. The outage will occur Saturday night - beginning at 7:00 PM and will last until Sunday morning at 1:00 AM. All users will need to be logged off during this time period. In order to validate the migration, production users need to test access to their home directories and applications on Sunday, October 7, 2001. If you do you experience any difficulties after the migration with access to home directories or applications, please call the resolution center at 713 853-1411. The resolution center will notify the appropriate resources. The following attachment is a list of the mount points affected.

summarize: Jeff - - -    Let me add to my best wishes for you and Rebecca that I conveyed the other night at Vallone's, my sincere hopes that the next post Enron-CEO phase of your life brings you personal happiness, fulfillment, fun and contentment. Although we often had different perspectives, my one-on-one sessions trying to get deals past you, while few in number, were some of the most stimulating and challenging I experienced here. I regret we never worked closely together - - you're the only really smart guy I've been unable to convince of/ demonstrate my value to in my working life. I think Ken Rice owes me for pissing you off and getting deselected to head the new US electricity efforts in '93! On a more somber note, I admired you for going over to Teeside last week to face the families. I can still remember vividly the faces, the destruction, the emotions in the hours after the San Juan Gas explosion in 1996. It was hard for awhile to get motivated to press ahead with the power/LNG project in the face of that tragedy and the distant thought that, gee, I'll be responsible for bringing the new facility to this island. Am I sure it won't kill people? If there was a catalyst or "straw" that tipped you across the line in asking how hard you're willing to fight just to keep doing the CEO job, instead of every other direction you could take your life, it wouldn't surprise me if the experience at Teeside was it. One changes, even if only subtly, after that kind of experience. Thanks for treating me civilly even when you were the most angry with the rest of EI. Good luck with your new marriage and the next phase of your life. 	Best Wishes
summarize: There are five CNG postings listed below. Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing  additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative  projects and joint ventures. In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression  into our gathering system may be approved. We have been able to grant a  limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make  this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers. For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station. The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations. The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system. Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office. The application must indicate the  amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames. We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited. In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis. Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression. Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement. Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type). Forward this information to:        Joseph A. Thompson     Manager, Business Development     Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division     500 Davisson Run Road     Clarksburg, WV  26301  After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a  determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the  capacity requests. You will be contacted as soon as possible after  June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close  after Noon on June 23, 2000. I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value  of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on  this opportunity to add compression. You can contact Joe Thompson at  (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may  have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering. Sincerely, 	CNG EBB notices
summarize: Gerald,  There are a number of things that have come up on which I hope to get your assistance, concerning both Dow wells 13 and 14 and the land sale to Texas Brine. Starting with Dow, I have written a (very rough!) draft reply to Gary Chapman's letter of October 2 regarding a new amendment to the Brine Services Agreement. We still would like them to buy the pad gas, but, given the equipment purchases needed if we do have to remove the pad gas, we have to have a concrete deadline for whether they will buy the gas (Dec. 14). Even so, in talking to Dave Owen it seems to me that the equipment may not be installed for rebrining by the time we exit the wells. How do we handle that type of delay contractually? Dave Owen has told Dow that we are not interested in allowing the fresh water option that Dow suggested in their letter, so I did not even address it here. I think they understand that we want no part of that. Perhaps we can discuss these and other issues after you've read the draft. As for the Texas Brine land sale,  Jean has asked me to draw up a timeline to close. I have spoken to the Texas Brine folks, and unless something goes really wrong with their environmental analysis,  we all expect this to close by the end of November. The timeline reflects this, but I would like you to take a quick look and see if I am missing anything, as there really are not that many steps. TB has not gotten back to us on the draft sale document, but I'm hoping to get it soon. There has been a bit of delay as they have requested access to any environmental assessments we have done on the land. All the channels I have pursued tell me there has never been anything done by Enron (per Kyle Purvis). If you know anything about this, please let me know! Do you have a draft of the easement agreement (?) for the March land sale? I don't have alot of details about location etc, but I think I could find them out if necessary. Perhaps while we are waiting for a reply on the sale doc we can hammer out the language for the easements on that and on the new land sale. I think that's it for now, have a great weekend and please let me know if you have time to talk early next week. Thanks! Eva 	Napoleonville Items

summarize: As discussed in our morning meeting the other day, NNG has a few points that have been approved as points that could potentially have daily capacity (capacity available for some time frame less than 30 days) throughout this winter. The attached file shows the points and the volume level that have been approved as points which may have daily capacity. As long as the amount of daily capacity that is determined to be available is within the points/volumes listed on this report, Omaha Planning will be able to post the capacity on our daily capacity report for 1 hour then we are able to sell it. If we exceed the volumes on this file or have capacity at other points, the capacity change will need to be routed for approval. At this time, we don't have any short term sustainable (capacity available for at least one month but less than 150 consecutive days) to post for this winter. If anyone is aware of short-term sustainable capacity that needs to be posted, please let me know. As changes are made to this list, I will forward them on to you. Beginning November 1, this posting (without the items in blue type) will be on our website. Finalized posting procedures for NNG will be completed by Michele Winckowski and forwarded to everyone. Please send this email on to the rest of the people on your teams. Thanks. Ranelle 	daily capacity

summarize: Everyone, J.C. asked me to send the following message:  Yesterday, the Houston federal court (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas) entered an Order consolidating all cases "involving or related to the financial difficulties of Enron" before one Judge, Lee Rosenthal (who was the Judge to whom the earliest-filed case had been assigned and who conducted the hearing last Friday). The consolidation order grants a motion that we and other defense counsel had made. It means that all cases in the Houston federal court should proceed in a more orderly, coordinated fashion. A technical detail - the Order provides for three separate consolidated proceedings before Judge Rosenthal: (i) the federal securities cases; (ii) the derivative cases (at least those that have been filed in federal court); and (iii) the employee benefit plan cases. Finally, the Order allows parties ten days to file objections to consolidation. While someone may well file an objection, we cannot think of any meritorious grounds for an objection. As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call us. Terri Richardson Assistant to J.C. Nickens    This e-mail and any attached files may be confidential and subject to attorney/client privilege. If you received it in error, please immediately notify the sender by return e-mail or by calling (713)654-7600. 	Order of Consolidation
summarize: Questions about this deal -   1. Should energy type be CAISO? 2. Should trade date be 3/7? 3. Should confirmation status be "NO"? I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before  changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals  marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just  a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the  confirmation status. Thanks, 	540493
summarize: Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon. He's pretty gung ho,  and also alluded to several other projects he's got on the front burner  (gas-fired power deals). He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about  the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in. Have you ever known a  project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds??? I look forward  to talking on Tuesday. DF 	Pueblo

summarize: Please pass this onto the individuals in your groups:  Tomorrow's simulation and Friday's desk to desk trading will provide an excellent opportunity for us to double check the online deals in tagg and sitara. Please pay special attention to these deals and let me know of any bridging issues. Even though we have been testing and having various people check the deals in the underlying systems, I am afraid of any logic that may be hardcoded in the bridge. Notify me immediately of any deals that are bridging incorrectly and I will try to resolve as soon as possible. I will also be watching the bridge to research any failed deals. Thanks for your help. Let's hope for a smooth transition! Dawn 3-9353 	Bridge logic
summarize: Jay:  In my travels looking for index 2 ways in the various rockies term markets you need I am running into several issues. First off, as you are aware, these markets don't tend to change much from day to day especially for the more obscure points and longer dated periods. Secondly, the time of year being the holidays is keeping most traders focused on Jan, Jan-Mar and April-Oct02 for the most part. Getting traders to show numbers beyond that, much less getting them to do it every day is not productive or practical. I suggest we keep in touch as we always do on a daily basis and I will pass on whatever we pick up in the market. However, attempting to refresh 2-5 year index markets on a daily basis isn't going to yield much in the way of "new" news. I look forward to seeing your shop get back on its feet down the road and to working with you. Thanks,    Jim Kornmann - DataLine Energy 	Rockies Term Markets
summarize: Tana: I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment. He never did  send me his comments. The file with the new draft will be with the files  near the window just in case.

I'm  not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now  with 2 separate guarantys. I'll keep you posted. Carol 	Engage
