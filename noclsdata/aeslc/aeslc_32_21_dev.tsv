summarize: For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive,                    and unlimited this month that you're capable of                    almost anything! (You've privately believed that                    the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This                    month, your incredible adaptability and powers of                    persuasion help you shed the status quo and                    break out of the corral. Unless you catch your                    foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People                    are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and                    conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an                    Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and                    provoke others to investigate things they may                    have taken for granted. Speak up during the first                    week, especially if it's to announce you're                    starting a new venture. Business travel is likely                    during the first and third weeks, especially if                    contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is                    actually enjoyable this month and can open your                    eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've                    dragged your tin cup across the bars long                    enough. I smell a prison break. . . . 	monthly forecast

summarize: Hey there! I went to jeep at lunch. The guy is giving me a good price on the car. However, he is trying to screw me on the price of my car. He is telling me that the price of the car purchased from the dealership is as follows...   Manuf price        $23,668 +sun roof-          $704.00 +destination charge $600.00 + a few addl charges$364.00 Total price          $25,336   That is pretty consistent with what I show for the price. Possibly taking off a few of those fees but that is pretty minimal... I am thinking that I should sell my car myself...  What do you think. Please see the attached file. This is how the guy is trying to screw me. 	jeep
summarize: Brant: Just a reminder that we need to discuss matters relating to Occidental (their  proposed change to the MAC language) and Chautauqua Airlines. Alos, with  respect to Aquila/Utilicorp,  apparently they cannot have all of the online  paperwork completed until next Tuesday. They submitted a PA today but the  guy that needs to authorize the sub-user accounts is not in the office until  Tuesday. The current plan would be for them to do that on Tuesday and then  to make the switch from Aquila to Utilicorp effective next Wednesday. I'll  keep you posted but we still have not declared the Utilicorp ISDA effective. Carol 	reminder

Maybe get me another name? Thanks. Sara 	Chase repo
summarize: Rick, I wanted to summarize for you my budget meeting with Michael on Wed. I will send you the whole pack under separate cover, but here are the highlights: 	Relatively speaking, it was constructive - he has made unequivical cut demands of other groups  	Original (adjusted) headcount budget for 2001 was 52, he is asking me to freeze heads at current 44  					which includes: not replacing recent leaver - Karin Levin 							not replacing scheduled Houston rotation - Oliver Harrison 							Scheduled new arrrivals	- John Collenette, Karl Sees, Blair Van Zant, Adam Bauer, Michel Gantois 							Tracy Ngo, plus 5 new in last month. 2002 budget looks much larger than 2001, despite lower headcount due to: $1.6MM increase due to full costing of expats @ salary plus 4x salary (instead of just 											salary) 										$500k for communications allocated 										increase in benefit costs from 10% to 23% 	All other expenses lowered -    Budget not finalized. Michael requested: reduce Travel by a significant amount ($100k?) get more precise justification of allocations from RAC Corp -  						Credit - $350k looks a little low (includes you, bill, debbie, credit reserve,CAS..) 						Market - $660 looks a little high/ok 						UndWr - $499 looks too high 						Portfolio - $108 ?? be prepared to shed under 2 scenarios a) 5 heads 										b) 10 heads 5 heads can be accomodated with little change in service, provided we continue to shed 'operational' credit responsibility and the current low level of large underwritten transactions and revals. Specific coverage holes and weakness will continue to be: EBS, German speaking credit person, depth in international markets, depth in market risk management. 10 heads would be quite disruptive and my recommendation would be to re-assess the role of RAC with an eye towards much less process work and immunity from finger pointing. Budget to be finalized a more comprehensive business review is completed over the coming few weeks. Perhaps we can discuss next week after you have reviewed. Ted 	2002 Budget

summarize: The reason NBC will not take cash is the preference thing. I think it may be helpful if an attorney were to call Bill Bonnell (and he can get his attorney) on why they should accept cash as margin or a prepay of the Jan invoice and it will not be a preference issue. It may not work, but we should try. His number is 514-394-7564. This needs to be done asap. They are one hour ahead of us and they will likely draw on the LC first thing tomorrow morning as the cure period is up today. Please advise. Tanya 	NBC

summarize: Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work. Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden. If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load. Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way. As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.

summarize: FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this  week. I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week. I will be  back in the office on Wednesday of next week. Todd tells me that a logo has been selected. Can you e:mail that to me? If  not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next  Wednesday. If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process  and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back  in the office next week. My first move will be to sit down with Jeff  Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours  that James Scribner sent you. When we look at numbers of confirmations and  compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which  activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed   to absorb increased business more easily. I also think that Jeff will be the  best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to  simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally. All of the  advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system,  auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm  group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for  implementation. No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next. 	Key Contacts - Out of Office - July 26-28, July 31 and August 1
summarize: The Perd is a problem because it cost $10,000 per year to maintain. I guess  Mom is (justifiably) tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six  months. There is really nothing more to it than that. When we1) all get a  little older and our kids can play unsupervised,2) are less busy and3) have  our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye, then we will use it  alot more. No one is seriosly considering selling the joint, save  Yvonne. I can probably take off two weeks in August next year to do something stupid  w/ you. July and June are bad because Julie will be in Montissori training  school in Austin. We should do something bold, exciting--not Colorado  or 	stuff
summarize: I swore I would be one of those people who said never and really meant it. Well, I guess "they" are right . . . Clay and I have some news. (No, I am not pregnant.) But, we are buying a   house in Dallas. We close on it two days after my arrival in London. Thankfully, Clay will still be here. We will rent it out over the next year   while we are away. Our move in date will be sometime next summer, depending   on our tenants' situation. So, about the never say never part. The house is in south Highland Park. Gasp! We never expected to buy a house this soon. And, I NEVER--I repeat 	so they say NEVER SAY NEVER. . .

summarize: We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds. $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book. During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001. Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI. The claims totaled close to $100 million. However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious. For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding. We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process. One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market. That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk. I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million. We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million. In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC. The draft decision recommended against any refunds. This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year. If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves. 	Northwest Reserves
