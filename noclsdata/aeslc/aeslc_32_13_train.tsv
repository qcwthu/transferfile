summarize: How the heck are ya? I have been thinking of  you alot lately. I tried to guess your e:mail address a couple of times  over the last couple of months but there is just no guessing it. I finally  had to call Laura Vuittonet. Well, I'm having a great time home with the  kids. I really thought I would be bored by now but I feel just a busy just  not as tired. In fact, for the first time since I had my kids I feel very  rested and at peace. It's fun being a kid and  running around Houston  when there isn't much traffic and it nice having the time to slow down the  pace. The boys are in Mothers Day Out 2 times a week from  9:00 - 2:00 which really isn't much time at all. I could use another day  of alone time. On those days I am usually meeting with Enron or once in a  while I meet a friend for lunch. Time really flies. Anyway, I hope all is well for you. Miss  ya. Janet 	Howday
summarize: To Our Valued Traffic Report Clients,   Today, FriedWire's Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and general connectivity problems caused by third parties. We apologize for this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this does not happen again. As always, we remain committed to providing you power markets information around-the-clock. Product Update   FriedWire has just added significant new content and capability to the Traffic Report, which are outlined below. Please contact us for brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather Forecasts       3-7 day Maximum Temperatures      6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability      8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly      Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed above)      Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies   ***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. Available Transmission Capacity  FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for available transmission by path. The new geographic interface will allow you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from non-path providers and more. ***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification services are now available along with the new ATC interface. Now, you can be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that you track ongoingly. You can custom define your alerts according to the provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the week, time of day, times per day, etc.). The following additional product upgrades have been deployed:   All hourly offerings are now reflected in military time designations. Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range (i.e. ; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. Eight new flowgates have been added for Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy. They all have Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting "View All Interties". All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of weeks. You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic Report.

summarize: Doug,  Here's the revised CA. I highlighted the changed terms. In addition, I  deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a  prior CA. I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,  but  obviously I left that for you to determine. I expect that the Enron entity  which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity. I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the complexity  of the issues, and I added 6 months to  the term since things won't get  cranked up for a while. I look forward to talking to you at your convenience. Have a good weekend. Kay 	CA re energy management services

summarize: barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:    While being entertained at the latest OSS working group meeting,  the limitation of being able to only schedule MIS 14 days in advance was brought up. Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in order to avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy). Now that things have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS. An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and using 4-5 man days to do. I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) and gave him the same song. If your shop would like to see the MIS limit lifted, have your representative to the S&P WG help it along. Please don't bother Ray directly or my TIE messages will rerouted to the Quilting Forum.

summarize: Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the  mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale  businesses. (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.) The controls around  mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test  - i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of  transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash. Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of  explaining what we think happens. Doing a deal test tells us what does  happen. And it is when there are differences between the controls that we  believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where  operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which  Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen. As such, they are purposely  designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to  produce less paperwork. It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and  potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that  are valuable in these reviews. These reviews also look  for ways to leverage  success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class  practices or practical solutions to shared problems. Briefly, the doorstep  review process would follow this set of steps:   1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office. This  is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be  notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain  that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell  them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in  making information and personnel available to complete the review. 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key  commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and  key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes. The  deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process  and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions. 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of  the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those  which may not be working as designed. Potential action items are suggested. This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually  very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support  their business. There are times when the head of an office will suggest an  additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with  this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support  the growth of their business. The doorstep team lets the head of the office  know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing  so. 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be  reviewed with Ted Murphy and me. Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls  and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view. Ted and I,  assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate  personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume  responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and  to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items. Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey  to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter,  doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep  findings and plans for the next quarter. Through most of 2000, the doorstep  teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each  doorstep review. This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me  sometime late in 2000. We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick  before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular  concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more  timely manner than quarterly. Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in  Germany. Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors  in charge of the scrap metal business. Her impression was that they were not  concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the  integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were  discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's  practices. Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley  was involved in that session as well. At my suggestion, she also contacted  Joe Gold to inform him of her findings. I do not know what the timing was  for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message. Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from  Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business. And if that was the  case, I apologize for that. While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I  know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you. If you  would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when  they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as  a clear step from this point going forward. The out of the ordinary step in  this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert  them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the  level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing  directors. I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and  myself. Although we had changed the process at year end so that the  download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice  mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a  meeting with Rick and Rick. This meeting should have been with Ted and me. In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona  mentioned some concerns. Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked  for more detail. She definitely covered both the teams findings and the  integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy. We don't, however, control  which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react. To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the  heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews. The effort here is  to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to  offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire  Enron organization. The key is quick discovery and quick resolution. The  findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations,  which I believe is healthy. We purposefully have chosen not to  "over-wordsmith" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be  surfaced through these reviews. Frankly, I believe that these reviews can  reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical  perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk. I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with  you. We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as  valuable input for you in managing EEL's business. Mike Jordan and certain  members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other  businesses outside EEL later in the year. We are certainly open to any  suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process. 	Doorstep Review Process
