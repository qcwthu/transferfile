summarize: Many of you have asked about procedures to evaluate employee performance. We are finalizing a performance process designed to track and provide feedback on individual accomplishments for the benefit of each employee, the company and the unsecured creditors' committee. A very simple and straight-forward online performance assessment system (PAS) will allow us to automate parts of the process. PAS will open next week on Monday, May 13, and remain open through Friday, May 24, 2002. As an employee of a debtor company, you should access the system and complete your self assessment by Friday, May 17, 2002. Your supervisor will review and approve submitted accomplishments and schedule a face-to-face meeting to discuss your contributions, offer feedback, set priorities for the upcoming period, discuss challenges and potential development opportunities, and if applicable, confirm your quarterly retention payout and project a target for the upcoming quarter. PAS will be accessible through the HR Global Launch Zone. We'll send a reminder with more details next week. In the meantime, if you have questions about the process you can contact your HR Representative. 	Performance Process for All Employees in Debtor Companies
summarize: Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage  arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement. I  makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as  this is really independent of the compression services. These storage  company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use  the counterparties paper. 	Bay Gas Storage

summarize: Ken  I understand a Turkish industrialist named Nuri ?olakoglu has been in contact with you through Bill Miller and possibly Jerry Giest. Colakoglu is an extremely wealthy and well regarded Turkish industrialist who has aggressively expanded into the Turkish energy sector. We have had a number of meetings with Colakoglu over the years and although we appreciate his potential prospects for the future we do not see a win-win opporutnity with his organization at this time. We expect he may try and contact you so wanted to let you know in advnace the background on his proposal. Colakoglu has proposed that, in order to manage our Trakya payment issue, Enron utilize the Arcos turbines to build, on balance sheet, a 1200 MW power plant at the tailgate of his recently completed specualtive LNG regas facility in Turkey. The plant would be part of a comprehensive proposal to the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce the prices at Trakya, in exchange for an agreement by TETTA? (the new Turkish power trading company resulting from the split up of TEA?, the former electricity monopoly) to purchase power from the new facility. All three plants would be fuelled by LNG provided by Enron and tolled through the Colakoglu's regas facility. In essence, Nuri wants us to build a power station as soon as possible to use the capacity at his LNG terminal which is now idle and has the potential to be a white elephant. Our team has explained to Colakoglu  that they thought the fact that the proposal relied totally on TETTA? 's credit was fatal, but that they would discuss it with EEL management. Lloyd Wantschek has responded to Colakoglu in the attached letter (we have highlighted the relevant portion for your information). 	Turkish industrialist Nuri Coalkoglu

summarize: I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on  the MG aquisition and assimilation. Would you please include me on that  distribution list effective this week? I believe that it is assumed that  Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the  aquisition is completed. However, in my role over Global Risk Management  Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of  operations and any issues surrounding assimilation. Brent Price, who reports  to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping  me updated on progress to date. His return soon to Houston, however, will  create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to  fill. Thanks in advance to your attention to this.

summarize: Jeff and Gerald,  I wanted you both to have the following information: (i) the legal/regulatory research questions that the Upstream Storage Group (Paul Bieniawski, Miguel Vasquez & Eva Rainer) have posed to LeBoeuf Lamb (law firm) and Brown Williams (rate consultant) and (ii) the two Reports produced in response to such questions. The Reports were delivered to the Storage Group personnel Friday, July 27, 2001, and were forwarded to me by Bob Neustaedter last Friday, August 3, 2001. The cost of this work was borne jointly by Jean Mrha's Upstream Group and the Regulatory Affairs Group; Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel, and Bob Neustaedter are the Regulatory/Governmental Affairs individuals involved in retaining Brown Williams and in recommending Larry Acker at LeBoeuf to conduct the legal/regulatory research. I reviewed the engagement letters on behalf of the Regulatory Affairs Department. The combined cost of these reports is about $100,000. I've done the best I can to be sure that the Upstream Storage Group does not "overlook" the Legal Department as it forges ahead into a transactional arena fraught with significant regulatory and accounting risks and traps. Gerald, as you have become involved with the development scenarios that involve a compression component, I think it would be wise to become familiar with the contents of both the LeBoeuf Lamb and Brown Williams Reports. If either of you would like to discuss the legal, regulatory or political implications of the attached, please feel free to give me a call. Steve 	Upstream--Storage Group Legal & Regulatory Research
summarize: Joe, Jeff an Bob: Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections  to our new form of Annex A:  1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply  2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff  language. Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if  they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity. 3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the "or otherwise" language in  the setoff language. Again, this is a credit issue. 4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting  a master in place with them. Sara expects this to happen in the next few  days. 5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill. I am working on this  one and their attorney owes me a response. This one may take a few weeks. 6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening  letter. It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial  derivatives with them recently. 7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to  tell me specifically what they object to. I will continue to follow up with  their attorney. 8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric. 9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying  they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them. I will  follow up with their attorney. 10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z)  to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation  as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral. Credit  should be alerted. 11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A  and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response. 12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy. 13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an  ISDA with them. If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have  requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA  negotiations. I can prepare a mark-up.

summarize: We have received the executed Acknowledgement and Termination Agreement dated  effective as of December 1, 1999 by and among El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas  Company (formerly known as El Paso Marketing Company, also formerly known as  Eastex Hydrocarbons, Inc.), El Paso Merchant Energy Gas, L.P., El Paso Energy  Corporation,  and ENA (formerly known as ECT). Such document referenced the  merger of Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. with and into El Paso Merchant  Energy-Gas L.P., and the subsequent assignment of El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas  LP's rights, duties and obligations to El Paso  Merchant Energy-Gas Company. Under such agreement, the parties agree that:  1. ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that (a) the Sonat  Marketing Company and Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. financial Transactions  shall be governed by the El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company financial Master  Agreement dated as of April 20, 1995; and (b) the Sonat physical transactions  shall be governed by the El Paso Enfolie Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement  dated March 1, 1998; 2. El Paso Energy Corporation, as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall  remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in  Item 1 above; 3. Enron Corp., as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full  force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above; 4. ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that the Sonat  financial Master Agreement dated as of September 1, 1994, and the Sonat  Master Firm Purchase/Sale physical Master Agreement, will be terminated; 5. Each of ENA, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and El Paso Energy  Corporation agree that the Sonat physical Guaranty dated August 28, 1995,   the Sonat financial Guaranty guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Enron Corp.  financial Guaranty dated as of August 28, 1995 and the Enron Physical  Guaranty dated May 1, 1994 are thereby terminated. All of the above is rather complex, and I've tried to reduce 3 pages of  "Whereas" clauses into 1 paragraph, but I will distribute the document to the  usual suspects, so any confusion about parties should become clearer.

summarize: Attached for your review are the finalized versions of the ISO Statement Files Specification (v14.0), ISO Charge Matrix (v14.0 ) and overview documents describing the key changes. Draft versions of the same documents were distributed in January for your review and comments. Version 14.0 is created due to changes in two settlement areas: *	The existing Market Operations Charge (CT 523) will be replaced by the new Ancillary Services and Real Time Energy Operations Charge (CT 524). *	To facilitate automatic processing of Manual Line Item entries by the SCs, ISO will impose more rigorous validations upon these entries when they are created in the ISO Settlement System.
