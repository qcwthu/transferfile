summarize: Dear Brothers, It was good to see everyone make the trek to central Oklahoma to launch Dent's book. The Daily Oklahoman published a brief story that suggested Dent had made up a bunch of lies about Saint Bud Wilkinson steppin out on the old lady. Around here, that's like saying the Pope likes it up the ass. Needless to say, the Sooner faithful were slightly chapped and the university canceled their offer to host the signing party at our new museum. Fuck 'em. Who wants to drink beer in a dusty old museum anyway? Del, sorry I couldn't make the party but I did get to see Cdie, Grumbles , Strange, Woody, Benson, PP, and Space for dinner. My favorite part was the full-volume discussion of who had the biggest penis (next to Benson, of course). Typical urology shit. The family next to us failed to recognize a medical discussion amongst professionals. Speaking of Benson, he was worried that his erections might crater all of a sudden just like his near vision has recently done. I assured him that this was extremely unlikely but, in his case, he'd better hope that his cardiac output remains high or else he's liable to pass out every time he gets a hard on. B.

summarize: Bob,   On the Texas desk, the majority of our deals are nominated manually (on Excel  or preprinted forms), with most of the information pulled from Sitara instead  of Unify. So, these noms were not late. For a couple of 3rd party  pipelines, we do use Unify. But we did not have nom changes for 5/4. Our  only problem was sending noms to HPL. Which is sending information to  yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline. This nom was sent about 30 minutes late. Let me know if you have any  questions. Daren 	Unify

summarize: Oooouch! That one hurt. We really kicked their butt all over the field. The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks. I don't think he had one  completed on him all night. What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team. I am trying not to get too down about this. This is  a young team that is  going to make mental errors and they will improve. I still thinks we will  have a good season. The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding. He looks fast out  there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return. He also got some  snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding. Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles. Victor Ike should be our starting tailback. He look big and fast and gets  yardages running in the interior. Ike left a defender looking really stupid  on his long TD run. Sweet moves. Hodges look about like he did last year. Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well. OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford. The thing I really like  was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and  that he will insure that they get fixed. Mackovic would have made excuses  that essentially put the blame elsewhere. This season could be an up and  down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after. Did you get any info on the game? 	NC State

summarize: Hi there! How's the little buglet doing? It was good to see you last week,  and I feel honored that I got to accompany Grayson on her first restaurant  mission. Hopefully the french-fry smell did not throw her off her feeding  schedule to badly. Got a message from Mema wanting to discuss the baby's  bottle habits. Pu-lease! If it's OK with everyone I will try to bring Bill  at Easter as a distraction. This weekend I am supposed to drive to Austin to pick up Bill and his friends  (aka Team Slacker) at the end of the MS 150. I'll be driving someone's SUV. If manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver (by Bill and the owner  of the SUV) do not improve, however, Team Slacker will be taking the bus home. Do you remember Rob Carty from high school? I just saw him at a seminar  given by Akin Gump for in-house lawyers. He works for Exxon/Mobil now. I  barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty!

"People thought he was a little, well, creepy," says Peter Smythe, the head  franchiser for Big Boy restaurants in Thailand, dusting off his giant Big Boy  statue on Bangkok's main thoroughfare. "They kept asking me, 'Is he a  Chinese Ronald McDonald?'" Eventually, a few Thai visitors decided Big Boy  was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet. ***  Take care and drop me a line when you can. Love, 	Hi

summarize: Second CA Merchant Storage Field Pushes Back Opening  California's second merchant underground natural gas storage project near Sacramento began injecting supplies this month, but its commercial start-up date has been pushed back to Dec. 1, according to the California operations manager for Houston-based Western Hub Properties LLC, the developer. Although it is not fully subscribed more than half the capacity is under contract, according to Jim Fossum, the in-state manager for Western Hub, which was purchased last summer by a partnership of Aquila Inc and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund in a $220 million deal that is still several months away from approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. The Lodi Storage Project near the town of Lodi, CA, about 35 miles south of the state capital, will have "high-performance, quick-cycle-capabilities" in a project that stores 12 Bcf of natural gas with a 500 MMcf/d withdrawal rate and 400 MMcf/d injection rate. Fossum said Western Hub also is pursuing a second merchant storage project in the southern half of the state around Bakersfield in the Wheeler Ridge area close to the nexus of all the major interstate natural gas pipeline coming into California. That project, he said, is not included in the Aquila partnership purchase at this time, and will be developed initial by a still-to-be-named company using some of the same personnel that developed Lodi. The same group also has a potential storage site identified in Texas, near San Antonio. 	Calif Lodi Storage Project Won't Start Up Now Until December 1

summarize: Hi Pete,  There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project. We are seriously  exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a  third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the  turbines. Sound familiar? Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called  Salmon somethingorother llc. I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need  to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent. I  believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on  for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the "new" Salmon  contract. I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale  can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with. Carlos Sole  is  the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats. His number is 713 345  8191. I will be out of the office next week, but will periodically check my voice  mail if  you have any questions. Thanks, 	Lv Co Gen Plan B

summarize: Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument. I did not go as far as I  could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no  limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what  capacity it can sell as firm. Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be  less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week. If you think this  passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it. My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as "firm" or "interruptible"  since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except  to assure us over the phone that it is firm! I'd like to check to see if PNM  is comfortable with all this before we file anything. Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15. 	PNM
