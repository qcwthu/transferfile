summarize: Phillip;  Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner. I was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I should just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals. Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Soft costs. I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, and again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it. Please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers to see if you agree. Land And Soft Costs 	- 	Initial Draw	$	  1,608,683.05 					Galaxy			-	Draw # 1	$	     250,000.00 					Galaxy			-	Draw # 2	$	     223,259.09  						Total Paid To Date Cash		$	  2,081,942.14  					Project Cost					$	10,740,980.87 					Loan Amount					$	  8,055,736.65  					Equity Required				$	  2,685,244.22 					Developer Profit					$	 (   326,202.57)  						Balance Of Funding			$	  2,359,041.65  						Total Paid To Date			$	  2,081,942.14  						Balance To Fund Cash			$	     277,099.51   					Galaxy			-	Draw # 3	$	     467,566.66  						Bank One Draw # 1			$	     190,467.15 						Final Cash Funding			$	     277,099.51   I think you thought you had more to fund.

summarize: John - you may have already heard this but on Friday, NYMEX increased margins for clearing brokers posting for Enron by 50%. Also Soc Gen cancelled their margin line on Friday (Warren wants to make it very clear that it was Soc Gen and not Fimat.) So far, Fimat is not reducing its trading limit with us but is passing through the NYMEX requirement. All of our brokers will have the right to do this and I expect them to do so.

summarize: Tracy called me at work. A water pipe broke under the street between her house and the old Hamilton house. She said water was shooting everywhere and that they were to turn off the water for at least 5 hours. Well, they worked fast because when I got home at 6:00, I had water. So I made some turkey soup. But Willow Lane will be torn up for a while as it just buckled the cement. The hole was about 7 feet down according to Tracy. Good thing this didn't happen on Thanksgiving! I have a foundation man coming out next week to check the foundation. Tracy seems to have a similar problem. Maybe we can get a two for one deal. John, I need your book list at Amazon.com this week. No excuses! Oh, tell Jeannie that I finished her soup this evening for dinner. She's a good cook! Have a good week guys. Love, Mom 	Willow Lane 
summarize: Need your book list from amazon.com!!!! May sleet and snow tonight but I think the ground is too warm to  stick or get icy. Although I could use a day off work! Send me your christmas list! Also, I see that Enron and Dynegy have been negotiating for days.....this concerns me. they cannot seem to come up with a new price. Are you continuing to lose trading? what % of normal trades are you now doing a day? I just hope you and Matthew are OK.  And Jeannie. Let me know. Love you, Mom. 	Book list

summarize: Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures. Bill  Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. He is an  extremely creative individual. Whalley actually commented on him today as  someone "who thinks outside the box". Bill actually sat in a bar four years  and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. He has been  successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. He throws out  ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. He pointed  out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally  don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for  Enron. In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within  reason. I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be  considered a high priority. I am willing to accept some of the credit risk  exposure as a cost of doing business. Bill understands his role as an  independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for  someone with finite capital. I place very high confidence in Bill not  conducting high risk trades. Having said that, we certainly need to monitor  his credit exposure and continue to require LC's. Just understand that he is  at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade  counterparty. I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread  option he traded. He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the  trading desk, knew it as well. There are a couple isolated products that  Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. This  was one product. Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing  models created by the research group. The problem with these models is that  they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental  price limitations. For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,  for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within  variable cost than the models predict. Thus it is necessary to apply a  correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. Obviously,  we have this function in our pricing models. I was not aware this  methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. This has since  been changed. Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very  few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to  Enron. I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting  credit. I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade  considering the circumstances. If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks, 	small ventures usa

summarize: Hi Folks,  Another wild week in the NFL. We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks. Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves. This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear. From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com  One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters. My reply to him:  Don't be down on yourself. That's the nature of the game. There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week. You did what just about every one of us would have done I'm guessing. It's part of the game. Is it frustrating? Sure it is. But it's still part of the game. In my local league last week, I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 - Aargh... )   Did it play out? No, it didn't. I had guys on my bench who outscored him. But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me. I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football. You just have to take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do the rest. Just like a real GM. You can only do so much. If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started him, well, that's your bad. But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did not, well, that's not your fault. I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit your job and head to Vegas. Control what you can control. Bust your butt to know all you can know. Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you can do. After that, just enjoy the games. Trust me, you'll be a better owner because of it. Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week. Have a great week, everyone. Joe  /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Upgrades   QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade in my book. More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this season. When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make. There's even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season. Right now, Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback. QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4 touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive. Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league. Keep in mind, a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch. However, with the Browns offense improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future. QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike. He's not the best fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup. With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy, Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season. With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion. 280 passing yards and 2 scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense. RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting 	[Footballguys] Update # 131  Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade 
summarize: this is an old one but a great one. If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand. A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999, and the early morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999: 6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels  7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning) 8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer) 8:53 Crack open second beer 8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea) 10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 10:35 Headed for San Antonio 10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam 11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: "Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives. I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field. 5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable." 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K", and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone. I cheer wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer. It is warm. I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them. I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own. I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon." 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage. I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a "Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can. Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less Bud Light out of a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him (no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects. However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a bit seriously." 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid fuck." 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid fuck." 11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid fuck." 11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid fuck." 11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon." 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear "Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads on the table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a shit. The tab is $112 with tip. 2:46 I'm sleepy. 9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty. 	[Fwd: a day in the life] 
summarize: Special Greeting   Subject: PRESIDENTIAL BUSH'S SPECIAL CHRISTMAS GREETING               "Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song. We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special. This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good. Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season. According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world. Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life. At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ. And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

summarize: I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in  Texas. I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming  on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation. The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important. The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e.,  natural gas, coal, etc.) Do you have this information? Thanks, 	Generation

summarize: Hello all,  Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets. The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining. The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets. If you have any questions please give me a ring. Happy Holidays, 	*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder

summarize: Dear NewCo employees: =20 I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and ne= xt steps.=20 =20 What are those opportunities? In short, to date no competitor has taken En= ron's dominant market position. In most cases, competitiors are retrenchin= g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr= otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets. Market liquidity an= d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels. = This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less=  choices to manage key long-term risks. This lack of transparancy and liqui= dity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and = capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri= can grid. We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, w= hich is unprecedented since the early nineties. This coupled with market p= articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo= rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value. However, in th= e long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive = technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy a= nd energy price volatility are highly likely. On the services side, there a= re numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand=  side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo= ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible. I also be= lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne= wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets. In = short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has = not been seen since the early nineties. =20 What is NewCo? NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener= gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun= ities detailed above. These businesses will stretch from production to mar= ket, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t= he United States and Canada. It will be a portfolio of several key business= es, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure. It will be m= ajority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensu= re liquidity and legitimacy. It will be re-branded and be operating and sol= vent by mid Q2 at the latest. It will be seeded with a number of Enron ass= ets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key cr= edit support. Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 = million to one billion. With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be=  at least a billion dollar company. It will emerge as a non-debtor company = and should be an investment grade rated company. NewCo will employ approxim= ately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under=  control. These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in=  Enron and ex-employees. NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing sys= tems and infrastructure. It will be in the market of buying and selling ene= rgy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete=  with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transac= tional relationship with Netco. =20 What will be NewCo's culture? It will have the benefits of being a small pr= ivate company which will measure success by cashflow generation. It will b= e a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other. It will be a=  group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objec= tives. It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily=  for long term value creation. We will build an organization of integrity = of which people can be proud. It will center its objectives around our cust= omers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market. NewCo will value cust= omer relationships. It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of o= pen communication. NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble. =20 What is next? There will be a meeting in 30C2 at 4:00 PM on Monday to discu= ss issues, questions and comments. There will also be a dinner set up for = 6:30PM on Tuesday at the Capital Grille to provide us an opportunity to spe= nd additional social time to discuss NewCo. NewCo will be located on the 30= th floor. The immediate tasks in hand can be broken into the following: a)=  opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans f= or opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these = assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start p= erforming to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy;=  c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma= 's for NewCo; d) working through the NewCo structure and path through bankr= uptcy to solvency, rating and operation; e) scouring Enron for other valuab= le assets not yet identified for NewCo; f) detailed market research;  g) as= set acquisition target definition; h) financing and capitalization plan inc= luding raising external investment and i) additional hiring and recruitment= . =20 On a final note, we will need to identify a new name for the company so let=  me know your ideas! I look forward to working with you towards reaching sh= ared goals and celebrating the inevitable success. =20 =20 Respectfully, Dave Delainey 	NewCo

summarize: We have designed an additional Daily Position Report which consolidates P&L, positions, maturity gap, and VAR by commodity rather than business unit. In accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business Units. This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of granting each one of you access to this report. When access is granted to all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business unit. Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns. Thank you 	DPR by commodity

summarize: RE: Media Preparedness Session, June 12, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Doubletree Hotel, Lamar Room (downtown)  Team   You may be wondering what our Media Preparedness Session on June 12 is about. Here's the logic...    We are in the enviable position of having significant media interest in the genius behind EnronOnline and our mid/back office services while, at the same time, we are trying to leverage our e-commerce reputation at Net Works. We can use this to our commercial advantage, e.g. advertising without the expense. Dealing with the media, however, can be like getting behind the wheel of a race car with no training -- you might have fun for a while but eventually crash. That's why it's important that we set aside some time to get ready for the race. 	Media Preparedness Training

summarize: Sally, Bob - just a thought about where we currently are and how we help ma= intain solid leadership for the future. As I looked around the room at your=  breakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important manage= ment roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, = work hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (col= lege, etc.) and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years. Other= s were probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's t= he quick hits that will make a difference. Maybe the mix was 50/50. Clearly=  I'm in the former category. Several people at the meeting commented about = the severe impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans a= nd how the time left to make this up is a concern. In my relatively short t= ime here (3 1/4 years) I have made the following observation. Enron has a g= reat Associate and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediate= ly to the company. In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce = that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts. No doubt this ha= s led to the great success over the years. However at the end of the day th= e business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectivel= y complements this young and very talented workforce. Helps pull things tog= ether and keep the sanity. In many cases this translates to employees in th= eir mid to later years of their work life. During the good times no problem=  as bonus $'s and other vehicles take care of things. However we are possib= ly in a situation where those are limited or reduced to some extent for som= e extended period of time. =20  Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle=  aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value=  you add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retir= ement plans. When we come out of this current situation what will the compa= ny look like? Will most of the younger crowd leave for the "quick hits" els= ewhere? How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees. How do we=  keep them here before they take another job that offers them additional se= curity? Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question = about pension I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement progra= m we have in place. It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we= 'll give you this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it. I know the cash bal= ance option is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron'= s is rather weak. Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%.=  Obviously this all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considere= d over the years and changing anything at this point is not going to happen= . In addtition this probably goes against our culture in many respects and = I'm not saying lets make this a job for life. We still need to manage our w= orkforce as we have in the past and deal with employees that do not contrib= ute regardless of age.=20  Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations. I get concerned=  when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loy= alty and ongoing leadership. I promise this isn't about me although I certa= inly have my concerns as I know you do also. =20  Thanks for listening - Bob 	Employee retention

Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services. BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all. Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes. For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906. Thank you very much for your support.

summarize: Sally,   here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems. There have been a number of changes as follows :-   Back Office The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position. Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios. Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only. EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice. EGM/EIM Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today. They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed   The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions....   regards 	Updated IT Savings 
summarize: As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger. We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful. The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning). Mark Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon. He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have. We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite". There is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day. The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend. 	5:00 PM Daily Meeting

summarize: This week each business unit across Enron has been asked to identify the optimal structure and resources on a going forward basis. While the review is not complete, we are close to finalizing decisions surrounding each individual business. We ask for your continued patience and we know that may be asking a lot. Please take the opportunity to enjoy the time with your family at Thanksgiving and know that we are working hard on finalizing all details. No significant organizational announcements will take place next week. Mike and Jeff 	Announcement for all EGM employees 
summarize: As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period. 	Program Changes 
summarize: FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find  this note interesting. Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several  schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that  lure students to join them. Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of  time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer. See note from Lexi  below. 	Jonathan Beck 
summarize: Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments. As speakers were  confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the  speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those  speakers. Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros,  drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling. We have  arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy  chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a  means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday. This  can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some. The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement  of our efforts (Causey). Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short  "state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and  EEL). Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold,  discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these. Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in  which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of  operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could  have such an impact. Each table can report back as we gather to start the  afternoon. Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move  Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and  lessons learned. Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going  project. Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool  for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group. We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its  impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted  Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group. Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles  Center Field Terrace. Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are  waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy. Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker. He plans to spend an hour plus with the group. He will make an informal  presentation and then will entertain questions. The rest of the morning will  be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action  steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information  provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office  services within Enron. Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic. Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group. After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to  reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against  our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps). Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions. The only details still  in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's  attendance. 	Draft Agenda 
summarize: We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am. I will contact  your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results. Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to  summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review. Thanks for providing your resumes. I will feel more informed during the  process. 	Associates PRC Meeting 
summarize: Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate. For a woman who can't remember the  last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy! Thanks, too, 	Thanks

summarize: Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers. However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager. The remainder are  senior specialists. Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in  detail. We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these  players away. Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our  competitor, which will require that he have good people. He will be moving  to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire. He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or  childless, their mobility factors could be high. Enron would not want to  lose any other talent to Steve's new employer. 	Retention plan for four managers 
summarize: As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of  Directors. Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement. In  conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily  report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston  time) to let me know about this requirement. Obviously, we want to meet  Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete  as possible. Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over  the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be  excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are  very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send  to the daily 8:30 meeting.) I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh  and me at 4:00 today. Realizing that the time was very late in London, we  tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in  the meeting. Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that  Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow. Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R  calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed. The  Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing  an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time. With this  timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by  approximately 10:00 am Houston time. Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R  including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power)  will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston  time (10:00 am London time). If this time frame is not met, then component  V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete. We had hoped to discuss this with  you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support  and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London  requirement for officialized books. The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on  what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread  options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine. Those V@R calculations  that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the  component V@R calculations. While there are other commodities that will  currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less  material than the UK spread options. Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of  days before this is completed. Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of  this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens. I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the  UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time. We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing. It is  probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and  systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report  earlier in the morning. Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or  not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently  meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.

summarize: I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey  on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15. I will leave the offsite  meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting  with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common  needs around risk systems. I will be in the office the afternoon of  September 15. Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I  can be reached.

summarize: I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on  Friday evening. Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group. His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved  up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe. Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which  resulted in her being removed from the transplant list. Randy has a four  year-old daughter. Several of us will be attending the funeral today. Over the past several  weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a  fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic  association. Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the  playground equipment was far exceeded. 	Employee Concern - Gas Logistics Manager 
summarize: No manager is listed below on this request and I don't know the employee. The manager blank must be completed for me to be able to address these.

summarize: On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's  cars. On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of  money for a school project. Last night, the magazine made it into my hands  around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night. What a  nice article! I smiled while reading it. How nice to see your  accomplishments recognized in print. Congratulations. I hope that you have  plenty of copies for your mom and dad. --Sally 	Fortune Article 
summarize: Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran  through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number. I think that I saw yours. Did I miss you sometime this weekend? With almost  two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down  the list in importance. I an never quite sure that I get messages that  anyone calls! Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during  my commute tonight again. Hope you had a good weekend. Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and  continuing the search for new clothes. Our friend Mo was in town from London  and had burgers with us on Saturday night. --Sally 	Did I miss you? 
summarize: To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000. His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it  would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on  July 1. Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth  transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen  would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance  review being based on his work for ENA. Stephen is very talented and will no  doubt do a great job at EBS. During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his  heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct  reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our  other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc. It was his  failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs  Improvement category relative to other directors on my team. It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that  category. 	Needs Improvements for Managers & Directors

summarize: My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is  sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the  ballroom at the Rice. Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases,  our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the  common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit  aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial  reporting, etc. In addition to managing these databases, Mary has  harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an  effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders. This tool can  help measure and increase coverage by industry segments. This project,   Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is  currently under development for delivery later this quarter. We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide  who will attend the working session next week. Please let me know if you are  interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule. Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity. 	Invitation to Speak - June 15 or 16 
summarize: Mary,  As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the  country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison  as a signer. Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume  Management groups. This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain  appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.

summarize: I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear  Julie Andrews speak. Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school  drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as  our daughters. So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High  School with Meagan. Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner. I hope that all of you enjoy the  evening. The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next  Tuesday, May 16. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot  for dinner. That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be  my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture. I can't think of a better  idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright,  motivated women! I will look forward to introducing her to those of you  whom she has not yet met. 	Lecture Series 
summarize: 1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John  Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore. This draft  now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he  made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week,  meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday. You and John should receive  those drafts today. 2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply  to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was  asking). I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am  there. 3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are  the following:  Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide  for you during this transition period Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of  the details on having support personnel in London   Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for  Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one  (which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)  Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is  appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective  trading operations and controls world-wide  I look forward to seeing you next week. 	Various Items 
summarize: Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point  and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached  memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting. This memo will be sent by  Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume  with regard to global operations. I shared this in the staff meeting so that  you would be the first to know. I will still fulfill my role within ENA as  VP of Energy Operations. I will not be going away! This expanded  responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel  and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the  organization. 	Additional Responsibility 
summarize: The attachment below recaps our meeting from this morning. Highlights from  last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well. Let  me know if anything has been left off the list. --Sally 	Recap of 4/23 Meeting on Commercialization 
summarize: Thought you might be interested in these two changes. Mary has actually been  out of the office since late February. All of her global database  responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his  team, under Beth Apollo. Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been  lessened over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied  on my business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for  their evaluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules. 	Management Team Changes 
summarize: I will serve as your representative in the year end 2000 Associates PRC  Meeting. ENA Management Committee  I represented some of you during the  mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to  represent. I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of  record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and  Associates Program. You will note that I have asked your supervisor to  provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as  well as a description of your job responsibilities. You may want to take  charge of creating this information. In addition to the input that I have  requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of  your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year). While  the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time  period at Enron, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I  have some background information on you. My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for  me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC  meeting. These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27  and December 4. I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those  two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting. Feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process. I will be  out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week, but I  will check and respond to voice mail messages. My number is x35926. 	Year-End Associate PRC Meeting 
summarize: This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples  Energy Board this week. Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive  in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others  recognize the talent that is in the operations organization). We may be able  to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal  purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external  marketing tools. --Sally 	Peoples presentation 
summarize: Tight time frame for Mike & co. on metals deliverables. Raises the question  around the timing of next week's visit on metal. Will we divert critical  resources from these efforts. --Sally 	Merchanting Metals Update #2 
summarize: Does Vanessa know anything about this? I know that we had a definite  interest several years ago in a system from Siebel. We shelved it at the  time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs. In  the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system. I know that Mary  was resurrecting this with someone on her team. She had recently reviewed it  with Brenda Herod, I believe. This is one of the items that we listed in  Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for  others. --Sally 	CRM system 
summarize: Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE. I can  view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12  attendees. There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska. I am  missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed? If I am not  missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees  (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa). A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees  looks funny. There were many more in attendance. The cost of the meal makes  more sense with a complete list of attendees. Thanks. 	<<Concur Expense Document>> - Robert M Hall 
summarize: All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great  and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules  next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program. I don't want  to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us. Karen's  letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting  these students names on our radar screen for next year. I will find out who  the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes  and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter. --Sally 	UT/Enron MBA Excellence 2001 Scholarship Winners Announced! 
summarize: FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week. No  problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access  issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their  jobs. She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston  who is bi-lingual (Gordon). Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's  responsiveness and the doorstep process in general. Just wanted to pass this  along. --Sally 	Gordon Heaney's Acceptance 
summarize: Cindy had to change lunch to March 30, which conflicts with Bob Shults. I   moved Cindy to March 30th- can you try to move my lunch with Bob to March  28th? Thanks. (FYI, CIndy's last names has only "O's" in it - Olson and  Bob's last name has only "S's" - no "Z".) 	Olson Lunch 
summarize: Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving  to Connecticut soon to join her husband. He has been working up there for  the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our  weather derivatives team about a year ago. She hopes to continue to work for  Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I  can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York  office. It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn  could be someone for you to consider. She came originally from the London  office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some  feedback on her. In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very  early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting. She came to  Houston and  has done a number of different things. I think that she is well  organized and control minded. Understands Enron's business. Managing a  group of people is probably not her strongest attribute. I am not sure that  people enjoy working under her. That could be old news, however. There are  a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her  based on very recent experience. Do you know of her? Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York. Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there. She would  definitely represent an Enron point of view. They have two small daughters -  she might be interested in something part time even. Could mean lower cost  that way. This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals. If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you  could go to for some fact finding around her. Let me know. --Sally 	Off the Wall? 
summarize: Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director. I have the dubious  honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of  the promotional memo via e:mail. I will be in the London office next week  and I believe that we have some time scheduled together. I look forward to  the chance to visit with you then. --Sally 	Congratulations 
summarize: Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend. Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too? This will be a meeting that we should  have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and  make timely decisions on how to handle those. I am sure that there is some  prep work that needs to be done for this meeting. I would assume that we  should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk  books, OA, etc. Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on  content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights. I would love for  us take charge and lead this meeting. --Sally 	Exposures Meeting 
summarize: From Enron Corp Business Controls   Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12. All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804. In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately. With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car. Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers. Therefore, Enron corporate aircraft should not be counted on to provide assistance in this situation. 	Crisis Management

summarize: Hello Everyone,   	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !! There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

summarize: We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, 	Online Trading Simulation 
summarize: In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below. Stack Manager Changes  Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window. Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website. In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page. If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out. Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window. Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website. In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page. If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature. Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box. Website Changes  New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows. The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order. In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. Price of Limit Orders   Modify Limit Orders  Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order. You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order. Expiration time for Limit Orders Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours. Float the Today's Orders Section You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option. Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear. Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount. In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group. Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users. Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week. Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords. If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

summarize: Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001. Stack Manager Changes  Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font. To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose "Inactivate Stack". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose "Activate Stack". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons. Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above. Website Change  Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product. If you have any questions please call me at 31787. Thanks. Savita 	NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY

summarize: Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years. Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart. Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology. On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk. The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods. We are looking for 50 team captains. The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers. The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers. The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk. As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets. Additional incentives are currently being developed. If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641). We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease. 	Team Captains Needed 
summarize: BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  West Power On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp. The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility. The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project. The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002. This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities. Congratulations to everyone who made it a success. Enron Freight Markets Enron Freight Markets closed its first firm sale of transportation with Penske Logistics. Penske is under contract for the operation and U.S. distribution of Whirlpool appliances. EFM will provide truckload capacity for Penske to serve Whirlpool.

News from the Global Flash  EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities. Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: "Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia." German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory  Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the "heart land" of Germany. Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul. Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company. True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels. Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.' The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  "The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located," explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner. "Other "Raider Class" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports." While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation! Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

summarize: Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year. Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year. Below is my update on a few GISB matters. We'll go into more detail at our next meeting. ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB) The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions. The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB). The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual. In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB. GISB REPRESENTATON Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001. Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board. Her term expires December 31, 2003. My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003. ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete. The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002. This is probably a firm date. The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed. GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards. The errors in the standards books are extensive. The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books. I am working to have GISB correct the standards books. Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version. Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books. I'll let you know what is decided. Thanks, 	GISB Update

summarize: Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday. My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution. I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting. I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks. You asked lots of good questions at the meeting. At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions. As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future. With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season. I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work. I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

summarize: Lynn/Karen:   The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems. We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st. And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations. One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant. Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled. They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points. And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point. But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system. That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch. Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall. But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system. And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call. Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d. If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura. But that is as far as we are planning to go. We view the flow restriction to be on your side. And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st. If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point. Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point. But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end. As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation. Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future. sc 	Aberdeen and Welcome

summarize: Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ." This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE. Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision. The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com. Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.

summarize: The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled. Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49. Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale. On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase). Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ? Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ? Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale. Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ? Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves. Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ? Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ? Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural. If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522. 	KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants

summarize: In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee. There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information. To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process. The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly. If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated. All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee. Firm						Relationship  	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.) Creditors' Committee 	U.S. Trustee 	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee 	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp    The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:  Ray Bowen - Chairman Bob Butts Jim Fallon Dave Glassford Dave Gorte Mark Muller Julia Murray Lou Stoler  Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court. It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors. Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee. 	Bankruptcy Management Committee 
summarize: Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back. Most of the time traders are focused on setting curves. Mid office has the most work, booking cancellations out of commercial book into bankruptcy book. Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book. Creditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favor a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that going to settlement might be preferred. Legal is deciding difference between "executable" contracts (able to negate deal) and "forward" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale. South America appears to have similar issues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transaction, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement. In summary, the positions being captured in value-at-risk are questionable, given slow and tedious process of cancellation/booking. However, below is the VAR COB 12/18/01.

summarize: Rick,  I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio. I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal. I have also reviewed them with Vlady . 1. VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm. This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio. 2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position. Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap. Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf. If you agree with these changes please let me know. If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723. Thanks. 	PGE Trading Limits

summarize: Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var,  p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves  before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not  necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of  business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it  would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the  efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management.

summarize: Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan. ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan. ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts. To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.

summarize: This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday. In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space. HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:  ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors. In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.

summarize: The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001. The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices. Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements. With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix. As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process. The  total  adjustment  of $581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh. Customers may validate their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the $581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load. Customers will observe a difference in the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus  adjustment  #3. This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment. Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly. In October 2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred. In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market. This results in an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances. This  billing treatment for the December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh. Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month. December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address  the  delay  in  invoicing. Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001. Payments due to market participants will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001. Please refer to the attachment below for banking instructions.

summarize: Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work. 	Jeff McMahon Named CFO

summarize: Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits  which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station. The most  critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really  restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25  ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines. We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue. Let me  know what additional information you may need. 1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations. 2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown. At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions. However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as  high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower. The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time. TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures. The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb/hr and ton/yr. These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd. Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load. 3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit. 4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas. Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas. 	Transwestern's comments to rough drafts of permit for Klagetoh and  Leupp 
summarize: Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue  groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant. As you may remember,  Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire  facility near Ft. Stockton. Groundwater montioring activities have been  ongoing since aprox. 1988. A permit condition states that if three years of  groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard  has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be  terminated. A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received  on July 14, 1999. Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious  weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).

summarize: George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some  help. Why are we collecting so much groundwater. Im concerned that charges  for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the  costs are reasonable. Are we trying to dewater or what? Other than that, I  dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should  get busy on the well installations. Do you think this will do it with  respect to no more wells needed. Id like to get to that position as quickly  as possible. 	NNG Gomez Remediation 
summarize: This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions  testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been  submitted to  t he TNRCC. The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we  also received an emissions reduction benefit. According to the agency, this  replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will  be a plus for the company. My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make  this happen. I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received.

summarize: John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile  pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting  and approvals. The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies:   California fish and game 1603 application   Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application   US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification   Reclamation Board- encroachment application   Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline   Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline  I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances  for this project. I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field  survey prior to construction. It seems that every Califonia state and county  agency is a candidate for notification or approval. Ill keep you  apprised...... 	Permitting Status, Rogas Construction Project

summarize: Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed. We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. B. If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

summarize: Michelle,  Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th. During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her: 1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three. 2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence. Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA. Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power. Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough "face time" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team. Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face. Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts. Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them. Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach. As always, thanks for your help. Anne 	Kristin Walsh- Questions for You

summarize: Michelle,  The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal. In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal. A few things:  In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer. Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees. George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc. Thanks, 	Project Fireball (personnel question) 
summarize: The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the "Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures. In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline). The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is "discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a "chain letter" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics). First Offense:  Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action. Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy. Second Offense:  Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor. HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy. Third Offense:  Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR. HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file. Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination. Fourth Offense:  System notice of shut down for continuing violation. Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor. HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct. Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the  HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action. Other Issues/Considerations: Should we carve out transmissions that are "untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit" and have a more severe discipline for those situations? Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites. Should we attempt to define all terms? Is it appropriate to use a "one size fit's all" approach. Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc. message? How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally? Please route your comments to me or be prepared to discuss at our next meeting to be held Monday, July 23rd from 10:30 am to 11:30 am in EB 3824.

summarize: Dear Amy,    My apologies that it has taken me a day or two to respond about the December 2001 checkout. I have spoken with our traders and learned that the reason EPMI deals # 585276.1 and 585277.1 are not in the system beyond December 2, 2001 is because (due to bankruptcy proceedings), Modesto Irrigation District requested termination of our contract on December 2, 2001. I understand that there was physical delivery every day of the month and I am working with our teams to get this in our system correctly. Please call me if you have any questions.

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88  and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation  from normal and percent of precipitation. So far things are looking good. We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks  like things should be beautiful for next weekend. I wouldn't be that worried  about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical  moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend. After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get  tropical  moisture. 	Weather

summarize: Attached for your review and comment is a first draft of the WPTF motion to intervene and protest the WestConnect filing. The major points made in it are as follows:  ? The Commission should convene a technical conference to deals with areas in the WestConnect filing that require further clarification, such as congestion management. Moreover, the analysis of congestion management issues must focus on the equitable allocation of transmission rights;  ? The Commission should require WestConnect to establish an independent board, with an accompanying stakeholder process that complies with commission precedent;  ? All load should be required to take service under the WestConnect tariff;   ? Interconnection issues should be deferred until completion of the Commission's generic proceeding on this topic; and  ? Since a for-profit Transco has an inherent incentive to maximize transmission revenue, there are certain RTO functions that an entity such as WestConnect should not perform. I am indebted to Karen Shea of Dynegy and Glenn Martin of Mirant for their very helpful assistance. Our draft also draws upon concepts contained in the EPSA filing that Gary Ackerman provided. The filing is due at FERC on Thursday the 15th. I therefore need any comments from you no later than early that morning. Thanks! Dan 	WPTF WestConnect Protest 
summarize: Dear Mr. Dasovich:  I am looking for a position in the Bay area as my wife will begin teaching at the Goldman School of Public Policy in January. Cecille Cabacungan from GSPP suggested that I contact you. Currently, I am with Mercer Management Consulting, a strategy consulting firm. While I enjoy my work with Mercer, the timing of transfers to our San Francisco office is uncertain. Mercer, however, has two programs through which I could move to the Bay area. The first is an externship program through which I could consult to a company for 6 - 12 months, or longer. As my attached resume reflects, I have several years of experience developing business plans and assessing market conditions. The second is a fellowship program through which I could consult to a non-profit organization for up to 12 months at a small fraction of Mercer's standard fees. I am particularly interested in organizations that work on economic development issues, but would be happy to help a range of organizations develop and implement their long-term strategic goals. Specific types of work I could perform include:  *	Assessing market size and growth opportunities, e.g., utility/profitability of new services or products *	Managing co-operative efforts with other institutions, e.g., pooling resources to increase leverage and efficiency of operations *	Benchmarking and redistributing resources to focus on highest impact areas  I would like to learn whether you think Enron could benefit from my services or know of a corporation or non-profit that could. I am arranging interviews for the first week of December, and would greatly appreciate talking to you before then to hear of any suggestions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you in advance for your assistance. Sincerely, 	Request

summarize: Dear Everyone,  I will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th. It?s a homey room and extremely artist-friendly, so far off the corporate path that the owner doesn?t advertise or even publish the address on the web. Of course, it?s not so homey that you can?t get a drink, and it?s close enough to the pulse that artists like Shawn Mullins still appear there regularly. For those of you wary of crossing the Bay Bridge, it really isn? t all that far (20-30 minutes), and this may be your last chance to catch my act this year.

We invite you all to attend and to extend invitations to two managers in  your organization who have made your studies possible through the provision  of resources, time, and their enthusiastic support. We recognize that many of you have class that evening and that your  managers have busy schedules. As such, we have developed a two-part  program for the evening that we hope will accommodate schedules and,  additionally, provide for your colleagues an evening at Haas that simulates  your own experience:        From 6:30 to 7:30 PM, two Haas faculty will give a seminar in Arthur  Andersen Auditorium on current topics; and from 7:30 to 8:30 PM, a  reception will be hosted in the Bank of America Forum. You and your  managers are invited to attend either or both halves of the evening. We do request that you RSVP for this event and specify what portion of the  evening you and your guests will be attending. We will have printed invitations for you to distribute to your  managers. We anticipate that they will be in the program office for you to  pick up during the week of September 17.

We barricaded as much of it as we could and the UCPD and the  Fire Department responded to our call. We quickly discovered that the  white powder was plain flour that had been placed in Haas and across campus  by a student Ping Pong club on a cross campus footrace.

If you find any piles in the building that were missed,  please let us know so that we can get it all cleaned up right away. 	Flour in Haas School 
summarize: Energy Committee Members:  We have been offered an opportunity to benefit from a unique federal funding program. Sure Power has been funded to implement distributed generation (DG) into a high-availability, energy-intensive application in the data communications industry (i.e. telecom hotel, financial processing center, internet data center, etc.). As you know, Sure Power is the world's leading supplier of DG-based systems providing six 9's availability (certified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Sure Power's patented technology eliminates interconnection issues with the utility, which has been one of the technical inhibitors to widespread adoption of DG. Sure Power has already aligned themselves with EPRI to assist them with measurement and analysis, but are looking for a partner who has a potential project on the horizon that could benefit from Sure Power's technology and federal funding assistance (as much as $3M). Please note, the project does not have to be past the internal approval stage to benefit. Even a potential project that is still being analyzed for viability could receive funding for an initial feasibility study. Understanding that the high-tech industry is going through trying times, and that many projects have been put on hold; Sure Power has a three-year window in which to apply the funds, so even a project that may not start for eighteen months would work. The deadline in which to finalize their project package is September 12, so Sure Power would need to have a response from a potential partner no later than COB Tuesday September 4. Feel free to contact Sure Power directly with any questions. 	DG Federal Funding Opportunity Available

summarize: As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging service for Jeff. When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that you must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams. I put the #12 on the team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all remaining numbers to come back to 1. (You did not have a 1 pick in what you sent.) I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if it wasn't the right thing. Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have been fair to change it at that point.

While we have sufficient funds to continue the pending electric study at present, we are unsure of Enron's desires.

summarize: USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says. By Gelu Sulugiuc  07/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online  energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a  simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. ,  EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with  the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks  told Reuters on Tuesday. The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready  to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers  or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper. "I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an  ownership position in any other exchange platform," Piper said. With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the  highest volume of all energy electronic platforms. Most energy trading  platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits. Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day. But while  ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline  one can only trade with Enron. "It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business," Piper said. Enron is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States. About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic  platform. "As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue  to grow," Piper said. The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals,  steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics. "We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get  more traction," Piper said. "There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't  even tapped into yet." Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success. The Atlanta-based  exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and  plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its  trade volumes. "Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different," Piper  said. "But right now, there is room for the both of us." He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE. Many of the  energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also  Enron's biggest clients. "Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one," Piper said. INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS  Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States,  Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of  ways to become more successful. "The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline," Piper  said. "But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something  different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional  about it." One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible  application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different  markets and regions. It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal. But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many  exchange. "We want to focus in providing our markets to others," he said. "In the near  term, we're not changing that." The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not  elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it. EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats  off. "I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't  work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong," said Frank Getman, chief  executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet. "If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the  market, then people will continue to use your site."

summarize: HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address State  BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN   DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BODY:  ?? ?While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects. ? ?Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.'' ? ?Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  and Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live. ? ?California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs. ? ?On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter  state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency  power. The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also  threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said. ? ?Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to  California this year. ? ?A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold  it at much higher rates. ?? ''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This  profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said. ? ?Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California. ?? ''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can  to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price. Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said. ? ?Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that  manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things companies understand is leverage.'' ? ?For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities. ? ?The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities. HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning  BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens  BODY:  ? ?LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California  gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's  energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch  spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly. ?? "I don't have any control over this," the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages. ?? "I feel your pain," Lynch replied with a smile. ? ?No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups. ? ?But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She promised to lead "a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out  of the California economy and not adding a whit of value." ? ?Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that. ? ?Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate  hike. ? ?Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said. ? ?Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a "failed experiment" and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that "true deregulation is our goal." The problem was that "the state stepped back too much" from management of the power system and that there had been "too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions," she added. ? ?A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. "We are expecting severe difficulties for this summer and next summer," said Barry Sedlik, a Southern California Edison manager. ? ?Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the electricity problems are spreading. "This may go on for a while and it's not just California," he said. "In the near term we've got chaos," he added. ? ?But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers  may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling  blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President  Bush's brother is governor. ? ?Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage, could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in an interview.

summarize: Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action  FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River  Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the  natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were  happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. "The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is  something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the  "precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned  Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although  she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC  "should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action." Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action  expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the  "extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it. Critics  claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler  Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she  noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. "...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in  the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how  our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing  electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything,  she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even  worse than it is. There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the  project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this  Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without  ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more 	FERC ruling on Kern expansion

summarize: Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the  issue......  Davis announces four new energy advisors   Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m.  Gov. Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including  members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team. Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy  campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the  governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new  director of communications. Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months. Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a  year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis'  spokesman. McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal  regulators and with generators. Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the  Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid. Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers,  Maviglio said. 	Former Gore Staffers Join Davis' Energy Team

summarize: Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted  to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered  on an IEP call today:  The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes. Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants  to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on  board. Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to  consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later  today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting. The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous  "prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts. Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting. Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an  objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do  worse, they take the hit. The utility, under this framework, has broad  flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.

summarize: As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today. Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing. As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch. In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses. At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week. Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business. Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs. We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties. This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron. I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you. Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron. All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges. Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today. We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company. As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make. Thank you. Ken 	Update 
summarize: Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43. This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines. In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance. We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units. In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units. For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities. In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services. This quarter they are reported separately. Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately. Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter. Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million. Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year. While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat. Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago. So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers. Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago. This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter. Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural. This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind. Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year. Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year. This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs. Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago. In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion. Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses. These charges include: ? A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ? $183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services. This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ? $544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement. With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

summarize: John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner. As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization. We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today. Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along. It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday. Approval from the judge is expected. I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details. Stay tuned ...  Tim 	UBS Wins 
summarize: Group,  For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power. Bill 	Emergency Power Generator Testing 
summarize: As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal. 	Organizational Announcement 
summarize: Good Morning,  Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston. Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December. This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice. Also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work. New templates will need to be created. Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will work up a series of them for January and February. Thanks, 	E-Tag 1.7 training 
summarize: During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we=  are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil= d out given the state of the company today. We appreciate people's concern= s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu= cing unnecessary expenses. Let us begin by saying that we share these conc= erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu= res without a great deal of thought. We would also encourage people to tal= k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=  certain things. In short, we have decided to continue with the college re= cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. =  We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple=  of weeks. Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting? During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p= resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=  schools in the northwest. This past year we finally reached critical mass=  and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts. Although we are unc= ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon= g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north= west. We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo= st schools. We have identified the best people from each school and have a= lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays. = The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit = that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa= rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs. We also realize that it=  is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job. It is our be= lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=  of employment may be somewhat diminished. Finally, we would like to empha= size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody. We will i= nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba= sed on the needs of the office. Before extending offers we will consider t= he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e= mployees in other offices who have been redeployed. Stated another way, we=  don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro= n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread= y here at risk. We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor= e certain about the state of affairs in the company. How Will the Floor Move Play Out? We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks. While we = still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo= r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o= n this. When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela= ying would accomplish several goals. First, it allows us to get final arch= itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo= re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward. Second, it gives th= e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move= . Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=  sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n= ow. While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje= ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=  right now. In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w= ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o= r delay again. =20  As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel= iable information becomes available. We recognize that this is a very hard=  time for everyone. Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=  up the success of this office. Tim Belden and Chris Calger 	Recruiting and Floor Buildout 
summarize: Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work. 	Jeff McMahon Named CFO

summarize: As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20. We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found regarding the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made. If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason. Some suggestions:  1. If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift. Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless. 2. Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered. 3. Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift. If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative. Thanks for your help. Kate 	Important - Please Read

summarize: FYI -  It appears the issue of how to execute inter-desk swaps is still not resolved. I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals. (Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand. This worksheet is.) One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of "place holder." An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat. If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question. If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes. 	Inter-Desk Swaps - HOW TO 
summarize: Part 3  Big 12 Roundup  Nebraska ran its home winning streak to 20 games and ended Oklahoma's string of 20 straight victories Saturday in Lincoln. Nebraska continues to lead the Northern Division with a perfect record, but Oklahoma fell into a three-way tie with Texas and Texas A&M in the Big 12 South at 4-1. The most important game this week has Texas A&M playing at Texas Tech. The Red Raiders have been hard for the Aggies to handle in Lubbock in recent years.

summarize: Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover. Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret. To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNBC	12404	804	 MSNBC	12405	805	 Bloomberg	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 CNN	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	   Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all. We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move. Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing. Updates will be provided as they become available. Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com 	Enron Center South Technology Watch

summarize: By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you  with information about your role as a timekeeper. This role is very  important at Enron. By using a single time entry system, we will be able to  gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their  associated costs. Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs  real-time. If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and  project costing are negatively impacted. We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at  3:00 p.m., CST. It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing,  our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th. Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry  periods. Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE)  at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing. We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a  success. Sincerely, 	SAP Implementation 
summarize: Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.

It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian  in Las Vegas. This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard  and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage  everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period. In particular, we  would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning. ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare. Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly. Regards 	2000 ENA Offsite

summarize: Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and  Doyle 7B burners. This could possibly have two benefits:  a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues  they are having with GE and  b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission  correlating into increased operating hours. I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:  a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on  the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and  b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions  on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal? I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your  earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you. Regards 	Power Systems

summarize: Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

summarize: Can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated? I am getting mixed information. I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries). The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume. Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day. In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume. For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day. James Armstrong is using the actual volume. The deal for the fee is 514353. My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport. Should the transport volume be in the calculation? Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume. Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom? If you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee, I would like to have a copy. You can fax it to 713-571-3141. If none of this makes sense, give me a call and I can try and explain further. Thanks, 	Tenaska IV Agency Fee

summarize: Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan. ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan. ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts. To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.

summarize: John,  I met with Sasha today for approx. 3 hours. We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS. Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):   - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone). Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book     to FPL (North Zone). Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North. - Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation. The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book. This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process. (Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that    it is a purchase from Frontera. Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.) - Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)   - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)     So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal. - Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date. One less step that we need to worry about. I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading "time is of the essence" and that we don't have much time to input data. Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly. I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes. I hope this helps. Joe Capasso 	Eterra 
summarize: I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on  the $200k we think they owe us. Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday  with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this. If  I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and  delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS'  fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December . That  argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of  warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right? At  minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to  get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied. But we heard nothing. Is  that our story? If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking  to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done. 	ECS Gallup: CDEC charges

summarize: Are we still considering adding ETS-owned generation at one or more of the TW  compressor stations in Arizona or NM? In case that is still a possibility,  let me pass on something we may want to follow up on. I called an old law  partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business  this week to have lunch and catch up. This guy says he has come up with a  good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap. He's got an  80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development  in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in  service on July 1. Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen. Here's his racket:  1. He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained. His  Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from  Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in  typical electric utility gold plated style). He didn't say, but I suspect  there is no warranty on the units. Obviously, this isn't a bold new  strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used  equipment. 2. His siting/permitting strategy is to use "brownfield" sites--i.e., 	TW Generation

summarize: As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their  intent to close the merger. Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing  date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later. Also,   until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come  undone. If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust  between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in. Has Courtney got this covered? I suspect he's been thrashing around so much  on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen. I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a  favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and  the merger closing. (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was  about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we  ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for  us if the merger goes south for some reason. I drafted a letter  awhile back  that could be updated for this purpose. Susan, assuming Steve and company  agree, could you follow up on this (I'm having Martha email it to you). The  contract requires us to notify ECS by March 1. Thanks. DF 	Gallup

summarize: Please take a look at Vig's effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on TW  using the same method that Steve Kirk used on Northern. You'll recall that  Steve's chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the  calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate  customer imbalances, by month. Proving once again that TW is just a little  different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW. I agree with Vig's  conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing. I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a  correlation. Steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities  that occur early and late in a month. Please tell me if you agree, marketing  folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb  opportunites. In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell  the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate  arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index  will be at the end of the month. In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on  the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the  monthly index will be, is basically free money. Using that logic, I ignored  any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month. I eyeballed  the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $.70-.90 arb  opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than  using Steve's mathematical approach. I still didn't see the kind of  correlation I'd expect. The correlation is directionally positive in only 4  out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in  the months that correlate on direction. I give up, and am removing the arb  argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft. I'll route that  separately. Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis.

summarize: As you requested, following are the facts for the media regarding the  negotiated rate deals that TW has recently done at rates in excess of the  tariff max rate. Please note that the first two transactions are already  public and the following information can be disclosed now. The third deal  has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is. That filing will  be made before Dec. 1, 2000. General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's  maximum tariff rate. Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated  rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997. (Order issued April 11, 1997,  Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par. 61,021). Pursuant to that authority,  TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed  at Docket No. RP97-288. Details on the specific transactions are as follows:    Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading  Rate Schedule:  ITS-1  Volume:    30,000/day  Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges  Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000  Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool  Delivery point:  SoCal Topock  Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000  and rate is $.75/MMBtu    Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading  Rate Schedule:  LFT  Volume:  10,000/day  Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges  Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000  Receipt point:  Bloomfield  Delivery point:  PG&E Topock  All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these  transactions.

With rare exceptions, those  receipt points are not at the Cal. border. Order 636 mandates that pipelines  unbundle transportation from storage. It also requires that pipelines that  make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline. That  latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should  resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell  it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product. My concern this morning was  that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that  gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement  (because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the  transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest  upstream point" requirement or both. Susan and my recollection was that when  ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than  Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where  they wanted it. I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling  that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around  whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

summarize: Attached is a draft of an "operational control agreement" designed to address  the concerns stated in FERC's order approving the Gallup project. We may or  may not actually file it as part of the required compliance filing, but will  describe it in detail in the "report" FERC ordered us to file. The  substantive terms track the language that is already in the O&M Agreement. Please give me or Susan a call with any questions or comments you may have. We expect to file this by I believe the 12th of Feb.  or so. Thanks. DF 	Gallup

summarize: Portland Employees-  At this time Enron Portland has 5 parking spots allocated based on floor space and number of employees. As UBS employees leave we do not automatically have the ability to take over their spots. However, in renegotiating our lease with PGE we will address the possibility of taking over more that the 5 allocated spots. We will keep you updated as to the progress of this. For now, Khymberly Booth is checking into the availability of 1 or more of our spots and will offer any available spots to Portland employees based on Portland office seniority. We will contact you individually if a spot becomes available. If you have any questions please contact Kathy Sheppard or Khymberly Booth. Thanks- 	WTC Parking

summarize: Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th. Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included. Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on. I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties. Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed. Thanks, 	Citizens Griffith cut procedures

summarize: Dawn, 	In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for ETS HQ. It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one column. We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies. For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail. Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees. Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet. Thank you for your assistance. Should you have any questions please call. Mary 	Corp. Costs for 2002 
summarize: Per your request we have checked the MMF calculation data for NNG/TW/FGT/Trailblazer to Hyperion and/or SAP as appropriate. Data checks out. However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation. It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year. A ballpark estimate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair value companies were excluded as they were last year. That would mean a factor of 19.0% rather than 19.1%. Please call me when you want to discuss IMP. I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for so trying to answer by e-mail probably wouldn't be very productive. 	MMF Factors 
summarize: EPPI Claim for 2000-2001  Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%. NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001. The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment. Prior Claim (1997-1999)  On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000. During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made. 	Oneok Claim on EPPI

summarize: I would like to get the following information from you. I think we probably will need to get the information for all the Appalachian producers. I also realize that it may take some time for you to get the EES information together. Over 70% of the Dominion volumes are for ENA. 1. Pre petition amounts due by production month for EES and ENA by pipeline. 2. Detail all deals that have pricing other than index for the total volume. If a deal has tiered pricing, then I need to know how much gas flowed for that deal. Ex:  Triad where the first 5,000 is at $4.48 and anything over that is at index. I would need to know the total volume by month on this deal. 3. Pre petition and post petition transportation expenses. Rita has put this information together for ENA. I will start it for EES and then get you or Kathryn to help me. It      may already be completed. 	Dominion Producers

summarize: Hey guys! It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday. Just thought you might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the English language. Hopefully they'll give you chuckle. There are differences between British English and American English that I've noticed so far:  Pants are "trousers." Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, "Black Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in "trousers" not pants with a smirk. "Pants" are what they call underwear here. Also, I almost fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said "PANTS!" and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed. Apparentely, it's the equivalent of saying "CRAP!" I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some orange juice. On the outside of some of the containers it said "with extra bits" and some said "no bits." I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained that it was "with pulp" or "without pulp." When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are "chips" on the menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called "crisps." If you want to get a baked potato it's called a "jacket potato." And if you want mashed potatoes, just say "mash." One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) here is "bangers and mash" which translates to sausages links and mashed potatoes. Here are a few more of the oddities:  You don't stand in line here, you "stand in queue." Trash cans are "bins." It's amusing to hear someone say, "I don't want it- just bin it." Country boy or redneck types are called "wide boys" or "barrow boys." When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced "zed" and H is pronounced "haitch." Cross walks are "zebra crossings"  since they are signified by white stripes on the road. (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra) Panty hose are called "tights" regardless of their thickness. Good  is pronounced "goote." Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them. Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today. I hope you are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates. Cheers! ( "Thanks") 	I thought we spoke the same language?! 
summarize: Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have  these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they  send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.

summarize: New Virus Taking Offices By Storm   This virus warning is genuine. There is a new virus going around, called "work." If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT. This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly. If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap... I'm off to the bar." Your brain should automatically forget the "work". If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can. Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever. 	fwd

summarize: Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas. Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30. We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy. While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses. The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy. It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts. We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas. Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services. Ken    Dear ETS Colleague:  On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy. In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas. Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved. The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court. For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business. Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas. Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS. Keep up the good work! Stan 	Northern Natural Gas 
summarize: As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal. 	Organizational Announcement 
summarize: Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings. I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again. The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations. Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc. The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links? We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final. We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS. Thanks 	updates 
summarize: Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department. Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group. And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential. Thank you. 	Solicitation Calls

summarize: Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in  sitara? I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San  Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in  April). The Baja transport is through March 2002. 80000/d to Citygate and  20,000 to KRS off-system. This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve. Let's get together and discuss tomorrow. Thanks, 	Socal transport and Baja transport 
summarize: Please review the transport for next month and make certain that it is set up  correctly for market prices. Perm to Socal based on current spreads, SJ to  Waha on EPNG, SJ to Waha on TW, etc. The SJ to Waha spread is .20 for next  month, does the transport work at these spreads? Please make the changes before prebid. Also, please put in a good burn estimate for Citizens next month. Please  prepare to supply our socal pool with non-topock gas 100% next month.

summarize: I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need  to discuss this in more detail. I would like to continue to use the physical  for large prompt positions going forward. I am afraid that the baseload  volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books. We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk. i.e. Intra  regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then  booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty. Janie managing SJ and  laying off risk on Steve's Opal. I know that the cash books would be a good  idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the  cash risk for baseload as well. What are your thoughts? I would also like to discuss the staffing issues. Matt Smith and Susan Scott  to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc. It seems like Ken S. has shown more  interest in the west fundies lately. Should we keep his services? The basis products need another book. Who can we add to the mix? I think  that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.

summarize: ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 29, 2001  CREDIT DERIVATIVES 	*	Pricing Synthetic CDO's - Derivatives Week  REGULATORY 	*	CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000 - Risk News  TRADING PRACTICE 	*	Banks tout economic derivatives - IFR  Pricing Synthetic CDO's Derivatives Week - October 29, 2001  Traditionally collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) involve a transfer of collateral assets. The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows (principal and interest) of the collateral assets. But CDOs are increasingly issued in synthetic form, where there is no physical transfer of collateral. In these structures the CDO references default losses, rather than the cash flows of the referenced collateral. Credit Default Swaps   In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit default swaps. A credit default swap is a contract where one party ,the protection buyer, makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a credit event. In a single name credit default swap, the credit event is the default of a single issuer. Thus, the price of the credit default swaps reflects the market's view of the default likelihood of the reference name. In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap. In this case, in return for a premium, the protection seller makes contingent payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of assets. The protection may be for first loss or equity, in which case the seller pays for the initial default losses, up to some threshold; second loss or mezzanine, where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss threshold up to some higher limit; or senior, where the seller pays all losses beyond a threshold. Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form. The simplest form of this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default swap. The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap. As losses occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay the required contingent payments. At the maturity of the structure the investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position. In both funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily a matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves. Correlation Products   It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because their value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual name in the reference portfolio, but also on the correlation between those names. Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two names, each with a 5% probability of default. Assume two levels of protection, one paying on the first default, and one paying on the second. If the names are independent, then the probability that the first loss protection is triggered is 1 - (0.95)2 = 9.75%, that is, 100% less the chance that there are zero defaults. The probability that the second loss protection is triggered is (0.05)2 = 0.25%, that is, only if there are two defaults. On the other hand, if the defaults are perfectly correlated, then there are only two possibilities: either both or neither of the names default. Thus, the probability that either protection is triggered is the probability that both names default, or 5%. Note that for the first loss protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the protection is invoked, and therefore reduced the fair price of this protection. For the second loss piece, the increased correlation has increased the trigger likelihood and fair price. The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps. For the first loss piece, since losses are capped, the pricing is driven primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur, which increases with correlation. For the senior piece, the pricing is driven by the likelihood that an extreme loss occurs, which is greater in cases of higher correlation. Pricing   Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool. Since individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name credit-default swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic CDOs. Consider an example structure with USD36 million of collateral, where first loss protects against the first USD5 million of losses, second loss protects against the next USD10 million of losses, and the remaining losses are protected by the senior tranche. We can model spreads on each of these tranches at different correlation levels. For example, using a correlation of 45%, we obtain model spreads of two basis points, 250bps and 1,642bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively. We can repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation. Figure 1 shows the normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation levels. We can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche increases with increasing correlation, that is the cost increases as senior debt gets riskier, while the first loss protection cost decreases with increasing correlation, that is the cost decreases as equity gets less risky. Note that, in this particular example the cost of second loss protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation. Implied Correlation   We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices in the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the Black-Scholes pricing model. An implied correlation extracted in this fashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model, but the observations above hold generally. Suppose the market spreads for our example structure are 2bps, 150bps and 2,000bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively. We can compare these observed spreads with our model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche. For example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior tranche, 2bps, when we price it using a 45% correlation. In other words, the implied correlation for the senior tranche is 45%. The implied correlation for each tranche can be inferred from Figure 1 as the correlation level with which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread. We can see that for the first and second loss tranches, the implied correlation is roughly 20%, while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is 45%. A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis. As we observe changes in the spreads for the individual names in the pool, we can reprice the tranches above by assuming the correlation level is constant, but updating the spreads. Additionally, implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis. For example, senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as correlation increases. Since both tranches depend on the same basket of names, we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation. As mentioned above, the implied correlation of the senior tranche (45%) is significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche (20%). This means that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection. We can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the pools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics, in terms of credit quality, industry, and geographical distribution. For example, if two CDOs have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable implied correlations for their senior tranches. All else being equal, a discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a discrepancy in price between the two structures. CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000 Risk News - October 29, 2001 By Naomi Humphries  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has released the final rules relating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States. These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act of 2000 (CFMA) that lift the 19-year ban on the trading of single-stock and narrow-based stock index futures in the US. The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regarding the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security futures products. The rules also establish requirements related to the self-certification of rules and rule amendments, reporting of data, speculative position limits, and special provisions regarding the contract design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures products. The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG). The CFTC adopted several revisions consistent with comments, but stated: "Generally, the commentators supported the proposed rules." The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on October 19, following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Key rules governing intermediaries, including futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, have been revised to provide greater flexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline and eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act. They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to registered derivatives transaction execution facilities, by permitting them to trade through a commodity trading adviser with $25 million or more in assets under management, and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices. The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat, a registered futures commission merchant, and securities broker-dealer, Exchange Analytics, an ethics training provider, the CBOT, the National Futures Association and the Managed Funds Association, all generally supported the adoption of the proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries. It added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training. Acting chairman at the CFTC, James Newsome, said: "These rules are just the first step in the Commission's review of appropriate regulatory relief for intermediaries. We have begun the intermediary study that Congress directed us to perform, and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms prior to the study's conclusion." Banks tout economic derivatives IFR - October 29, 2001  Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver the new derivatives products, which they say will be self-clearing and self-hedging. The solution licensed to the two banks to create derivatives on economic statistics will also be applicable to corporate earnings and revenues, mortgage prepayments, equity prices, central bank target rates, index-related products, electric power, weather degree days, credit or any event-driven market where the development of risk management tools has been constrained by illiquidity, according to the developer of the solution, New York-based Longitude. "Once the mechanisms are up and running and validated, we could envision structured notes on swaps linked to the auction process itself," said JP Morgan Chase's Chris Harvey, managing director of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives sales for the Americas. Deutsche Bank has picked Germany's lfo and Japan's Tankan as the debut products for its economic derivatives franchises in Europe and Japan. JP Morgan Chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural US economic statistics product. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise on the economic derivatives. To retain their exclusive agreements with Longitude for the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA)-enabled derivatives, the banks must meet performance benchmarks. Longitude charges a fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system. Using Longitude's PDCA bookrunner product, Deutsche Bank, for example, would engage in pre-marketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a bond or equity syndicate offering, followed by a short auction period. During the auction period, the bank would submit orders to buy or sell digital options on the economic data covered to Longitude's web-based system. Upon receipt of the orders, Longitude's system produces bid/offer prices for the derivatives being offered, and other relevant market equilibrium statistics, such as limit order books. Longitude routes this information back to the bank, which publishes the statistics for its customers. In this example, Deutsche Bank would be counterparty to transactions that are filled. An order that is filled would result in an International Swaps and Derivatives Association-documented transaction. The filled orders should hedge themselves because in a pari-mutuel system all claims that end in-the-money are funded by those out-of-the-money. "Longitude's clients can offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance sheets," said Andrew Lawrence, chief executive of Longitude. As the systern accepts orders with limit prices, capital markets participants can have a high level of price certainty. In a pari-mutuel system, prices are market-driven and determined by customer participation, rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of risk. Doubfers "A pari-mutuel model is a demand and supply based market, so the question becomes: Will there be enough participants?" said Richard Sandor, chief executive of Environmental Financial Products and one of the architects of the interest rate futures markets. "Is it view taking or [traditional] hedging? I'm not sure," said one bulge bracket firm's head of market risk management. Numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend upon the design of the specific auction, said Longitude's Lawrence. "Perhaps as few as 10-15 total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium," he said. The cost of operating the call auction is another consideration. A high transaction charge will mean less money for the winners. "It varies from market to market. But because banks are not taking market risk, the price for the service will be modest," said Lawrence. "In general, it has always been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined." "Let's assume a health maintenance organisation (HMO) wishes to hedge out its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the US, and that the health industry accounts for slightly less than 20% of US gross domestic product. What can this HMO do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk? Not much. But JP Morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this HMO," he said. Both JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are expecting early interest from financial institutions, and fixed-income participants in particular, because no mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a country's economy currently exists. Deutsche Bank's strategy for introducing the new products will initially hinge on drumming up internal interest, said Kevin Rodgers, global head of currency options at Deutsche Bank in London. In January, the bank's trading desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions. This activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability distributions, he added. Deutsche Bank will then try to get other banks' proprietary and swap desks to use the system. The new products will probably be available for use by hedge funds, commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third quarter of next year. JP Morgan Chase expects to start its franchise market on US economic statistic derivatives next month. **End of ISDA Press Report for October 29, 2001**  THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

The requirements focus on what are known as bank call reports, which banks file with the federal bank regulatory agencies each quarter; these are used to monitor the condition and risk profile of reporting banks and the industry as a whole. In a joint notice, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said tile new Items proposed to be added to call reports should result in a "minimal additional reporting burden" for affected banks. WORLD NEWS: Brazil's weakness set 'for some time' Financial Times; Oct 19, 2001 By Raymond Colitt in Sao Paulo   Brazil's financial markets have recovered this week, halting at least temporarily the downward spiral of the Real. But few analysts support the government's hopes of asustained currency recovery that would allow interest rates to come down and economic growth to resume. With a tighter monetary policy and somewhat brighter short-term prospects after elections in neighbouring Argentina, the Brazilian portion of the JP Morgan's EMBI+, emerging markets bond index, has narrowed by 133 basis points since October 8. By mid-week, the Real had recovered to RDollars 2.70, up 4.5 per cent against the dollar from its post-attack low. Future interest rates also came down by more than 60 basis points this week. The Real had depreciated 30 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year, raising concerns about the country's inflation target and credit outlook. However, the currency weakness "is here to stay", says Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist with JP Morgan Chase, the investment bank, in Sao Paulo. "The fundamental problems of the Brazilian economy have not changed and the market outlook remains uncertain." Indeed, a consensus forecast published by the central bank sees the currency at RDollars 2.80 against the dollar at the end of this year and at RDollars 2.86 by the end of next year. A sustained currency weakness implies higher inflation and a larger nominal budget deficit, and subsequently slower economic growth, says Mr Carvalho. JP Morgan Chase foresees GDP growth next year of only 1 per cent, compared to the market consensus of 2.25 per cent next year. Brazil's principal problem is its dependence on international capital markets and direct foreign investment to finance a current account deficit estimated at USDollars 25bn this year, the largest of any emerging market. Total external financing requirements are estimated at just under USDollars 50bn next year, a tall order at a time of a global downturn and heightened risk aversion towards emerging markets. Earlier this month, the economic authorities issued more dollar-linked debt, increased obligatory bank deposits and reformed corporate reporting rules designed to reduce the need for currency hedging. The economic slowdown these measures helped to trigger will help improve the country's trade balance by driving down imports. As a result, the market expects the current account deficit to fall from Dollars 25bn this year to Dollars 21.7bn next year. The domestic slowdown has also helped to dampen inflationary pressure caused by the currency depreciation. On Wednesday, the central bank decided to maintain its prime interest rate at 19 per cent with a neutral bias. Yet more action to tighten monetary policy - such as a further increase of bank deposit requirements - may be necessary given the ongoing threat of an Argentine default, an escalation of the US-led war on terrorism and political noise ahead of Brazil's presidential elections next year. Bank of New York demands back-up links from customers By Joshua Chaffin in New York  The Bank of New York will require some customers to have back-up communications links to its securities processing operations, and will more closely inspect its vendors' technology and communications capabilities to ensure they function in the event of disaster. Thomas Renyi, chief executive, announced the changes on Thursday when discussing the bank's third quarter earnings, which suffered more than expected from the September 11 attacks. BoNY, which specialises in securities processing, was one of the Wall Street firms hardest hit by the attacks. More than a month later, it is still struggling to reconcile trades that clients executed after September 11. As a result, its disaster recovery plans have been among the most scrutinised by the financial services industry as it tries to prepare for future disasters. BoNY executives had contended that much of the disruption was due to damaged telecommunications lines. Mr Renyi reiterated Wall Street's new-found appreciation of "how important telecommunications are to the smooth operation of the capital markets". But he also pointed to problems with computer and communications systems at BoNY's vendors that may have hindered the bank's recovery. "Some of the things just didn't work as billed by our vendors," he said. Mr Renyi also said that he and other Wall Street executives would re-evaluate the practice of out-sourcing large volumes of business to a small number of companies. His comments are notable because BoNY has aggressively promoted itself to customers as a single provider for all back-office needs, from trade processing to accounting. Overall, losses from the disaster cut BoNY's third-quarter earnings by one-third from last year's levels to $243m, or 33 cents a share. BoNY pointed out that excluding the disaster, earnings rose 6 per cent from last year. BoNY recorded a $140m charge related to the disaster. This covers a variety of expenses, from renting office space in mid-town Manhattan to buying computers. BoNY estimated it lost about $29m in fees from the closure of the markets and problems with its automatic teller machines, and paid about $45m to compensate customers for trades that failed or were slow. However, it expected that a "substantial amount" would be covered by insurance. DTCC seeks to address post Sept 11op-risk concerns  By Gallagher Polyn  18 October - The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world's largest clearing company, has seized the initiative to address the issue of systemic operational risk concerns raised in the aftermath of the US terrorist attacks of September 11. DTCC chairman and chief executive Jill Considine held the first in a series of discussions with representatives of the Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, yesterday, to address operational risks exposed by the attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech to the Bond Market Association in New York prior to the meeting, Considine said the major systemic risk posed by the September 11 attack stemmed from over-centralisation of physical assets - people and facilities - related to financial markets in New York. Bond market settlement banks, the New York telephone carrier Verizon's network in lower Manhattan, and numerous market makers on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq were briefly incapacitated by the attack. US fixed-income markets did not resume trading until September 14, while trading on NYSE and Nasdaq did not resume until September 17. The Bank of New York, a large custodian and securities settlement bank, had major problems paying out funds due to failed communications lines, with some market sources indicating that Bank of New York's payments backlog reached $130 billion on Thursday September 13, leaving a number of large European institutions with large overdrafts with other banks. After a 'breather' from weeks of intensive recovery efforts by US regulatory authorities subsequent to the attack, Considine said the DTCC would look to take a leadership role in helping the US financial industry adopt new best practices to manage the newly exposed risks. Comments made by Considine during her speech suggested the DTCC would hold discussions with regulators, broker-dealers, electronic trading network service providers, clearing houses, and even public utilities like phone companies. Asked whether new awareness of the risks stemming from spatial concentration would result in calls to disperse financial market operations over wider areas, Considine said, "I think people are looking at that very seriously." But it was unclear whether Considine was referring to regulatory authorities. Neither the SEC nor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have yet issued any new regulations related to the attacks, though impact assessment is ongoing, spokespersons for the two organisations said. The DTCC is the world's largest post-trade infrastructure organisation, providing clearance, settlement and custody services for equities, corporate and municipal debt, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, ADRs, money market instruments, unit investment trusts and insurance products. **End of ISDA Press Report for October 19, 2001** 	  	THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

summarize: In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:  1. Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and  indirectly MSEB without any credit support? The only security is the equity  in DPC? Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep  pockets? How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders? 2. Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local  courts with respect to the LNG contracts? Fraud? Bribery? Are there any  local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the  contracts? Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support? 3. What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts? Only where  the PPA is terminated? Payments? 4.    Who negotiated the contracts? Were there requests for credit support? From Enron? Did Enron ever promise to indirectly "backstop" the contracts by  its investment in Dabhol? 5. What was the discussion regarding the "reduction in operational  capability" language in the contracts? What was the language meant to  cover? Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets? 6. Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts? Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the  entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases? 	LNG Contract Questions

summarize: Per your request,  Attached is the slide we reviewed with Danny today. It shows the value of contract terminations for NNG for the contract year of 1101/03 to 11/01/04 to be $145 million. It also shows that the estimated market value is $95 million. I think for planning purposes however, we would assume that we would contract for the full value of $145 million either through better pricing analytics, new business development projects and/ or Rate Case reallocation to captive customers. The biggest risk would be the South end TFF of $12 million which we would have a hard time replacing at a $3 million level. So, depending on your assumptions, 2003 and 2004 could be flat to 2002 margin of $439.1 million -   or, if you take into account  the TFF deterioration, it could be below by $8 to 10 million. However, this deterioration will be offset by some of the new power plant projects  - in particular "Pleasant Hill"  which will bring an incremental $6 million in 2004. I think you also have to assume that other business development projects will come in to help offset the downsides. Sorry if I rambled a bit too much. My view is that NNG will have margin targets for planning purposes flat with 2002. Call me if you wish to discuss. 	NNG Revenues/Margins for 2003 and 2004

summarize: As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

summarize: DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry. Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d. Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location. Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR. DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier. A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests. The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC. DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4. DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport. Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink. DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01. DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents). DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers. The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days. This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect. 	Notes from DTI Customer Meeting

summarize: So what's happening today? Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim? That's all so much fun. I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting, he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!! Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would work to improve that one little imperfection. And of course I need no improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha haaaa). Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in our eyes. I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad about that! He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like 5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night. We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english. I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the thermals can go too. I hope Julie has been having better weather in Prague...but I think not. Have ya'll heard from her? I thought she might call us since she's on the continent...  Did you tell her about talking to your parents? She told me that she told you her secret. Were you surprised? I actually guess who it was, but I was surprised! Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find out? Well, write me!!!! Connie 	WG: MORNING!

summarize: Guys,  Rebecca Grace received a call from Axia and they are NOT agreeing that they sold us 4 Mwhs for HE5 on May 4. The MDEA 0504.xls model (maintained at the time by GENCO) indicates that we made a 4 Mwh purchase from Axia for MDEA. Rebecca has checked OATI for any/all tags for this day and has accounted for everything but that transaction. I was hoping we could find out who was working that morning and perhaps they could check their records / log book to see if the transaction occured and verify it was, in fact, AXIA. Please let me know and copy Rebecca Grace what we can do to resolve this issue. Regards, 	MDEA May 4 HE5 4 Mwhs

summarize: It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall. I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease. Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year. JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research. Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help. Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place! We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal. The theme for the walk this year is "Mission: Possible" and we would like to have you join us for this great event. The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below. If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week. In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer. Thank you very much for your support.

summarize: Ruth,  Welcome to the Fort Pierce Repowering Project, aka "FPRP", (now that John has become a traitor err trader). The following list contains the latest and greatest natural gas needs for this project (if anyone copied notices any discrepancies with my information, I need to know yesterday <- that soon):  Pressure Requirements:  per the Mitsubishi 501F technical specs, required pressure at the inlet is 530psi, however, this does not include losses. Therefore, the required pressure off of FGT's mainline needs to be 560psi. Hourly Gas Requirements:  even though we have reviewed various turbine configurations, the amount of hourly gas needed for this project has managed to hover around 2,100mmbtu/hr using 16 hour/day run cycles. Looping vs Lateral:  we are willing to defer to FGT's recommendation provided that a single meter configuration be used as opposed to a dual configuration. Timing:  plans are for the plant to be running in a simple-cycle configuration by June '02 and a combined-cycle configuration by Sep '02. Therefore, we will need pipeline construction completed by Apr '02 for start-up and testing. Phase VI Strategy:  the plan has been to either get this construction rolled into the Phase VI expansion (it would be the first piece of Phase VI initiated in order to meet our time deadline) or to have the construction covered by FGT's blanket for normal construction. FGT Deadline:  It is my understanding that FGT needs to finalize the Phase VI plans by April 30, 2001. That is everything that comes to mind at this time. If you or anyone has any comments, changes, questions or interesting anecdotes, let me know. Thanks, 	Fort Pierce Pipeline Requirements

summarize: With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:  Week of Jan 28:  We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications.

Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following:      Week of Feb. 4:  We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

summarize: Per our conversations with Tony Walden at VNG, Tony has been instructed not to release any funds to Enron per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL. AGL is the parent of VNG. I will be out of the office on Wednesday, but if you need any more information from Settlements, please contact Margaret Dhont, at 713-853-7683.

Around 11:30 - Bryce Baxter contacted Beth White to find out what the issues were that would prevent payment. Left message. Tuesday p.m. Around 3:00 - Bryce Baxter called Beth White again and spoke with her secretary. Her secretary said she would send Beth a text page and would call back as soon as possible, but haven't received return call yet. Around 4:30 - Bryce Baxter called Beth again and left another message.

summarize: John, Just a reminder that Tiger is still looking to baseload a piece of gas delivered to WGL, on a firm basis, for the remainder of November. We are prepared to pay a premium above where Transco NNY prices are trading right now (as of 11:15 a.m. on Nov. 5). We would be looking to do a volume of between 3,000-5,000/day. If we do finalize a deal, we will either post an LC with you, or prepay the entire amount by wire. Thanks for you help, 	WGL Baseload for November 
summarize: This has been a tough couple of weeks. I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company. Here's a rundown of events from last week:  	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas. -	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us. Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2. Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB. Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-. All agency ratings are investment grade. Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:  	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday. Transaction counts remain higher than average. EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas. EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi. EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities. Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question. We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole. We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company. And that's where you come in. Look around you. Look at the excellence that you and your team represents. That's the reason we hired you - you're the best. Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other. Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other. 	Enron Update

summarize: The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth. Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others. This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001. (Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.) Feedback and Evaluation Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year. The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations. The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year. No overall performance rating will be designated. ? PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7 ? Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14 ? Written evaluations due to HR			January 15  Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials. Compensation Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary. Division Head approval is required. As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance. Relative Talent Reviews Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above. The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron. Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent. Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed. Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director. EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group. Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions. If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative. Gary 	ETS Year-end Performance Evaluation Process

My name was  included on the list of attorneys and paralegals with whom AEP could talk to  regarding possible employment for continuation of legal representation for  HPL's business lines. I met with Gary Prescott yesterday and do not know  whether AEP will or will not make an offer. However, in the event they elect  to make an offer, I would like to know what my options are relating to (1) my  vested Enron stock options, (2) any unvested options, (3) the Enron Savings  Plan. Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in  the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll  those amounts into a rollover IRA? What actions would I need to take  regarding the amounts that are in the Deferred Compensation Plan? Enron is currently subsidizing a portion of the costs of internet services  through Time Warner Roadrunner. Will these costs continue to be subsidized,  and if so, by whom?

summarize: The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:  Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered  into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production  Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.;  John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as  Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of  William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust;  Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred  Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et  ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris  Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm. First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas  Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation  in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in  Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year. The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage  covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres. I do  not have copies of these 2 amendments. At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production  Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to  Houston Pipe Line Company. The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas  Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged  into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL  Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.

summarize: As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to "business as usual." As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public. We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled. In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. 	Travel Security Update

summarize: Good afternoon, I work with Cheryl Johnson in Global Counterparty doing name changes, acquisitions, and mergers and have run into a minor setback with one of the counterparties:  I received a lead from one of my co-workers that a merger and concurrent name change had occurred involving the above referenced entities. To follow up on the lead I spoke to Howard Boigon at 303-575-0143, he is the lawyer handling the transaction, and I requested documentation in the form of copies of Secretary of State documents relevant to the changes. Mr. Boigon informed me that he had forwarded a DPL Notice to you with a "complete package" detailing the transaction. He refuses to send anything further until I get with you and find out if what he sent is sufficient; if it is not he has requested that someone from legal call him and explain what we need and why. Could you please follow up with me on this issue...don't you just love Mondays?! Ruby Kyser Ext 5-8136 	Belco Oil & Gas Corp Merger w/ Westport Resources Corp.

summarize: Tana,  Per my voice mail, I received a call from Gregg Thompson with Coast energy Canada, and US. He has several questions regarding the base contract that they have with Enron, and EnronOnline. For example, if their users logged into EOL under Coast Canada, and transacted on an US product, what underlying agreement would be governed? From my conversation with Gregg, I believe that they are trying to figure out  what contract applies to what entity, when transacted on EOL. If you could give them a call they would really appreciate it. Thanks for your time. 	Coast Energy Canada, and Coast Energy Group contract question?

summarize: Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation ("AHC") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc. The following has occurred:  a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;  b. Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;  c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC;  d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC ("HESCO") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01 (originals sent out 11/5/01);  e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC ("HETCO") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;  f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule;   g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01;   h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO. Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement. Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;  i. On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala. Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft; 	Amerada Hess and Carolina Power & Light Update

The directions to my house are as follows:  1. Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church 2. First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet. 3. Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile. On the right you will see a gray  apartment complex called "Maryland Manor". The street right there is  "Ashby", make a right on Ashby. 4. The first left is Wroxton Court. I am in the upstairs of the duplex at  1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the  back yard. My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.

summarize: Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow. I'm  looking forward to the cooler weather. I got some good bargains on post  winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about  buying a sweater! I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one  sitting! My backyard is really looking good. It's almost all planted, maybe 90%  done. I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer  Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms). It will be a  while before they look like trees, though. Right now they kinda look like  tall bushes. I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft.  plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little  little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about  7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm. They're in pots, because I'll have  to take them in during hard freezed. I've planted lots of climbing pink,  yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid. It will take a while before  they fill out. Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot  of color. Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over  Houston. I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds  and butterflies. I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a  bit. Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit. I need a little sun to make them bloom. And then there's my St. Francis  fountain. He's just lovely! 	I'm German bound

summarize: Just a followup note:  We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original  incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have  been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of  using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents). I  think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to  the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them. So my  question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts,  to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us! ). 	Original Guarantees

summarize: 1. What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"? I think that should be  "Credit Derivatives". 2. Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list,  since I never have any responses from those groups. 3. I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with  limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake. 4. Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for  "EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper". I will maintain my approvals for each of  those separate online trading databases in the same database. 5. I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial". Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush  from last week done....  As usual, your help is always appreciated! 	Amendments to EOL Database

summarize: Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to  Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe  (www.bishopslodge.com). Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a  silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great. The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink  to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the  activities going on in Santa Fe. I think you are going to be too late for  their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other  fun things going on. The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking  pool, horseback riding and shooting. Take a look. 	Santa Fe 
summarize: As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the  U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap  agreements.

summarize: We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00  ("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the  approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed  the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and  paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and  option transactions"  with ENA. For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we  trade. For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps  and options. If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both  ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval. I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts  and Camille Gerard. 	Brant-Allen Industries, Inc. 
summarize: Please remember that all online confidentiality agreement should be logged in  through me, I prepare a list of them for the Online Team.

summarize: I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about  tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and  ENA. Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided  with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of  Japan. Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next  week to discuss this. 	A Reminder 
summarize: Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database. You  should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access  only. They should not see our comments. That information is confidential  and subject to attorney/client privilege). Let me know if you do not have  edit access. Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside  your area of responsibility. A few notes... There is some great reporting functionality in this database. Check out some  of the sorts on the left. There is a drop down called "Pending Swap  Update". That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial  agreements. There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate  reports for you compan  The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are  critical to trading/confirmations/settlement. Kinda, before you do/authorize  a trade read this. Not for general legal notes. Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded  elsewise (it will mess up reporting). If you are amending an agreement or  superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment". I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs. If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you. Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA  definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption  provisions. This information should be inputted for the new master swap  agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and  repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements. Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and  mergers reference. If an item is filled in for that entity it should show  you any prior or new names for the counterparty. We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful. Link --> 	ISDA Master Agreement Data Base Link

summarize: A few news flashes re: limitations on products:  1. The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina  counterparties. They have licensing requirements similar to US physical  power. All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut  down for this product. 2. Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA  can only enter into credit derivates with US counterparties. 	Online Product News

summarize: On your counterparty list for the UK, have you identified which  counterparties are utilities or governmentals? If you have that would help  me alot. Thanks! 	Online Trading 
summarize: For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can  trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need  your help and your list to be able to do that. I am totally unfamiliar with  the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in  English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty  or not. I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with  utilities and governmentals. I've been searching that utility website trying  to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it  sounds like a utility or governmental. Is your list done, or when will it be done? Do you spell out if the  counterparty is governmental/utility? What help can you give me? 	UK Counterparty List

summarize: Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending  12/3. All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be  ignored. If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to  look at it. If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of  today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division   The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going  forward basis. Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU  IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE  PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY. We rarely expect  counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the  counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties. I  ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY. Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which  contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts,  in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis. Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will  forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 	EOL Credit Approvals Week Ending 12/3

summarize: Another Division  Mark,  Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a  division. My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these  counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of  the name. Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as  divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle. Do  you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as  divisions? Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss  divisions? What to do?

summarize: Clem,  Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela. Carolyn started  working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in  1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!). Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas  Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key  contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the  primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB  relationship for the law firm. Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be  around. I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate  Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and  Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc. I  think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron. - cpv.doc 	Resume of Carolyn Varela

summarize: In response to a RUSH request from Frank:  FINANCIAL TRADING:  El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. is approved to trade  all financial products under with the existing El Paso Energy Marketing  Company (now known as El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company) Master Agreement  dated as of 04/20/95. Such Master Agreement and the Transactions thereunder  we assigned to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P, pursuant to an Assignment of  Agreements dated as of 12/1/99. Confirmation Desk:  with respect to weather confirmations, they should  continue to follow the existing format of the El Paso Energy Marketing  Company weather trades (changing the name, of course). We are in the process of replacing the old "ERMS Style" Master Agreement with  an ISDA Master Agreement and will notify you when the new agreement is  executed. PHYSICAL TRADING:  Approved for all products. Global Contracts:  talk to  Stacy Dickson about which contracts to use (EL Paso, Sonat or GTC). EMERGING PRODUCTS. Approved for all products.

summarize: I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby  (well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work! ), I called Leslie at home  at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company  approved. We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we  just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the  bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for  purchases only).

summarize: I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade  under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty. It's not  surprising, it's a confusing master! This is currently the only agreement we  have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial  transactions in one agreement. There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between  ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp.  (Global Contract Reference No. 96000160). This agreement provides for  financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and  further provides for physical natural gas transactions only. It does not  provide for any other physical products. Call me if you have any questions... 	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. EOL Trading 
summarize: Attached please find the referenced lists.

Of course, no European power for US entities until further notice. 	Counterparty Approval Lists for 2/7/00 and 2/8/00 
summarize: Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments:  1. BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me. We got  the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all  financial. 2. Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with  Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America. That should be the name that  goes out on the confirm. All the counterparties on today's list are shut down for power. 	Counterparty Approval List for 02/18/00 
summarize: Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict  Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going  forward basis. To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based  counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power. This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us  evidence of their FERC licensing. 	Australia counterparties-physical power

REVISED REMINDER: Feb 1 Industry Collaborative on Developing      Energy Standards Organization in NYC 
summarize: As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal. 	Organizational Announcement

summarize: Mark,  Two points. 1. You probably know about it already. ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power  Play", is on a tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a  meeting last Sunday  at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40  people attended. 2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to  write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an  article on EBS. I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company  Reinventing Itself. I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident. It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management. b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up  with a term "proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution." c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment. d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and  accomplishemnts. The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate  strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts. Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key  players. Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper. Vince 	Enron in India 
summarize: Becky,  I am sending you two spreadsheets. Headcount gives  the allocations by major business units. Please, see the sheet Allocations. Line 83 gives you the  percentages you can use. Budget  spreadsheet gives the budget projections. The sheet Allocations has  been modified to  include charges to RAC and GRM. I had to modify extensively  the sheet Detail to account for the size of the group (as compared with 25 rows available to  list the employees in the original spreadsheet). Please, check the logic of my  modifications (I hope I copied all the formulas correctly). I had to assume a bonus number. I shall work on allocations by different business units within ENA and GRM  but it's chasing a moving target. It changes from month to month. I shall be gone for the next 4 business days. Please, call me and leave a  message on my voice mail if there is any question. I shall be listening to my voice  messages. Sorry if there are any problems. I have to rush to catch my plane.

summarize: Sherri,  Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to  have  Jeff Skilling as a keynote speaker. Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend that Jeff speaks at this conference I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about this conference and  I think that this will be  an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future. I shall send a separate message to Jeff about this request. Vince 	Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling

Either Brad  or a stipend refund check should show up on March 15. 3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his  future employment opportunities with Enron.

summarize: As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the September Quarter-end close period. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report that significant progress has been made. With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response. Poor Performing Programs The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs. Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end. In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close. Workload Distribution The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system "bottlenecks". We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution. Workshops are currently being conducted with key "close-users" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process. Improved Close Monitoring The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems. Communication Strategy Implement The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues. This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner. Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regarding our efforts to improve overall system performance. 	Update on SAP System Response 
summarize: Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed. Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind. transcos under). The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week). The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida). I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts. Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board. The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top. When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: "that would put the cabosh on this model," then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO. There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model. Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power. Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos. 	FERC meeting: SE RTO

summarize: During a news conference held late on 29 October, Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that intelligence sources have found "credible" information that the U.S. could be the focus for some sort of terrorist attacks within the week. Ashcroft said the information received was not specific as to target or date of attack, but was of sufficient credibility  to warrant sharing with the public. He further called on law enforcement agencies, citizens and U.S. interests abroad to be on "highest alert." Although no specific targets were mentioned, various federal agencies, including DOE, EPA, FAA, FBI and DOT have been alerted. Effective immediately, and until further notice, DOE and NNSA have mandated that all activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks. Changes in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented. DOE and NNSA strongly suggest that the energy industry also implement these actions and to be on alert for any suspicious activities. We will keep you informed of any new information as it is received. 	Threat Advisory and Call for Increased Vigilance

summarize: Hi, Steve -             I've been thinking of you quite a bit over the past few months as the       Enron woes have unfolded and finally decided to drop you a line. I       hope you're keeping your legendary sense of perspective. One of the       things I have admired about you is that you never lose sight of the       fact that people make an organization successful, a lesson many of       your Enron peers apparently have yet to learn. Maybe it comes from       having priorities other than making money ot being powerful, but my       conversations with friends demonstrates that they still appreciate       your loyalty to your staff. Philadelphia agrees very well with Michael and me. We're getting       ensconced in our house and adjusting to life in the 'burbs. Fortunately, we're in Bryn Mawr, where we have a college town, rather       than suburban, environment. In fact, we are within three miles of       four four-year colleges! I've seen Mike Terrasso at some of the EHS       meetings - what a thoughtful, gentle man. Although I miss some of the excitement and intellectual stimulation of       working at Enron, I don't miss Houston (except for the people). However, I'm energized by the notion of incorporating EHS excellence       into a coherent management system that focuses on improving the bottom       line, and I'm enjoying the challenge of managing a large staff again. Given all of the recent consolidation in the refining industry, I'm       thankful for Sunoco's strong perfromance over the past couple of years       and hope that we can remain independent for a few more years. Do let me know if you get to the East Coast. We'd love to take you to       dinner. Take care, and hang in there!

summarize: We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA. In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW). He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided). He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming". Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of  generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 	Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional  comments/suggestions

summarize: Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of  what FERC did today. One question you need to think about is how their  decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to  California's spot market. The way it reports the market clearing price will  change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to  clear the market for all bids. So, if we are using this as a reference price  in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives. 	USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

summarize: BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Global Markets  In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage. The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.

summarize: Pete,  Just a quick note to see how things are going down there? I'm sorry to hear that Enron's on some tough times, hope you're area is safe. Got to love paying Andersen for their quality financial statements huh? Old AA is in hot water for their F/S for Enron, Waste Management Inc. and couple other companies. Their getting some pretty bad press and rightfully deserved, since all they've tried to focus on is building up a consulting firm years before the inevitable split with Andersen Consulting (Accenture). On a personal side, hope you, Anne and the girls are doing ok.  Kim and I move into our new place on Monday. Of course we were supposed to move in back in September, but what can you do. We're cutting it close to Kim's due date, but if she keep her legs together until after Monday we should be ok. 	Corporate Culture

summarize: Hi, Sweethearts,   I want to let you know that Michael's father passed away yesterday  morning. He had been feeling bad for about a month and last week he passed out and hurt himself. At the hospital they found out that he had a bleeding ulcer that made him faint. They took had to take him off the blood thinners and they were giving him medication for the ulcer and sent him home Tuesday night. Wednesday morning he must have had a blood clot that caused a heart attack. Crystal and Jamie did cpr which started his heart again but then it stopped. Michael is in Denver and is going to Alamo tonight for the funeral on Saturday. The kids and I aren't going since Michael has to leave for Denver and then North Dakota on Sunday and he doesn't want me trying to drive out there alone with the kids. Michael was training on Wednesday so I waited to tell him until lunch. He is blessed that two of his good friends were there and they have helped him deal with his loss (one of them is exactly Michael's age and is dying of lymphoma...he has 5 children, the youngest just 7). Michael seems to be doing fine, although the funeral will be hard. His family will be in a financial crisis, though. Please pray with us for them that God helps them through their pain and hard decisions. Mandi, I hope your move goes without problems. I love you all, 	Michael's dad

summarize: We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, 	Online Trading Simulation

summarize: Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser. BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children. This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month. Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services. BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all. Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.

summarize: Hello  Long time no see or hear!! Thank you for sending me a note - I've only just got into this e mail lark as we didn't have it on the computors at work until this year - and then I'm not supposed to be using it oh well. How is America? I had no idea that you where there or that you had  had a baby, Denise came to Majorca this summer and she filled me in on peoples whereabouts. How old is you little boy and what's his name. It's winter season here and very little work to do - that's why I am e mail mad  to try and fill in my time. Only got 2 days left and then I am finished until Feb, depending on how things go with bookings etc after New York. I usually go home for Christmas every year but my nana died  at the beginning of the year and now we don't have a base to stay (me, sally and mum) so i am going home on the 8th of Dec until the 18th and having Christmas here instead. My mum has been here for 2 years now, well 2 summers and a bit of winter. she originally came to help me with Louisa just after she was born as I went back to work when she was 3 months and mum looked after her for me during the day, but now as she hasn't got nana to look after she decided to come back and helps me out a lot as my hours are not always a straight 9-5. Louisa goes to nursery during the week  and mum and I juggle the hours between us ( I say mum and I as Toni is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard )  My sister is an art director for Vidal Sasson, doing very well for herself, she runs the new salon in the city in London and is always jetting of to Japan and other exciting `places, still single no children but loves Louisa to bits. Anyway enough about me, how is life in America,  do you work or are you a lady of leisure? Louisa is nearly 3, but I imagine your little boy isn't at school yet is he? does he look like you or your husband? Louisa is blond with blue eyes, nothing like either myself or Toni - she is very much like my sister and my dad. I have been at the hospital today to see a specialist with her as she was born with a lump in her neck (which he has told us will have to be removed in later years) she also has a mark on the back of her head and a birthmark between her lip and her nose which a lot of people comment about but I am very used to. She has noe to go and see another specialist about these 2 things and then hopefully eveything will be sorted out, apart from that ahe is nearly 3 but every thinks she is at least 4 as she is very tall and well built unfortuanately the only thing she has got from her father is his Majorcian temperment!! Say hello to your mum and dad and Paul, if you are in the Uk at the same time as me let me know as I would love to see you all. Bye for now  Love Jo and Louisa  xxx 	Me in Majorca

summarize: CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote  Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a "preference payment" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment. The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates. It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently. Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others. This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors. 	California Update 6/08/01

summarize: Dear Mr. Lay:  You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it. I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group. Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings. I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time. Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews. With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one. However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way. I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well. Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end. I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed. I knew that since I was a ???survivor?? ?, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ?? ?critical employee???. But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself. I decided to seek employment outside of Enron. I was fortunate. I found something immediately. I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity. I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been. I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due. I was mistaken. When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself. After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources. I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ?? years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation. I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation. I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??" that way they were assured $4,500. I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month. Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to. What are the rules? How should these situations have been handled? Should not each employee be treated fairly? Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay. I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron. I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down. However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??" ones that have yet to be recognized. All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me. I earned my vacation. I worked hard and supported this company ??" and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars. I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future. I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful. Sincerely, 	Goodbye Mr. Lay

As an employee for over 11 years, I've seen a lot at Enron, both good and bad. But in my career I've been with a number of major companies, and none have been as exciting as Enron.

summarize: Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies. As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron. This is just one of several options that we are considering. Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy. We have no additional information we can share at this time. We'll keep you updated as developments occur. 	Dynegy Discussions

summarize: Attention: Mark Palmer and Kenneth Lay  I have two additional quesitons I forgot to ask. The first of which is Mr. Lay's age, is he 58 or 59 years of age. Secondly, does Mr. Lay have plans to sell any more shares in the near future of any of the companies he is involved in either as an executive or director? Many thanks, and feel free to call if you have any questions, Cassell Bryan-Low 	WSJ additional questions 
summarize: As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron. The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you. 	Change of Control Provisions 
summarize: Ken,  Your decision to return your separation package to the company you built was a meaningful gesture to all employees. Having been here at Enron for seven years, I know you must be terribly disappointed with the recent events. This move was a very classy one. Thanks! Rob 	Great Move!

summarize: Dear Mr. Lay ,                     I was employed as an EGLI employee twelve years ago and currently I am a contractor with EES power company . My wife has been                     with ENRON for fifteen years eversince she came out of U of H . Our hearts bleed ENRON blood and they were wounded deeply last                     Friday night when we saw you on TV announcing the sale of ENRON to Dynergy . We are and still very grateful to all the good things                      that ENRON has provided to our family ( we have three children) and feel so blessed to be associated with such a caring and generous                     company . Mr Lay , we love you , respect you and most of all we trust you to do everything in your power to help to save ENRON and in process                      all of its employees . Our hearts were broken when we saw your face in that Friday announcement . The stress of giving up "your child"                      away can be devastated and I think you have aged greatly the last three weeks or so . The stress impact was almost the same as that                       which I saw on Mr . Michael Cappellas as he announced the sale of Compaq to HP sometimes ago . Please beleive us we felt this way                       whether you gave back the 60 millions or not . ( I felt you deserve the money because under your leadership ENRON has growthed                        tremendously the last fifteen years or so and hence all the people here including the critics have the jobs that they currently have and                         99.99 % of them would have taken the money anyway besides that what are the reasonable compensation to a leader that have tripled                        or quadrupled shareholders values ?. Look at Michael Eisner , Larry Orvitz and dozen other Fortune 500 CEO 's compensation including                         those that have not added any values to their respective companies during their tenure and they will see your compensation are justified . Throughout the years we saw so many changes at ENRON and most disturbing fact is the expenses ( G & A ,outside contractors ,consultant ...)                        go up thru the roof . Since I am a contractor  I knew how much ENRON paid for such services , me and my wife were trying to do our parts by she                        wrote and sent an e-mail to Mr Rick Causey suggesting ways to cut down outside contractor 's cost because whatever the savings will be                        reflected directly to the bottom lines . Mr Lay , whatever happened we will allways trust you to steer ENRON into the right path and we truly wish you Health ,Prosperity and                         Happiness to you and your family . Thank you for reading this e-mail . Sincerely , Joseph Nguyen . 	GO ENRON !!

summarize: Dear Ken -  Please don't be heartbroken about the value of anyone's portfolio or stand in line to beat yourself up about it (again). Contrary to popular opinion, there is nothing that Enron executives or Wall Street analysts can do to ruin anyone's future. The "portfolio problem" is not loss of value, rather lack of values--people need to get some personal values that are worth a damn! 	To Brighten Your Day 
summarize: Mr. Lay:  First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 yea= rs now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of m= y life, career-wise. When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost sta= rry eyed. I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates= t company I had ever been associated with. I started out with Enron Power = Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible. I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years. Some great, some good and=  some not so good. But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart=  beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our = management have made. But most of all, we've still got great people. Base= d on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like=  we are going to have to "do it all over again". However, I am an eternal = optimist. Looking at this in football terms...  this is a rebuilding year = and we've got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench. One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich = Kinder exuded. I was saddened to see Mr. Kinder move on, but I was confide= nt that having you remain behind would continue our successes. And we have=  been successful. Aside from the LJM issue (which, to be honest, I still d= on't fully understand), I think we've just had some external distractions t= hat have hampered our stock growth this year, such as Dabhol, Portland Gene= ral, California, etc., in addition to the market conditions in general. =20  In the all-employee meeting, you told the troops that it was going to take = the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going i= n the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess. I am full= y prepared to do this, however, there is one request I would like to bring = up. I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are goi= ng to expire at the end of this year. In all my wildest dreams (or nightma= res), I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threate= n a grant price of $21.563, but here we are. As a dedicated and confident = employee, I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications=  around me that the stock would go to 100. Later in the year, as the stock=  moved downward, I heard indications that we were going to bounce back stro= ng. I was on board. I was excited. I trusted that this was the case. In=  fact, I look back on this past year and, based on what I knew at the time,=  I would probably do the same thing over again. But...   that was then and this is now. It has been painful for me, as I k= now it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company. I wan= t to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end. =20  My request is simple...    is there any way possible to extend options expi= ring at the end of this year by one year? If you want to make a good faith gesture towards long-time employees who ar= e willing to re-dedicate themselves to the daunting task at hand, I can thi= nk of nothing better for the short term. I think extending the expiration=  date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee popu= lation who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourse= lves in. =20  If you can't do anything, I will understand.

summarize: Dear Family,  Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the Houston Rockets through November. Because we all have very busy lives and find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each game before distributing tickets. Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game this year, if we could do it on shorter notice. Our eight basketball seats are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try to make this work and have fun doing it. I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets. If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with an * next to it. Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I will put your name on the list with a ? next to your name. Once your name is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend. Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets. Hopefully, we can all work it out. However, in the event that we have more requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I will have Barb pull names out of a hat. Once you confirm your attendance, tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up. For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets, they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order. I will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation. If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to offer tickets to, let me know. I can either contact you and have you contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb will contact them directly, as you wish. In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the tickets. GO ROCKETS! Love, Mom/Linda 	HOUSTON ROCKETS TICKETS 
summarize: Dear Ken,  I wrote you some time back about the campaign to raise ca. $4 million to replace the American Heart Association's Houston regional headquarters building which burned this past April. You were so kind in putting us in touch with Cindy Olson and Misha Siegel to discuss Enron's corporate position and the potential for assistance from the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation. We deeply appreciated our meeting with Cindy and Misha. Things have been progressing I'm pleased to say. AHA has concluded a deal to sell the restored old building for approximately $1.15 million, and we have received substantial commitments from a very few individuals and Houston area foundations totaling approximately $600,000. Therefore, our remaining challenge is to raise around $2-$2.25 million to complete the funding of a new building that will meet the needs of AHA in the years to come. We have not yet been able to identify a very visible corporate or professional lead for the effort. We will be discussing this possibility with Ernie Cockrell on November 6th. As part of that conversation we would like to indicate notable leaders in Houston who would be willing to have their names affiliated with the capital campaign, perhaps as an Executive Committee or Advisory Committee. The question to you is:  Would you approve the use of your name in your capacity at Enron and/or the name of the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation in this way? Again, the AHA and I have been so deeply appreciative of your willingness to support the American Heart Association for so many years. I hope we can call on you for this additional assistance at a time of need. Thanks, Ken, for your consideration. Best regards, 	American Heart Association 
summarize: Dear Mr. Lay,  i have just returned home after picking up Victor at Shepherd/Kirby and bringing him to the grocery store. He shared with me that you had stopped to say hi and gave him $20 from your wallet. This email is to convey my warmest personal thanks to you for your generosity to those less fortunate. i have paid for an apartment on Commonwealth for 3 years for him, and check on him every day...he has also volunteered his time and efforts to several of my former work projects - JDF, MS150, etc. i will be going into redeployment next monday, and hopefully will be fortunate enough to stay on at ENRON. If it doesn't work out, please know that I am grateful for the 4 years I spent there - the company has treated me very well, and i will always remain loyal and dedicated to you. 	victor kelly 
summarize: Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43. This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines. In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance. We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units. In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units. For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities. In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services. This quarter they are reported separately. Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately. Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter. Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million. Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year. While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat. Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago. So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers. Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago. This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter. Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural. This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind. Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year. Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year. This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs. Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago. In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion. Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses. These charges include: ? A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ? $183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services. This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ? $544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement. With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

summarize: Hi, Ken:  I'm a former ECT VP who is just down the street, back at Ryder Scott Company which was my home before my six-years with Enron. A great six-ears, in fact, I learned much and enjoyed the Company and the company, but it does feel better to be back in the "oil patch". I still have stock and will continue to be a stockholder as I know the company will continue to be innovative and dynamic. My reason for this email is a recent op-ed piece in the Houston Chronicle by Robert Buzzanco decrying the current campaign against terrorism. His editorial was at best silly, fraught with inaccuracies (as a geological engineer I rely on facts - minorities make up 34.4% of the combined arm forces - not the opposite as suggested in Buzzanco's piece) and intended only to protract his personal agenda which has nothing to do with peace. This may be more about selling his anti-American books than current events. I could really care less about this person, he certainly has the right to conduct his protest, many have fought and died for his right and more may die in the coming days. I do object to this guy using the University of Houston to lend credibility to his cause. That's like an Enron employee (purely an example) marching in protests wearing the logo and identifying him or herself with Enron. He is a private citizen when he writes an editorial or marches in protest. He used his position at UofH  to get his piece in the paper. I know you are an alumnus, and I ask you to read his editorial (10/8) and respond according to your hear. Keep the ship on course, Ken. Respectfully  Thomas M. Talley 	Robert Buzzanco 
summarize: Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept. After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups. This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc. The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

summarize: The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development. We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive. We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works. Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12. Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:  Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year. Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM. Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well. The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year. Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant. For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business. The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs. Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date. In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002. If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us. Greg Piper Sally Beck Mark Pickering 	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process 
summarize: Dear Ken,             I would like to apologize for not responding to the survey at the beginning of September. It wasn't a statement or anything. We were just up to our ears in a project that had to go out on the Wednesday following Labor Day. And the "well, I'll fill it out during lunch" is never a really good idea. Lunchtime disappears so quickly. So by way of apology I am sending you this letter with some thoughts and observations about life at Enron. I hope you don't think I'm "line jumping" by doing this. But I've observed that surveys often get you information you want, not information you need. The numbers on the survey look good. But there's always room for improvement. I'm very pleased that you're once again involved in the day-to-day operations. I'm also very glad that you're emphasizing our values. I have to admit that they weren't the reason I came to Enron-I needed a job-but as soon as I was here, they became a major reason for staying. It's not just another job, if the values are believed and followed. The perks are nice, but I bet that the values have as much to do with our being named a great place to work as anything else. I wonder, though, if everyone shares my-our-view. There was a rumor going around the day after the all-employee meeting that senior management was not happy when you announced we were going to reaffirm our values. That strikes me as a little too soon after the meeting to be totally credible, and I really can't picture senior management telling people what they really think about our values or anything, if they really think that way. I also don't doubt that it's true. We seem to have gone from a company that treasures its intellectual capital and people to one where reorganizations and "disappearances" are more the order of the day. Although it's gotten a little better, our values right now seem to be FUD-a computer industry term for fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Many people-myself included-spend a lot of time looking over our shoulders as we go through seemingly constant reorganization and reevaluation, waiting for the other shoe to drop-on us. Rumors (the whole unit is being phased out) were rampant, and it didn't help when the PEP scores came out with no indication why (really low) scores were given, or, more importantly, how we could go about improving our performance. This doesn't strike me as the best way to increase productivity or esprit d' corps. We need to add value to the values. As part of my initial orientation, Joe Sutton asked us to define and give examples of our values. A couple of months later, Jeff Skilling addressed "Enron at a Glance." He spent serious time explaining the importance of the values, too. Hey, I thought, these guys are serious about this stuff. Since then, though, all my reinforcement about our values comes from the elevator, right after The Building Guy. Last spring, we were all trooped over to the Doubletree to see the harassment players, costing a fair chunk of time and money, I'm guessing. So which, in my puny little brain, is more important? Where the dollars go, or the occasional reference in what somebody considers otherwise dead time? There are ways we can adjust. I would like to suggest two possibilities. First, I would like to propose a refresher course in our values. Take time out of our days. Get in experts. Hire a hall. Give us cookies. Heck, maybe even lunch. Make the bigwigs in each unit do off-sites. They like off-sites. We'll get the idea. This is important. One other notion. You may recall bumper stickers that read, "Commit Random Acts of Kindness." I would like to suggest a "Random Acts of Values" award. Actually, I wouldn't want to make it an award. "Random Acts of Values" recognition? captured? Maybe. I'll keep doing the day in and the day out, because it's the right thing to do, not because of an award. But recognizing what we think is important might give a boost to some other people. It will at least raise the profile. And it would also tell us something if the recognition was going to everyone except senior management. I'd really hate to see my rumormonger proven true. I know we have the Chairman's Award. But I'm no Mark Herada. I would need two lifetimes to do half of what he's done. The Chairman's Award is really important, and I will nominate someone. People like Mark truly deserve it, and I know a couple. But it's one award, once a year. We should recognize little moments. I have no idea how we would capture them, and I don't know what to do with a guy who is really respectful today and tomorrow resumes being a jerk. But we can figure out something. And I'm suspecting that you really wouldn't be terribly bent out of shape if you had to recognize 20,000 values moments, especially if they were one per person. Sincerely, 	values 
summarize: Dr. Lay -  The decision to go with Planners Services Group versus Extraordinary Events, TBA Inc., or Ward & Ames was made by the ONE ENRON Holiday Party Planning Committee. (Planners has an established relationship with Enron Field and coordinated ECT's Holiday party there last year.) Each vendor gave creative presentations and were very similar in capabilities. While Ward & Ames provided sound ideas in their proposal, there were a few aspects that affected the final decision. Ward and Ames' proposal was over budget when calibrated against other bids, holds an internal perception of being "controlling" vs flexible (i.e. logo launch & Portland adopted elephant event) and presentation was satisfactory but not outstanding when compared to others. Overall each of the vendors would have been capable of handling the event, but in the end Planners was unanimously selected by the Planning Committee. Sarah A.

summarize: Ken  I received a copy of the agenda for your October 3 & 4 conference on Alternative Futures for the Current Energy Crisis. I applaude you for your continued leadership in the public policy arena for energy. The absence of representatives from the coal industry is obvious. Since coal is America's largest domestic energy resource and it fuels 52% of America's electricity, it should be represented. Thank you for your consideration and best wishes.

summarize: I'm a recent EBS redeployment person who found a job in ETS. Late last week my group got flat screen monitors to replace the old, large, bulky ones. We moved to 3 Allen Center on Monday evening 9/17. On Tuesday evening, 9/18 someone came into this area and stole 2 of the new flat screen monitors. This is being investigated, however, we now have 2 persons without a monitor. What is happening to all the computer equipment from EBS terminated/redeployed persons? If we had access to this equipment, the monitors could be quickly replaced. Instead, 2 old, large bulky monitors are being delivered as a "temporary" fix while ETS orders new equipment. Why is ETS ordering new equipment when a transfer of computer assets from EBS to ETS could speedily resolve this problem? All Enron companies could benefits if the unused equipment from EBS was recycled back into Enron. 	EBS Computer Equipment

summarize: Dear Ken,  Today I learned that effective midnight tonight I have been made redundant from my position in Enron Europe. I have worked for Enron for the last 10 years and I can say that despite what has happened today, joining Enron was the best career move I made. The past 10 years have presented opportunities that were beyond my wildest dreams. I appreciate everything that Enron has done for myself and my family, and I leave believing that I did my best to return my gratefulness in some way. While growing up in a worling class environment my father taught me two great lessons in life, which I believe we all need to learn. The first being that if you ever want anything in life then you had better work for it. The second being that you should never understand the meaning of the word "can't". I believe that I have been able to follow his teaching in my career with Enron. I leave Enron with tremendous experience and, most of all a feeling of belonging to something that was once great. I truly believed in the company and its people. Indeed I have reminded myself daily over the last few weeks that Enrons success was built more on its intangible assets rather than its tangible assets. Enron's greatness was built by its people because we all have dreams and ambitions to be a part of something great. Although I leave the company with great sadness I also leave with a great feeling of thanks and appreciation. Arthur Ransome 	Thank you for a great experience 
summarize: Mr. Lay: I am a former Enron employee. I used to be proud of Enron. I believed everything that you and EES management said. I believe that the Vision and Values that you and other senior executives at Enron preached are not worth the paper they are printed on. Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence. I don't believe you respected the rights of so many Enron employees who sacrificed their family time so that the company would succeed. I don't believe you have any integrity when it comes to fully disclosing Enron's future. You obviously have not communicated the truth to employees, analysts or anyone else. Maybe you should look inside yourself to see if you have the excellence now that you demanded from your employees. I would like to see you take ownership of the incredible debacle that has fallen upon Enron. So many of my friends and colleagues are out of work because of the gross mismanagement that you and others have shown. I believe the least you could do is go on record and address these people at a time of year that is so special to so many. Do the right thing and show some of the visions and values that you spoke so highly of not so long ago. Show the men and women of Enron and Houston what you're all about. Steve Beck 	Enron

summarize: To the attention of: Dr  Kenneth L. Lay Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Enron   Dear Dr Lay,  2001 was an extraordinary year! As it draws to a close, I would like to share some of my thoughts with you. First of all, I wanted to thank our members and constituents for their active engagement during the last 12 months, which helped us to move forward in our efforts to serve as a framework and catalyst for business and society to improve the state of the world. In 2001 we implemented "Forum Plus" strategy, designed to advance critical issues on the global agenda through the creation of task forces and initiatives that integrate business, governments, international organizations, civil society, academics and technical experts. Today, 11 task forces are already in place. To provide an intellectual and strategic base for these activities, we have developed and computerized - with the help of our members and constituents - a comprehensive system for monitoring some 200 specific items on the global agenda. This tracking process provides a foundation for action on these ongoing challenges. To make our foundation a true multi-stakeholder platform we have created a number of consultative councils (e.g. with NGOs, world religious leaders, academies of science, etc.) and have, at the same time, strengthened the role of the business community inside our organization. It is worth noting that despite the negative trends in the global economy, 2001 was a successful year for all of our activities. This shows that even in difficult times there is a great demand for increased interaction among global decision-makers, and for top-level community building. The most difficult decision the Forum had to take this year was to move our Annual Meeting from Davos to New York in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September. From 31 January to 4 February 2002, leaders from business, governments, academia, religions, the media and civil society will have a first opportunity to develop an integrated response to these new circumstances. The Annual Meeting 2002 is organized around six major challenges we are facing as a global community:  1. Restoring Sustained Growth 2. Achieving Security, Addressing Vulnerabilities 3. Redefining Business Challenges 4. Reducing Poverty and Achieving Equity 5. Sharing Values and Respecting Differences 6. Re-evaluating Leadership and Governance  The Annual Meeting in New York will be characterized by a workshop-style approach where all participants will have an opportunity to engage in shared learning and to have a collective impact. The programme is designed to stimulate discussion and provide insights that will help us better cope with the fragility of our times. The response to our invitations has been overwhelming: All the key personalities will be present. Please note that this year, instead of sending Christmas cards, we have made a donation to the Nelson Mandela Foundation to help build schools for needy children. My 150 colleagues and I look forward to joining forces with you in the New Year, in the spirit of entrepreneurship in the global public interest, to "improve the state of the world." My very best wishes accompany you in your contemplation at the end of the year and particularly for a healthy and successful 2002.

summarize: Dear Ken:  I am very sad to see what has happened to such a big icon in Houston. I am very sorry to see you struggle through this and try to remain at a high level. I am very pleased to see you chose to stay with the company and work at what I hope is its new birth and positive rise in society and business community. I had a chance to meet with you a little over a year ago at a charity function. While I am no expert in the energy business and I'm but a college student at the present time, I would like to share a view from the other side of the inner loop your used to. Before I met you everyone I spoke with had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and what a genious you are. After the news came out about the misfortune of Enron, some of those same people started bad mouthing some of the same people they praised. It made me sick and made me think very little of those individuals. I was concerned because I could not believe that you would intentionally and knowingly do something that would jeopardize the very company you helped build. The day I saw you make the decision to not leave or step down as CEO I knew then that you must not have been directly involved in the coverup done by your previous COO and a couple of other top executives you had entrusted. Those few people,! one of which you had recently hired, all quit just before the news came out about Enron bookkeeping. I feel safe in saying you must have been misadvised by those few people or you did not know what they were doing behind your back. It is obvious they were not working for Enron like you, but rather "at" Enron to try to steal as much money and benefites they could and then head for the hills, which is what they did. The mere act of having several top executives quit working at Enron after a short stay at the company and then cashing out on their holdings tells me it was intentional and I consider them thieves. It would be a different story had they stayed like you and really cared about the company and what it represents and does for society as a whole. I feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devestated by what has happened. BUT, it makes me very angry to hear people and writers casting stones on you and a company that has done so much over the past several years for so many. Enron has funded more charity events and backed more functions and elections than most. Now when the tide has turned and (due to a few greedy top executive decisions) Enron is in the position of needing help, everyone is out for blood and looking to end a company that still represent the same work it did before, but whose value has decreased because of word of mouth and the stupid greed of your previous employees. Some people I have talked with say Enron is finished and is only a matter of time before it is gone. That makes me angry too. From what I see you have not given up on the company nor have you abandoned ship. That tells me you may be trying to rebuild the company and its reputation. That would be the greatest thing to do and show those who are out for Enrons demise (and who can do nothing but bad mouth) just what your really made of and put them in their place. I have been reading nothing but negative articles about the company. I feel like it is not the company, because that would mean every single employee would be to blame. Rather the writers should focus on the few individuals who cashed out and split. I would hope you could remember back 4 or 5 years ago when the company was really thriving and doing well. I hope you can remember the good things about the company and the fact that it can still (and does) make money from its businesses. It can turn around if you want it to. I would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by Enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beutiful buildings now towering over Houston's skyline. I call those Houston's twin towers. Other large companies in the past have turned around after similar set backs as horrible as this with Enron. Your turn around would be record setting. I heard about others (like the teachers retirement fund) making noise about wanting to take Enron to court because they invested millions. That is stupid because it is their choice to invest and their risk to take, especially making it after the news broke about the company. Sure they trusted that Dynegy would merge, so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at Dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn Enron around and make their investment purposful rather than throwing stones. I think Dynegy is a wonderful company as well, but it "was mean" for them to come out and say "yes they would merge" and then not. I realize it's all business and people like to make money, but it's another thing to flat steal and lie (like your executives you trusted did) rather than profit from hard work and honesty. I personally know of many large corporations and politicians who have things to hide that would cause problems like yours. Your company is not alone, which is why I am so angry at others throwing stones at you and Enron. This would not happen if there were'nt executives in corporate industries like the ones you entrusted your company to who try to take rather than give and earn from it. Perhaps many should learn from Colleen Barrett, COO of Southwest Airlines. Do you know that they are the only airlines to refuse federal aid recently and they are doing better then most airlines. Good luck and thank you for hanging in there and making me believe there are still some good top CEO's out there. 	Rebuild

summarize: As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.

Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign. Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity! This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo. The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner. This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community. The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign. Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

summarize: Attached is a draft agreement regarding the Citizens' contract whereby BP, as agent, has requested the use of an alternate delivery point outside the path. The tariff permits us to agree to such alternate point and the rate. We are not required to agree to such alternate point use under the tariff. Therefore, we do not have to grant this right beyond that which we want, which in this case is a month. If pressed by BP, we should respond that we are only prepared to agree to such alternate point use for a month. For those of you unfamiliar with the Global Settlement, the reason we have the right to agree whether we want to amend a customer's  primary or alternates outside the path was to give us the opportunity to recoup the turnback costs. In other words, by not agreeing in certain instances we may receive incremental revenues to recoup the turnback costs which we are now 100% on the hook for. I did not know the Contract No., Lorraine, pls. fill that in. Given the Dynegy transition, pls. forward any additional comments to Bill Rapp. Thanks, Maria 	Amendment to Permit Use of Alternate Point outside of path 
summarize: California:  CA Legislature. On Monday Jan. 7th the legislature recovenced and Gov. Davis delivered his State of the State Address on Tuesday. Davis focused on the projected $12.5 billion budget shortfall and increased education spending. Gov. Davis pledged he will not advocate increasing taxes and his proposed budget for closing the gap will include a combination of cutbacks, deferred spending, internal borrowing and accelerated revenue. On Thursday, Assemblyman Herb Wesson, Jr. was elected as Speaker of the Assembly. Assemblyman Wesson is a Culver City Democrat. Also on Thursday, Gov. Davis submitted his balanced budget without tax increases. Key and controversial provisions to cover the shortfall included borrowing from teacher and state worker pension funds, cashing in on future year revenues from the tobacco settlement and spending cuts of $5.2 billion largely from health and welfare programs. I99-07-003  SoCalGas Unbundling. On Jan. 9th SoCalGas held a customer meeting to review their proposed unbundling implementation plan. This plan will be filed with the CPUC on Jan 17th.

Please put any future requests in there so  that we can keep track of who needs off when. I would like to try and keep  from having more than 3 people out at a time. 2. Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful. These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly  swaps. This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader  at gas daily as opposed to mid. This is very important to avoid OA variances. 3. When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are  created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price. This is  important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I  notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct  gd curve. 4. I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the  process and how to prepare forms. 5. Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders. All  the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to  spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the  positions that they do. The only request I have had is that we sit there  quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.

summarize: This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY  Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was "important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side," that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines." Last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend," he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an "adequate alternative," the commission observed. "However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision." A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers," the commission pointed out. "A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges," FERC said, adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner." Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers." Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled." Through a "tortured line of cases," FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured," Breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach. The "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers, she said.

summarize: I talked with Julie Smith right after lunch about ENA responding to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion. The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Thursday, November 29th). I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA.  That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements. I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project. She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA. Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that "due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001. So it looks like ENEL has about another week to work on their proposal. Ruth  P.S. I just got off the phone with Tennessee Gas Pipeline to thank them for extending the Open Season for us and give him an update on participating in the expansion. He indicated that "another international company" had just submitted an Open Season response. So it looks like ENEL has submitted the necessary paperwork. 	ENEL Proposal - Rio Bravo IV

FERC staff proposes to have 6 weeks of meetings (up to 3 days per week) to discuss issues identified by the participants. The purpose of the meetings is to try to develop consensus among industry participants on a standard interconnection agreement and procedures. A list of issues is attached. This list was developed by EPSA and presented to FERC at last week's meeting. At this week's meeting, the discussion will focus on the scope of interconnection rights and on interconnection study issues. Donna Fulton will attend these meetings on behalf of Enron. In preparation for the meetings, EPSA developed a position paper, which is attached. Briefly, EPSA proposes:       - Interconnecting Generator may elect, as part of its application for interconnection and study agreement, to be studied as an Energy Resource and/or as a Network/Capacity Resource; it may also request an "optional deliverability" study based on case-specific requirements. The interconnecting generator may elect its level of interconnection following completion of the studies. - The rights of the interconnected generator will depend on the manner it is studied, the upgrades for which the generator has paid, and whether the transmission pricing system is based on physical rights or financial rights. If you have any comments on the attached, please let me know as soon as possible. 	Generator Interconnection Rulemaking update

summarize: Kay,  Attached is the proposed CA for Western Resources, Inc. that Rudy requested today. It is identical to the proposed Dynegy CA. Rudy,  Reagan suggested to use the same form and scope of discussions as the Dynegy CA. Let Kay and I know if you think there should be any changes. Thanks. 	Western Resources, Inc. CA

summarize: As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter. 	Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues 
summarize: Karen,  As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions. I will add  that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who  repairs the road since they have approval authority. However, this doesn't  seem like a big issue to me. So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk  profile, I'm happy. Kay 	Annexation agreement/Yorkville 
summarize: Richard,  When you get a minute I would like to catch you up  on these issues. I think  it is appropriate to get outside counsel to look at the two Westinghouse  issues we have. Thanks, 	siemens westinghouse damaged generator 
summarize: Hi Paul,  Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form? Looks like we  might have some business. I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had  any comments. I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss  it. How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday? Thanks, 	LM 6000 Transformer Assignments 
summarize: Hi Jeff,  I guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted. I'm at home this am, as I'm on my way to MD Anderson to donate blood for a  friend's son who has leukemia. I don't think it will take too long, but they  don't open until 930. Kay 	enovate Risk Policy 
summarize: Hi Kathy,  Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6  Definitions. I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and  replace of business days for Business Days. 1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of  performance test reports. I think we need a definition that incorporates the  tests listed on Exhibit E.  The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of  the installation option when I did a search. 3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances? Does it matter? 4.3  Delete "Each". 5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option  agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm  interpretting it incorrectly. 5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"  6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller  would be charged interest if not timely paid. 10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?. I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back  option. You should have it today. Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read  before? I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something. Thanks, 	ABB 
summarize: Gloria,  I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded  locally. The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file,  and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe  rev 2). The new document is the one below. Please save the redline verision  in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll,  Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP. Thanks, 	Fuel Cell Purchase Order 
summarize: Hi Jordan,  I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples. Peoples and  Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be  involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities. Each  of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow. It  is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah  Wesner has been involved in the process. Therefore, I thought it would be a  good idea to run this transaction through your group for  blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate. I can give additional  information to whoever you decide should take a look at this. Thanks, 	Enovate 
summarize: Hi Jeff and Barbara,  I would really like to stay where I am, if possible. I like being close to  Suzanne, not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall. Thanks, 	Construction Schedule - Office Moves 
summarize: Eric,  Has this info been provided to Andrews and Kurth yet? It is needed to finish  the facility agreement for the LM's, especially if you are trying to move  these out of the existing contract on Monday. Thanks, 	GE contract for the City of Austin project 
summarize: Hi Carolyn,  Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC:  1. Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the  transformer as well as the turbine? 2. Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload  responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the  equipment, not just the sale. I believe this should be a TEH responsibility. 3. Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and  commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a  reference is fine). 4. Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the  confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement? If fact, please review  the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss  same. 5. Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here. We should  specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed  by a credit worthy entity. 6. Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter  with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the  obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility  agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to  fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing. 7. Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to  convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the  nitty gritty of our financing structure. I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of  where we are headed. Thanks, 	Coral 
summarize: What a great addition to my day. I'm getting close to being finished with the year end crises (I hope I hope I  hope), and I'm looking forward to fuelcelling again. Thanks for being  patient. See you tomorrow. Kay 	Elf shuffleboard 
summarize: Please call Sheila and let her know we've made some progress with GE. Please  see if there is time she wants to talk prior to 300 CST. Thanks, 	Sheila
