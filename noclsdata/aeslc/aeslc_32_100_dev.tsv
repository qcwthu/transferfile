summarize: Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party. Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities. But  before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles  call for a wee bit of polling. Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses  pronto. If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's  out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over. Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all  suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight. Here are the questions:  Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity? Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear  from other folks. If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas  for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome. Same  goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may  influence where we eat). Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys. Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES  and ENA) or confine it to GA? Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA? We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December. What's your  preference. Is there a day that just won't work? Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on. Best, 	That Joyous Time of Year

summarize: Mark, You have been in mind for days, longer in fact. Every time I read about Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to write. Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another, it must be chaotic for you. Let me know how you are and what is happening. No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out of you. We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I am very tired of police check points and ID's. Our building is livable now for about a month, but still behind a barricade. My mother has been in and out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed. I sold a house in KW in late Sept, so came down then for the closing. Hated going back to NY as we were still living in a hotel then.... I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don. Back to NY next week, then here again end of month. Planning a new addition on the house, which is trying. The little house next door is coming up for rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway?? All best, Hal 	How are you ?

summarize: Hope all is well with both of you! As Colin and I discussed, we are looking to place some transportation capacity. In that regard, I offer the attached proposal for your consideration. I believe these transportation paths are a good fit for your needs on PG&E. This proposal offers diversity of supply (Baja and Redwood) for your generation projects on the PG&E system. You would also receive the future benefit of existing tolls relative to incrementally priced expansions.Start date is open for discussion. Please call me as soon as possible - we are going to move fast. Best regards, 	Transport Capacity on El Paso and NOVA/ANG/PGT

summarize: Kim- Here is the August spreadsheet. These are the changes I've made so far:  I changed the formula in column R I added in the new contracts for August  The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs);  It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit. Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for. It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense. I know this is a lot of stuff to look at. If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say. Thanks, 	Palo Alto Invoice--Aug 01.xls

summarize: A follow up to your questions on the accounting for the above:  HPL - when Gosset began marking the position 9\30, our balance sheet gave your book the $33 Million annuity that we held as the difference between the $2.34 (original swap price with B of A) and the market price at the time of the bammel unwind. He obviously needed this amount to keep your book whole when he began marking it. Included in the $33 was the original $1.2      bid\offer spread. On October 1, when Jeff pulled the total marked value off of schedule C and recognized the income, he recognized the bid\offer spread as well. All Accounting looks clean! Pan Nat - The day 1 booking of the arbitration changes resulted in a $18 MM loss that we booked to the office of the chair. Since that time I am told that all of the related resid positions that you now hold are marked everyday and taken into income. Again accounting looks fine. The only two items that remain in the "Wes Colwell" accrual book are the (1) mark of the Napoleonville pad gas and the related hedge (scheduled to begin the withdrawls 8\02) and (2) the hedge of the financial obligation to fill the Enron 1 cavern with financial gas. You locked in the capital contribution for about $20 million with the hedge. The hedge began liquidating in September and we began paying Bridgeline. The payments take place for 4 months.

summarize: "Depillo, Raymond V." <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  A quick question on operations. First, thank you to the ISO for updating the HAM prices. Second - I have a question regarding dispatch. I notice now that HAM prices in NY City are in excess of $1,000. Which to me, given a bid cap, implies that everything capable of running will be dispatched. Yet, when I look at the dispatcher notices, I see that both the Gowanus and Astoria CT blocks are running out of merit for the ISO (note - not local security). How can this be - certainly the HAM prices indicate these units should be running for economics and setting price. I hope we are not going to see the cost of these units in our uplift charges. I look forward to a response from the ISO  Ray 	Real -  Time operations

summarize: Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the  program affect my eligibility for promotion. At the end of last year you  informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid  year review (my 2 year anniversary). It was my impression that the only  reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was  tenure. Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible  for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program. I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this  PRC? Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. Eric Bass x3-0977 	Program Changes

After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space. If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook. The most prominent factors were:  ? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer) ? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features ? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices ? Instant Messaging capabilities  WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000? ? Email Messages. From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook. ? All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in. ? To Do Items ? Journal Items ? Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted. ?

He also said that the bonding company was "rumbling" that it was not going to pay. I do not know what their obligation is to pay, but I would think that "rumbling" is not default, yet.
