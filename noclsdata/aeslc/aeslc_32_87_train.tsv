summarize: Calpine - Meet with Calpine to discuss Red Rock FT.  Calpine has been allocated 33,529 MMBtu out of their 40,000 MMBtu Red Rock contract for receipts from the West Texas Pool. They have indicated this is not satisfactory and may pursue (I'm not sure how) this in the future. We are still working towards designating specific receipt points for their entire MDQ. SoCal - Jeff Dasovitch made initial contact with the CPUC about SoCal's unwillingness to confirm TW volumes at the SoCal Topock point on an alternate basis. He would like TW to continue in its efforts to keep these discussions going as well. (Rick Ishikawa is out on vacation this week and I have a call into him.) This week, Richardson Products contacted So Cal about this issue as well. Calpine is also interested in having the flexibility under its Red Rock contract to deliver gas to Socal Topock (on an alternate basis) and is meeting with SoCal next week and will discuss this with them. OBAs - I have made initial contact with all my volumetric OBA parties to begin discussions on resolving payback and going forward on the tariff OBA. Lorraine 	Bullets

summarize: For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00  for activity for December 22-26, 2000. The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of  $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was  estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint. Specificially the following trades were  transacted over the telephone:  Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor    The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most  companies observed the company holiday on December 26th. As a result,  volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published  a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made  a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period. I  received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing  concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal  activity that transacted on December 22nd. While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online,  from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the  telephone that will impact the Enron Online price. My volume  is a little  over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to  intentionally reporting erroneous information.

summarize: Hi Bart,  I think this is at least close to the final draft. It ain't pretty but it  seemed to work. You won't hurt my feelings if you make massive revisions, so  long as I get a copy of the new-and-improved version. Kay 	equipment option
summarize: I want to ask a question for e:speak today but I don't want my name put on the question. There are some internet gurus working on e:mail from Mars. I would like to know if Enron has plans on getting involved in  interplanetary communication. Tomorrow will be here faster than you think! Thank you for your valued and important time and my privacy.

The reason I ask is on the trading floor the workspaces are very small, and there is no room whatsoever for books (eg, econometrics texts). I think this revives the issue of a library.

The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state  of Colorado. This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use  as a result of  a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin. 	Weekly Report, Roswell Area
summarize: CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas  Eastern. CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is  giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2. According to my new  best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the  January transaction is complete. Here are my questions/comments;  1. David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal  146788). The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange. I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC. If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the  new deal. Please let me know ASAP. 2. Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable? I would like to  see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment  was due. 3. David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it  above, where do we put the $.65 fee at? 4. Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES  deals. He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America. Who  should he talk to about that?? Please forward this email to others that may need to see it. Thanks 	Equitabel Gas Company Exchange on Tetco

summarize: Michelle,  We enjoyed the meeting with Transwestern and appreciate your support for our Plan of Reorganization. We are still looking at a purchase of pipeline capacity from PG&E Topock to your connection with the South Point Power Plant. The timing has changed from when we met in Houston. At this time, we will not be including this contract and service to South Point in our FERC filing. However, we would like you to review the following proposal. 50,000 dth/day of firm capacity on the Transwestern system from PG&E Topock to the Calpine South Point Power Plant. The price is to be $0.05 per dth consisting of $1.395 per dth-month reservation fee and $0.0042 per dth volumetric charge. The contract will start with CGT acceptance of the FERC Certificate and continue to the end date of the Calpine contract, which is the start of our Section 4 rates. We anticipate acceptance of the FERC Certificate at the end of 2002. Our Section 4 rates would start mid to late 2004. The start of the contract is contingent on the following conditions; PG&E is issued and accepts an FERC Certificate, PG&E is allowed by the FERC to amend the delivery points in the tariff to include the South Point Power Plant and PG&E has a contract with Calpine for deliveries to South Point. Please let me know what you think 	Pipeline Capacity

ER01-3013-000 and ER01 889-009 Compliance Filing 		Changes to Provision of Data to CERS 		Modification to November 30, 2001 Market Notice Modified Implementation Schedule  - Changes to Provision of Data to CERS ISO Market Participants: On Friday, November 30, the ISO issued a market notice providing the ISO's schedule for complying with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") November 7 and 20, 2001 orders, that require the ISO, among other things, to stop providing information to the California Department of Water Services, California Energy Resource Scheduling ("CERS") which is not also provided to other Scheduling Coordinators ("SCs"). The ISO has accomplished all milestones as listed through December 3, 2001. The transition planned on December 6 has been shifted until next week. The ISO is making every effort to insure that the transition is a smooth one and seeks some additional time to work with the resources in the California market to gain their cooperation with provision of inc and dec bids at reasonable prices. Specifically the items that were listed in Item 4 of the November 30 market notice to begin at HE 2400 on December 6, 2001 will now occur at 23:59 Wednesday night December 12, 2001. They include:   a. The ISO will halt the preferential provision to CERS of the ISO Forecasted net short in the BEEP Stack; b.	CERS will no longer engage in OOM purchases; and c.	The ISO will dispatch all available Energy from bids in the BEEP Stack for both resources prior to the ISO making OOM purchases.

I went on a field trip with Taylor yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time. Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday but she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either. Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to you. Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer at 4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email address I have one for her too? 	Hi
