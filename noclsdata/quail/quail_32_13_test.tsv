How long was Candy trying to seduce Larry?(A)about 10 minutes(B)about 2 hours(C)not enough information(D)All day [SEP] Candy watched the bearded man drive his silver BMW into the convenience store parking lot and pull around to the side, near the back corner of the building. There were plenty of open slots in the front, so she figured the guy was there for something other than a bag of chips and a coke. A chilly breeze blew up her mini-skirt and she shivered. She pressed her legs together tightly to generate some heat. The knee-high boots protected her feet and calves, but her butt was freezing off. She wrote down the license number as she circled around to the side of the expensive vehicle. He'll have a big wad of cash, she thought. Larry Luzor had just stepped out of the car, when she said, "Nice car, Honey." "Uh, thanks." "I'm Candy. You got a sweet tooth tonight?" He gave her the once over. Her black hair framed a pretty, young-looking face. The low-cut blouse left little to the imagination, barely hiding her nipples. She was average height, but the high heel boots elevated her to about 5'8". The long legs were very nice. Larry had never used a prostitute. He'd always thought of it as revolting. The idea of having sex with a woman who'd been with hundreds of men did not appeal to him. But this didn't seem like a typical hooker. She seemed too clean--almost pure. But of course, she wasn't. He knew she had to be just as skanky as the rest of them. Still--if he hadn't been in the middle of something important he might have been more than willing to buy what she was selling. "So, what do you say? Want to get it on?" She smiled seductively. He was impressed that she had all her teeth, and that they looked white. "How can I resist?" He grinned at her and winked.	about 10 minutes

He knew she had to be just as skanky as the rest of them. Still--if he hadn't been in the middle of something important he might have been more than willing to buy what she was selling. "So, what do you say? Want to get it on?" She smiled seductively. He was impressed that she had all her teeth, and that they looked white. "How can I resist?" He grinned at her and winked.

When Larry klicked "Publish"?(A)After he finished his fiction story.(B)not enough information(C)While he was communicating with some of the readers(D)Before he made changes to the original plot [SEP] Larry sat down at his laptop and logged in as Barry Undermine to complete another chapter of his serial novel, Illusion of Luck. He jittered with excitement at the realization of what he had just done. His clothing reeked of smoke from Erin's incineration. Hopefully by morning her remains would fit in an urn. But she didn't deserve one. So instead, he would dump her ashes into the rusty 55-gallon garbage drum on the other side of the dirt road. His brain articulated the scene at hyper-speed, overloading his sixty-words-per-minute hands. It was so easy--just like the murder. Wait. Not that easy, he thought. It wasn't as though he was simply taking dictation. No, not at all. He was a craftsman, an artist. He had six novels worth of experience under his belt. This time his writing was much better--but only because he had a better story idea. It was still fiction. He was taking a different approach to his writing--making it up as he went along instead of preparing a detailed story outline and following it to the letter. For this book, lucky number seven, he only had a rough sketch of the plot. His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene. But now the original plot would never make it into the book. Real life had given him better ideas. He typed the last word of the chapter and clicked 'Publish.'

After the end of the story, Larry:(A)not enough information(B)Waiting for a feedback(C)Calling Erin(D)Starts writing a new movie [SEP] Larry sat down at his laptop and logged in as Barry Undermine to complete another chapter of his serial novel, Illusion of Luck. He jittered with excitement at the realization of what he had just done. His clothing reeked of smoke from Erin's incineration. Hopefully by morning her remains would fit in an urn. But she didn't deserve one. So instead, he would dump her ashes into the rusty 55-gallon garbage drum on the other side of the dirt road. His brain articulated the scene at hyper-speed, overloading his sixty-words-per-minute hands. It was so easy--just like the murder. Wait. Not that easy, he thought. It wasn't as though he was simply taking dictation. No, not at all. He was a craftsman, an artist. He had six novels worth of experience under his belt. This time his writing was much better--but only because he had a better story idea. It was still fiction. He was taking a different approach to his writing--making it up as he went along instead of preparing a detailed story outline and following it to the letter. For this book, lucky number seven, he only had a rough sketch of the plot. His original plot had called for his main character to confront his girlfriend about her affairs, and get into a nasty court battle over money. Then he would murder her and somehow get away with it and live happily ever after in Tahiti. Until the girlfriend's father, an ex-Navy Seal, tracked him down and killed him in the final scene. But now the original plot would never make it into the book. Real life had given him better ideas. He typed the last word of the chapter and clicked 'Publish.' Let's see how they like this one, he thought. Some of his readers had already signed up for instant email notification. So, it wouldn't be long before they'd be reading about the girlfriend's terrible demise.	Waiting for a feedback
Why was the principal upset?(A)Because it was warm for February.(B)He wanted to go fishing.(C)Jim took the kids out of school to go fishing.(D)not enough information [SEP] It was about 7:00 PM, and pitch black. As far as Larry could tell, there was no moonlight at all. The gas pole lamp provided just enough illumination for nighttime barbecuing. But now that his eyes had adjusted to it, he could barely see anything else. His only real point of reference was the light coming from the cabin windows. Without it, he could imagine himself getting lost and walking right into Lake Texoma. He figured the temperature to be around 50 degrees. Probably about average for late February, he thought. He wasn't wearing a jacket, but felt plenty of warmth from the hot barbecue pit. "Catch any big ones?" A deep voice boomed from somewhere out in the darkness. Larry jumped. The man's voice was approaching. "Me and my boys pulled in quite a haul today. I caught me an 8 lb. largemouth bass." Larry strained to see the man, but couldn't. For all he could tell, it could have been a ghost, floating around in the darkness. "Something smells good." A big plaid shirt materialized at his side, and Larry jumped. Then he saw the jeans and the boots, and looked up to see the face. The guy was huge. "Hi. My name is Jim." He grabbed Larry's hand and gave it a bone-crushing shake. "Me and Barb brought my three boys up for a long weekend of fishing. Yeah, I know what you're thinking: shouldn't them boys be in school? Nope.

He didn't like it one bit, and he got all huffy with me. But I told him I didn't give a durn what he thought. Sure, they gotta learn their three R's: reading, writing and 'rithmetic.

Without it, he could imagine himself getting lost and walking right into Lake Texoma. He figured the temperature to be around 50 degrees. Probably about average for late February, he thought. He wasn't wearing a jacket, but felt plenty of warmth from the hot barbecue pit. "Catch any big ones?" A deep voice boomed from somewhere out in the darkness. Larry jumped. The man's voice was approaching. "Me and my boys pulled in quite a haul today. I caught me an 8 lb. largemouth bass." Larry strained to see the man, but couldn't. For all he could tell, it could have been a ghost, floating around in the darkness. "Something smells good." A big plaid shirt materialized at his side, and Larry jumped. Then he saw the jeans and the boots, and looked up to see the face. The guy was huge. "Hi. My name is Jim." He grabbed Larry's hand and gave it a bone-crushing shake. "Me and Barb brought my three boys up for a long weekend of fishing. Yeah, I know what you're thinking: shouldn't them boys be in school? Nope. Cause I sent a note to their principal explaining how this is a part of the boys' education. Know what I mean, Guy?" "Yeah...sure." "Well, the principal didn't like it. He didn't like it one bit, and he got all huffy with me. But I told him I didn't give a durn what he thought. Sure, they gotta learn their three R's: reading, writing and 'rithmetic. Everybody knows that. But you gotta have some balance in life. Know what I mean?"	He will invite Jim and his family to eat with him.

"Who's that?" "It's a girl I went to high school with." "What about the guy?" Larry didn't answer. He just puffed on his pipe. Erin backed away. She hated his smoking, but he didn't care.

Cynthia was a strikingly beautiful 30-year-old redhead. He wouldn't have been surprised if Cupid himself had flown in to break up the crazy mismatch. But Cynthia saw something in Greg she couldn't resist. Something she should have looked for in the eyes of her first groom. Troy was a rugged, handsome man. Nothing wrong with that.

Cynthia was a strikingly beautiful 30-year-old redhead. He wouldn't have been surprised if Cupid himself had flown in to break up the crazy mismatch. But Cynthia saw something in Greg she couldn't resist. Something she should have looked for in the eyes of her first groom. Troy was a rugged, handsome man. Nothing wrong with that. But he was also an abuser. And all the love he'd ever given her meant nothing after that first brutal slap across the face. Then came the boozing and hitting and steady barrage of obscenities. So, this time around Cynthia was looking for something different. Greg was kind and thoughtful and funny. And regardless of what Greg thought, she did find him attractive--even on their first meeting. And the more she got to know him, the more attractive he became. She wasn't marrying him just because he was a nice guy. She truly had the hots for him. It was Thursday night, 6:20 PM. Greg and Cynthia were finishing up a run-through of the ceremony at First Baptist Church, Coreyville, where Greg was part-time music director. They were well on their way to happily ever after. Everything was perfect. Until the phone call. Cynthia's mother, Beverly, was serving as her Maid of Honor. She had girlfriends her age at First State Bank where she was a vice president. But her mom was her closest friend. It might have seemed a little odd to some people--no mother sitting on the second pew, crying. No father to walk her down the aisle and give her away. She wished so much he was still alive to share in the joy.	He was practicing for his upcoming wedding

What did Marcus do immediately after grabbing his bag?(A)Closed his laptop three-quarters shut(B)Rolled his eyes at Ms Galvez(C)Stopped his downloads(D)not enough information [SEP] I'm a senior at Cesar Chavez high in San Francisco's sunny Mission district, and that makes me one of the most surveilled people in the world. My name is Marcus Yallow, but back when this story starts, I was going by w1n5t0n. Pronounced "Winston." Not pronounced "Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn" -- unless you're a clueless disciplinary officer who's far enough behind the curve that you still call the Internet "the information superhighway." I know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson, one of three vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He's a sucking chest wound of a human being. But if you're going to have a jailer, better a clueless one than one who's really on the ball. "Marcus Yallow," he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA isn't very good to begin with, and when you combine that with Benson's habitual mumble, you get something that sounds more like someone struggling to digest a bad burrito than a school announcement. But human beings are good at picking their names out of audio confusion -- it's a survival trait. I grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut -- I didn't want to blow my downloads -- and got ready for the inevitable. "Report to the administration office immediately." My social studies teacher, Ms Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and I rolled my eyes back at her. The Man was always coming down on me, just because I go through school firewalls like wet kleenex, spoof the gait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they track us with. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me (especially when I'm helping get with her webmail so she can talk to her brother who's stationed in Iraq).

I know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson, one of three vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He's a sucking chest wound of a human being. But if you're going to have a jailer, better a clueless one than one who's really on the ball. "Marcus Yallow," he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA isn't very good to begin with, and when you combine that with Benson's habitual mumble, you get something that sounds more like someone struggling to digest a bad burrito than a school announcement. But human beings are good at picking their names out of audio confusion -- it's a survival trait. I grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut -- I didn't want to blow my downloads -- and got ready for the inevitable. "Report to the administration office immediately." My social studies teacher, Ms Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and I rolled my eyes back at her. The Man was always coming down on me, just because I go through school firewalls like wet kleenex, spoof the gait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they track us with. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me (especially when I'm helping get with her webmail so she can talk to her brother who's stationed in Iraq).

Who else belived to be one of the prisoners in the truck?(A)not enough information(B)Darryl.(C)The narrator's father.(D)The narrator's mother. [SEP] I actually managed a kind of sleep there, kneeling with the circulation cut off to my legs, my head in canvas twilight. My body had squirted a year's supply of adrenalin into my bloodstream in the space of 30 minutes, and while that stuff can give you the strength to lift cars off your loved ones and leap over tall buildings, the payback's always a bitch. I woke up to someone pulling the hood off my head. They were neither rough nor careful -- just...impersonal. Like someone at McDonald's putting together burgers. The light in the room was so bright I had to squeeze my eyes shut, but slowly I was able to open them to slits, then cracks, then all the way and look around. We were all in the back of a truck, a big 16-wheeler. I could see the wheel-wells at regular intervals down the length. But the back of this truck had been turned into some kind of mobile command-post/jail. Steel desks lined the walls with banks of slick flat-panel displays climbing above them on articulated arms that let them be repositioned in a halo around the operators. Each desk had a gorgeous office-chair in front of it, festooned with user-interface knobs for adjusting every millimeter of the sitting surface, as well as height, pitch and yaw. Then there was the jail part -- at the front of the truck, furthest away from the doors, there were steel rails bolted into the sides of the vehicle, and attached to these steel rails were the prisoners. I spotted Van and Jolu right away. Darryl might have been in the remaining dozen shackled up back here, but it was impossible to say -- many of them were slumped over and blocking my view. It stank of sweat and fear back there. Vanessa looked at me and bit her lip. She was scared. So was I. So was Jolu, his eyes rolling crazily in their sockets, the whites showing. I was scared. What's more, I had to piss like a race-horse.	Darryl.

We were all in the back of a truck, a big 16-wheeler. I could see the wheel-wells at regular intervals down the length. But the back of this truck had been turned into some kind of mobile command-post/jail.

Each desk had a gorgeous office-chair in front of it, festooned with user-interface knobs for adjusting every millimeter of the sitting surface, as well as height, pitch and yaw. Then there was the jail part -- at the front of the truck, furthest away from the doors, there were steel rails bolted into the sides of the vehicle, and attached to these steel rails were the prisoners. I spotted Van and Jolu right away. Darryl might have been in the remaining dozen shackled up back here, but it was impossible to say -- many of them were slumped over and blocking my view.

Who was the only people to speak with him all day in Oakland?(A)not enough information(B)Jehovah's Witness and a Scientologist(C)Women(D)Businessmen [SEP] That afternoon, Van left school as usual, sitting in the back of the bus with a tight knot of her friends, laughing and joking the way she always did. The other riders on the bus took special note of her, she was so loud, and besides, she was wearing that stupid, giant floppy hat, something that looked like a piece out of a school play about Renaissance sword fighters. At one point they all huddled together, then turned away to look out the back of the bus, pointing and giggling. The girl who wore the hat now was the same height as Van, and from behind, it could be her. No one paid any attention to the mousy little Asian girl who got off a few stops before the BART. She was dressed in a plain old school uniform, and looking down shyly as she stepped off. Besides, at that moment, the loud Korean girl let out a whoop and her friends followed along, laughing so loudly that even the bus driver slowed down, twisted in his seat and gave them a dirty look. Van hurried away down the street with her head down, her hair tied back and dropped down the collar of her out-of-style bubble jacket. She had slipped lifts into her shoes that made her two wobbly, awkward inches taller, and had taken her contacts out and put on her least-favored glasses, with huge lenses that took up half her face. Although I'd been waiting in the bus-shelter for her and knew when to expect her, I hardly recognized her. I got up and walked along behind her, across the street, trailing by half a block. The people who passed me looked away as quickly as possible. I looked like a homeless kid, with a grubby cardboard sign, street-grimy overcoat, huge, overstuffed knapsack with duct-tape over its rips. No one wants to look at a street-kid, because if you meet his eye, he might ask you for some spare change. I'd walked around Oakland all afternoon and the only person who'd spoken to me was a Jehovah's Witness and a Scientologist, both trying to convert me. It felt gross, like being hit on by a pervert.

"Johnny, where did the acid that was on my dresser go?" "I sold it. Isn't that the fucking point? Maybe I've been wrong about this whole process from the start, but aren't we trying to make money here? If you want me to stop selling the fucking drugs, you should tell me now so I can go back to watching my fucking movie." Johnny and Lyle were actually very good friends and usually interacted with one another in only the most polite and cordial manner. Johnny however, was more than a little drunk; and Lyle-- Well, Lyle knew something of great import that Johnny did not. But that was about to change.	Johnny or Lyle
Why Johnny was annoyed(A)Lyle broght Acid and Orange Juice(B)Lyle interapted his movie(C)He was out of Orange Juice and Beer(D)not enough information [SEP] Three weeks earlier, Johnny poured himself another drink. He had worked his way through the four beers in the fridge over the course of an hour and had started in on the pure ethanol he and Lyle used as a solvent. You couldn't drink it straight of course, unless you wanted to dissolve your taste buds, but it went nicely with orange juice. When Johnny drank, he had something of a nasty tendency to do so alone. This tendency was nasty only in a social sense, of course. Johnny was by no means an alcoholic, nor was he a violent or melancholy drunk. It just so happened that in early twenty-first century North America, the entire society was fostering the illusion that ethanol was not a drug. Johnny however had no delusions concerning his status as a user of drugs. As it happened Johnny wasn't truly drinking alone that night. Well, he was alone in drinking, but not in the apartment.

Lyle probably likes what kind of music?(A)Gospel Hymns(B)not enough information(C)Only Sousa Marches(D)Punk rock [SEP] Lyle and Johnny had met in Intro to Psych. Neither of them completed the course. Johnny was taking it because he was in first year and still believed that University life was about becoming an educated person rather than about getting in, getting out and getting paid. As such he had signed up for Intro to Psych and Intro to Advanced Physics as the two first year electives in his Computer Science Degree rather than the much more traditional Intro to Logic (which anyone who knows the difference between if and iff can ace) and Science and Society (which gets you your humanities requirement without having to actually take a humanities courses). Lyle's reasons for being in the course were much more mysterious. Johnny noticed him straight off: The punker with the green mohawk sitting just to the left of centre in Convocation Hall, where PSY 100 was held. It was a 9am Monday morning class, the first university class in the lives of most of the students. Yet Lyle did not have the same air of trepidation about him that hovered over the rest of those in attendance. He sat calmly with his Docs up on the back of the seat in front of him, knitting. Whereas almost everyone else in the hall (Johnny included, he was embarrassed to later recall) had brought with them a shiny new binder bought at Wal-Mart (or Grand and Toy for the rich kids) and a pencil case with not only pencils and erasers but pens in blue, black and red, Lyle had three sheets of folded paper which had clearly been pulled from his pockets minutes earlier and a red Bic pen without a cap sitting on his fold-down desk. The instructor was a frightened looking graduate student named Mohammed Haj-Mosawi who spoke English with a very thick accent and did so in a voice that would have been rather too quiet for polite dinner conversation, never mind lecturing to 800 students. He did however, come armed with some pretty serious PowerPoint slides.	Punk rock

As such he had signed up for Intro to Psych and Intro to Advanced Physics as the two first year electives in his Computer Science Degree rather than the much more traditional Intro to Logic (which anyone who knows the difference between if and iff can ace) and Science and Society (which gets you your humanities requirement without having to actually take a humanities courses). Lyle's reasons for being in the course were much more mysterious.

It was a 9am Monday morning class, the first university class in the lives of most of the students. Yet Lyle did not have the same air of trepidation about him that hovered over the rest of those in attendance. He sat calmly with his Docs up on the back of the seat in front of him, knitting. Whereas almost everyone else in the hall (Johnny included, he was embarrassed to later recall) had brought with them a shiny new binder bought at Wal-Mart (or Grand and Toy for the rich kids) and a pencil case with not only pencils and erasers but pens in blue, black and red, Lyle had three sheets of folded paper which had clearly been pulled from his pockets minutes earlier and a red Bic pen without a cap sitting on his fold-down desk. The instructor was a frightened looking graduate student named Mohammed Haj-Mosawi who spoke English with a very thick accent and did so in a voice that would have been rather too quiet for polite dinner conversation, never mind lecturing to 800 students. He did however, come armed with some pretty serious PowerPoint slides.	To take notes.

She was sitting naked at his desk, the second bottle of wine half-empty between her knees: "Reading your Internet history files." Like a shot, Johnny was bolt upright in his bed: "What?!" "Don't get your panties in a bunch," Tinka laughed, "Best way in the world to get to know someone, saves us a lot of trouble. You shouldn't talk about drugs on MSN though, and you certainly shouldn't track your drug-dealing profits in a spreadsheet." Defensive now, Johnny said: "It's not like I labeled the columns Cocaine and Marijuana." "Yeah, but what else could it possibly be. Four hundred units at two dollars fifty purchased. Thirty-one units overhead. Three hundred and sixty nine units at five dollars sold. Eight hundred and forty-five dollars gross profits. Good luck convincing a judge you're talking about magazine subscriptions." "Listen," Johnny said, "I know what I'm doing."

Who was transformed from an intimidating Asian punker?(A)a beautiful woman(B)Tinka(C)not enough information(D)Bettie Page [SEP] Johnny was too curious not to show up. He arrived at Annesley Hall at five minutes to seven in the nicest outfit he owned: a slick black three piece suit with a cobalt blue high necked shirt and no tie. He had bought it for his high school formal-- with drug money. Tinka was waiting for him on the stairs. He didn't recognize her at first, but when he did it almost bowled him over. She had transformed from an intimidating Asian punker girl into the most beautiful woman he had ever seen by simply putting on a dress and a hat. The dress was a long form fitting red silk evening gown with red sequins and the hat was black and feathered and pinned into her hair, which looked downright aristocratic despite the fact that it peeked out wildly in red, black and blue around the edges. She also wore a black mink scarf that would have looked absurd on anyone but her. Johnny was just about to tell her that she looked amazing, but she beat him to the punch: "Good Evening Dr. Page, you're looking sharp tonight." "Sorry?" was the only thing Johnny could think of to say. "You are Dr. Edward Emmanuel Page and I am your wife Bettie," she replied, checking her makeup in a compact mirror. "Bettie Page?" "Only by marriage, now come on." She shoved the mirror back into her purse and led him into the building. They ascended the stairs toward the main hall. "Nice dress," Johnny said from two stairs behind and below Tinka. "Thanks. Stole it from a costume rental shop." As she said this, Tinka turned and made eye contact with Johnny. It was then that he noticed that her eyes were just as wild and fiery as they had been the day before. It made her look less like a respectable aristocratic lady and rather quite a bit more like a walking time bomb in an evening gown.	Tinka

Sitting up, he took in his surroundings. At least that much of what he remembered from the previous night seemed to correspond to reality. Night? The sun had still been high when Tinka had found him. He could only have been four or five hours into his trip. There is no way he should have been able to sleep. "Here. Swallow this," his memory provided. A pill! Had he been poisoned? He patted his chest and stomach with both hands as though that would give him a clue. No, it suddenly occurred to him; not poisoned, sedated. Remembering a clock, he looked up. To its face there was affixed a note: Johnny, be gone by dawn. Take the note with you. -Tinka Detaching the note from the face of the clock, Johnny learnt that it was three o'clock (in the morning he could only assume). Johnny looked again at the picture next to the clock and in a moment of uncharacteristic jealousy wanted to leave the note behind so that the man in the picture might find it.

There is a tiny claustrophobe hiding inside of every person and the one in Johnny was threatening to start pumping his lungs. Quickly he reached behind his head to where he vaguely remembered there being a lamp. After a few seconds of fumbling he managed to turn it on. The room burst into light. Sitting up, he took in his surroundings. At least that much of what he remembered from the previous night seemed to correspond to reality. Night? The sun had still been high when Tinka had found him. He could only have been four or five hours into his trip. There is no way he should have been able to sleep. "Here. Swallow this," his memory provided. A pill! Had he been poisoned? He patted his chest and stomach with both hands as though that would give him a clue. No, it suddenly occurred to him; not poisoned, sedated. Remembering a clock, he looked up. To its face there was affixed a note: Johnny, be gone by dawn. Take the note with you. -Tinka Detaching the note from the face of the clock, Johnny learnt that it was three o'clock (in the morning he could only assume). Johnny looked again at the picture next to the clock and in a moment of uncharacteristic jealousy wanted to leave the note behind so that the man in the picture might find it. This urge passed and he gathered his skateboard from the floor and his binder from what passed for a desk. He looked around once more before leaving and resisted the temptation to rifle through Tinka's things. He pushed open the door and was surprised to find that it did in fact open up onto an extremely narrow passage with an identical doorway proclaiming 1959 directly across the way.

How long is the Ferry ride from Peaks Island probably will take?(A)not enough information(B)10 minutes(C)1-2 hours(D)6 hours [SEP] Spring comes late in Maine. Snow changes to rain; branch tips redden; you can see your breath. Not a whole lot different than winter until the daffodils, crab apples, and forsythia bloom. The sun skips off the water, impossibly bright, impossibly blue. You can almost almost hear the cracking of seeds, buried and forgotten. Charlie Garrett was as hardnosed as most. He kept going, did what he had to. "Ninety percent of success is showing up," Woody Allen said. Charlie repeated that in dire times--before medical checkups or visits to his brother, Orson. Orson knew a lot about success and never hesitated to pass it on. "What you need, Charlie, is a Cessna. You aren't supposed to spin them, but you can. That'll clear your head, Charlie, straight down, counting as a barn comes around--one time, two times, three times--correct and pull out nice and easy." Orson dipped his knees, lowering his flattened palm. Or a catboat: "A solid little Marshall, Charlie. Putter around, take some cutie coasting. You're in sailor heaven, man, all those islands." "I know some cuties," Miranda had said. "Last cutie took my silver garlic press. Well, she didn't take it; she borrowed it and never returned it." "Call her up and get it back," Orson said. "That's what she wants you to do." Miranda was the best thing about Orson. "I got another one." "Where the hell did you find a silver garlic press?" Orson was impressed. "It's aluminum, I think, or a composite material." "Oh." It was always like that; motion was Orson's answer to everything. Charlie stretched and checked his watch. The ten o'clock ferry from Peaks Island was edging to the dock. Soon a few dozen passengers would walk off the ramp, carrying shopping bags, slipping day packs over one or both shoulders, holding dogs on leashes. Margery, short and polite, would be toward the end of the line, one hand on the railing, blinking as she looked up at the city buildings and around for him.	1-2 hours

Snow changes to rain; branch tips redden; you can see your breath. Not a whole lot different than winter until the daffodils, crab apples, and forsythia bloom. The sun skips off the water, impossibly bright, impossibly blue. You can almost almost hear the cracking of seeds, buried and forgotten. Charlie Garrett was as hardnosed as most. He kept going, did what he had to. "Ninety percent of success is showing up," Woody Allen said. Charlie repeated that in dire times--before medical checkups or visits to his brother, Orson. Orson knew a lot about success and never hesitated to pass it on. "What you need, Charlie, is a Cessna. You aren't supposed to spin them, but you can. That'll clear your head, Charlie, straight down, counting as a barn comes around--one time, two times, three times--correct and pull out nice and easy." Orson dipped his knees, lowering his flattened palm. Or a catboat: "A solid little Marshall, Charlie. Putter around, take some cutie coasting. You're in sailor heaven, man, all those islands." "I know some cuties," Miranda had said. "Last cutie took my silver garlic press. Well, she didn't take it; she borrowed it and never returned it." "Call her up and get it back," Orson said. "That's what she wants you to do." Miranda was the best thing about Orson. "I got another one." "Where the hell did you find a silver garlic press?" Orson was impressed. "It's aluminum, I think, or a composite material." "Oh." It was always like that; motion was Orson's answer to everything. Charlie stretched and checked his watch. The ten o'clock ferry from Peaks Island was edging to the dock.

What types of pictures does the writer have?(A)Three in fog, two in sun(B)not enough information(C)One in fog, one in sun(D)Two in fog, two in sun [SEP] I have these pictures--two in fog, two in sun. Fog: a man in a deck chair is playing a trumpet, his feet on the stern railing of a ferry. Fog: a telephone pole seen through a windshield. Sun: a young woman on a bicycle is climbing a cobblestoned street, blonde hair bouncing, white blouse, solid breasts. Sun: a snake falling back to the bank of a stream, a dragonfly in its mouth, dazzling, iridescent. Put in a certain order, riffled through, they make a silent movie--until sounds grow more insistent. A Jeep honks twice, accelerating past the biker, driver and passenger turning to look. She ignores them. She doesn't notice me watching from a doorway. I suppose my heart leaping toward her made no sound. She was locked into my blood and bone before I knew any words for her, her name even. The shock of recognition left me wide-eyed and strangely blind. Nothing would be seen for itself, only in terms of her--whether she was there or not, how likely it was that she might appear, how not her everything else. Nantucket is ten miles long with one central town. I worked in a restaurant on the main street. The following day I saw her stop at a bakery/cafe which became my hangout. When she came in again, my throat went dry and my knees shook. I don't remember what I first said to her, but she responded to some sort of signal. She was willing for me to pay more attention. We began to meet in the cafe. It is hard not to put what I know now into what I knew then. I presented what plumage I had--no money, but a small currency of integrity. I had survived childhood by learning to please. Eventually, I could no longer do that and I started over, was reborn at nineteen. While I was only five, by that count, when Jamie (her name) pedaled up the main street of Nantucket, I was uncompromised; I offered myself for whatever waited inside that white blouse.

We began to meet in the cafe. It is hard not to put what I know now into what I knew then. I presented what plumage I had--no money, but a small currency of integrity. I had survived childhood by learning to please. Eventually, I could no longer do that and I started over, was reborn at nineteen. While I was only five, by that count, when Jamie (her name) pedaled up the main street of Nantucket, I was uncompromised; I offered myself for whatever waited inside that white blouse.	He was shy.

A Jeep honks twice, accelerating past the biker, driver and passenger turning to look. She ignores them. She doesn't notice me watching from a doorway. I suppose my heart leaping toward her made no sound. She was locked into my blood and bone before I knew any words for her, her name even.

When he first saw her
Who was Martin hard on?(A)not enough information(B)Penn(C)Arthur's grandmother(D)Arthur [SEP] At the sound of wooden blocks struck together, Arthur adjusted his sitting position and emptied his mind. The echo diminished to a memory and changed to a tree. A palm tree. Not this again. An expanse of empty beach curved to a familiar headland. Sometimes his grandmother would appear, coming toward him on her fitness walk, legs moving quickly, scarcely bending at the knees, like the birds that chased and retreated at the water's edge. She never noticed him. This morning Penn stepped from the water and approached, his long thin body tanned ivory brown, his eyes blue-green, clear as a cat's. Things came easy to Penn. Arthur exhaled the past and inhaled it again. Not that way, he told himself. No struggle. Let it float away. He straightened and followed his breathing. Penn disappeared as casually as he had twenty years ago. Arthur put his cheek against the palm tree. The bark was like cloth, raspy and flexible, wrapped around and around the heart of the tree. Someday, years of balmy weather would be violently interrupted. This tree, which grew in sand, would have to bend horizontal or be uprooted. Arthur exhaled the satisfaction that attended this insight. No attachment. When the blocks sounded again, he stood and walked with the others around the zendo, careful not to look at Martin for approval. He wasn't sure why Martin was hard on him. Martin was enlightened, but wisdom hadn't erased narrow lines in his face, resentful lines. Arthur was respected in the scientific community, well paid. Martin had been an insurance adjuster or something before he found his vocation. He had shaved his head, but the cheap haircut remained. The blocks signalled and sitting resumed, the group settling into a shared breathing. A quiet euphoria rose and faded, replaced by an edgy pre-verbal clarity. Kwok! Over. Arthur rejoined the world of choice and demand. He felt that he was making progress.	Arthur

Arthur exhaled the past and inhaled it again. Not that way, he told himself. No struggle. Let it float away. He straightened and followed his breathing. Penn disappeared as casually as he had twenty years ago. Arthur put his cheek against the palm tree. The bark was like cloth, raspy and flexible, wrapped around and around the heart of the tree. Someday, years of balmy weather would be violently interrupted. This tree, which grew in sand, would have to bend horizontal or be uprooted. Arthur exhaled the satisfaction that attended this insight. No attachment. When the blocks sounded again, he stood and walked with the others around the zendo, careful not to look at Martin for approval. He wasn't sure why Martin was hard on him. Martin was enlightened, but wisdom hadn't erased narrow lines in his face, resentful lines. Arthur was respected in the scientific community, well paid. Martin had been an insurance adjuster or something before he found his vocation. He had shaved his head, but the cheap haircut remained.

What is probably Don's character trait?(A)Selfish(B)Greedy(C)not enough information(D)Kind [SEP] It dawned hot in Georgia. Don rubbed his head and blinked. He got out of bed and paused before a makeshift easel where a drawing, taped to a board, showed a woman sitting on a park bench. She was large, dressed in layers of multi-colored cotton. She reminded him of the Renoir woman in her plush living room, the dog sprawled at her feet, but she was smarter. The line across her eyebrows and tapering along her jaw was right. He'd left out a lot, but that didn't matter. If what was there was true enough, you knew the rest--like a Michelangelo shoulder emerging from stone. He went into the bathroom and splashed water on his face. After coffee and a piece of toast, he rolled the drawing and took it to the park where the woman fed pigeons every day. She wasn't there. She wasn't there the next day, either. The following day Don brought a loaf of bread, sat on her bench, and tossed white pellets into the air. Birds fought for each piece. He prepared the remaining bread and scattered it in one throw. "There you go--something for everybody. She'll be back soon." A week later, she showed up. Don moved aside and asked, "Where you been?" "Took sick." "I've been feeding the pigeons." "I was worrying. Thank you." "I did a drawing of you. I wanted to name it, but--I didn't know your name." "Ruby." "Ruby, ah. I'm Don. You want to see it? I'll bring it tomorrow." "Sure." "O.K. How you feeling?" "Better, now." "Good." He walked to his usual bench and sat down. The sun beat on the live oak trees and sage-green strings of Spanish moss while the birds made happy sounds in front of Ruby. She had lost weight, he thought, but it was hard to tell, the way she dressed. She was a beauty once. He remembered his bloodshot eyes in the bathroom mirror. None of us getting any younger. He would give her the drawing in the morning and take off. It was time to leave Savannah, past time. Head for Portland again. Look up Lorna.	Kind

Why did Cat shiver?(A)not enough information(B)She was trying to wake up Tarika.(C)She was scared.(D)It was a cool morning. [SEP] Cat woke in darkness. Something had changed. Something was new and different and strange. She glanced at the window. The stars were bright above the streetlights. A raven flew away from the sill with a soft fluttering. That wasn't what woke her. Ravens often perched on the tower of Casa Medianoche. She sat up, shivering as the blanket slid from her shoulders. The shadows in her room were familiar. The high posts of the old Spanish bed that had been her mother's had never frightened her--when she was little, her father had said they were guards named John, Paul, George, and Ringo who would protect her from any closet monster. The antique wardrobe was big enough to hide serial killers, but only if they threw out half her collection of old costumes and games. The hulking shape in the far corner was the ancient desk that had been her mother's, now topped with a computer that had been her father's.

Immediately after the end of this story, Cat and Tarika probably:(A)will remain best friends(B)get in fight and never speak again(C)find out they are actually siblings(D)not enough information [SEP] Cat woke in darkness. Something had changed. Something was new and different and strange. She glanced at the window. The stars were bright above the streetlights. A raven flew away from the sill with a soft fluttering. That wasn't what woke her. Ravens often perched on the tower of Casa Medianoche. She sat up, shivering as the blanket slid from her shoulders. The shadows in her room were familiar. The high posts of the old Spanish bed that had been her mother's had never frightened her--when she was little, her father had said they were guards named John, Paul, George, and Ringo who would protect her from any closet monster. The antique wardrobe was big enough to hide serial killers, but only if they threw out half her collection of old costumes and games. The hulking shape in the far corner was the ancient desk that had been her mother's, now topped with a computer that had been her father's. The squatting shape in the near corner was a Victorian armchair, piled with clothes and school books. Two black blurs like monstrous eyes were the doors to the stairs and the elevator. They always groaned when they opened. She would have heard anyone using them. The only difference in her room was barely a difference. On the far side of the bed, her best friend was sleeping soundly. Tarika often slept over. Tarika wasn't what had changed. Cat listened to the night. A few cars passed in the distance. A breeze rustled a palo verde tree. The city of Tucson was quiet. She sniffed. The air was crisp and dry, just as it was every autumn. The mattress shifted as Tarika lifted her head from the pillow to mumble, "Cat? Wegoddagiddupaready?" The clock's glowing numbers said they had an hour until sunrise. "No. Stay asleep, Tee."

She wore a boy's black suit, a white shirt, a blue tie, and dark sunglasses, all from Goodwill. She nodded and almost kept walking. The memory of pancakes made her pause. "It's a not-a-costume." "Oh?" "Mr. Killjoy banned costumes at school. He says they're for children." "So you're not a bill collector? That's a relief." "I'm displaying my maturity by dressing like a productive citizen." "Because you're really a secret agent?" "I'm sorry." Cat reached into her pocket. "I must kill you now." She drew a water pistol, grinned, and aimed at him in a perfect two-handed grip. He threw his arms over his book. "Kid! If this got wet--" She felt her grin die. What could she say? That, for a moment, she had thought he was an ordinary father and she was an ordinary daughter, and they were having an ordinary moment of fun? She put the water gun back in her pocket. "I wouldn't have squirted you," she lied. He watched her as if he wanted to say something. He would never admit his books were more important than she was. She whirled and raced downstairs, shouting, "Bye, Granny Lupe!" so her father would hear that she didn't say goodbye to him. Granny Lupe called, "Let me see the not-a-costume!" Cat ran to the top of the basement stairs and turned like a runway model. From the shadows below, Granny Lupe said, "Ah. The best bad girls wear men's clothes. I remember a masque where Lucrezia Borgia--" "I'll be late! Tell me later!" Cat snatched her book bag and ran outside. The rising sun was just below the Rincon Mountains. Cat thought that if she could paint like Tarika, she would paint Luna Street with its small, southwestern houses in desert colors, burnt red, fire orange, and cactus green, all washed in soft blue light.	not enough information

When Cat rang the bell, a tall skeleton in a dark suit opened the front door and said, "You're late." "Like that's different." The skeleton said, "On Halloween." "Uncle Olujimi kept telling funny stories about his kids and wives. He's so nice he likes Evil Dad. Also, something happened." "No talk." Tarika yanked Cat inside. "The maestro must work."

Against one wall were an acoustic guitar, a keyboard, a doumbek, and a hammered dulcimer. One corner of the room was bare so Tarika could dance. One wall had a mural she had painted of her heroes. Muhammad rode a flying horse through the night sky, Jesus walked above a lake during a storm, and Shakira danced in space with the earth, the moon, and the sun behind her. Below the mural was lettered in gold paint, You are a song written by the hands of God. Cat dropped onto a big pillow on the floor. While Tarika painted finger bones on her skin, Cat told everything she had seen and heard about her trip to Arkan Exterminators. When she finished, she asked, "What do you think?" "I'm with Granny Lupe. Ms. Arkan's a stalker ex-girlfriend." "And someone stole her van and nearly hit me? Big coincidence." Tarika shrugged. "If there weren't coincidences, there wouldn't be a word for them. Is Ms. Arkan dumb enough to run someone over in a car with her name on the side?" "Maybe someone wanted to frame her." "You think your dad could have two stalker girlfriends? Someone reads too much manga." "Would a stalker show up after fourteen years?" "Why not? Your dad's the hot." "The hot? Evil Dad?" "Totally Heathcliffy."	Fall.

Below the mural was lettered in gold paint, You are a song written by the hands of God. Cat dropped onto a big pillow on the floor. While Tarika painted finger bones on her skin, Cat told everything she had seen and heard about her trip to Arkan Exterminators. When she finished, she asked, "What do you think?" "I'm with Granny Lupe. Ms. Arkan's a stalker ex-girlfriend." "And someone stole her van and nearly hit me? Big coincidence." Tarika shrugged. "If there weren't coincidences, there wouldn't be a word for them. Is Ms. Arkan dumb enough to run someone over in a car with her name on the side?" "Maybe someone wanted to frame her." "You think your dad could have two stalker girlfriends? Someone reads too much manga." "Would a stalker show up after fourteen years?" "Why not? Your dad's the hot." "The hot? Evil Dad?" "Totally Heathcliffy."	She enjoys painting

The writer believes that:(A)He should have been more affected by the murder(B)not enough information(C)He was set out to kill(D)He needs counseling [SEP] I was seventeen, almost eighteen, the first time I killed someone. It was kind of an accident, in the same way that bubble gum is kind of a food. I hadn't set out to kill him, honestly, but I wasn't exactly trying not to kill him either. To be fair, the guy was trying to kill me first. That I had most likely broken his arm and nose before he tried to kill me would probably have been brought up by the prosecution at my murder trial, if there had ever been one. If there had been, though, I or my overpriced attorney (I'm assuming that if I had one, he would be overpriced) would have mentioned the extreme duress I was under. My father had recently died, my school life had gone completely out of control, I had more than a little bit of pepper spray in my eyes, and I was acting to defend my life and the life of the girl I was with. But alas, there was no murder trial. There was hardly an investigation, really. As an average teenager, that night would have probably been the high -- or low -- point of my young, naive life. It would probably have been the topic of discussion in a lifetime of counseling and group therapy. It might have motivated a period of heavy drug use and the abandonment of friends and family, followed by an inspirational recovery that I might later write about in a best-selling autobiography, that would surely be described by Newsweek magazine as, "A haunting, yet uplifting story of tragedy and the re-discovery of life that every person, young and old, must read." My life wouldn't move in that direction, though. Being put in a situation where you have to decide whether or not to probably kill someone to protect your own life should have affected me profoundly, but it didn't. It bounced off me like rain off glass. Around two weeks later, when I killed someone again, this time much more deliberately, I was affected even less. There was no murder trial for that one, either.

If I had been just a bit younger during the Attention Deficit Disorder and Ritalin craze that swept the nation a few years ago, I probably would have been swept up in it. They'd say the reason I was so disinterested in classes was that I couldn't focus or that my brain was working harder than most other kids, so I should be put on a neuro-stimulant that single-handedly changed the already-aging idea of a school nurse from an applicator of bandages and thermometers to a dispensary of pre-prescribed medications. I doubted I suffered from any definitive brain disorder, though. I just didn't like spending all day in a school, being given information and then instantly asked to recall it, and being fed mass-produced chicken nuggets at lunch. The US government, the largest governing body on the planet is tasked with educating its children in everything needed to be successful in adult life, and this is the best they can do? By the end of each day I would always feel exhausted mentally and physically, not from difficult classes but from trying to parse enormous chunks of boredom into pieces small enough to handle without causing an aneurysm. I'd head home each day with the eagerness of a recently paroled inmate and decompress my brain with some television or video games before going to bed way too late and wake up way too early, just to deal with it all again.

To be honest, I was starting to look forward to going back. Somehow, sinking into familiar routines seemed like the most amazing thing I could have done. Sitting around the house or walking around the neighborhood was doing me no good, not with the compounding mysteries seeping into my life. Monday morning, I walked those halls again and let myself slip into the empty anonymity provided by a crowd of peers. Freshmen with their stupid-huge backpacks, sophomores telling inside jokes so satisfied that they're cooler than at least one group of people, juniors walking with their noses in books and looking distraught over all the stress they're under, and seniors leaning against locker doors, their backpacks long since abandoned and only carrying few things absolutely necessary to get through the day. Life seems so much easier when peer groups are categorized so rigidly. Anonymity went out the window when I entered my first class and sat down. From the second I walked in the door, hushed conversations were severed as 40 eyes dug into me and trailed me as I slumped into the first empty desk I saw. I darted my eyes around, everybody avoided eye contact. I lined my pencils up on my desktop while the room sat in a still, thick silence. They had to have heard about my dad's death, but I hoped the word hadn't gotten about regarding my ill-gotten gains. It shouldn't have; I didn't tell anybody. Still, if everybody knows, I'd need to hire a bodyguard just to hold off the ironic requests for loans. I tried to imagine how much bodyguards cost; I remembered reading somewhere that a legitimate executive security firm charges about a thousand dollars per day. I could get a bodyguard for 500 days, and then I wouldn't need one anymore. Spending all your money to keep people from getting your money -- that should have been a Twilight Zone episode.

Who worked at the narrator's elementary school?(A)Mr. Comstock.(B)The paramedic.(C)The police officer.(D)not enough information [SEP] At my school, the role of dealing with students typically reserved for a single principal is split up among a small fleet of "administrators" who are assigned to certain students seemingly at random. I understand this is common now among modern high schools. The administrator I was assigned to was Mr. Comstock. Replacing the first 'o' with a 'u' has always been a popular teenage antic around here, and is one of the reasons I loathe admitting that I am, in fact, a teenager. I'd spoken to Mr. Comstock only a few times in my life, even though it seemed like he'd been around me forever. When I was in elementary school, he worked there in the office somewhere; he transferred to my middle school during my second year there, and he and I started at this high school at the same time. He must either be very easily dissatisfied or so horrible to work for that he just gets slid around the system so nobody has to deal with him for too long. I'd apparently broken one person's nose and collapsed another's larynx. The kid who'd walked in on the fight, a freshman, had run to the nearest adult, who called the school's assigned police officer. Said police officer arrived on scene just as I was tossing one kid -- the one whose larynx I collapsed -- onto another. When my head stopped thumping and I could stand up, I was taken to this office and left alone. Through the glass panel of the closed, probably locked door I saw paramedics rolling stretchers down the hall. Mr. Comstock had been on the phone since I got there, talking with various people including the police. After a few minutes of silent contemplation as to the source of the pain in my head, I heard Mr. Comstock begin to wind down the conversation and then he hung up the telephone and looked to me, himself seeming frazzled and anxious to say something. He started to tell me then about the collapsed larynx and broken nose until the phone rang yet again.	Mr. Comstock.

During these five years the husband:(A)not enough information(B)helped his wife morally.(C)gave his wife financial assistance(D)enjoyed his life to the fullest. [SEP] I have been and still is in this situation in my family life. In 2013, I fell severely ill and it took me these 5 years to return to normal life. In all these five years, I haven't had any finanical or moral help from my husband. While I was in excruciating pain, he enjoyed his life to the fullest, splashing out money for his hobbies like fishing. I had to hold two jobs to pay my medical bills since my health policy didn't cover the costs of my treatment. I had to take two- hour breaks between my workshifts ( fortunately, my former boss gave me permission to use a recliner bed in our doctor's office for that) and my “dear other half” complained about having to collect me to and from work as his car was used too often. For those, living in the US, I feel I need to explain some details. In Russia, we don't usually have a joint family bank account, so I couldn't use his money; I had to make do with what I earned. I asked him for money, which I always borrowed from him returning it regularly, only twice in all these years. He gave me a little sum once only to reproach me for asking the next day. He refused to lend me a meager sum for three days though he knew well enough that if I didn't get the medicine I needed, I could pass out in any place and any time. So now, I don't trust him anymore and feel very insecure. If you ask me about how it feels to live like that, I'll tell you that it's devastating. Many people feel betrayed when they are cheated on. I only smile when I read their stories. They don't know what betrayal is and what it means to have to live with a traitor who may let you down any minute.	enjoyed his life to the fullest.

I had to hold two jobs to pay my medical bills since my health policy didn't cover the costs of my treatment. I had to take two- hour breaks between my workshifts ( fortunately, my former boss gave me permission to use a recliner bed in our doctor's office for that) and my “dear other half” complained about having to collect me to and from work as his car was used too often. For those, living in the US, I feel I need to explain some details. In Russia, we don't usually have a joint family bank account, so I couldn't use his money; I had to make do with what I earned. I asked him for money, which I always borrowed from him returning it regularly, only twice in all these years. He gave me a little sum once only to reproach me for asking the next day. He refused to lend me a meager sum for three days though he knew well enough that if I didn't get the medicine I needed, I could pass out in any place and any time. So now, I don't trust him anymore and feel very insecure. If you ask me about how it feels to live like that, I'll tell you that it's devastating. Many people feel betrayed when they are cheated on. I only smile when I read their stories. They don't know what betrayal is and what it means to have to live with a traitor who may let you down any minute.	A bed at work in the Drs office

How much total time did the narrator take to cook the steak?(A)not enough information(B)4 hours(C)45 minutes(D)10 minutes [SEP] It was a Saturday night and I was working the broiler station, responsible for cooking steaks and chops. On any busy night I had to cook a hundred or more steaks to the customer’s specifications (rare to well done). The kitchen closed at 10:00 and an order came in at 10:10 for a filet mignon, rare. This called for cursing, complaining, and the demand for a cold “heinie” (Heiniken Beer). I cooked the filet (6 oz., bacon wrapped) to rare and sent it out. I resumed my cleaning; I wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant. There had been a function for 150 and I had worked since 8:00 AM, a fourteen hour day. I was a little on the testy side. The waiter returned with the steak. It was too rare. “M***** F***** .“ I turned the broiler back and begrudgingly cooked the steak to med- just a little pink in the center. In two or three minutes the waiter returned with the steak. Still too rare. I am now pissed off. Apparently this yahoo has no idea of what a rare steak looks like. I butterfly the sucker and cook it into a state of unmistakable well-doneness. I glare at the waiter. Not his fault but I have lost any reasonableness I might have possessed. “86!” I yell. Close the kitchen down. The waiter returns yet again. Still too rare. I am now Samuel L. Jackson incarnate. I take the steak and throw it into a frialator, a deep fat fryer at 375 degrees, and leave it in the hot fat for five minutes. The steak now looks like a deformed hockey puck, it has become a shriveled up piece of charred animal flesh. The kitchen staff gather around, eager to see how this last move will play out. The waiter returns with a big smile. “Compliments to the chef.”	45 minutes

On any busy night I had to cook a hundred or more steaks to the customer’s specifications (rare to well done). The kitchen closed at 10:00 and an order came in at 10:10 for a filet mignon, rare. This called for cursing, complaining, and the demand for a cold “heinie” (Heiniken Beer). I cooked the filet (6 oz., bacon wrapped) to rare and sent it out. I resumed my cleaning; I wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant. There had been a function for 150 and I had worked since 8:00 AM, a fourteen hour day. I was a little on the testy side. The waiter returned with the steak. It was too rare. “M***** F***** .“ I turned the broiler back and begrudgingly cooked the steak to med- just a little pink in the center. In two or three minutes the waiter returned with the steak. Still too rare. I am now pissed off. Apparently this yahoo has no idea of what a rare steak looks like. I butterfly the sucker and cook it into a state of unmistakable well-doneness. I glare at the waiter. Not his fault but I have lost any reasonableness I might have possessed. “86!” I yell. Close the kitchen down. The waiter returns yet again. Still too rare. I am now Samuel L. Jackson incarnate.

What is probably true of the author?(A)She is a dog person(B)She is a cat person(C)She loves horses(D)not enough information [SEP] Depends on how you define "public"…. The trails around the stable where I used to board my horse went through a very up-scale housing development. The back yards of the houses abutted the trail; they had cinder-block walls that were a good 8 feet high. ….So if you were in one of the yards, you couldn't see over the fence or through the fence; if you were walking on the trail, you had 8-foot block walls on either side of you, and you couldn't see over or through the walls into the yards. But if you were riding a horse, you could see over the top of the walls into the back yards of the houses. Some of the trails in the development weren't used by equestrians very often. I liked to use these trails, which were quieter than the more-travelled trails. Because many of the residents of the development weren't too happy about having horses close at hand (objections to dust, flies and noise), when we went through the development, we usually went at a very quiet walk. So I was riding my horse down this trail one afternoon, heading back to the stable after a longer trail ride. It was a quiet afternoon, and as I headed through the development, I heard a kind of creak-creak-creak sound. It was unusual enough that I started scanning over the fences, into the yards, trying to figure out what it was. As I came around a slight curve in the trail, I found the source of the noise. There was one of those big, round, elevated trampolines in the back yard. And on the trampoline were a naked man and woman, bouncing gently up and down as they engaged in a VERY intimate activity! Creak-creak-creak… They saw me at about the same time I saw them. I saluted them with my riding crop, kicked my horse into a canter, and scrammed the hell out of there; I have no idea what they did after I left!	She loves horses

The back yards of the houses abutted the trail; they had cinder-block walls that were a good 8 feet high. ….So if you were in one of the yards, you couldn't see over the fence or through the fence; if you were walking on the trail, you had 8-foot block walls on either side of you, and you couldn't see over or through the walls into the yards.

It was unusual enough that I started scanning over the fences, into the yards, trying to figure out what it was. As I came around a slight curve in the trail, I found the source of the noise. There was one of those big, round, elevated trampolines in the back yard. And on the trampoline were a naked man and woman, bouncing gently up and down as they engaged in a VERY intimate activity! Creak-creak-creak… They saw me at about the same time I saw them. I saluted them with my riding crop, kicked my horse into a canter, and scrammed the hell out of there; I have no idea what they did after I left!	Kicked horse into a canter and scrammed.

So I was riding my horse down this trail one afternoon, heading back to the stable after a longer trail ride. It was a quiet afternoon, and as I headed through the development, I heard a kind of creak-creak-creak sound. It was unusual enough that I started scanning over the fences, into the yards, trying to figure out what it was. As I came around a slight curve in the trail, I found the source of the noise. There was one of those big, round, elevated trampolines in the back yard. And on the trampoline were a naked man and woman, bouncing gently up and down as they engaged in a VERY intimate activity! Creak-creak-creak… They saw me at about the same time I saw them. I saluted them with my riding crop, kicked my horse into a canter, and scrammed the hell out of there; I have no idea what they did after I left!	not enough information
What issues does he probably have now?(A)No issues(B)Trust issues(C)Abandonment issues(D)not enough information [SEP] We were married in a judge’s office. The instant we were married, I felt regret like a curtain closing. I knew something was wrong. I had ignored that inner voice that had been telling me GET AWAY! We were married on a Tuesday. Three days later (Friday), I consulted a lawyer for an annulment, because I had discovered that my new wife had no attraction for me. None whatsoever. She didn’t believe in premarital sex, so I didn’t know what I was getting into until we married. I blame only myself for the mistake, because I ignored the very strong gut instinct that warned me not to get married. The experience taught me to listen to that inner voice. I’ve listened to it ever since that day in the judge’s office those many years ago. I don’t blame my wife at all. It was my mistake and much of our unhappiness was my fault. We ended up staying together for six weeks. It was like six weeks of Navy SEALs training in emotional suffering for both of us! I can laugh about it now. Hell, Marine Corps boot camp would be child’s play compared to what we went through in mental stress. Many years later a close friend told me that my wife, during that six weeks of marriage, approached him about having an affair with him. He asked, “What about _____?” (Insert my name, which will remain anonymous here.) She said, “What about him?” Think twice, three times, a hundred times before getting married. Listen to your intuition. Sleep on it. Be especially careful around the potential partner who is “perfect,” because that may be a sign that something is wrong. Be with the perfect partner long enough to see how they act when things go wrong. How does that person treat waiters in a restaurant? Just be careful. But at the same time, stay open minded. You don’t want to reject the love of your life, either.	not enough information

Many years later a close friend told me that my wife, during that six weeks of marriage, approached him about having an affair with him. He asked, “What about _____?” (Insert my name, which will remain anonymous here.) She said, “What about him?” Think twice, three times, a hundred times before getting married. Listen to your intuition. Sleep on it. Be especially careful around the potential partner who is “perfect,” because that may be a sign that something is wrong. Be with the perfect partner long enough to see how they act when things go wrong. How does that person treat waiters in a restaurant? Just be careful. But at the same time, stay open minded. You don’t want to reject the love of your life, either.	being in boot camp training in the military
What does the author likely believe about listening to one's intuition?(A)not enough information(B)that it will stop many marriages(C)that it will lead one to the right decision(D)that it can tell you if someone is having an affair [SEP] We were married in a judge’s office. The instant we were married, I felt regret like a curtain closing. I knew something was wrong. I had ignored that inner voice that had been telling me GET AWAY! We were married on a Tuesday. Three days later (Friday), I consulted a lawyer for an annulment, because I had discovered that my new wife had no attraction for me. None whatsoever. She didn’t believe in premarital sex, so I didn’t know what I was getting into until we married. I blame only myself for the mistake, because I ignored the very strong gut instinct that warned me not to get married. The experience taught me to listen to that inner voice. I’ve listened to it ever since that day in the judge’s office those many years ago. I don’t blame my wife at all. It was my mistake and much of our unhappiness was my fault.

But I just knew she hit on something that was true in a sense but not in the way she meant it. And because I didn’t understand it, I thought she might be right. I didn’t know how to explain myself and I wasn’t the kind of person to demand attention like she was. It hurt my deeply but I didn’t say anything and I had no idea what to do with that hurt. And the fact that none of my friends said anything made me feel so very alone. I wish I could go back now as a mother and explain a little to that girl, help her along but I guess she did finally find her way.	For a day.
The narrator feels at the end of the story:(A)they became more isolated and disconnected from others.(B)not enough information(C)they learned to better care and accept others in their relationships.(D)they became more vindictive and distrusting of friends. [SEP] Yes, it was a very long time ago. I was 17 and at my best friends house. There were about seven girls there. All were friends, some closer than others. One girl had been alternating between yelling at her boyfriend on the phone and sobbing. It was like 2 in the morning. Everyone else seemed to be very concerned about her. I thought she was being quite mean to him, demanding attention and just being completely irrational. i was tired and I wanted to go to sleep. After this had dragged on and on, I think I said something pretty awful like you are being a bitch, just go to sleep. She turned on me and said you will never understand what I’m going through, you don’t know how to love anyone. The only person you love is your younger brother. No one stood up for me. And it was true, I didn’t date much. I did but I never got very involved. I stayed pretty distant. I had my reasons for this that I didn’t understand at the time.

my mother was anger on my father due to(A)not enough information(B)he did not helped her sister when she was alive(C)he is always fighting and beating my mother(D)he is a drinking hard drinks daily [SEP] It wasn’t told to me, but instead my mother was furious with my father and his family. I have never forgotten her words to him. His youngest sister, an aunt I had never met although she lived in the same city, drowned herself and her two young sons in Lake Michigan. I was maybe 5 or 6 at the time, I think? That would make this around 1956 or 1957. My father and his 5 remaining siblings sprang for a really expensive funeral. The figure that sticks in my mind is $5,000. Understand that $8K could have bought an entire house in Chicago; a nice 3–4 bdrm red brick home on a good-sized lot, at the time. As Niseis they experienced a great deal of prejudice after WWII, so an annual salary of $2K would be doing really well. My aunt’s husband had died unexpectedly young. He had no insurance and almost no savings. She was struggling with two young kids. She reluctantly asked her sisters and brothers for help. They turned her down. All of them. They had always been a competitive and dysfunctional family, and for whatever reason, they refused to assist her. They told her to go on welfare if she needed money. In those days welfare had an enormous social stigma. Being Asian and second generation, “losing face” within the local community was utterly humiliating. Your family were quite literally outcast. Depressed and in despair, she committed suicide. My mother’s words to my father right after the funeral were to the effect of: “What use to her is spending $5,000 on a casket and flowers now? If all of you were willing to spend that money, why didn’t you give it to her when she was alive and needed it?” The answer, of course, is that the $5K funeral was for show - meant only to impress others. In that one moment, I understood the utter hypocrisy of what had happened. And I never really respected my father’s family ever again.	not enough information

I was maybe 5 or 6 at the time, I think? That would make this around 1956 or 1957. My father and his 5 remaining siblings sprang for a really expensive funeral. The figure that sticks in my mind is $5,000. Understand that $8K could have bought an entire house in Chicago; a nice 3–4 bdrm red brick home on a good-sized lot, at the time. As Niseis they experienced a great deal of prejudice after WWII, so an annual salary of $2K would be doing really well. My aunt’s husband had died unexpectedly young. He had no insurance and almost no savings. She was struggling with two young kids. She reluctantly asked her sisters and brothers for help. They turned her down. All of them. They had always been a competitive and dysfunctional family, and for whatever reason, they refused to assist her. They told her to go on welfare if she needed money. In those days welfare had an enormous social stigma. Being Asian and second generation, “losing face” within the local community was utterly humiliating. Your family were quite literally outcast. Depressed and in despair, she committed suicide. My mother’s words to my father right after the funeral were to the effect of: “What use to her is spending $5,000 on a casket and flowers now? If all of you were willing to spend that money, why didn’t you give it to her when she was alive and needed it?” The answer, of course, is that the $5K funeral was for show - meant only to impress others. In that one moment, I understood the utter hypocrisy of what had happened. And I never really respected my father’s family ever again.	After the aunt had died

One that’s just a stand out for me happened just about a year ago. We chatted online and seemed to hit it off, we took it to the phone and it seemed alright. He suggested we meet for coffee that same evening and the timing worked for me. We met at a coffee shop, I had tea and paid for my own, I offered to buy his, but he wanted nothing - he suspiciously eyed the free water in the self service jug, but decided to skip that too. We grabbed a seat and I asked him about where he lived - he lived about 30 minutes out of the city in a gorgeous tiny town at the foothills of the nearby mountain range. He said he’d lived in the city, but preferred the peace and quiet…(all good so far)…because out there you could get a clear view of the stars…(awww, how lovely)…and the chem trails…(WTF???) “The Chem Trails…you mean the vapour that planes leave when they fly overhead?” I said, hoping I’d misheard him. No, Chem Trails. "The government is trying to poison us.” he said confidently. I asked why they would try to eliminate us indiscriminately, being that we pay taxes and all and there wouldn’t be much money in the coffers if we were all dead, but he was quite insistent. Then he explained that the “Media” was part of the conspiracy, of course, because they knew and kept it from us. I said “well that’s awkward for me, because I work in the media.” Honestly, that didn’t seem to put him off at all, he just wanted to share more of his theories with me. Truth be told, I was fascinated and probably egged him on by asking lots of questions, but for goodness sake, part of my job is to interview people - how could I resist?	not enough information

The author probably believes that:(A)not enough information(B)the patient is very sick(C)the patient needs more pills(D)the patient doesn't need so many pills [SEP] Going anonymous for legal reasons. I used to work at a pharmacy when I was in high school. When I got hired, I was a good student and a really good kid. Over time, though, I started getting involved in some not-so-good stuff. I starting drinking a lot and even started getting into drugs, namely marijuana. Being surrounded by prescription drugs didn’t really bother me because they weren’t the drugs that I was into. At least not at first… But one day, I was packing up some oxycodone for a patient. This patient was a “frequent flyer” so to speak, always in getting tons of medications. Well this particular prescription was for 300 oxy. 300! There were so many that the lid barely fit. So after thinking about it for a second, my idiot self decided to take a few out. Cause she wouldn’t notice anyway, and I had started to get curious about what the big deal was with them since a lot of people I knew were getting into them. So I stole some. I committed a felony. Stealing class ii drugs from a patient who needed them. That’s the stuff people go to prison for. If I would have been caught, I would have lost my job, gone to prison, and disowned by my family. It probably would have been in the local news because an in-home healthcare worker had just been in the news for the same thing not long before. I was so stupid and it’s still something that I am so disappointed in myself for doing. Shortly after that, I quit my job. I knew that once I opened up that can of worms, it was going to be really hard to go back. The temptation was too high. And it was totally not worth the risk.	the patient doesn't need so many pills

What is true about Rob the policeman?(A)He quit being a policeman after the two creepy cases described in the story.(B)He eagerly seek out cases that are out of the norm or unusual.(C)He prefer cases that are not odd or creepy.(D)not enough information [SEP] My friend who used to be a policeman got called to a house for a sudden death. When he got there, what had happened was the father of a wheelchair-bound girl with severe learning difficulties had died of a heart attack, riding a strap on dildo that he had fitted to the poor girl in the wheelchair. He was pegging and pegged it! Edit: Just to clarify - father strapped a dildo to daughter who was in a wheelchair, climbed on her lap in the wheelchair and rode the dildo, before succumbing to a heart attack on her lap. She was unable to get him off of her lap, and that is what was found by police. She was an unwilling participant. He also went to another report of a sudden death (why these things kept happening to Rob is beyond me!) where the son of an old gent lived across the country and couldn’t get hold of his dad. He had called the neighbours and they couldn’t get a reply at the door, either. Rob knocked very loudly and in the end, kicked the door in. The place didn’t smell very good, so Rob had that sinking feeling. He went room to room, searching for the deceased male. Finally, he went to the bedroom and standing at the foot of the bed, he saw the old gent laying there, cheeks sunken in, head back, mouth gaping open. Just to be certain, Rob put his hand under the duvet and touched the deceased’s leg - it was cold and stiff. He goes to his radio and starts to inform the dispatch when suddenly… The old boy sits up and shouts at him “What are you doing in my house?” Rob admits, he screamed! The old gent obviously wasn’t dead. It turns out, the batteries in his hearing aids had run down, so he couldn’t hear the phone when his son had called him, nor could he hear the knocking at the front door. And the cold stiff leg?

Rob got calls that reported sudden deaths. Which call involved a man with a prosthetic leg?(A)the first call(B)during the night(C)not enough information(D)the second call [SEP] My friend who used to be a policeman got called to a house for a sudden death. When he got there, what had happened was the father of a wheelchair-bound girl with severe learning difficulties had died of a heart attack, riding a strap on dildo that he had fitted to the poor girl in the wheelchair. He was pegging and pegged it! Edit: Just to clarify - father strapped a dildo to daughter who was in a wheelchair, climbed on her lap in the wheelchair and rode the dildo, before succumbing to a heart attack on her lap. She was unable to get him off of her lap, and that is what was found by police. She was an unwilling participant. He also went to another report of a sudden death (why these things kept happening to Rob is beyond me!) where the son of an old gent lived across the country and couldn’t get hold of his dad. He had called the neighbours and they couldn’t get a reply at the door, either. Rob knocked very loudly and in the end, kicked the door in. The place didn’t smell very good, so Rob had that sinking feeling. He went room to room, searching for the deceased male. Finally, he went to the bedroom and standing at the foot of the bed, he saw the old gent laying there, cheeks sunken in, head back, mouth gaping open.

What would the author continue to do?(A)go to music festivals(B)drink more of those same drinks(C)drink himself silly(D)not enough information [SEP] Absinthe and Buckfast. If you don’t know what either of those are then consider yourself lucky. Neither tastes great on their own, and mixed together this was as foul smelling and tasting as they come. Pretty stupid of us to mix them together as well as both are known to get you extremely drunk! We were at a music festival (Leeds) about 12/13 years ago. A friend had half a bottle of Buckfast left and I had half a bottle of Absinthe left. We mixed them together and egged each other on to drink till it was finished. Both of us were a mess, and I have no clue what happened to him that night. I realised how drunk I was and staggered towards a bar to ask for some water. Someone was dancing “at” me and refused to get out of the way. I think he thought it was amusing how drunk I was. I was having none of it and ended up throwing up on him before putting my hand on his face and pushing him out of the way. Not intentional, but he really should have read the situation better. I apologised and staggered on. I got to the bar and asked for water. They were charging about £3 a bottle but then looked at me and just gave me it for nothing. Thanks anonymous bar person! I got back to my tent and crashed out in a drunken mess. Woke with the worst hangover I’ve ever suffered through, got myself rehydrated, fed and then went to watch some bands the next day. Not my proudest moment, not the most sensible mixture, not something I would recommend, and not something I would ever be stupid enough to repeat.

He would EAT our lunches if we misbehaved, so that we poor students would STARVE. You would have to be heartless to do that. But one thing he did to me, triggered me to no extent. One day, I was sitting in his class, minding my business, when he walked by and looked into my notes. Now, I had lent my pencil to someone else, who lost it. It’s not like I carry TWO pencils to school. Pffftttt…. that’s ridiculous. What am I…10? So since that dude had lost the only pencil i had, I didn't have a pencil to write notes with. So i didn't. Mind you, I had cake for lunch that day, and no way in hell would I have allowed him to touch my lunch. As soon as his fat, stubby, hairy fingers reached out to my lunch bag, I bit his hand. Now, I admit it was a little… ‘animal-like’ of me , but come on! I wasn't going to sit still while some 40 year old dude ate my cake. Guess what? I got detention, and he went Scott free.

[SEP] I got a full body massage in Phuket…need I say more? My massage went like this… I was asked to undress to my knickers and lay face down, on my stomach. The masseuse began by crawling on me like a tigress, seeking out its prey, starting at my feet then continuing slowly along my legs and finally onto my back. My legs suddenly felt so long with this slow dragging movement. This probably lasted a shorter amount of time than it felt. It was rather strange, having someone on top of you, moving in this manner. Although it was rather enjoyable, I thank God she wasn’t heavy or I would have been crushed. She proceeded by doing the usual standard massage, followed by the strangest butt massage. My butt was kneaded, and squeezed as if it were a dough ball. Then began the clapping and tapping motion. A rather difficult motion to describe in words. I then turned over and she took a giant leap, pushing her tiny arms into my pelvis with intense pressure, with the quickest and sturdiest of movements. It was so unexpected that I found it difficult to contain my laughter. It was the strangest feeling in the world! I thought, “Did I order the standard full-body massage? Did she get the memo? This lasted a couple of rather loooong seconds. Then came the even stranger breast massage. It was NOT a subtle breast massage. It was full-on, breasts over floweth in hand. They were cupped, squeezed, and kneaded. Finally, I couldn’t help but yelp in a fit of laughter and she did too. If this was the standard “full-body massage”, I imagined, what more could there be?

My legs suddenly felt so long with this slow dragging movement. This probably lasted a shorter amount of time than it felt. It was rather strange, having someone on top of you, moving in this manner. Although it was rather enjoyable, I thank God she wasn’t heavy or I would have been crushed. She proceeded by doing the usual standard massage, followed by the strangest butt massage. My butt was kneaded, and squeezed as if it were a dough ball. Then began the clapping and tapping motion. A rather difficult motion to describe in words. I then turned over and she took a giant leap, pushing her tiny arms into my pelvis with intense pressure, with the quickest and sturdiest of movements.

Four different times I have been stalked by ex’s. Only one was based more in a sort of revenge mode. He wanted to get back together so he could dump me. He called obsessively, showed up where he knew I would be and harassed my friends for information. I’m sad to say I actually did go back out with him and he did break up with me but that wasn’t the end. He thought he had left me a crumpled mess only to find out I was fine and had moved on. So he started his stalking all over again. However, everyone knew what he was up too. What I didn’t expect was then he turned to vandalizing and bad mouthing me to anyone that would listen. It was so bizarre! Believe it or not but I ended up taking him back in hopes he would just stop being so crazy. He didn’t and he got worse with me becoming physically violent and then he cheated on me. I broke it off again and even though he started dating the girl he cheated on me with he still couldn’t let me go. It took four years and my then fiancé now husband to tell him to get lost. It’s strange though if I had to choose I would take dealing with an ex that is now stalking me over the man I don’t really know. An ex you have history and you know their friends and family. You know if the police would have an effect or talking to their parents. With a stranger you don’t know any of those things and you don’t know what they are capable of. I don’t think anyone really wants either but since I’ve dealt with both I thought I’d share that.	not enough information

How long did it take the author to trap the spider in the Tupperware?(A)A half a day(B)not enough information(C)A good hour(D)A few minutes [SEP] Yesterday I got home from work, threw my bag on my table, looked up and saw a whopper of a spider on my wall. Let’s be clear, it was a whopper by China standards and not by Australian outback standards. In size, it was about the circumference of a pint glass. I took a deep breath, grabbed a Tupperware box and text book, and with an admirable sense of courage, I said to the spider, “别害怕，我帮你!” (Don’t be scared, I’ll help you). I had to use Chinese, otherwise it wouldn’t have understood me. I managed to trap the spider in the Tupperware against the wall and shuffle the text book underneath, delicately avoiding ripping it’s little legs off. I walked outside, past the gawps of neighbours in the corridor and past the trash pile next to the door that smells like a freshly dug up, mass grave. As I opened my innovative contraption and carefully placed the spider on a path to freedom, I did a mini jump, threw my arms in the air and even let out a little, “Yay, spider!” Almost immediately, my landlord’s over excited Staffordshire bull terrier (the Chinese version) sprinted out of absolutely nowhere and mauled my spider friend to death. When I say mauled, there was absolutely no trace of the spider after the dog had had his 1.8 seconds of fun. My landlord’s Father, affectionately named ‘Uncle Li’ by the local residents, shuffled up to the area where the spider would have been with his vest on and a giant wooden bong in his hand, looked at me, and giggled. I forgot about the spider immediately because Uncle Li was making fish with garlic and chili and he offered me some. I tried my best, pal. R.I.P Mr. Spider	A few minutes

As I opened my innovative contraption and carefully placed the spider on a path to freedom, I did a mini jump, threw my arms in the air and even let out a little, “Yay, spider!” Almost immediately, my landlord’s over excited Staffordshire bull terrier (the Chinese version) sprinted out of absolutely nowhere and mauled my spider friend to death. When I say mauled, there was absolutely no trace of the spider after the dog had had his 1.8 seconds of fun. My landlord’s Father, affectionately named ‘Uncle Li’ by the local residents, shuffled up to the area where the spider would have been with his vest on and a giant wooden bong in his hand, looked at me, and giggled.

I took a deep breath, grabbed a Tupperware box and text book, and with an admirable sense of courage, I said to the spider, “别害怕，我帮你!” (Don’t be scared, I’ll help you).

In fact, he still volunteers at an exotic animal shelter which is home to a large variety of those aforementioned creatures, and my old friend White Noise. Many years ago, I went to visit my mother where he still lived, off and on, as it was closer to his job than his new apartment. I happened to go into his room and noticed a gold foil topped box about four or five inches square. Nosey as I am, I had to open it. It contained the shed exoskeleton of a large hairy yellow and black tarantula. Creepy as that was, it didn’t bother, or even surprise me much, as I knew my brother might keep something like that in his room. About an hour later, he called to say hello and suggested I take a look at the gold box in his room. I told him that I already had, but I picked it up again to take another look, while he told me about watching his pet shed it. My two year old daughter was VERY curious about the contents of the pretty box, so I showed it to her. Big BAD mistake. A mistake so bad it should have been spanked. She took one look at it, turned white and visibly trembled. I’ve never seen someone so terrified. Of course I did what I could to reassure her. I explained that it was the big spiders “old body” and that it actually lived at her uncles other house. But, umm. . .I guess I wasn’t really much of a compassionate and understanding dad, because over the next couple years I teased her with a jumping toy spider, a gummy tarantula and “creepy fingers up the arm.”	for a couple of years

It contained the shed exoskeleton of a large hairy yellow and black tarantula. Creepy as that was, it didn’t bother, or even surprise me much, as I knew my brother might keep something like that in his room. About an hour later, he called to say hello and suggested I take a look at the gold box in his room. I told him that I already had, but I picked it up again to take another look, while he told me about watching his pet shed it. My two year old daughter was VERY curious about the contents of the pretty box, so I showed it to her. Big BAD mistake. A mistake so bad it should have been spanked. She took one look at it, turned white and visibly trembled. I’ve never seen someone so terrified. Of course I did what I could to reassure her. I explained that it was the big spiders “old body” and that it actually lived at her uncles other house. But, umm. . .I guess I wasn’t really much of a compassionate and understanding dad, because over the next couple years I teased her with a jumping toy spider, a gummy tarantula and “creepy fingers up the arm.”	something creepy

What is the author's job?(A)Nurse(B)not enough information(C)Doctor(D)Writer [SEP] Not to me, but my grandma. Last year, she accidentally broke her arm, we took her to the EM, where they told us she needs to do a surgery immediately. They kept asking us some questions about her. But the surgery was canceled due to old age. They told us that she would live on painkillers until her arm heals, but she may not be able to use it as before due to the untreated damage. She will also stay in the hospital until she be fine. The broken part was swelling every day until it becomes so noticeable to the doctor !! The doctor decided to make a small surgery to the swelling part and empty it. They also tested the fluid and the results says that the fluid is dead-white blood cells. This means that it got a microbe, so they gave her some antibiotics. It becomes full of fluids again and again. One doctor told us that it shouldn't be opened from the first place, not even to test the fluid. However, one day her blood pressure was very low(the doctors told us later it's due to her arm's infection and the meds), but they didn't notice it, nor measure it. They noticed a bed wounds, an increase in body fluids or something like that on her body, so they gave her Lasix (Furosemide). Lasix is a good choice in this situations, but not with low blood pressure's people !! Two hours later, We received a call from the hospital telling us that she passed out due to very low blood pressure. We were in a complete shook that she was very normal in the day before, but now they're telling us that she actually died. R.I.P grandma. P.S.: it was one of the big hospitals in the city and very expensive too. The swelling part of the arm.	not enough information

She will also stay in the hospital until she be fine. The broken part was swelling every day until it becomes so noticeable to the doctor !! The doctor decided to make a small surgery to the swelling part and empty it. They also tested the fluid and the results says that the fluid is dead-white blood cells. This means that it got a microbe, so they gave her some antibiotics. It becomes full of fluids again and again. One doctor told us that it shouldn't be opened from the first place, not even to test the fluid. However, one day her blood pressure was very low(the doctors told us later it's due to her arm's infection and the meds), but they didn't notice it, nor measure it. They noticed a bed wounds, an increase in body fluids or something like that on her body, so they gave her Lasix (Furosemide). Lasix is a good choice in this situations, but not with low blood pressure's people !! Two hours later, We received a call from the hospital telling us that she passed out due to very low blood pressure. We were in a complete shook that she was very normal in the day before, but now they're telling us that she actually died. R.I.P grandma.

[SEP] This “casual” email was sent to me just over 9 months after my discard. (He ended it 11 days before my birthday and two months before our wedding day.) I was very close with his family. Remembered every birthday, anniversary, holiday etc… His parents had their own guest bedroom in our house as well… I never responded to this disgusting, lame email, but did receive a beautiful (but sad) card from his grandmother about how heartbroken she was for me. To me, this email just shows more of his lying character. This man destroyed me, so this blasé correspondence was insulting and detrimental to my psyche. My discard included him packing all of my things for me, putting them in a huge pile in our garage and letting me come pick everything up. Within two weeks after discard, I was blocked on all social media and he then texted me to let me know he started dating again. I was also never given a reason for him discarding me other than I “didn’t do anything wrong” “there was nothing [I] could do to fix it.” he “didn’t want to work on anything.” he “just wanted to be single” … after buying a house, planning a wedding, adopting animals together, and me literally changing my life around to make him happy… He used silent treatment and abandonment to the max to do the most damage. And he was successful. *I will add that this one email broke my heart all over again at the time. I was nowhere near functional and seeing/getting this pushed me waaaay back in any allusion I had about being “okay”. Three months later I was put on medical leave for cPTSD and level 3 hypertension…. I just didn’t want anyone who’s suffering thinking that I was perfectly okay with him sending this- especially so soon after being discarded. It was almost unlivable. And it takes years and years and years to be okay.	Before the ex had broken up with the author.

My discard included him packing all of my things for me, putting them in a huge pile in our garage and letting me come pick everything up. Within two weeks after discard, I was blocked on all social media and he then texted me to let me know he started dating again.

The author believes that they succeeded because:(A)They had a lot of money(B)not enough information(C)They worked hard(D)They cheated [SEP] Me… We’ve got 9 mandatory grades, after which you branch into higher ed or go vocational. It isn’t as strict as it used to be when I was branching out to my vocational detour, but anyhow. After about 2nd grade through the end of the 9th I was cursed (and blessed) to be good enough. I was good enough that I could skate through without doing my homework and without paying much attention. This was the good part. It was easy. Too easy. Because it was easy, I didn’t pay attention. English and IT were the worst, because I was good at them; I’d get the 9 out of 10 without trying much, math & physics not far behind as with them I’d also get 8 without trying much, 7 without trying at all. We had pretty good teachers, but out of the dozen or so, only two, Finnish and history teachers who managed to really push and challenge me enough for me to pay attention and apply myself, for which I am ever grateful for them. Then there was the biology / geography teacher who tried to push me, but didn’t know how, and we both failed each other… this sometimes bothers me still. Then I had my detour with vocational school, which I sailed through easily… but finished to the deepest recession with zero jobs. Eventually I somehow got myself into polytech… and boy was I in trouble there, because I hadn’t paid attention. It was hard trying to keep up with math, physics and nice subjects like signal processing, digital electronics, analog electronics & the like. I did okay; worked a few years and talked a boss paying me an MBA. When I got in, I busted my ass from the day -1, and it did pay off.	They worked hard

What did the author find out about how long and hard vocational school was:(A)that he/she wasn't good at manual labor(B)that he/she learned skills that were valuable in the current job market(C)that it was easy and he/she didn't need to work hard(D)not enough information [SEP] Me… We’ve got 9 mandatory grades, after which you branch into higher ed or go vocational. It isn’t as strict as it used to be when I was branching out to my vocational detour, but anyhow. After about 2nd grade through the end of the 9th I was cursed (and blessed) to be good enough. I was good enough that I could skate through without doing my homework and without paying much attention. This was the good part. It was easy. Too easy. Because it was easy, I didn’t pay attention. English and IT were the worst, because I was good at them; I’d get the 9 out of 10 without trying much, math & physics not far behind as with them I’d also get 8 without trying much, 7 without trying at all. We had pretty good teachers, but out of the dozen or so, only two, Finnish and history teachers who managed to really push and challenge me enough for me to pay attention and apply myself, for which I am ever grateful for them. Then there was the biology / geography teacher who tried to push me, but didn’t know how, and we both failed each other… this sometimes bothers me still. Then I had my detour with vocational school, which I sailed through easily… but finished to the deepest recession with zero jobs.

what did he go to school for?(A)not enough information(B)gym(C)science(D)math [SEP] I don't know if proud is the right word since it was random luck that first introduced us, but I am thankful. We met in high school. I was a transfer student and one of my courses from my previous school was full so I got shoved into a study hall to wait until the semester ended. Study hall at that school was normally for students having actual grade issues. I didn't fall into that category so I really didn't belong there either. A couple weeks after I transferred my algebra teacher visited the study hall. She needed a teacher's assistant to grade papers for a basic math class. She was surprised to see one of her better students sitting there and immediately asked me to take the position. So the next day I started working in her class and that's when I met the most beautiful red haired girl I've ever seen. I flirted with her at every opportunity, but she got the impression I was like that with every girl and immediately shut me down. A year later she found out I wasn't like that at all from some common friends and she had one of those friends let me know she was interested. It turned out she did like me the first time she saw me, but was very concerned that I was the type to immediately hit on a girl I'd just met. We dated for three years before marrying and recently celebrated 30 years of marriage. I would still encourage people to take risks when they meet somebody they like. My aggression may have turned her off at first, but she wouldn't have known about my feelings for her if I didn't share them with her.	not enough information

She was surprised to see one of her better students sitting there and immediately asked me to take the position. So the next day I started working in her class and that's when I met the most beautiful red haired girl I've ever seen. I flirted with her at every opportunity, but she got the impression I was like that with every girl and immediately shut me down. A year later she found out I wasn't like that at all from some common friends and she had one of those friends let me know she was interested. It turned out she did like me the first time she saw me, but was very concerned that I was the type to immediately hit on a girl I'd just met. We dated for three years before marrying and recently celebrated 30 years of marriage. I would still encourage people to take risks when they meet somebody they like. My aggression may have turned her off at first, but she wouldn't have known about my feelings for her if I didn't share them with her.	5 hours

After this story, the family likely:(A)Stopped taking their dad to festivals(B)Continued to be embarrassed by their dad(C)Stopped allowing their dad to get in conflicts(D)not enough information [SEP] My family once went to some sort of festival and we won a fish from one of those arcade games. My younger brother who won the fish was very excited as the dude was handing him the fish in a bag. My dad then asks, “the fish doesn't come in a tank?” You see, around the game tent there were mini fish tanks lined up, so I guess my dad thought that the tank was included. So when the guy said that the tank wasn't included, and cost $10, my dad started arguing with him and said that he should get the tank for free cause there aren't any signs that show that the tank isn't included. At this point everyone in my family wandered off cause we were embarrassed of him (obviously). After arguing for about 5 minutes, he proceeds to try and steal the fucking thing and is now arguing with the dude and a security guard too. I think he eventually got the tank for free. The annoying part is that we already had a spare one so we didn't need that tank. In the end, all the fish we got that day died anyways :/ we have one from the year before that's still alive and pretty big, though now we have 3 tanks that we don't use. My dad seems to perform stunts like this often and it really grinds our whole familys gears. He says we won't get anywhere in life if we don't stand up for ourselves, but we do, but we're also reasonable and don't make others miserable when doing so. So that's probably the craziest thing I've seen my dad do Edit - tried a slightly different writing style for this one	Continued to be embarrassed by their dad

Who demanded they be given a fish tank?(A)The man running the game(B)The writer's brother(C)not enough information(D)Their dad [SEP] My family once went to some sort of festival and we won a fish from one of those arcade games. My younger brother who won the fish was very excited as the dude was handing him the fish in a bag. My dad then asks, “the fish doesn't come in a tank?” You see, around the game tent there were mini fish tanks lined up, so I guess my dad thought that the tank was included. So when the guy said that the tank wasn't included, and cost $10, my dad started arguing with him and said that he should get the tank for free cause there aren't any signs that show that the tank isn't included. At this point everyone in my family wandered off cause we were embarrassed of him (obviously). After arguing for about 5 minutes, he proceeds to try and steal the fucking thing and is now arguing with the dude and a security guard too. I think he eventually got the tank for free. The annoying part is that we already had a spare one so we didn't need that tank. In the end, all the fish we got that day died anyways :/ we have one from the year before that's still alive and pretty big, though now we have 3 tanks that we don't use.

Who was deathly afraid of thunder?(A)not enough information(B)Nellie(C)McDuffie(D)Sherlock [SEP] Hello I have a few, but they won’t seem so heroic to others. However, I was greatly impressed. One was with our Scotch Collie, Nellie, who lived to be 19 years old. She was the sweetest dog I’ve ever known. But, she was deathly afraid of thunder and of riding in a vehicle. She would become so afraid that she would shake all over and her teeth would chatter. However, she dearly loved us, and trusted us. More times than I can count, she would get into the car when we told her she had to go with us. I have always thought that is one of the bravest acts I’ve ever seen — to be that terrified, yet to do it anyway. Another involves a little Scottish Terrier, McDuffie (age 3.) When McDuffie was a wee pup, I was having an exciting conversation with my lovely wife. I tend to talk with my hands and arms waving around a good bit. Well, McDuffie saw this, and was concerned for my wife (McDuffie is her soul-dog.) He wasted no time running over, sitting in front of her, glaring at me and barking at me! I thought that incredible brave for the little guy. On another occasions, McDuffie and another Scottie, Sherlock (age 2) were in their kennel one night in our bedroom. I was standing in front of the television — a 65 inch flat screen. I was trying to swat a fly, and had my arm lifted back. About that time, a man came on the television screen, waving his arms. My little Scotties, trapped in their kennel, started growling and barking excessively at the man on screen. I thought that incredibly cute, but also very brave. These examples are not the pulling someone from a raging river, or stopping a bullet kind of bravery, but I think they are examples of bravery nonetheless. Peace	Nellie

I was standing in front of the television — a 65 inch flat screen. I was trying to swat a fly, and had my arm lifted back. About that time, a man came on the television screen, waving his arms. My little Scotties, trapped in their kennel, started growling and barking excessively at the man on screen. I thought that incredibly cute, but also very brave. These examples are not the pulling someone from a raging river, or stopping a bullet kind of bravery, but I think they are examples of bravery nonetheless. Peace	Dogs have different personalities.
The conversation between the author and his wife lasted about how long?(A)not enough information(B)An hour.(C)A few minutes.(D)A few hours. [SEP] Hello I have a few, but they won’t seem so heroic to others. However, I was greatly impressed. One was with our Scotch Collie, Nellie, who lived to be 19 years old. She was the sweetest dog I’ve ever known. But, she was deathly afraid of thunder and of riding in a vehicle. She would become so afraid that she would shake all over and her teeth would chatter. However, she dearly loved us, and trusted us. More times than I can count, she would get into the car when we told her she had to go with us. I have always thought that is one of the bravest acts I’ve ever seen — to be that terrified, yet to do it anyway. Another involves a little Scottish Terrier, McDuffie (age 3.) When McDuffie was a wee pup, I was having an exciting conversation with my lovely wife. I tend to talk with my hands and arms waving around a good bit.

When was the truck taken to the mechanic?(A)Before the collision(B)while the collision was ongoing(C)After the collision(D)not enough information [SEP] I was lucky. The deer…not so much. Fortunately, in my 28 year career, I've only ever hit one, which was more than enough. It was just before dawn as I was leaving the Proctor and Gamble plant in Neely's Landing, Missouri. There's only one way in and out of the plant and that's Rt177, a narrow two lane road with a culvert on each side. I was running through the gears bringing it up to speed when out of nowhere… BAM!!! I never saw it coming. As part of our training, in a situation like that, we're supposed to take the hit. The logic being, any damage the deer might cause would be less than rolling the truck over. I'm glad I didn't see it until I hit it, because I'm convinced my natural reaction would've been to swerve and, with nowhere to go but into the culvert, the end result would been disastrous. I pulled over as soon as I could to inspect the damage. It's amazing what a hundred pound deer can do to a 20,000 pound tractor. I caught the deer with the left front corner. The first thing I noticed as I exited the truck was the smell. There was guts, blood, and shit down the length of the truck. The plastic bumper was turned inside out and was rubbing against the tire. The headlight and fender mirror, aye, fuget about it…gone. The hood which is one piece molded fiberglass was cracked almost the length of the fender. To add insult to injury, the truck was only six months old. Fortunately, the radiator and air conditioning condenser remained intact so once I removed the damaged section of bumper, I was able to drive it. When I got it to the shop for a damage evaluation, they refused to let it in because of the smell.	After the collision

I pulled over as soon as I could to inspect the damage. It's amazing what a hundred pound deer can do to a 20,000 pound tractor. I caught the deer with the left front corner. The first thing I noticed as I exited the truck was the smell. There was guts, blood, and shit down the length of the truck. The plastic bumper was turned inside out and was rubbing against the tire. The headlight and fender mirror, aye, fuget about it…gone. The hood which is one piece molded fiberglass was cracked almost the length of the fender. To add insult to injury, the truck was only six months old. Fortunately, the radiator and air conditioning condenser remained intact so once I removed the damaged section of bumper, I was able to drive it.

What did the person sell to make money?(A)popcorn(B)not enough information(C)chocolate pralines and meat(D)cards [SEP] I’m going to be a drama queen here, and tell you of an incident that occured at the start of the year. As most students are from school, I was stressed, both from school and my life at home. I went to an elementary school called, Rödsleskolan. My class and I had planned an outing at an amusement park in Gothenburg (göteborg) which was fun to think about buy oh my god the stress. We had to sell meat and chocolate pralines to get up to our quota because each person payed for themselves, from what they had sold ofc. So I wasn’t that good at selling stuff, nor would I ever think to be in the future. But it was so ridiculous, I couldn’t sell literally anything. Most people had already bought food from other classes that planned the same thing. So the deadline was nearing it’s end and I find myself stressing out because I have people asking about the money, so I decide that I should take a walk to clear the air and my heavy thoughts. I walk near a gymnasium and a person walks past me in the dark night, me with my headphones on, blasting music in my ears. I get a bad feeling from the person and I turn around. Suddenly hands sneak around both my waist and mouth. I was pushed to the ground and the guy kisses me and takes my headphones. I don’t want to write much more down but that was the worst night in my entire life and I am still haunted by it. By my mom talking about that night sometimes to the paranoia that although had lessened since then, but still there when I take my walks at night with my dogs.

What is probably true about the author's home?(A)not enough information(B)It is messy and chaotic(C)It is noisy and full of people(D)It is quiet and peaceful [SEP] I am an introvert who absolutely loves the nature and animals. As I can easily be for days or weeks without seeing a human being, I struggle to be for a few days without having a contact with the nature. It’s the nature that brings me joy and happiness, that inspires me, motivates me and gives me strength. I am also an analyst, so my job is mainly in the cities. Nonetheless, I usually choose contracts (I am self-employed) that allow me, at least partially, work from home. Despite the fact that all the logic would say that I should be living in the city, I just can’t do it… I need my solitude and the support of the nature, therefore I chose to live on a rural property. There are 3 houses in my neighborhood, the closest is about 500m away from my home. The nearest town in 25km away, and the city I work in is 200km away. Almost every week I will get up before 3am and drive for 2,5hours to the city (I have to arrive at my motel before the peak-hour traffic starts). I will be staying for couple of nights in the motel (sometimes longer), work very long hours to get everything done I have to do in the city and then drive home again to enjoy my wonderful country life. I have been doing it for 7,5 years now. I think this shows how important for me it is to be living rural life. But why wouldn’t I chose it, if I can enjoy view like this every day: Or having a visit from a lovely friend - I love them very much, as long as they don’t destroy my gardens! Oh well, even if they do destroy them, you simply can’t get angry with someone like that, can you?: I think this little person also shows how relaxing the country life can be: No, I wouldn’t give up my country, peaceful life-style for a city- or suburban rate-race.

I will be staying for couple of nights in the motel (sometimes longer), work very long hours to get everything done I have to do in the city and then drive home again to enjoy my wonderful country life. I have been doing it for 7,5 years now. I think this shows how important for me it is to be living rural life. But why wouldn’t I chose it, if I can enjoy view like this every day: Or having a visit from a lovely friend - I love them very much, as long as they don’t destroy my gardens! Oh well, even if they do destroy them, you simply can’t get angry with someone like that, can you?: I think this little person also shows how relaxing the country life can be: No, I wouldn’t give up my country, peaceful life-style for a city- or suburban rate-race.

What did the analyst do to get to the city?(A)take a bus(B)drive(C)take a train(D)not enough information [SEP] I am an introvert who absolutely loves the nature and animals. As I can easily be for days or weeks without seeing a human being, I struggle to be for a few days without having a contact with the nature. It’s the nature that brings me joy and happiness, that inspires me, motivates me and gives me strength. I am also an analyst, so my job is mainly in the cities. Nonetheless, I usually choose contracts (I am self-employed) that allow me, at least partially, work from home. Despite the fact that all the logic would say that I should be living in the city, I just can’t do it… I need my solitude and the support of the nature, therefore I chose to live on a rural property.

Who entered the wrong classroom?(A)The teacher(B)The author(C)not enough information(D)The sister [SEP] This happened in my 2nd-Grade Primary school. We used to live in country side and will take about 45 minutes to town area. So me and my little sister have to wake up as early as 5am because we have to arrive at school before 7am. We usually sleep in my grandpa lorry during our journey to school. There was this one time, i was so tired and sleepy that when i arrived school and as i sat on my chair, i slept. Then, i heard someone is calling my name in my dream so i woke up and everybody in the class was staring at me including my teacher with her sharp eyes. I was still half-asleep. Haha So she told me to wash my face. As i am on my way to the toilet room, i think to my self, “ Why am i in school? I thought i’m in my room and now i’m here? Something is wrong!” After i washed my face and going back to my class, i’m still struggling to figure it out. Without any hesitation, i entered class and saw someone sit on my chair. So i came closer to the table and wish that the student would go back to his/her seat. But he/she didn’t move and kept glaring at me with confusion. I saw an empty chair nearby and sat there while everybody is looking at me. (The class was silent). Then, i slowly noticed that all the students in the class is not from my class. Finally i realize the teacher was in front glaring at me like she wanted to eat me. Then, my mind became clear and that i entered the wrong class room! So i quickly stand up and leave the class. I checked on the class label, it was “2BLUE”, my class is “2Red”. So i proceeded my class and sit, with all the confusion in my head and the embarrassment i felt that time. Hahaaha	The author
