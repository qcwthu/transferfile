Which of the following statements is NOT true? [SEP] Interviewer: What were the things in Britain that you found most strange when you first arrived? Mathew: Well, the first thing is driving on the wrong side of the road..., that would be the- that was very strange because you have this automatic reflex when you go out into the street to look one way and a couple of times I did that and I almost got hit by cars and bikes and all, you know. It's dangerous. It really is dangerous. And you have to teach yourself to look the other way. Interviewer: Someone said that Britain and the United States are divided by a common language. Have you had any difficulties with the language here? Mathew: Oh, yeah-tremendous amount of difficulty but I'm starting to pick it up now-all the lingo and slang and all those-but there's definitely a difference. Interviewer: Can you give me any example? Mathew: Well, the big-I'd say some of the biggest ones would be the word "queue" which means in America "line". I never heard the word "queue" before. Um-what you call "chips", I call "French fries". I never heard them called "chips". Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different. Ah-" crisps" which mean " potato chips" Yeah, that's - we call them "potato chips" or "chips" in America. You call them "crisps" here. So when I heard the word "chips", I was thinking of "crisps" and not French fry-you know-it's very confusing but-urn-but just some of the expressions like-er-" mate" you know and "love". Those-you know--they're funny. You don't hear them. You don't hear them in America. Interviewer: What about with young people-with people your own age-I mean, do you notice differences there? Mathew: I do notice some differences-er-I think-ah-I think the younger people in Britain are-they seem to be-much more radical than the younger people in the United States. I noticed that. Ah-the dress is different. You see a lot of-I see a lot of males here with earring in one of their-in one of their ears. You don't see that in America that much. Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women. Interviewer: You don't like that? Mathew: Not really. It's just my own preference. I like-I'd rather see different colors here and there-not all-not all one color. Everyone looks like Madonna. Interviewer: When you say "radical"-do you-are you just thinking of clothes or of anything else? Mathew: Um-no, I think-er-radical as in going against the norms-could you say? Not only in clothing but I think in politics too whereas in America-er-you don't find that as much. Oh, also, another difference is the young-er-the younger people are-they're more politically aware on a larger level. See a lot of the-a lot of the Americans- they're aware of-er-government of the United States and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in Europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run-not as widespread. Whereas here, I think that they- er-the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the United States and how it's run. Interviewer: What do you think the reasons are for that? Mathew: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run. And so many of our policies in America affect Britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn't work on the other level like Britain's policies don't-I mean, they can affect us, but not to as great an extent and therefore you don't hear as much about Britain and people don't know as much about it. [SEP]  (A) The Americans use "line" for which the British people use "queue". (B) The Americans use "French fries" for which the British people use "chips".

What was the woman's job? [SEP] M: Hi, Claire. How does it feel to be back on campus? W: Hi, Gee. Well, to tell you the truth, I have mixed feelings. M: Oh, why? W: I have this great summer job that I really hated to leave I worked at the wild life research center in Maryland. M: That makes sense for a genetic major. What did you do? Clean the cages? W: This is a wild life center, not a zoo. This place breeds endangered species and tries to prepare them for life in the wild. M: You mean the endangered species like the tiger and the panda? W: Well, endangered species, yes. But not tigers or pandas. I work with whooping cranes and sandhill cranes. I taught the baby crane how to eat and drink, and I help the vets to give medical check-ups. M: I can see it was hard to leave that job. But how did you teach a bird how to eat and drink? W: We covered ourselves up with cloth and used puppets made out of stuffed crones to show the baby chicks what to do. Then the chicks copied what the puppets did. M: Cloth? Puppets? Sounds like fun. W: It was. The cloth and puppets are the key tools. We all covered ourselves up, the scientists, the vets, the junior staff, everybody. You see, baby cranes will become attached to their caretakers. M: So if the caretaker is a person, the crane will stay in places where people are. W: Yeah. And their chances for survival aren't very good. But by covering ourselves and using cloth and puppets the chicks are more likely to seek out other birds rather than people. And their transition to the wild has a better chance of being successful. M: A chance of being successful? Hasn't this been done before? W: It's been done with sandhill cranes and everyone is optimistic about its work with whooping cranes too.

M: Oh, that's terrible. But how did you lose it? W: Well, as you know, I was with a friend all morning and we had lunch together. After I had lunch, I went shopping.

W: But I didn't find it there. M: And you went to the police station? W: Not immediately. Before I went to the police station I called my friend's office. No luck.

M: Some of these books aren't so old, though. See? This novel was published only six years ago. It cost seventy-five cents. W: Hey! Look at this! M: What? Are you getting interested in nineteenth-century plays all of a sudden? W: No. Look at the signature. Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover. It's dated 1856. Maybe it's worth something. M: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents. W: But if this is the signature of someone who is well-known, it might bring a lot more. I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars. M: Oh? I can hardly read what the one says. Who wrote it? W: The name looks like "Harold Dickinson". Wasn't he a politician or something? I'm going to buy this book and see if I can find a name like that in the library. M: Good luck. Your book of plays may make you rich, but I'll bet my seventy-five cents novel is a better buy. [SEP]  (A) The book with the signature. (B) A novel published six years ago.

I'm ... what am I? Three years older than you, and I can be blunt if I want. Besides, you used to say stuff like that to me all of the time. You used to call me fatso all the time when I was little. Andrew: Oh, yeah, well, to be honest, uh ..., I started changing my life .... yesterday. [ Oh good! ] I'm on the Wafu Diet. Andrew's Sister: What? I've never even heard of the Wafu Diet. What is that? Andrew: Ah, it's too difficult to explain. I found information about it in my junk mail the other day ... Andrew's Sister: What? You read your junk mail? No one reads their junk mail. Andrew: ... and I signed up for it, and it only cost $490. Andrew's Sister: You're serious? [ Yeah. ] Four hundred and ninety bucks? [ Yeah. ] Like every month or every week or ...? Andrew: I didn't check that ... ah, ah, but, but, but, but ... I think ... Andrew's Sister: Listen. I think you're getting scammed, and it sounds really stupid, so listen. I'm not fat anymore, so trust me. I ... if you want to lose weight, you need to do it the right way. Andrew: Well, like what? Andrew's Sister: Well, okay. Andrew: Okay, uh, well, look. Look at my running shoes over there. Andrew's Sister: Andrew. They're still in the box. ( Well ... ). Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful. It's great, but you also need to learn how to eat right. For example, you need to eat smaller portions. And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties. Andrew: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate! Andrew's Sister: Andrew! That won't help. Next [ Oh, next? ]. Oh yeah. So, first of all, smaller portions [ Okay. ] Then, you need to make sure you eat a good, well-balanced breakfast first thing in the morning [ I do that. ] and then you follow that up with smaller meals throughout the day, cause, you know what? If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks. [ Uh ... ] Andrew's Sister: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night. [ What? Like what? ] Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat. You have to throw away ... Oh my gosh! [ What? ] That's all you have in your freezer! You've only got ice cream in here! You're going to have to throw that all away? Andrew: It's low-calorie (ice cream). Andrew's Sister: Low cal. No, it's not low-cal. Look right here. Andrew! That's all the food you've got in here is ice cream. Andrew: Well, what else, what else? Andrew's Sister: Also, what else are you eating? [ Well, you know ...] I mean, seriously. All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? [ Well ...] Okay, you got to cut out the fast food. When you know the manger of McDonalds by name, and he's your best buddy on Facebook, you know that you're going to McDonalds or any fast food place too much. Andrew: Uh, this is going to be tough. Andrew's Sister: Yeah. It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables [ Oh, well. ]; cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day. Andrew: I don't drink five gallons. Andrew's Sister: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups! How many times do you refill them? Andrew: Well, then, drink what? Andrew's Sister: Water! [ Water? ] It's really good for you. Andrew: Oh, this is going to be tough. Andrew's Sister: It might be.
