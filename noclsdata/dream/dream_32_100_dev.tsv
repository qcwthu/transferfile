Man: Well, I worked full time, um, for a private language school in Tokyo for the first two years, and then I found a job at a community college. Woman: Oh really?

You've done a lot, haven't you? [ Yeah. ] So, what exactly, um, how did you teach and what exactly did you do? Man: Well, um, many of my students wanted to become chefs in restaurants, or they wanted to start their own restaurants, uh, and in our area, there were many, uh, tourists tourist spots.

Uh, you know, to be honest, we have fifteen people who are applying for this position. You've got quite a background, but why don't you tell me three reasons why you would be the best person for this job. Man: Um, well, first of all, uh, I understand that different students have different learning styles, and for that reason, I have used iPads, video, music, cooking, drama, role plays, and games to reach every student. [ That's good. ] And second, I have a background in academic and psychological counseling and advising [ Uh, huh ] ... skills that are often needed, you know, in working with international students. Woman: Yeah, that could be really useful. Man: Yeah, so you know, many of them struggle with, uh, emotional turmoil, you know, home sickness .... Woman: Yeah, coming to a new place ... Man: Right, so making the transition can be very overwhelming, and uh ... Woman: Good. So, what would you say would be a third reason? Man: And finally, I speak four different languages ....
