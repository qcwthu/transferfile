Who has a more developed culture according to the speaker? [SEP] M: Mary, have you ever wondered why some cultures have more proverbs than others? For example, the Mayans, the Incas, and the North American Indian tribes seem to have fewer proverbs than cultures like, the Arabians, and the Chinese. I wonder why this is. W: What would you say about our ... our own culture? Would you say we're a culture that's rich in proverbs or one that lacks proverbs? M: I think we, we have a rich heritage of proverbs - the Benjamin Franklin maxims, proverbs, wise sayings have been handed down to us. W: Well, I think the fact that we're no longer creating proverbs today maybe says something ... maybe perhaps explains to some extent why proverbs in certain cultures were not as extended or extensive as in other cultures. M: Mm, hmm. That's true. I wonder why we are not creating as many proverbs as we did in 1700s and 1800s. I agree with you. I don't think there are nearly as many. I can't think of any. I'm sure there are some, but I wonder why this is so. W: Yeah, well, I think we all know a great many proverbs. If we sit down, we can think of some that we can ... we can list. But we don't seem to use them to explain things. We find many times that they're used too much and too simple - too general. Today we're much more sophisticated, you might say, and analytical, and therefore we don't use proverbs to explain things the way, say, our grandfathers and parents did. M: Life is too complicated now to just quote a simple proverb to take care of things. W: Right, and maybe to some extent that's why the North American Indians and the Mayans among others don't have as many proverbs. At least there's no record of as many proverbs. Since their own culture ... their traditions were highly eroded and they were wiped out during this era of change. M: Well, that's interesting. [SEP]  (A) Mayans. (B) Arabians. (C) North American Indians.	Arabians.

Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working? Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?

I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday? Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations... Ross: 100?! Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people. Ross: Yes, but the room won't... Fisher: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.

Which seems to be most effective for many patients, according to Dr Stewart? [SEP] W: We all know that poetry is not everyone's cup of tea. But according to Dr James Stewart. M: Hello! W: Hello! If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr Stewart, how does poetry help? M: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er... W: I do, yes. M: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if... W: I think it's if. M: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it. W: Yes, I see. M: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients. W: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries? M: Yes, many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders. I mean their patients said that, that reading poetry made them feel less stressed. You know, almost as many said that writing it has the same effect. You see, some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily! W: Yes, it certainly is! M: Era. Others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers. And writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions. W: Em, that's fascinating! Can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way? M: Well, it's only a guess. But I say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the.., you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm. Now, I believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions, you see. W: Do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions? M: No, no, no. I think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed. People who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed, probably because they are in touch with their emotions. I mean they certainly don't need a doctor to tell them which poems to read. W: Thank you very much, Dr Stewart. M: You are welcome. [SEP]  (A) Listening to poetry. (B) Reading poetry (C) Writing poetry.	Writing poetry.
Where are the two speakers? [SEP] W: My colleagues at work say I should get a health insurance. What do you think? M: I think it's important. I can give you my insurance agent's card if you want.

W: Why is that? M: Well, it's because of the American culture. Americans think private companies can do things better than the government. So we depend on private companies for insurance. W: But isn't that expensive? M: You're right. It is expensive. And many people criticize it. They say it is not fair to poor people.

I lasted a year, and then I came back to the main campus and finished up as an economics major specializing in labor economics. W: Did you go right graduate school or join the army after you graduated from the university? M: Well, I went to Harvard as a graduate student in philosophy in 1936, and stayed there until the war broke out. I was drafted after I took my PhD exams in the early part of 1941.

You can find this name on the reading list. Doctor Seuss is his pen name. M: I love reading those stories as a child. It'll be interesting to read them now from a different point of view. I guess they'll give me a good idea of how children think. W: Those stories are also great for classroom use. M: How's that? W: Well, take a typical Doctor Seuss's book like The Cat in the Hat. It has a controlled vocabulary of only two hundred words. M: So that means the children get lots of practices using a small number of words over and over again. W: Exactly. In fact The Cat in the Hat was written mainly to show how a controlled-vocabulary book could also be interesting and fun. M: Well, it sounds as though this course is also going to be interesting and fun. I think I'll get started on those readings tonight. [SEP]  (A) These stories are interesting.

W: By not using too much water when we wash dishes, take a bath, and when we do other things like watering the plants outside. M: Oh, what else? W: When drinking or eating something outside, you should keep the garbage until you rind a garbage can to put it in. Because throwing rubbish carelessly makes our planet dirty, Do you like seeing rubbish all over the ground? M: No, I don't. Do you have any other suggestions? W: Yes, we shouldn't waste paper, because trees are being cut down to make paper. By saving paper, we save the forests where animals live. M: So how can children save paper? I mean everyday. W: Well, for example, when I was in kindergarten, I used to save newspapers so that I could fold things out of them like paper trees instead of just throwing them away. Now the children in our neighborhood collect newspapers once a month to take them to a factory as raw material. M: That's great. Well, thanks Catherine for your ideas.
