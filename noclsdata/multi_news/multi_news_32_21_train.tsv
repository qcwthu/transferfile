summarize: Image copyright IBO/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock Image caption Redoine Faid (pictured in 2010)      Rédoine Faïd, a French gangster who broke out of jail using a hijacked helicopter in July, has been recaptured.      The country's most wanted fugitive, he was detained north of Paris, reportedly with his brother and two men.      Faïd, 46, is a fan of gangster films, which he credits with teaching him how to pull off raids.      He was first arrested in 1998 for armed robbery. The 1 July jailbreak was his second and most dramatic escape.      He was sprung from a prison in Réau, south-east of Paris, by three heavily armed men who broke into the visitors' room. They then bundled him into a helicopter flown by a flying instructor who had been taken hostage.      Faïd had been serving a 25-year sentence for masterminding a botched robbery in which a policewoman was killed in 2010.      He was recaptured in the early hours of Wednesday in the town of Creil.      French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told Europe 1 radio: "We're going to put him in a high-security facility where he will be watched extremely closely."      Image copyright AFP Image caption Redoine Faïd was arrested overnight in his hometown, Creil      The arrest came hours after Interior Minister Gérard Collomb - the country's top law-enforcement official - resigned to run for mayor in Lyon, France's second-largest city.      The move is regarded as a fresh setback for President Emmanuel Macron, whose popularity has fallen sharply in recent weeks. The interior ministry will be temporarily headed by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe.      Who is Rédoine Faïd?      Born in 1972, he grew up in Creil. In the 1990s he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion.      He has said Hollywood movies, such as the Al Pacino thriller Scarface, inspired his lifestyle and some of his schemes.      During a 1997 attack on a security van, he used and his accomplices used ice-hockey goalkeeper masks, mimicking Robert de Niro's gang in the film Heat.      He later said he had watched that movie "hundreds of times" on DVD and once told its director, Michael Mann, at a Paris film festival: "You were my technical adviser."      Image copyright AFP Image caption Redoine Faid was placed on Interpol's most-wanted list after his 2013 escape      His fame was helped by a 2009 book outlining his younger days on the streets of Paris and his descent into the life of a professional criminal.      That earned him the nickname "L'Écrivain" - or "the writer" - among French police.      Timeline of a jailbreaker      Faïd's cycle of imprisonment and escape began with his arrest in 1998 for armed robbery and bank theft. ||||| A gangster who made a Hollywood-esque helicopter jailbreak has been arrested in northern France after three months on the run, sources close to the inquiry said early Wednesday.      Notorious French robber Redoine Faid was apprehended during the night in the Oise region north of Paris along with three other men including his brother, one source said, confirming earlier media reports.      A massive manhunt was launched after Faid's daring July 1 escape, in which two heavily armed accomplices used smoke bombs and angle grinders to break through doors and whisk him to a waiting helicopter.      Faid, a career criminal with multiple convictions for armed robbery, was sprung from the prison in Reau, 30 miles southeast of Paris.      Escaped French gangster spotted in car with explosives, narrowly avoids capture      Two men posing as flight school students, who had already taken an introductory flight, forced a helicopter instructor at gunpoint to fly them to the jail.      The terrified pilot landed in the courtyard -- the only part of the prison not fitted with anti-helicopter nets -- prompting a heated debate in France about whether the country's prisons are secure enough.      Faid had been serving a 25-year term over a botched 2010 heist in which a policewoman was killed, though he claims her death was accidental.      Around 100 specialist police were deployed to track down the 46-year-old, who narrowly avoided capture just weeks after his flight and had to abandon a car carrying explosives.      Manhunt underway for gangster who broke out of French jail      Faid had escaped from prison once before, for six weeks in 2013.      He has cited movie baddies such as Tony Montana in "Scarface" as an inspiration and said he discovered his "calling" at the age of 12.      In July, investigators found a stash of guns, masks and a cement cutter in the Oise region, which they believed belonged to his gang.      Weapons were also seized in the raid on Tuesday night in the town of Creil which unfolded without incident, according to the source. |||||	– In the Hollywood version, the criminal makes a daring prison jailbreak via helicopter and spends the rest of his life drinking wine on an island. In the real-life version, he ends up back behind bars. Such is apparently the fate of French robber Redoine Faid, who had been branded the country's most wanted fugitive and who police sources tell the BBC has been captured after three months on the lam. He was reportedly found early Wednesday in the Oise region north of Paris; the prison he broke out of was located 30 miles southeast of the capital. He was reportedly in the company of his brother and two other men. The AFP reports that on July 1, men pretending to be flight school students made their instructor land a helicopter in the prison courtyard, emerged with balaclavas, used a grinding machine to open the door to the prison's visiting room, and spirited Faid, 46, away. It was the second bold escape Faid has made: In 2013 he got out of a different prison using explosives concealed in a tissue box and was on the run for six weeks. He is serving a 25-year sentence tied to the 2010 death of a policewoman during a bungled robbery. As for what the country plans to do with him, Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet had this to say: "We're going to put him in a high-security facility where he will be watched extremely closely." (This fugitive managed to elude thousands of cops for weeks.)
summarize: Julian Assange, co-founder of WikiLeaks, has announced that the whistleblowing website is suspending publishing operations in order to focus on fighting a financial blockade and raise new funds.      Assange, speaking at a press conference in London on Monday, said a banking blockade had destroyed 95% of WikiLeaks' revenues.      He added that the blockade posed an existential threat to WikiLeaks and if it was not lifted by the new year the organisation would be "simply not able to continue".      The website, behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of controversial US embassy cables in late 2010 in partnership with newspapers including the Guardian and New York Times, revealed that it was running on cash reserves after "an arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade" by the Bank of America, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Western Union.      WikiLeaks said in a statement: "The blockade is outside of any accountable, public process. It is without democratic oversight or transparency.      "The US government itself found that there were no lawful grounds to add WikiLeaks to a US financial blockade. But the blockade of WikiLeaks by politicised US finance companies continues regardless."      Assange said donations to WikiLeaks were running at €100,000 a month in 2010, but had dropped to a monthly figure of €6,000 to €7,000 this year.      This had cost the organisation a cumulative €40m to €50m, he claimed, assuming donations had stayed at their 2010 level without the financial blockade.      Assange said WikiLeaks was facing legal cases in Denmark, Iceland, the UK and Australia, as well as an existing action in the EU.      He is also fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual misconduct.      The Guardian, New York Times, El País, Der Spiegel and Le Monde worked with WikiLeaks in publishing carefully selected and redacted US embassy cables in December, but have since criticised the website's decision to publish its full archive of 251,000 unredacted documents in early September.      • To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The refusal to accept donations has cost the website “tens of millions of dollars” in lost funding, the website said.      Mr Assange was due to make the announcement at a press conference in London at 1pm today , and appeal for donations to help flight the blockade.      WikiLeaks said “in order to fight for its survival” it has decided temporarily to stop publishing secret state documents, while it battles the financial blockade through the courts.      In a statement, WikiLeaks said: “In order to ensure our future survival, WikiLeaks is now forced to temporarily suspend its publishing operations and aggressively fundraise in order to fight back against this blockade and its proponents.”      The financial problems for WikiLeaks started on 7 December last year when Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union refused to accept donations for WikiLeaks.      This “unlawful financial blockade”, WikiLeaks said, “destroyed 95 per cent of its revenues”, leaving the website near-broke.      The website blamed the blockade on a reaction to its decision to start publishing the first of 250,000 leaked US Government cables days earlier.      The website said: “WikiLeaks has published the biggest leaks in journalistic history. This has triggered aggressive retaliation from powerful groups.      “Since 7th December 2010 an arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade has been imposed by Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union.      “The blockade came into force within ten days of the launch of Cablegate as part of a concerted US-based, political attack that included vitriol by senior right wing politicians, including assassination calls against WikiLeaks staff.      “The blockade is outside of any accountable, public process. It is without democratic oversight or transparency.”      WikiLeaks continued in its statement: “As a result, WikiLeaks has been running on cash reserves for the past eleven months.      “The blockade has cost the organization tens of millions of pounds in ost donations at a time of unprecedented operational costs resulting from publishing alliances in over 50 countries, and their inevitable counter-attacks.      “Our scarce resources now must focus on fighting the unlawful banking blockade.”      WikiLeaks said that it had “commenced pre- litigation action against the blockade in Iceland, Denmark, the UK, Brussels, the United States and Australia.      “We have lodged an anti-trust complaint at the European Commission and expect a decision by mid-November as to whether the European Competition Authority will open a full investigation into the wrongdoing of VISA and MasterCard.”      WikiLeaks is today setting out a number of ways that people can donate to the website. |||||	– WikiLeaks won’t be releasing any more secrets in the near future, Julian Assange announced today; the credit card companies have brought it down. In a statement, WikiLeaks said it was making the move in response to the “blockade” against donations established by banks and credit card companies. “We are forced to temporarily suspend publishing whilst we secure our economic survival,” its website reads today. At a press conference in London today, Assange said the blockade had shrunk its donations from more than $100,000 a month to around $8,000-$9,000, and that if the ban wasn’t lifted the organization would be “simply not able to continue,” according to the Guardian. What money the organization does have will now be devoted to legal action against the banks—it’s already taken “pre-litigation action” in six countries, including the US, the Telegraph reports.
summarize: Once upon a time in prep school, a guy in my class made up a girlfriend who went to another school so that people would get off his back about when he was going to start dating. Her name? Georgina Glass. It was comical, to say the least.      So, my mind immediately went there when Joseph Gordon-Levitt talked about his secret girlfriend during an interview with Howard Stern on Tuesday. For the first time in his career, he talked about his love life publicly, revealing he’s dating a girl who is not in the industry.      “I have a girlfriend but I tend not to really like to talk about it in public,” he said. “She is not in show business… The girl that I’m with, she really doesn’t want to be a part of [the spotlight]. You can imagine not wanting to have that kind of scrutiny.”      I don’t know, dolls… all of this sounds very suspicious to me. Even just the phrase “the girl that I’m with” sounds like she’s just a figment of his imagination. What do you think?      Stay up-to-date with your celebrity gossip! Follow me on Facebook and Twitter. XOXO ||||| Um, what?! (Can you hear all of the hearts breaking?)      It turns out Hollywood hunk Joseph Gordon-Levitt is officially off the market—sorry guys! The handsome actor's rep confirms that JGL secretly married his girlfriend Tasha McCauley on Dec. 20. during an intimate ceremony at their home.      The 500 Days of Summer star has always been very private about his personal life, but did make mention that there is a special someone during his first-ever interview with SiriusXM's Howard Stern Show in September 2013.      "I have a girlfriend but I tend not to really like to talk about it in public," the celeb confessed. "She is not in show business." He declined to say how long they've been together.      Gordon-Levitt repeatedly refused to identify his girlfriend at the time, though he did reveal that they met through "mutual friends." When asked if he's in love, he replied, "Oh, jeez, man! Come on! This is getting private." |||||	– Joseph Gordon-Levitt managed to pull off a secret Hollywood wedding. His rep tells E! the actor wed Tasha McCauley at the couple's home on Dec. 20. The actor has always been secretive about their relationship, like when he first revealed their relationship to Howard Stern in September 2013. "I have a girlfriend but I tend not to really like to talk about it in public," he said, declining to identify her or to say how long they'd been together. "She is not in show business." He also explained that his girlfriend doesn't want to be in the spotlight. So all we really know about their relationship is that they met through "mutual friends." Back in 2013, some bloggers wondered if she was even real.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced last December that the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, infuriating even Washington’s Arab allies and dismaying Palestinians who want the eastern part of the city as their capital.      No other country has recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and Trump’s decision has sown discord between the United States and the European Union over Middle East peace efforts.      “We are excited about taking this historic step, and look forward with anticipation to the May opening,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, noting that it will coincide with Israel’s 70th anniversary.      The embassy in Jerusalem will be gradually expanded in existing consular facilities in the Arnona neighborhood, while the search for a permanent site has already begun for what Nauert called a “longer-term undertaking.”      The interim embassy will have office space for the ambassador and a small staff and, by the end of 2019, a new embassy annex on the Arnona compound will be opened, Nauert said in a statement.      The consulate in East Jerusalem will continue to serve Palestinians, and for security reasons U.S. Ambassador David Friedman will continue living in the residence in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and commute to the relocated embassy, another official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.      A May opening is earlier than expected - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Israeli parliament last month that the move would take place by the end of 2019.      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Friday’s U.S. announcement as “a great day for the people of Israel”.      Palestinians reacted to the news with anger.      “This is an unacceptable step. Any unilateral move will not give legitimacy to anyone and will be an obstacle to any effort to create peace in the region,” said Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, who is in the United States until Saturday.      The status of Jerusalem — home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions — has been one of the thorniest issues in long-running Mideast peace efforts.      In a speech on Friday to a gathering of conservatives in suburban Washington, Trump recalled his controversial decision, saying he withstood enormous pressure to make the move.      “I put the word out that I may do it. I was hit by more countries and more pressure and more people calling, begging me ‘Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t do it,’” Trump said.

REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo      “I said we have to do it. It’s the right thing to do. It’s the right thing to do, we have to do it. And I did it.”      Clashes erupted in Gaza and the West Bank earlier on Friday, in a weekly protest against Trump’s stance on Jerusalem.      Palestinian health officials have said at least 20 Palestinians, most of them in Gaza, have been killed in protests against Trump’s decision since he announced it on Dec. 6. |||||	– May 14th is the 70th anniversary of Israel's independence, and it appears it will serve as another big day: the moving of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Per the Jerusalem Post, Minister of Transportation and Intelligence Israel Katz made the surprise announcement on Twitter Friday, tweeting: "I would like to congratulate Donald Trump … on his decision to transfer the US Embassy to our capital on Israel's 70th Independence Day. There is no greater gift than that! The most just and correct move. Thanks friend!" Although the White House hasn't yet confirmed this, an anonymous US official had told Reuters Friday that the Jerusalem embassy would open sometime in May. Meanwhile, Trump touched on the transition at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he spoke on Friday. He called the move "the right thing to do" and called the pushback against his decision "incredible," with other countries allegedly imploring him, "Don't do it, don't do it," per the AP.
summarize: I Don't Know How She Does It      'I Don't Know How She Does It' review: Sarah Jessica Parker is married & harried in romantic comedy      Craig Blankenhorn/Weinstein Co. Sarah Jessica Parker must answer to boss Pierce Brosnan in "I Don't Know How She Does It."      With Sarah Jessica Parker, Pierce Brosnan. Romantic comedy about a stressed-out working mother. Director: Douglas McGrath (1:35). PG-13: Language, mild sexuality. At area theaters.      If anyone out there is desperate for another "Sex and the City" sequel (anyone?), fear not: In "I Don't Know How She Does It," Carrie Bradshaw finally settles down and raises a family.      Well, not technically.      Sarah Jessica Parker is actually playing a character named Kate Reddy, who originated in a best-selling novel by Allison Pearson. But from the wry narration to the girlish mannerisms, Parker really does turn this film into "Sex and the Kiddies."      On the bright side, it's a lot more watchable than its awful trailer indicates. Director Douglas McGrath ("Emma") and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada") are both pros, with a crucial sense of empathy toward their hapless heroine.      A mother of two, Kate is an investment manager whose demanding job perpetually requires impossible decisions: Does she please her husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), or her bosses, Clark (Kelsey Grammer) and Jack (Pierce Brosnan)? Can she buy a deli pie for her daughter's bake sale, or does she have to make one from scratch?      While Olivia Munn, Christina Hendricks and Jane Curtin nail their roles as Kate's assistant, best friend and disapproving mother-in-law, the male actors - including Seth Meyers as her competitor - are afterthoughts. Only the always-reliable Brosnan finds some depth in his underwritten role.      Then again, this is very much Kate's story, and much to their credit the filmmakers refuse to judge any of her choices.      They do wrap things up with superficial ease, but they also find plenty of humor and poignancy in parenthood.      At the same time, they never shy away from the worry, guilt and criticisms so many working mothers experience. (If anything, they're too hard on stay-at-home moms, as represented by a vapid Busy Philipps.)      Unfortunately, Parker infuses Kate - a nonstop mess who's constantly apologizing - with such frantic insecurity that she comes across more as an anxious twentysomething than a 40-year-old mother. It's Hendricks who provides the welcome maturity, and I couldn't help wishing she had been given the lead.      But as Richard reminds his harried wife, "Sometimes okay has to be good enough."      Magic Moment: Any parent who's ever sung a lullaby over the phone will connect when Kate serenades her daughter with "A Bushel and a Peck." ||||| Thwarted by the same awkward timing that zonked "Confessions of a Shopaholic" two years ago, just when shopaholics began to seem extra-heinous, the film version of "I Don't Know How She Does It" doesn't know how to do what I think it's trying to do.      I think it's trying to acknowledge the real-world pressures shaping millions of women's work/life to-do lists.      When the investment firm wizard played by Sarah Jessica Parker tells a colleague she got into fund management because people today are "scared to death about their future," it's meant sincerely, and Parker — even in a disposable comedy with a puddinglike consistency and the aftertaste of something other than real sugar — does not oversell it.      Her comic and dramatic technique is formidable. If she can survive "Did You Hear About the Morgans?" and the second "Sex and the City" movie, she can survive anything.      Freely adapting Allison Pearson's 2002 London-set best-seller, adjusted to Boston and New York locales and a tougher economy, screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna has the devil's own time juggling agendas. It's the same for Kate Reddy, the Parker character, who must negotiate time-sucking work projects; a backbiting rival (Seth Meyers) and a demanding boss (Kelsey Grammer); the sweet attentions of a high-powered colleague played by Pierce Brosnan; and a tightly packed calendar involving two kids, a nanny and her super-easygoing-but-there's-a-limit husband, an underemployed architect played by Greg Kinnear.      The movie concerns three especially chaotic months in Kate's life. In addition to direct-address bits to the camera, the script relies largely on Kate's musings in voice-over, whisking us back in spirit to the comparatively carefree days of Parker in "Sex and the City" (which, on television, let's remember, was often wonderful).      But the comedy's forced and rather forlorn in "I Don't Know How She Does It." We first see Kate, who's Type-Triple-A, as she desperately repackages a store-bought pie for a bake sale to make it seem homemade. Old joke; no new spin. Each supporting character gets placed into her own little box, labeled "shrill, stay-at-home, exercise-mad mom" (Busy Philipps plays the queen of the elliptical machines) or "generically supportive best pal" (Christina Hendricks) or "workaholic assistant reminiscent of Emily Blunt in 'The Devil Wears Prada'" (Olivia Munn as Kate's driven aide-de-camp, Momo).      "The inside of a working woman's mind," one line goes, "is like the control tower at O'Hare Airport." True, and yet doesn't that sort of generica belong to the era of "9 to 5"? "I Don't Know How She Does It" condescends inadvertently to its female characters even as it flatters their juggling abilities. The story lacks the wit to say something about double standards or gender politics in a crummy economy. While on a business trip to Cleveland, Kate and the neutered version of Big played by Brosnan take a night off from their spreadsheets to go bowling with an alley full of working-class stiffs. (So that's where the middle class went — Cleveland!) This bit has a strange aftertaste; it plays as a ploy to "humanize" the socioeconomically advantaged.      Also, for a movie largely about temptation, "I Don't Know How She Does It" has a weirdly low sexual current. Whenever Kate and her husband argue about their dangerously low rate of intercourse or some other matter, the stakes seem low, the friction frictionless. The Brosnan character apparently has been keeping himself chaste all these years (since the loss of his wife) for That Girl — sorry, Carrie Bradshaw — sorry, Kate Reddy. I enjoy a lot of these performers. But performers can do only so much to specify what is not specific, or vivid. Near the end there's a series of glimpses of Parker and Kinnear beaming (high-beaming, really) at each other from across a crowded room. As much as I like those two, even in reduced circumstances, those shots are enough to make you urp.      mjphillips@tribune.com      'I Don't Know How She Does It' -- 2 stars      MPAA rating: PG-13 (R (for sexual content and language)      Cast: Sarah Jessica Parker (Kate Reddy); Greg Kinnear (Richard); Christina Hendricks (Allison); Olivia Munn (Momo); Pierce Brosnan (Jack Abelhammer); Kelsey Grammer (Clark); Seth Meyers (Chris Bunce); Jane Curtin (Marla)      Credits: Directed by Douglas McGrath; written by Aline Brosh McKenna, based on the novel by Allison Pearson; produced by Donna Gigliotti.

Still, it “should prove relatable to female audiences of a certain age and stage.” Other critics are less forgiving. “This vacuous farce has nothing original to say about marriage, working parenthood, child-rearing, or corporate America,” writes Claudia Puig in USA Today. And Michael Phillips, writing in the Chicago Tribune, calls it “a disposable comedy with a puddinglike consistency and the aftertaste of something other than real sugar.”
summarize: A few years ago, we were warned that the world’s helium reserves were running out. Today, researchers announced there may be several potential new sources of the precious gas hidden throughout the world.      Helium, which is used widely in nuclear, medical and party industries, has become worryingly scarce. Despite it being the second most abundant element in the universe, here on Earth it’s rare - it is so light that it leaks away into space – and our major resources are running low.            Practically all of the world’s helium reserves have been derived as a by-product from the extraction of natural gas from underground gas traps. “No-one could really pinpont where the next deposit would appear,” said Diveena Danabalan, a PhD student at the University of Durham. This has made it difficult to locate new sources of helium.            To make the quest a little easier, Danabalan and her colleagues have identified how helium makes its way into gas traps. They analysed natural gas samples from 22 wells throughout the US and Canada and discovered that wherever helium was present, there was also a second chemical that is only ever associated with ground-water.            Danabalan said: “This, we realised, meant that helium has to have been dissolved in groundwater and then transported throughout the US and Canada until it met a geological structure that drew it back out of the water and into an underground trap.” Danabalan presented the findings today at the Goldschmidt conference in Prague.            Since known helium traps appear in regions such as the Rocky Mountains that were formed from ancient tectonic movements, the team reckon it may have been these climactic events occurring 135 million years ago that released helium into the groundwater in the first place.            Since these tectonic events happened all over the planet, it means there is potentially several traps full of commercial quantities of helium throughout the world, said Danabalan’s colleague Christopher Ballentine of the University of Oxford.            The problem is finding them. “We need to study maps that have been made for that period that infer groundwater direction, which will hopefully allow us pinpoint geological regions that might contain helium traps,” said Danabalan.            The research looks interesting and is well done, said Jacob Lowenstern, a geologist at the US Geological Survey. “It shows that the accumulation of helium may occur in more geological settings than previously recognised.”                   ||||| Image of a helium filled discharge tube shaped like the element's atomic symbol. Image: Pslawinski/ Wikipedia. Helium gas - essential for MRI scanners, semiconductor manufacture (and according to some, party balloons) - may not be on the verge of running out after all. Previous studies had raised concerns that we were getting close to a world shortage of helium, but a new study shows that in many areas of North America, there is the potential for undiscovered quantities of helium to be associated with natural gas fields. This work is being presented in an award-winning poster at the Goldschmidt conference in Prague.      A group of researchers from Durham and Oxford Universities, led by Diveena Danabalan, analysed natural gas samples from 22 wells in the USA and Canada. Using mass spectroscopy, they measured the full suite of noble gases, with an emphasis on helium, neon and argon.      Diveena Danabalan said:"We identified neon isotope tracers which show a strong association between helium and groundwater. This means that in certain geological regions, groundwater transports large volumes of helium into natural gas fields, where trapping potential is greatest. This suggests that we have probably underestimated the volumes of helium which are actually available to explore".      "On a continental scale, and we are talking about a line running right down the Rocky Mountains, we are seeing processes which are releasing the existing helium which has been built up deep underground over hundreds of millions of years. In some places, like in Yellowstone Park in Wyoming, the deep helium is released directly into the atmosphere. In others, we are seeing that the deep helium which was released when the Rocky Mountains formed has percolated via the groundwater into the same underground reservoirs where we find natural gas. This means that there are almost certainly reservoirs of helium which we had not anticipated. More importantly, understanding how and why helium arrives in these reservoirs means that we now know where to look for new helium resources"      She continued:"Helium is the second lightest element in nature, it is so light that it leaks away into space. This is why it is ultimately a non-renewable, finite resource".      Helium is the essential for use in the MRI body scanners and superconductor production. It is also used in super-hi-tech installations such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which address questions on the origins of the universe      Commenting for the Goldschmidt conference, Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar, (University of Toronto) President of the Geochemical Society said:      "This work shows that the amount of helium which is available is greater than we had thought. Helium is essential for many things, with the most important use being in body scanners and in microchip manufacture. So in many ways it is essential for modern medicine, and perhaps even for modern life.      The lightness of helium means that it can escape off into space, to be lost forever, so a steady supply is needed. This work shows that it is trapped in natural processes, so the lightness of helium may not be as unbearable as we had thought".

ABSTRACT      Since its first economic discovery in Kansas in 1903, helium has become an integral resource for today's society. With known reserves declining, discoveries of helium are still only serendipitously found with some petroleum discoveries; there are no viable exploration strategies in place for helium. Radiogenic 4He accumulates in the crust during quiescent periods and is subsequently released during periods of active tectonism [1]. In the Hugoton-Panhandle He-rich gas field (Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas), 4He correlates with water-derived 20Ne. This relationship is used to suggest that helium released from basement rock is dissolved in overlying groundwater and then quantitatively degassed following migration and contact with a pre-existing hydrocarbon gas phase [2]. To test whether this mechanism is common to other helium-rich natural gas fields, we have collected 22 natural gas samples to analyse for noble gas abundance and isotope determination. Preliminary data from the Kansas Basin, Central Kansas Uplift, the Harley Dome field in Utah, and two exploration wells in Montana and Saskatchewan, Canada, have helium contents that vary between 0.009 cc STP and 0.080 cc STP. The helium isotope ratio, 3He/4He, ranges from 0.08 RA to 0.66 RA (RA = 3He/4Heair) showing a predominantly crustal He source with a small mantle input for most samples. Argon isotope (40Ar/36Ar) ratios range from 589-1435 in the Kansas samples and from 4586-8963 in the Harley Dome, Montana and Saskatchewan samples. 4He/20Ne in the Hugoton- Panhandle averages 3.4 × 104 [2]. Kansas samples range from 4He/20Ne = 3.5-7.8 × 104, showing the same degree of water involvement as the Hugoton-Panhandle for the lowest values. Harley Dome, Montana and Saskatchewan samples have 4He/20Ne = 1.0-2.3 × 105 showing a 3-7 times lower involvement of the groundwater system, consistent with the elevated 40Ar/36Ar ratios.       |||||	– Don't mourn the loss of your humorously high-pitched voices quite yet. Despite years of warnings from scientists that Earth's supply of helium is quickly running out, the results of a study announced Wednesday in Prague show there could still be large deposits of the element hidden underground, the Guardian reports. Helium, as important to the nuclear industry as the birthday party industry, is essential to everything from MRIs to the Large Hadron Collider, according to Phys.org. But as PhD student Diveena Danabalan explains, "Helium is the second lightest element in nature, it is so light that it leaks away into space." That makes it a finite resource, and most of the helium we've used so far has come as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. But "no one could really pinpont where the next deposit would appear," says Danabalan. That problem that led researchers to look at 22 natural gas wells in the United States and Canada. According to Phys.org, whenever helium was found in those wells, so were neon isotope tracers, a chemical almost always associated with groundwater. "This, we realized, meant that helium has to have been dissolved in groundwater and then transported throughout the US and Canada until it met a geological structure that drew it back out of the water," Danabalan tells the Guardian. Knowing how and why helium got into natural gas reservoirs means scientists have a starting point in terms of where to look to find new helium deposits. Now, they just have to actually find them.

Haitian voters will choose one of two candidates, Michel Martelly and Mirlande Manigat,... (Associated Press)      The election, already delayed by a political crisis, is also clouded with uncertainty over the return of ousted former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a popular but divisive figure whose mere presence was considered by the U.S. government and others as a possible threat to the vote.      Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, and Michel "Sweet Micky" Martelly, a star of Haitian compas music, emerged as the top two finishers in a first-round vote in November with 18 candidates that was marred by fraud and disorganization.      Lines formed before dawn Sunday outside polling stations as many people sought to cast ballots before church. As usual in Haiti, many polling stations opened late and workers could be seen setting up past the scheduled 6 a.m. start time.      Enso Jodin, a 36-year-old construction worker, was among the early-risers in Petionville, in the hills above the capital. He wouldn't say which candidate had his support, expressing only frustration with the current government.      "We're here to change our country so that our kids can go to school and people can get out from under the tents," Jodin said.      Whoever wins will face major challenges, including a Senate and Chamber of Deputies controlled by the party of outgoing President Rene Preval, who was barred by the constitution from running for re-election. They may also face a surge in cholera once the rainy season starts and anger over the fact that 800,000 people are still in what were once optimistically labeled "temporary settlement camps" after the January 2010 earthquake.      "Everybody is waiting for these elections to be done and nobody wants to make a move until they are," said Yves Colon, a Haitian-born journalism professor at the University of Miami. "Haitians are looking for someone who can take them out of this hole they're in."      The two candidates have similar agendas, promising to make education universal in a country where only half the children attend school, to build homes and to foster economic growth. Both have said they want to restore Haiti's armed forces, eliminated by Aristide in 1995 after a long history of abuses.      Their backgrounds could not be more distinct: Manigat is a 70-year-old university administrator and former senator; Martelly is a 50-year-old pop star who has no college degree and a history of crude onstage antics.      Some view his outsider status as an attribute in a country where the government has failed to provide basic services.      "We want to start with somebody who's new, somebody who hasn't been in politics before," said Robenson Naval, a 34-year-old unemployed plumber who lives in a camp across from the ruined National Palace. "We've been trashed by the previous political leaders. They took our votes and dragged them in the ground."      Ebert Cineus, a 28-year-old elementary school teacher, said he was concerned over Martelly's lack of experience.      "Martelly says he will send all children to school for free, but that's an impossible dream," Cineus said. Manigat "is someone who knows how to negotiate. She can get the international community to help this country change."      One of Martelly's most high-profile supporters, hip-hop star Wyclef Jean, was treated at a hospital for a gunshot wound to his hand late Saturday, a spokesman said. The details surrounding the shooting were unclear.      What remains a mystery is what effect, if any, Aristide might have on the race.      The former president, who was ousted in a 2004 rebellion, made a triumphant return from exile Friday _ two days before the election, sparking feverish speculation over his motivations and intentions, even though his party was barred from the ballot.      His endorsement, if he offered one, could be a boon for one of the two candidates. If he told followers to boycott the election, it could disrupt the vote and add an influential voice to critics who say it lacks legitimacy. |||||	– As his country goes to vote for the presidential race he was barred from, it's oddly Wyclef Jean who's instead making news.

summarize: ACSI: Car Buyer Satisfaction Rises as Mass-Market Autos Challenge Luxury Brands      Good News for Detroit as Domestic Automakers Improve; VW Sinks Amid Emissions Scandal      ANN ARBOR, Mich., (August 23, 2016) – Car buyer satisfaction rebounds as domestic and mass-market brands improve, according to new data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). Customer satisfaction with automobiles is up 3.8 percent to 82 on ACSI’s 100-point scale. Luxury cars have dominated the driver satisfaction rankings for years, but the top tier is now evenly split between mass market and luxury vehicles.      “The rise of mass-market vehicles may well be at the expense of luxury brands in the sense that buyers now see little differentiation between luxury cars and regular ones,” says Claes Fornell, ACSI Chairman and founder. “If there is little difference, why pay more? Exclusivity may not be enough.”      Among 24 auto brands tracked by the ACSI, 16 improve while 5 decline – 3 of which are premium brands. The most notable decline is for Volkswagen, which is embroiled in an emissions-cheating scandal that has angered customers, government officials, and consumer and environmental advocates. In a year dominated by improving customer satisfaction, Volkswagen drops 3 percent to 78, tied for lowest among mass-market vehicles.      “The combination of fines and fallen stock price are a big hit to Volkswagen’s finances, but it may prove even harder to recover from the reputational hit the company will take for deceiving customers and the general public,” says David VanAmburg, ACSI director. “Many customers or would-be customers could be turned-off of VW for life and it’s hard to put a value on that.”      All domestic automakers improve customer satisfaction overall this year, and the highest-scoring car is now an American brand. Ford’s Lincoln takes the lead with a 5-percent jump to an ACSI score of 87. Honda claims second place with an 8-percent gain to 86, while Toyota and BMW each advance 4 percent, placing these luxury and mass-market brands in a tie for third place at 85.      Lexus, which previously held first place, is now matched by GMC (+8%), Subaru (+2%) and Nissan’s Infiniti – the leading gainer with a 9-percent jump to 84. Audi (+6%) and Chevrolet (+5%) follow close behind at 83. The rest of the industry comes in below the industry average. The Ford brand edges up 3 percent to 81, catching up with Mercedes-Benz (-2%) and Hyundai (unchanged).      Nissan moves 4 percent higher to 80, matching Mazda (unchanged), while the Chrysler nameplate climbs 7 percent to meet Cadillac, Buick, Kia and Mitsubishi at 79. Acura loses ground, falling 8 percent to 76 at the bottom of the category.      “Year-to-date sales are looking pretty flat, and demand for cars may slacken some,” says VanAmburg. “But the good news for Detroit is that higher levels of customer satisfaction will make it more competitive.”      Among domestic automakers, Ford keeps its lead, stepping up to 84, followed by GM (81) and Fiat Chrysler (78). In comparison with foreign-made autos, which have long had the highest customer satisfaction, domestics are catching up, rising to 81 overall. European automakers also do better, matching Japanese and Korean manufacturers at 82.      This press release is also available in PDF format.

These are some of the findings from the 2016 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Automobile Report 2016, a nationwide survey measuring customer experience among the major car brands. Along with record car sales, customer satisfaction appears to have improved as well. Of the 24 brands surveyed, 16 improved their customer service ratings in the ACSI compared to 2015.      While American companies tend to perform poorly compared to foreign automakers, a number of domestic brands improved their customer satisfaction scores this year. Still, while Japan-based Acura had the worst score, five of the nine worst rated brands are American. Among the eight brands with the best customer satisfaction, three are American.

Cars are one of the most expensive purchases most people ever make, and American motorists expect their vehicles to meet certain standards. Performance and dependability are two important components of customer satisfaction. Not surprisingly, automakers with higher quality and dependability ratings from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power — authorities on product quality — tend to also have higher customer satisfaction scores.      In some cases, customer satisfaction is tied to less tangible attributes than vehicle reliability and performance. German automaker Volkswagen has consistently received high customer satisfaction marks over the last decade. However, after the company was caught in 2015 cheating on emissions tests for its diesel vehicles — a scandal that could end up costing the company tens of billions of dollars — customer satisfaction took a hit. This year, for the first time in a decade, VW’s customer satisfaction score dipped below 80, and is now second lowest in the industry.      Luxury brands tend to have higher customer satisfaction, likely due to overall vehicle quality and dependability, among other factors. Half of the brands scoring at least an 84 are luxury cars, while only two of the nine worst ranked brands are luxury makes.      Still, a number of mass-market brands have improved their standings with customers. This year, Honda and Toyota, two of the top-selling auto manufacturers in the world, ranked second and tied for third, respectively.      To produce the customer service scores in its Automobile Report 2016, the American Customer Satisfaction Index surveyed 3,776 randomly chosen people on their experience with one of 28 of the largest car brands based on U.S. auto share. The best rated cars scored at least 84, while the worst brands scored 79 or less. The benchmark for the auto industry for 2016 was 82. |||||	– It's not clear whether Matthew McConaughey's commercials have anything to do with swaying customer opinion, but a nationwide survey of nearly 4,000 people regarding 24 major car brands has found that Americans love their Ford Lincolns the most, 24/7 Wall St. reports. An American Customer Satisfaction Index press release for the 2016 report, released at the end of last month, notes that mass-market vehicles are catching up to luxury brands in terms of customer satisfaction. As for American brands, they still lag behind imports, but a number of domestic brands boosted their satisfaction scores this year. Here, the top five car brands: Ford Lincoln; ACSI rating: 87 Honda; 86 BMW; 85 Toyota; 85 GMC; 84 And the worst car brands: Acura; 76 Volkswagen; 78 Dodge; 78 Jeep; 78 Cadillac; 79 See which other brands made the lists at 24/7 Wall St.
summarize: A long line of Norwegians streamed into Oslo's cathedral Sunday morning for a service focused on the grief and need for healing after Friday's attacks that left 93 dead.Police searched bags as people entered the service, which was attended by Norway's king and queen."Today we are mourning. Today we want to stop and remember those who died," Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said at the service, as attendees in the pews wept.In all, 93 people were killed and 97 wounded in the Oslo bombing and Utoya Island shooting rampage. There are still people missing at both scenes, and divers were searching the waters around the island for bodies.Stoltenberg grew emotional as he recalled a woman named Monica who had worked at the island youth camp for 20 years. "She has died, shot and killed while she tried to create safety and happiness for young people," Stoltenberg said."Soon we will be given the names and pictures of those who have died, and then the size and scale of this cruelty will become apparent. This will be a new trial for us, but we will manage that one as well. In the middle of all this tragedy I am proud to live in a country that is able to stand at such a critical moment, to stand together."Also Sunday, Oslo Deputy Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said the suspect, Anders Behring Breivik, was cooperating, and that "the dialogue between him and police has been good."Police would not comment on the long right-wing online manifesto attributed to Breivik, saying only that it was part of the investigation.As for whether there was a second shooter, "we are not looking for anybody else, but we are working on the assumption there might be other people. ... We are investigating," Sponheim said.He added that 30 people were treated for injuries in the bomb attack and 67 were injured on Utoya island.Meanwhile, according to Reuters, a Norwegian daily reported that the suspect's father, who lives in France , said he is in shock and only learned of his son's involvement via online coverage."I was reading the online newspapers and suddenly I saw his name and picture on the net," the father told the daily Verdens Gang of his son. It said the man was interviewed "somewhere in France," where he is a pensioner."I have not recovered yet," said the man, who added that he has had had no contact with his son since 1995.In Italy, Pope Benedict XVI responded to the Norway attacks by urging people to renounce hatred.The pope urged people to pray for the dead, the wounded and their loved ones as he spoke Sunday to pilgrims and tourists from the balcony of his summer palace in Castel Gandolfo near Rome.Benedict said he is issuing a heartfelt appeal for people to "abandon hatred once and for all" and renounce "the logic of evil."Times wire services contributed to this report. ||||| The suspect charged with carrying out a massacre at a youth camp in Norway and a bombing in the capital, Oslo, says he acted alone, police say.      Anders Behring Breivik, 32, admitted to carrying out both attacks, which he described as "gruesome but necessary".      At least 93 people were killed in Friday's attacks - 96 have been injured and some are still missing.      He is set to appear in court on Monday but it is not clear if the session will be open or closed to the public.      Mr Breivik has said he will explain his actions in court, but a judge will decide whether the hearing is to be opened up.      Memorial services have been held across the country, including at the main Lutheran cathedral in Oslo.      Each and every one of those who've left us is a tragedy - together, it's a national tragedy Jens Stoltenberg, Norwegian Prime Minister Press digests horrorMayhem in the lake of tranquillity      Norway's King Harald V and his wife Queen Sonja attended the service, along with Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, laying single white flowers outside as they entered.      The pews in the church were full, with the congregation spilling into the square outside, which was covered in candles and flowers.      Mr Stoltenberg told the mourners that the two days since the attacks took place felt like "an eternity - hours, days, and nights filled with shock and angst and crying".      As many of those in the cathedral wept, he said: "Each and every one of those who've left us is a tragedy - together, it's a national tragedy."      Throughout the day people continued to pour into the square outside the cathedral, laying flowers and candles at a memorial for the victims.      Meanwhile more details have emerged about why the police operation to capture the gunman took so long.      Local police said a boat they wanted to use to get to the island was too small and leaky to carry personnel and equipment, and they decided to wait for a special unit from Oslo.      And asked why a helicopter was not used, police chief Sveinung Sponheim said this would have taken longer as the nearest police helicopter was at a base in the south.      'Good dialogue'      At the scene The blanket of flowers, flags and candles is spilling onto the street now in front of Oslo's cathedral. "There will be many more to come," says one young woman from Stavanger. "There are many more people who will want to come in the next few weeks." But they have already come in their hundreds. The people of Oslo have lined up since early morning and, even in the pouring rain, they stand in complete solidarity with the victims. "I hope something good comes out of this," Oskar says, "even if it's just better understanding of how we can deal with radical people like this."      On Sunday, police briefly detained and later released several people without charge in a raid in Oslo.      Mr Sponheim told reporters the suspect had property in the area of the raid and police were looking for traces of explosives, though nothing of value was found.      In an earlier news conference, he said Mr Breivik "admitted to the facts of both the bombing and the shooting, although he's not admitting criminal guilt".      "He says that he was alone but the police must verify everything that he said. Some of the witness statements from the island have made us unsure of whether there was one or more shooters."      Mr Sponheim said police were not looking for anyone else at the moment - though they had not ruled out that the suspect might have had help.      He said Mr Breivik, who has been charged over both attacks and is due to appear in court on Monday, had co-operated during his interrogation.      Mr Sponheim confirmed that the maximum time Mr Breivik could face in prison under Norwegian law is 21 years.      At least seven people were killed in the bomb attack on the government quarter in Oslo. Soon afterwards, 85 people were shot dead as a gunman, dressed as a policeman, ran amok on the nearby island of Utoeya. An 86th person died in hospital on Sunday.      The gunman was arrested when police arrived an estimated 90 minutes after the massacre began. Mr Breivik's lawyer said his client surrendered after running out of ammunition, but police later said he still had a lot with him.      At least four people from the island camp shooting are yet to be found; it is thought some may have drowned after swimming out into the lake to escape the hail of bullets.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Breivik's lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said the attack had been planned "for some while"      The BBC's Richard Galpin, near Utoeya which remains cordoned off by police, says that in the midst of Norway's worst peacetime tragedy it is a particularly harrowing time for relatives of the missing.      Some families are still waiting by the lake, he says, but others have gone home.      In Oslo, police said the death toll could rise further as bodies or body parts were in buildings damaged by the bomb but still too unstable to search.      Years of planning      Mr Breivik's lawyer Geir Lippestad told Norwegian media: "He thought it was gruesome having to commit these acts, but in his head they were necessary.      "He wished to attack society and the structure of society," Mr Lippestad said.      He added that the actions had been planned for some time.

Still pictures of him, wearing a wetsuit and carrying an automatic weapon, appeared in a 12-minute anti-Muslim video called Knights Templar 2083, which appeared briefly on YouTube.      A 1,500-page document written in English and said to be by Mr Breivik - posted under the pseudonym of Andrew Berwick - was also put online hours before the attacks, suggesting they had been years in the planning.      The document and the video repeatedly refer to multiculturalism and Muslim immigration; the author claims to be a follower of the Knights Templar - a medieval Christian organisation involved in the Crusades, and sometimes revered by white supremacists.      Police have not speculated on motives for the attack but the bomb in Oslo targeted buildings connected to Norway's governing Labour Party, and the youth camp on Utoeya island was also run by the party.      In the document posted online, references were made to targeting "cultural Marxists/ multiculturalist traitors".      Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat, correspondents say. |||||	– Reeling Norwegians gathered today to honor the 93 lives lost in Friday's murderous rampage, with Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg telling weeping mourners that even "in the middle of all this tragedy," Norway is a nation that will "stand together."

summarize: I thought I'd never see my cult leader again.      And then a month ago, he showed up on my bedroom television. His name is Victor Barnard, and he was on the local news because two women in Pine County, Minn., near where I grew up as a member of his Fellowship church, had accused him of sexual abuse.      He had allegedly chosen a group of adolescent girls—the daughters of church members—to live alone in the church headquarters, where he sexually abused them with their parents' permission. The women said he dressed like Jesus and called them "maidens." He'd been accused before of sleeping with his married female followers, but this was the first time his child sexual abuse was being spotlighted. An investigation was open against him, but nothing had gone forward.      But the news report brought survivors out of the woodwork. Follow-up stories were aired, and Victor Barnard was, last week, officially charged with 59 counts of sexual misconduct. He's now on the run from authorities—maybe being smuggled between the homes of his remaining followers.      I never had a sliver of hope that he would be brought to justice and made to answer for the horrific things he's done to those girls, it's hard to even now, it just seems too good to be true.      My family joined the Fellowship when I was five, in 1985. My mom lost my little brother in childbirth and our preacher at the time told her it was because God was testing her. That hurt my mother, who didn't want to believe in a God that would do such a thing. We switched churches, and got involved with a small Christian group that we called "Twig" or "the Fellowship." Twig was an offshoot of The Way Ministries, another Christian sect.      Twig was different enough for my mother. It preached love, not vengeance and pain, and, at least initially, it was warm and collegial. We became fast friends with another family, the Cheshires—my mother with Jean Cheshire and me with her daughter Jessica, who was a year younger than me. We'd have Fellowship on Sundays at a mix of different leaders' houses. It seemed like anybody who wanted to host and lead Fellowship could.            That was before Victor came along.            I actually know very little about Victor's background. I was so young when we got involved with Twig; it was mostly just my parent's friends who led Fellowship at their houses around Minneapolis. There were little pockets of us all over Minnesota, and eventually we all started to get together in the summer for picnics. That's when we first met Victor, and a few other families that seemed to be very closely tied to the Barnards. The picnics soon turned into weekend getaways every summer where everyone would show up, all of it organized by Victor.When I was 10, the Cheshires moved north of Minneapolis to a tiny town outside of Mora, and my family followed. We were very close, having attended the same Fellowship exclusively for several years now; we rented the house right next to their double wide mobile home on the same plot of grass.            A couple years later, in 1992, Victor moved up north too, to a neighboring rural area called Rush City. Another family the Barnards were close to, the Roarks, soon followed him and built a house on the same plot of land. Not long after that we all began to attend Fellowship at their compound, always in Victor's house and eventually led by Victor only.      Sunday Fellowship became restricted to just the Barnards' house. A slew of other new restrictions arose. We were no longer allowed to have friends outside of the Fellowship—unless we were trying to show them The Light, The Word and The Way. Victor required approval of what we were able to watch and listen to. At first it was just small silly things. We weren't allowed to say something was "awesome," because only God is awesome. Then my sister had to cut the horns off of her My Little Pony unicorns because it was a mythical creature and therefore "devilish." We also could no longer watch the movie Ghost, which wasn't a huge blow, honestly.      Essentially everyone was a mole, even our closest friends. If a friend from Fellowship told her parents that she watched something "bad" at my house, Victor would find out.      Victor's rise to power was gradual and methodical, starting at those group picnics and continuing long-distance even before he moved to Rush City. That's the thing about cults, and about predators. There's a slow but constant grooming. You don't really realize how drastically things have changed, so it feels normal. And all the while you're being reassured that what you believe in—what you've devoted your life to—is real and right. The more you commit to it the more Jesus loves you. The more Victor loves you. Victor became just as much of a focus as God and Jesus. After a while there wasn't a prayer that went by without the speaker thanking God for Victor before they said "amen."      Every Sunday the "horn of plenty" was passed around. It was nothing more than a wicker trinket from Pier One, meant for decorative purposes, but everyone stuffed 10 percent or more of their earnings—in cash—inside to fund The River Road Fellowship. I even put in part of my baby-sitting money.      Victor asked that our parents have us enrolled in the school system in Rush City, where he lived. I was tormented daily by the girls in my grade. Victor made me stay—because, he said, I needed to turn the other cheek and show them Jesus' love and forgiveness. I developed a horrible case of insomnia. My hair started falling out.      At this point Fellowship had become incredibly strict; my mother had been personally reprimanded by Victor for letting us watch Fantasia because it portrayed magic which is a tool of the Devil. While I was being forced to go to Rush City school by Victor in that same year it was also "suggested" that I watch a movie called The Buttercream Gang, over and over until I got it.      The Buttercream Gang is about a friendship between two kids, Pete and Scott. Pete goes off the Chicago and comes back "bad," stealing Scott's bike and selling it. Scott turns the other cheek. Pete sees the error of his ways and changes.      I am here to tell you as Victor's guinea pig that the turn-the-other-cheek shit does not work on eighth-grade girls in a small town. In fact, my Jesus-like approach only fueled their fire. And I was terrified of these girls because I wasn't allowed to retaliate. I was a straight-A student, and I faked illnesses and failed classes until my mom pulled me out.      Many years later, I was passing by Rush City on my way back to Minneapolis and I was starving so I stopped at the freeway-side gas station combination Burger King. I cannot express in human words how satisfying it was to hand my worst bully cash as she passed me a Whopper Jr. and fries. She didn't recognize me. I guess some of us make it out and some of us don't. I'm not a religious person but maybe sometimes you really do reap what you sow.      Eventually, my best friend Jessica and I were allowed to go to the adults-only leadership weekend retreat at Craguns, a resort in Brainard, Minn. At the start of the retreat, Victor announced that Jessica and I would be speaking in tongues in front of everyone on the final day. This was news to us. We were terrified.            We had watched the adults do it every Sunday, but none of the kids had ever been asked to do it ourselves. For the rest of the weekend we tried to slip away when we could into an empty cabin and practice our shubba-lubba gibberish so it would sound authentic. After the shubba-lubba-ing we knew we'd have to interpret the gibberish as if God were speaking directly through us. We tried to come up with anything that sounded like it came from the Bible: "I sayeth unto you, my children, I am the Father, and I hath given you my son to be your Lord and Savior, in his love and light you shall never be lost."            We dreaded it the entire weekend. When it came time to stand up I was terrified, and convinced that everyone would know instantly I was faking it. But the practicing paid off. I made it through, when I was finished my father was so proud of me he started crying. I've never felt like such a fraud in my life.      When Jessica was 13 she told her mother that her stepfather Dirk, who was also a Fellowship leader, had been sexually abusing her. Jean left him immediately. Dirk was charged and convicted with criminal sexual conduct, and when the case was brought to a sentencing hearing in Pine City, Victor showed up to testify on Dirk's behalf, and told Jessica that she needed to forgive Dirk because it's what Jesus would do. Dirk was sentenced to four months in jail, with work release. Last I heard, he'd moved to Kentucky and got a job selling used cars.      Things started unraveling from there. Victor told Jean that she needed to get rid of Jessica, and that Jessica should go live with her father in California because she was a bad influence. This was the final straw for Jean. There was no way anyone was going to tell them they had to abandon their children, not even the all powerful Victor Barnard.            So we all left. On New Year's Eve 1994, my mother was thinking about everything that our family had gone through in the past year when, as she puts it, "God struck me on the head with a hammer": Victor and The River Road Fellowship were wrong. We stopped attending Fellowship immediately, without warning or explanation.      A few weeks later my mother received a phone call from Victor asking why we hadn't attended. She told him God told her she needed to focus on her family; he retorted, "What about my family?" Another congregant, sent by Victor no doubt, came to the house and told my parents that if they didn't come back they would die like Ananias and Sapphira—the Biblical couple who held back on the profit of the sale of their land and were struck dead for lying to the church. This was their plea to come back. How will the Barnards survive without the tithe we gave every Sunday?      After the biblical threat came a nasty letter from Victor's mother, accusing my parents of abandoning her son and his family and the Fellowship. When we still refused to return, Victor himself showed up at our doorstep. My parents let him into the kitchen and told us to go downstairs. The three of them sat at the table, and Victor demanded to know why we'd left the Fellowship. My mother was terrified, but her strength outmatched her fear. She told him he'd have to answer to God for what he was doing—but he and my family were done with one another. He berated my parents more, and told my dad he wasn't a good father because he traveled for his job and wasn't around. But his threats didn't persuade my parents, and eventually he left.            Shortly after that we moved from rural Minnesota back into Minneapolis. We'd lost our friends, our community, our faith. I was 15. My mother was terrified that he'd keep coming after us, stalking and threatening. He probably would have if they didn't think we'd moved out of state. It took my mother several years to even feel safe. We hadn't gone far, and it's a small world even when you're not an ex-member of a cult.            Nobody had left, as far as I can remember, not before us. There were pockets of believers all over the state but the ones closest to Victor, the ones who could be controlled wouldn't even consider it. We were all so tightly knit and secluded in our Christianity, our beliefs. That's how he could threaten and deliver on us losing everything if we left; all the people we'd ever known would stop speaking to us, on his command. If people left after that it was only because he became even more controlling.            A few years later the Fellowship sold its property in Rush City and moved to a campground in nearby Finlayson. By 2000, Victor was living in a separate compound with his 10 Maidens.            Jessica tried to keep tabs on him over the internet. She tracked him through forums started by jilted husbands who Victor had weeded out by sleeping with their wives, and she learned that they'd sold the Rush City houses and moved to a campground in Finlayson. The forums talked about those "Maidens," daughters Victor was taking for himself, and we wondered how many of them were girls we knew and grew up with—the only friends we had at one point.            I don't know if Victor was already abusing children during the time we were involved in the Fellowship. I know that my sisters and I were never groomed or physically abused, but Jessica was molested by her stepfather, a prominent Fellowship leader on whose behalf Victor felt the need to testify in court, against a 13-year-old girl.            The warrant says Victor just stood up one day and announced 10 first-born girls he'd be taking to his private camp. Being the first-born daughter in my family I can't help but think that if we hadn't left when we did my name would have been on that list. So what do I think when I look back? That our parents saved us from unimaginable Hell.            Through Jessica's relentless sleuthing we found out that the reason they sold the campground in Finlayson and moved to Washington state was because those jilted husbands had gone to the Finlayson/Sandstone sheriff back in the early 2000s to complain about Victor and the cult. The consensus seemed to be that the sheriff couldn't do anything about what these women were willingly submitting to, but he did warn Victor that he knew what Victor was up to, and shortly after that the Fellowship moved out of state.            I am in total shock that he has a nationwide warrant out for his arrest. In all of my wildest dreams and fantasies (of which I've had many) I never imagined it would happen like this. He's a monster with a tremendous amount of charisma and power.            But what I personally went through is nothing—nothing—compared to the horrors these girls had to endure. I had parents that saved me from it; they had parents who served them up to it. It's unimaginable, incomprehensible. But it's the power Victor wielded.

Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was arrested Friday at a home in a gated community, said the Public Security Secretariat of Rio Grande do Norte state. A 33-year-old woman was detained, police said.      Both were transported to a federal jail in Lagoa Nova in Natal, awaiting extradition to the United States, authorities said.      Barnard is suspected of 59 counts of sexual assault in Minnesota. He is accused of sexually abusing two young girls who were members of his church, the U.S. Marshals Service said.      The last U.S. sighting of Barnard was last year in Raymond, Washington. The fugitive was featured on CNN's "The Hunt With John Walsh" last year and again last week.      Barnard was featured on the U.S. Marshal's 15 Most Wanted List along with a $25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. In addition to the sexual assault allegations, he was also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.      Charismatic leader      As a pastor, Barnard inspired his congregants with his charisma and apparent devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ.      "I had never met anybody that I thought loved the word of God as much as Victor Barnard did," said Ruth Johnson, a former member of Barnard's River Road Fellowship.      Barnard set up a so-called "shepherd's camp" in the mid-1990s in Pine County. Several congregants moved to the rural area about 100 miles north of Minneapolis to be a part of the camp.      In June 2000, the pastor allegedly convinced some members of his congregation to hand over their firstborn daughters to live with him in a secluded campsite.      Lindsay Tornambe's name was called, and her parents allowed their 13-year-old daughter to join the group of girls at the camp, called "The Maidens," under Barnard's supervision. She and other congregants said the girls got up early, sewed, cooked and cleaned.      "Everything that a wife would do, they did for him," Johnson said.      Barnard proclaimed he was Christ on Earth.      "He taught that in the Bible, the church was the bride of Christ and because he was Christ in the flesh, the church was supposed to be married to him," Tornambe said. "At that time, I didn't really understand the fullness of what it meant."      The complaint filed in Minnesota says Tornambe alleges she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of River Road Fellowship. She told investigators the group of 10 young girls and women were known as Alamoths, or maidens. Her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp, the document says.      Tornambe told investigators Barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania.      In fall 2011, Tornambe was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story: She said she was molested by Barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20, although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month.      Tornambe and the other woman went to the police in Minnesota. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says.      The ministry operated in a secluded area of Pine County from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012, Chief Deputy Steven Blackwell of the county sheriff's office told CNN last year.      The fellowship left the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry, Blackwell said. Afterward, The Salvation Army started running a family camp there. ||||| RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian authorities said Saturday they arrested a self-professed minister put on a U.S. most-wanted list for allegedly molesting two girls in a "Maidens Group" at his religious fellowship in rural Minnesota.      In this photo released by Rio Grande do Norte State Security secretary, American sect leader Victor Arden Barnard sits in a police station after being detained at Pipa beach, in the Northeastern state... (Associated Press)      A statement posted on the website of the Public Security Secretariat for the Rio Grande do Norte state government reported the arrest of Victor Arden Barnard, 53. The U.S. Marshals Service also confirmed the arrest in a statement.      The Brazilian statement said police captured Barnard late Friday in an apartment near a paradisiacal white-sand beach in northeastern Brazil. He was being held in the city of Natal to await extradition to face charges in the U.S.      Bernard, who faces 59 counts of criminal sexual conduct, was on the most-wanted list of the U.S. Marshals Service.      According to a criminal complaint in the U.S., two women said they were among about 10 girls and young women who were chosen to live apart from their families in a camp that Barnard set up near Finlayson, Minnesota, about 90 miles north of Minneapolis.      One woman alleged Barnard sexually abused her beginning at age 13 and continuing until she was 22. The other said her abuse occurred between ages 12 and 20.      Barnard allegedly kept the girls isolated, and U.S. authorities have said he used religious coercion and intimidation to maintain his control over them, calling it cult-like behavior. He allegedly told one victim she would remain a virgin because he was a "man of God," according to a criminal complaint.      Investigators believe Barnard abused other girls but have been unable to get others to come forward. Most of the criminal counts against him carry maximum sentences of 30 years in prison.      Cindi Currie, who said she had visited Barnard's River Road Fellowship religious camp in Minnesota years ago and tried to persuade a friend to leave the group, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper that she can't wait to see Barnard behind bars.      "He has ruined more lives. That man is the devil incarnate," she said. "I'm just ready to cry. I'm so glad they found him. Not only will Victor Barnard go to jail, but every adult who knew what was going on up there can start to pay, and maybe these girls can start to heal."      The U.S. Marshals Service said Barnard initially left Minnesota in 2010, before the women came forward, and his whereabouts were unknown for some time. It was believed he and his followers had moved to Washington state.      Brazilian police inspector Paulo Henrique Oliveira told the news portal G1, the website of Brazil's biggest TV network, that Barnard entered the South American country legally in 2012.      Authorities said Barnard had been living for at least six months at the apartment where he was arrested near Praia da Pipa beach, about 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) from Rio de Janeiro.      Taken into custody with him was a 33-year-old Brazilian woman. Police also confiscated computers, cellphones, pen drives and other objects.      ___      Associated Press writer Brad Brooks reported this story in Rio de Janeiro and Amy Forliti reported from Minneapolis, Minnesota.      ___      Brad Brooks on Twitter: www.twitter.com/bradleybrooks ||||| A Minnesota cult leader who had been the subject of a yearlong global manhunt was arrested Saturday in a beach town in Brazil.      Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was wanted on 59 counts of sexual assault on girls and young women in the isolated religious community he founded in Pine County. The U.S. Marshals Service coordinated with Brazilian military and law enforcement officials, who arrested Barnard early Saturday. Pictures of a handcuffed Barnard appeared in the Brazilian newspaper O Globo.      The arrest took place in a condominium by Pipa Beach, considered one of Brazil’s most beautiful coastal locations. Barnard was reportedly staying with a 33-year-old Brazilian woman who previously lived in the U.S. Federal police confiscated religious papers, diaries, computers, flash drives and cellphones from the condo.      Two young women have told Minnesota investigators that Barnard raped them after they were chosen, at ages 12 and 13, to be separated from their families and live near him as part of a cloistered group he called his “maidens” in the River Road Fellowship near Finlayson.      One of the women who stepped forward to report Barnard was Lindsay Tornambe, who was 13 when Barnard informed her parents that he had chosen her to join the maidens. She told Pine County sheriff’s investigators that Barnard raped her soon afterward, and that the abuse continued for the next nine years.      “I am ready to have him locked up,” Tornambe told the Star Tribune. “As soon as I got the news, I started crying. It feels so surreal. I knew the day would come, but it finally came and it’s almost numbing.”      Barnard used the charismatic hold he kept over his followers to sexually exploit girls and young women at his whim, according to court papers that spell out the crimes alleged by the two young women who stepped forward to report being abused.      Barnard, facing bankruptcy and law enforcement scrutiny, had moved his family and his remaining followers to Washington state years before Pine County brought the charges in 2014. He has been the target of a national and international manhunt ever since.      Tornambe wasn’t surprised to hear that Barnard, whose preachings were full of apocalyptic warnings, made his way to Brazil. Barnard had talked for years about relocating to a place like South America, where he had other followers. Pipa Beach, where he was arrested, is in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte.      “I’m not surprised he was there. … He had talked about, if things had gotten bad in the U.S., finding another place to hide out,” she said. The Brazilian newspaper reported that Barnard’s extradition papers to the U.S. have already been signed by the Brazilian courts. The Marshals Service confirmed that Barnard is pending formal extradition to stand trial for the charges in Pine County.      “I cannot wait to see that man behind bars,” said Cindi Currie, who visited the River Road Fellowship at the invitation of Lindsay Tornambe’s mother. She was so alarmed by what she saw, she tried to persuade the family to leave. “He has ruined more lives. That man is the devil incarnate.”      Years after her visit, Currie learned that her friend’s daughter had been chosen to join the maidens. Now, Currie said, “the day of reckoning has come.”      “Not only will Victor Barnard go to jail, but every adult who knew what was going on up there can start to pay, and maybe these girls can start to heal,” she added.      Barnard’s capture brought both relief and heartbreak to Ruth Johnson, who spent more than a decade in the River Road Fellowship. She and her husband left the group after the allegations against Barnard surfaced. They left behind relatives who “refuse to see what he’s done.”      “These young women, we thought their lives were going to be dedicated to the word of God,’’ Johnson said. “That was the intent for them to be together, and it went horribly, horribly wrong.”      Johnson said she first realized something strange was going on between Barnard and the young women after witnessing a strangely intimate moment. One girl helped Barnard into his coat, and he leaned in and asked her if his breath smelled OK, Johnson said. “The way they interacted with each other was the attitude of lovers, not a father with a daughter — like what you would expect with a minister,” she said.      Micah Vail’s family joined the group when he was 8 years old and stayed until 2009. With Barnard’s arrest, he hopes to put his time at the camp in the past.      “I feel like justice was served and I’m happy to see that he won’t be able to harm anyone else,” he said. “For that, I’m grateful.” ||||| Brazilian authorities said Saturday they arrested a self-professed minister put on a U.S. most-wanted list for allegedly molesting two girls in a "Maidens Group" at his religious fellowship in rural Minnesota.

Barnard was charged in April with 59 counts of criminal sexual conduct during his time as leader of the River Road Fellowship near Finlayson, Minn. U.S. Marshals Service / Reuters      Minnesota prosecutors called Barnard a "master manipulator" who persuaded church members to let their daughters, some as young as 12, live apart from them to fulfill what he preached was their biblical obligation to have sex with him, NBC News has reported.      The girls, who lived in a group called "Alamoth," were required to be virgins when they were "invited" by Barnard and were to remain unmarried, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.      Two unnamed girls are now adults but were 12 and 13 at the time they say Barnard assaulted them. They told detectives that Barnard preached that he "represented Christ in the flesh" and that because Jesus "had Mary Magdalene and other women who followed him," it was normal for Barnard to have sex with them.      Barnard would tell them "it was in God's Word," according to the affidavit. His control over his followers in Minnesota was so strong that investigators had trouble getting church members to cooperate. Barnard left the church and moved to Washington sometime around 2012 when the fellowship splintered over allegations that he was having affairs with married women.

Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was detained in northeastern Brazil, along with a 33-year-old woman, and now faces extradition to the US, where he'll face 59 counts of criminal sexual misconduct. He had run the River Road Fellowship in a rural area north of Minneapolis, where a former member tells CNN he kept 10 or so young girls and women as his "Maidens" to serve him, including doing all the cooking, cleaning, and sewing. One woman says Barnard sexually assaulted her between the ages of 12 and 20; the second woman says the same happened to her from 13 to 22. He disappeared from Minnesota in 2010 and arrived in Brazil in 2012. "Everything that a wife would do, [the Maidens] did for him," Ruth Johnson, the mother of the second accuser, Lindsay Tornambe, tells CNN. Now an ex-member, Johnson says that in 2000, Barnard convinced a few of his congregation's members to offer up their firstborn daughters to live with him on the campsite and to fulfill their "biblical obligation" to have sex with him, as NBC News notes; he also told the girls he "represented Christ in the flesh," the two complainants told detectives. Investigators add that Barnard's pull over sect members was so powerful that it was difficult to extract information out of anyone involved with the church. "I am ready to have him locked up," Tornambe—who told Pine County detectives that Barnard had started raping her soon after she joined the Maidens group—tells the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "I knew the day would come, but … it’s almost numbing." (Kehla Backman wrote for Gawker about how she and her family escaped Barnard's spell.)
summarize: Mount Ontake, Japan (CNN) -- At least 31 people are presumed dead after rescuers found them showing no signs of life Sunday near the summit of a Japanese volcano that started erupting a day earlier.      Police said the people were in a state of "cardiac arrest," meaning that they were discovered without a pulse and weren't breathing but hadn't been declared dead by a doctor.      A coroner confirmed the first four deaths Sunday.      Rescue teams had begun searching Sunday for dozens of climbers who were caught by the sudden eruption of Mount Ontake.      The volcano in central Japan unleashed a huge cloud of ash late Saturday morning that billowed down the mountainside and engulfed hikers in its path. Witnesses described hearing a sound like thunder when the eruption began.      The exact number of people unaccounted for was unclear, as officials were uncertain how many had already made it off the mountain.      Desperate relatives      Relatives of the missing gathered near Mount Ontake on Sunday desperately seeking information. Among them was Kiyokazu Tokoro from nearby Aichi prefecture, whose son, Yuki, was hiking on the volcano with his girlfriend.      He said he knew they were near the summit at the time of the eruption because his son's girlfriend had sent a photo to a friend minutes beforehand.      "All I can do is beg for your help to get information," he told CNN. "Please help us."      Authorities estimated there were 200 to 250 hikers in the area at the time of the eruption. Most of them were reported to have managed to make the long trek down the mountain.      But some people remained trapped in several lodges on Mount Ontake, and others were missing altogether, local authorities said.      More than 350 rescue workers -- a mix of police, firefighters and military personnel -- began climbing two separate routes up the mountain on Sunday morning, authorities in the nearby village of Otaki said.      Alert level raised      Aside from those in cardiac arrest, more than 25 people were reported to have been injured, 10 of them seriously, according to the government of Nagano prefecture, where the volcano is situated. Helicopters ferried some injured people off the mountainside.      Among the climbers trapped in the cottages, at least 11 were injured, officials in Otaki said. They said they had observed 17-20 inches (40-50 centimeters) of volcanic ash covering the ground in some areas.      The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3. That means the public is advised to not approach the volcano, the summit of which is at an altitude of 10,060 feet (3,067 meters).      The agency warned that another large eruption could take place in the next six days or so. Small continuous eruptions continued Sunday.      The volcano's plume of smoke and ash was reported to have disrupted air travel in Japan, causing delays at several airports.      Popular destination      Mount Ontake, the second tallest volcano in Japan, after Mount Fuji, is a popular destination for hikers, especially in the fall when the foliage's rich autumn colors are on display.      About 250 people living near the mountain have decided to remain in their homes, police said.      The last major eruption of Mount Ontake, which is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Tokyo, took place in 1979, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institute.      That eruption lasted months, spewing out more than 200,000 tons of ash, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.      Smaller scale activity was reported in 1984, 1991 and 2007.      CNN's Will Ripley reported from Mount Ontake, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report. ||||| Plumes of smoke and ash billow from Mount Ontake as it continues to erupt in central Japan, Sunday, Sept. 28, 2014.

Nagano prefecture posted on its website that about 30 people had heart and lung failure, the customary way for Japanese authorities to describe a body until police doctors can examine it. At least four of the victims were being brought down from Mount Ontake on Sunday afternoon, one day after the volcano erupted.      A Nagano police official described the number of unconscious people as more than 30. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly.      Mount Ontake in central Japan erupted shortly before noon Saturday, spewing large white plumes of gas and ash high into the sky and blanketing the surrounding area in ash. The mountain is a popular climbing destination, and at least 250 people were initially trapped on the slopes, though most made their way down by Saturday night.      Before the unconscious victims were found, Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said that 45 people had been reported missing. The exact location of the bodies and their identities were not immediately known.      Keita Ushimaru, an official in nearby Kiso town, said that Nagano crisis management officials had informed the town that at least four people with heart and lung failure were being brought down to the town, and that there were others in the same condition. The journey was expected to take about three hours.      Rescue workers were also trying to help injured people and others who had been stranded on the mountain overnight, many taking refuge in mountain lodges. Some were unable to descend on their own, or unwilling to take the risk.      Military helicopters plucked seven people off the mountainside earlier Sunday, and workers were helping others make their way down the slopes. One woman was being carried on a stretcher, and a man with a broken arm was walking down.      Seven people were picked up in three helicopter trips, said Defense Ministry official Toshihiko Muraki. All are conscious and can walk, though details of their conditions were unclear, he said.      Japanese television footage showed a soldier descending from a helicopter to an ash-covered slope, helping latch on a man and then the two of them being pulled up.      The Self-Defense Force, as Japan's military is called, has deployed seven helicopters and 250 troops. Police and fire departments are also taking part in the rescue effort.      A large plume, a mixture of white and gray, continued to rise from the ash-covered summit of 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake on Sunday, visible from the nearby village of Otaki. A convoy of red fire trucks, sirens blaring, and rescue workers on foot headed past barriers into the restricted zone around the mountain.      Shinichi Shimohara, who works at a shrine at the foot of the mountain, said he was on his way up Saturday morning when he heard a loud noise that sounded like strong winds followed by "thunder" as the volcano erupted.      "For a while I heard thunder pounding a number of times," he said. "Soon after, some climbers started descending. They were all covered with ash, completely white. I thought to myself, this must be really serious."      Mount Ontake, about 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of Tokyo, sits on the border of Nagano and Gifu prefectures, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. The volcano's last major eruption was in 1979.      ___      Associated Press videojournalist Emily Wang in Otaki, Japan, contributed to this report. |||||	– Rescuers at the scene of a Japanese volcano that unexpectedly erupted yesterday have now found at least 30 people described as suffering cardiac and pulmonary failure, reports CNN; that's what the AP calls "the customary way for Japanese authorities to describe a body" until it can be declared dead by a doctor. "We have confirmed that more than 30 individuals in cardiac arrest have been found near the summit" of Mount Ontake, a police rep in Nagano tells the AFP, as per the BBC. Some 45 to 50 people were thought to have remained on the volcano overnight; search efforts resumed at daylight, and seven people were reported to have been rescued via helicopter. Bodies were being brought down the mountainside in a trek that takes about three hours, notes the AP. Up to eight inches of ash is covering Mount Ontake, adds the BBC.
summarize: Facebook has come under fire from privacy advocates, users, and now even US senators for what many believe is the site's lack of concern for protecting user privacy.      So how much does Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg care about your privacy on his social network?      Not much at all, according to a Facebook employee interviewed by the New York Times' Nick Bilton.      Bilton posted a tweet Wednesday that read:      Off record chat w/ Facebook employee. Me: How does Zuck feel about privacy? Response: [laughter] He doesn't believe in it.      The Facebook employee's claim rings true with the view on privacy Zuckerberg articulated earlier this year.      During an interview with TechCrunch, Zuckerberg revealed that he had taken an "about face" on privacy and argued that privacy was no longer a "social norm."      "People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people," Zuckerberg said. "That social norm is just something that has evolved over time."      Earlier this month, Facebook unveiled a number of major changes to its site, which will more widely share user activity and profile information--with other sites, advertisers, and other parties. (See our guide to the changes and what they mean for you)      Wired suggests how users might tweak their online behavior given Zuckerberg's stance: ||||| Facebook users who choose not to link their user accounts to Facebook's public Pages are ending up with blank profiles containing no information at all. If you haven't experienced this problem, it's probably thanks to the somewhat high-pressure tactics Facebook is using to get you to accept these changes.      The next time you visit your Profile page (if you haven't done so already), you'll be introduced to the new "Connected Profiles" option, one of the many potentially concerning privacy-related changes announced at Facebook's f8 developer conference last week. With this option, the text in your Facebook profile section where you list your hometown, education, work and interests, is now being linked to the respective pages on Facebook. So for example, if you live in New York, that's linked directly to a page for New York. If your favorite TV show is "Lost," you'll be linked to that show's page, and so on.      Those who choose not to link, though, are informed via a Facebook pop-up box that their Profile page will be left empty.      Your Profile Gets More Connected      According to news posted on Facebook's official company blog last week, the Connected Profiles option offers more than "just boring text," wrote Facebook software engineer Alex Li. "These connections are actually Pages, so your profile will become immediately more connected to the places, things and experiences that matter to you," Li says.      Sounds good, right?      Well, maybe not. Whether or not this change is actually an improvement for the social network's end users is still up for debate. For starters, many Facebook users had included in their profile section witty sayings and other text that couldn't be exactly matched up with a Facebook Page. Now, if you want to express yourself in this more "free-form" way, you'll have to do so in the "Bio" section of your Profile instead.      That may be bit of an inconvenience, but it's not necessarily the most concerning aspect of the new Connected Profiles. It's their by default public nature that's most troubling.      How Connected Profiles Work      When you revisit your Profile page, explained Li on the Facebook blog, you'll see a box pop-up asking you to link your profile to Pages that reflect your listed interests and affiliations. You can either pick some of these pages or click "Link All to My Profile" to accept all of Facebook's suggestions.      Yet in examining the design of the pop-up box itself, it's clear that it's been crafted so that the "Link All" button, shaded in blue, is the option hurried users will click in an effort to get back to what they were doing - attempting to edit their profile.      Years of poor web experiences filled with pop-up ads, long user agreements no one reads and unnecessary screens on software installations that seem to serve no purpose but to have you click the "Next" button have created a certain type of blindness to pop-up text on the web. Instead of thoughtfully considering the options, a majority of users simply click the button that makes the message go away. You can bet that Facebook is counting on precisely this behavior regarding the new Profiles.      Opting-Out a Poor Option      But even for those who actually do consider the implications of everything about themselves being made public, they'll soon encounter another issue. Something that Li didn't explain in the cheery blog post was what would happen if you refused to link to these new Pages: your profile information will be removed and your profile page will be left empty.      According to a FAQ from Facebook's Help Center:      "If you don't want to connect to any Pages, the corresponding sections on your Profile will be empty. Connecting to Pages will now be the main way to express yourself on your profile, and you can always edit your profile to remove specific suggested Pages that you don't want to connect to."      This isn't a forced "opt-in," like the instant personalization option that's currently being examined by several U.S. senators, including Charles Schumer, Michael Bennet, Mark Begich and Al Franken, but it certainly feels like an arm-twisting on Facebook's part. It makes opting-out a poor choice, one that degrades the overall Facebook experience.      Making Your Interests Public      That's not to say that this forced link-building doesn't have its pluses - Facebook can now build a web of connections from people to their interests and then allow those details to be shared with the "instantly personalized" websites like Pandora and Yelp. If you leave the privacy issues aside momentarily, you'll see that does offer some intriguing possibilities for a more social web. In addition, other sites can offer Facebook "like imports," an optional feature that would allow you to immediately get a web service up to speed on who you are and what you're into. This is a great feature for recommendation-type sites like Lunch.com, for instance, which is implementing this option today.      However, the high-pressure tactics being used to get people to link to Facebook Pages are a good example of how Facebook is coyly forcing people to go public with their previously more private, personal data. Although the pop-up box quietly warns "Remember, your Pages are public," few Facebook users will likely take note of that text. (After all, if thousands of people managed to confuse this blog with Facebook, we doubt they can grasp the finer points of data privacy.)      So what should your takeaway be from all this mess? Look before you link.      In fact, it may be best if you just assume that everything on Facebook will be public from now on and act accordingly. |||||	– Two dispatches today from the Facebook privacy wars: In an off-the-record conservation with a New York Times reporter, a Facebook employee laughed when asked how Mark Zuckerberg feels about privacy: "He doesn't believe in it." The reporter tweeted about the exchange, and Bianca Bosker of the Huffington Post notes that it jibes with Zuckerberg's theory that the idea of privacy is evolving and people don't get too worked up about it anymore. Over at TechCrunch, Sarah Perez complains about the "high-pressure tactics" Facebook is using to get people to link their user accounts to its public pages. "Even for those who actually do consider the implications of everything about themselves being made public, they'll soon encounter another issue.

summarize: Texans try to lure Sriracha hot sauce maker from California      IRWINDALE, California — Dallas-area State Rep. Jason Villalba led a team of state officials to California on Monday to meet with the owner of Sriracha hot sauce, which is considering moving after a high-profile backlash from local government.      Villalba, State Sen. Carlos Uresti, and State Rep. Hubert Vo — along with officials from the governor’s office, the attorney general’s office and the Texas Department of Agriculture — met with David Tran, owner of Huy Fong Foods, on Monday morning.      Rep. Villalba and state leaders then met privately with Tran to discuss possibilities of getting Huy Fong Foods to Texas.      Uresti and Villalba held a news conference after the visit to extol the virtues of doing business in their state.      "We're not here to offer any specific incentives, but just to let it be known there are incentives," Uresti said. He and Villalba noted Texas has no personal income tax, among other benefits.      Tran said Texas must prove it can grow chili peppers as hot as the hybrid jalapenos he gets from a farm that specifically developed them to make his Sriracha sauce the hottest possible.      "If there is not chili peppers, we cannot build the plant," he told reporters.      Although Tran had the Texas flag flying outside the facility on Monday, he said it was just meant to welcome his visitors. Inside the plant's employee parking lot, and out of public view, a large sign declared, "No Tear Gas Made Here."      Villalba had pushed for a meeting with Huy Fong Foods for several months.      The hot sauce maker is considering leaving California after neighbors there started complaining last fall that strong spicy fumes were making the plant a public nuisance.      In November, the city sued and won a temporary, partial shutdown.      On Wednesday, the Irwindale City Council will hold a hearing to decide whether to officially declare the Sriracha plant a public nuisance.      If city officials declare the factory a public nuisance, Huy Fong officials will have a set period of time to comply with the city's demands to address the odor issue, according to The Los Angeles Times.      It’s uncertain if Huy Fong Foods will actually move from its four-year-old factory, just east of Los Angeles but the company could expand operations, Villalba said, and build a new plant in Texas as the condiment becomes more popular.      The visit by the Texas delegation is getting extra attention in Southern California -- especially after Toyota announced it was moving its North America headquarters from Torrance, Calif. to Plano.      Though he represents North Texas, Villalba said San Antonio and cities in the Rio Grande Valley would likely be most suitable for Huy Fong Foods.      Gov. Rick Perry has made news traveling the country touting Texas’ business-friendly climate, but few other state leaders have done so – much less Villalba, a freshman legislator.      The Republican, representing District 114 in Dallas, has spent the last few months raising his profile.      Earlier this year, he reached out to the four candidates in his party running for lieutenant governor, asking them to tone down their immigration rhetoric worrying that it could have a backlash for the GOP. Villalba told WFAA-TV’s Inside Texas Politics that he even spoke privately with Sen. Dan Patrick before his highly publicized immigration debate with San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro.      Villalba has also spoken to conservative groups about the need to include more Latinos in the Republican Party.      The Associated Press contributed to this report.      E-mail: jwhitely@wfaa.com ||||| Sriracha-Maker Says Factory Will Remain In California      i itoggle caption Nick Ut/AP Nick Ut/AP      Sriracha hot sauce-maker Huy Fong Foods has been tussling with the City Council of Irwindale, Calif., near Los Angeles for months now over whether the factory's spicy smells harm its neighbors. There have been legal action and suggested fixes, but also pleas from other cities for the company to consider moving there.      David Tran, the CEO of Huy Fong, says he escaped from Vietnam almost 35 years ago to be free of the communist government there and its many intrusions.      "Today, I feel almost the same. Even now, we live in [the] U.S.A., and my feeling, the government, not a big difference," Tran says.      Irwindale's city attorney, Fred Galante, says the city loves having the cult condiment factory but must pay attention to the health of residents.      "It's difficult to tell a resident that suffers from asthma or their child that suffers from asthma, 'Sorry, we do not want to be considered business-unfriendly; just keep your child indoors,' " Galante says.      It's a tough call, because Sriracha is a glamorous commodity. Bon Appetit named it one of its favorite foods last year. Chiliheads began to hoard it when it looked like Huy Fong might be forced to stop making it.      Food writer Andrea Nguyen says Huy Fong Sriracha appeals to a certain palate.      "For people who are seeking to turn their bland food into bold food very quickly, the Huy Fong stuff will definitely do it," Nguyen says.      The Huy Fong stuff is now an $80 million business, made in a 600,000-square-foot plant.      Tran designed the plant to be self-sufficient. The peppers are ground here and stored in huge plastic tubs manufactured on-site. The sauce is mixed and bottled on-site. Even the machines are repaired on-site.      Sitting in his conference room, where a credenza displays the three chili sauces Huy Fong makes, Tran refers to the plant he designed to his specifications as his "loved one."      And he's wounded that Irwindale's government is finding his loved one not so attractive anymore. But there are other suitors. Since the rumble with Irwindale, almost two dozen cities have urged Tran to relocate to their part of the country. For a while, he actually considered it.      Galante says the problem can be fixed, and he hopes it doesn't come to a move.      "We continue to try to work this out informally," he says.      And after thinking it over, Tran has decided to stay in his Irwindale factory. He has lived in California for more than 30 years, and he says he's not planning to move.      But he might open another site, outside Southern California. An additional location would allow him to keep up with the ever-growing demand for Sriracha and develop an added source for peppers, in case climate change threatens his current supply.      There is also the allure of less regulation.      On Monday, Texas state Rep. Jason Villalba is visiting with a contingent of business and agricultural people to urge Tran to consider expanding to the Lone Star State. Soon they will be countered by Rep. Tony Cardenas, who'd like to keep the business in Southern California, if not his San Fernando Valley district — all promising to do right by Tran's loved one. ||||| Craig Underwood stands by his farm field near Piru that was recently planted with chili peppers that will be used to make Sriracha hot sauce, Wednesday. Michael Owen Baker/Staff Photographer      READ MORE More stories on Sriracha Hot Sauce.      VENTURA COUNTY>> The jalapeño peppers that will be ground later this year at an embattled Irwindale factory and pureed into the red-hot chili sauce known as Sriracha are now being planted.      Wednesday morning in a Ventura County field off Highway 126, workers unloaded cartons of pepper plants from a Santa Maria nursery and then loaded up a tranplantation machine, which drops the plants into the soil.      Craig Underwood, 72, whose family has been farming in Ventura County for four generations, has been growing the jalapeño peppers that fill the bottles with the iconic rooster on the front and topped with bright-green lids for 25 years. That first year, he called Huy Fong Foods CEO David Tran and asked him if he could grow 50 acres of peppers for him. This year, Underwood will plant 2,000 acres, with plans to harvest 2,200 acres next year.      The international demand for Sriracha sauce has caused Underwood to double the acreage of his crops and expand his operation into Kern County.      “It’s amazing that the sauce has gotten such attention and it has such a cult following. Who would have guessed?” Underwood said.      These are uncertain times for Underwood, for whom 75 percent of his Underwood Ranches’ revenue comes from Huy Fong Foods.      On Monday morning, a delegation from Texas will visit Huy Fong Foods and speak to Tran about relocating his Irwindale operation to the Lone Star State.      Underwood will join the closed-door meeting because Tran asked him to. He’d prefer to stay away.      Tran has been in a legal battle with the city of Irwindale for months about strong chili odors emanating from the factory during the grinding season. Residents say the process emits odors that have caused their eyes to burn, given them coughing fits and forced them to stay indoors. Many of those complaints came from just four households.      In response, Tran has extended an invitation to officials from out-of-state and from other California municipalities to meet with him about moving to their city.      Underwood said he didn’t want to speculate what would happen if Sriracha was no longer processed in California.      But, “I don’t think it’s going to happen,” he said.      Tran has said the secret ingredient of his chili sauce is the freshness of the fruit, so wherever Tran processes his chilies, pepper fields must be close by.      “We pick ’em and as soon as the truck’s loaded, it’s on the road,” said Underwood.      When the trucks arrive in Irwindale, about an hour later, the bright red peppers are dumped into the grinders. About four hours from soil to grinder.      Underwood said he has about 200 to 300 workers during the 12-week harvest season and employs about a 100 people year-round to work on other aspects of preparing for the harvest.      The effect of Tran’s possible relocation would also trickle down to Plantel Nurseries in Santa Maria, which produces the hybrid jalapeño plants and Beardsley and Son in Oxnard, which supplies Underwood Ranches its fertilizer. Both of those companies have expanded because of the increased demand for Sriracha.      “When Underwood expanded his jalapeño growing to Arvin and Bakersfield, that took us a little bit out of our comfort zone, but I’m not going to let any competitors take the account away,” said Tom Beardsley, whose operations had previously been confined to Ventura County.      Beardsley said the company increased its tractor fleet and made custom equipment specifically for growing jalapeño peppers.      Underwood said he and Tran have a special relationship. While most processors are trying to get the grower that will sell them the product for the cheapest amount of money, Tran cares about quality.      Tran insists on peppers that are bright red and have good flavor. He has even brought a taste-tester to Underwood’s fields.      “I don’t know how she did it,” Underwood said, eyes widening at the thought of the heat.      Peppers are always on Tran’s mind.      Underwood said at Tran’s daughter’s wedding, Tran pulled him outside on the balcony to talk about the crop.      “He’s very focused,” Underwood said of Tran.      Underwood himself is dedicated to peppers, which he says are his favorite crop because they are challenging to grow.      He named his 14-year-old Shetland sheepdog “Jalepeno Pepper” and calls her Jaley for short.      Underwood plans to fill about 40 semi-trucks per day this harvest season, which typically begins in late August and ends by December for a total of 58,000 tons. It’s something that residents who have complained of the odors might not like to hear. Especially if Tran does not install the air filtration system that has been recommended by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Tran’s lawyer has said the system will be in place by June 1. A preliminary injunction that the city sought in Los Angeles County Superior Court also ordered Tran to abate the odors. |||||	– With Huy Fong Foods under siege at its current Irwindale home, a group of Texas lawmakers calling itself the "Sriracha delegation" is traveling to California today to try to convince owner David Tran to move the company. "I am confident that this group will be able to communicate with Mr. Tran ... the benefit of conducting business in the Lone Star State where frivolous litigation is not business as usual," says Dallas Rep. Jason Villalba, who's been pushing for the meeting for months, WFAA reports. The group will tour the Irwindale factory and hold a closed-door meeting with Tran and other Huy Fong officials today, the Texas Tribune reports. Almost two dozen cities have made similar pitches, NPR reports, but so far Tran has said he wants to stay in California, where he's lived for more than 30 years. The company recently planted a new crop of jalapenos there despite the uncertainty, the Pasadena Star-News reports. But Tran might open a factory elsewhere, and clearly isn't happy about the flap. He told NPR he left Vietnam to escape the repressive government. "Today, I feel almost the same. Even now, we live in [the] USA, and my feeling, the government, not a big difference."

For one thing they're all very, very famous, but so are lots of people, and you already knew that. Another thing these four individuals have in common is that they have extra nipples. A third one, to be exact, though there are humans who have had as many as six additional nipples. Eight nipples! The mind boggles.      The first formal description of the condition was made in a German scientific journal in 1878 by a researcher called Leichtenstern. He estimated that around one in 500 humans, or 0.2%, have "supernumerary nipples" – that is, a number of nipples greater than two. There are almost as many guesses as to the prevalence of extra nipples as there are studies on the matter.      One study found a prevalence of 0.22% in a Hungarian population; another estimated 0.6% of white American infants; another claimed that 1.63% of Black American infants have them. For Israeli infants, the rate was estimated to be 2.5%; for Israeli-Arabic children, 4.7%; and 5.6% among German children. Another study reported that 5% of Japanese women but only 1.6% of Japanese men have additional nipples, though most other studies find them to be more common in men than in women. Some evidence has suggested that they more commonly erupt on the left side than the right.      In other words, while the estimated prevalence varies wildly according to ethnicity, sex, geographic region, or (most likely) detection methods, extra nipples probably occur fairly rarely. Indeed, the National Insitute of Health’s Office of Rare Diseases considers supernumerary nipples a "rare disease", by which it means fewer than 200,000 people within the United States have them.      One early voice in the drive to scientifically understand "supernumerary nipples" was a researcher named Kajava. In 1915, based on a study of Finnish people, he classified supernumerary nipples into eight discrete categories, according to the types of tissue present. In "polymastia," or category one, the extra nipple comes with an areola as well as underlying breast tissue. In essence, it's a complete additional breast.      Embryonic development      Other categories describe areolas with breast tissue but without a nipple (category three), for example, or an areola by itself sans nipple and breast tissue (category seven). In one category, a nipple and areola are present but fat tissue replaces the typical glandular breast tissue (category five).      The most common type is category six, in which an extra nipple forms, but without an areola. It's more specifically known as "polythelia". Despite being more than a century old, Kajava's classification scheme is still in use today by doctors and researchers.      To understand how, where, and why extra nipples might be found on a human, it helps to understand where the more typical pair comes from in the first place. After a sperm attaches itself to an egg, the pair combine to form an embryo. (Starting after the eighth week after fertilisation, human embryos are referred to as fetuses.) Sometime around the fourth week of embryonic development, two strips of the ectoderm (part of which will eventually become skin) become slightly thicker. These strips, known as milk lines or mammary lines, stretch from the armpits down the chest and stomach and towards the upper thighs near the groin. In the following weeks and months, the strips become even thicker, and become known as mammary ridges. Eventually, the mammary ridges regress except for on the chest area, where the breasts and nipples continue to grow and develop.      But sometimes the mammary ridges don’t disappear completely. When that happens, a supernumerary nipple might form, whether as a complete extra breast as in Kajava's category one, or just a nipple, as in category six. Most are located below the regular nipples, but according to one estimate, as many as 13% are found above the regular nipples, such as on the armpits. "Such an occurrence can cause discomfort after childbearing when it lactates in unison with its two sanctioned colleagues," writes Dr Norman A Grossl in the Southern Medical Journal.      The knowledge of extra nipples long predates the advent of modern medicine. The ancient Greeks sometimes depicted their goddess Artemis with multiple breasts, and followers of her Phoenician counterpart, Astarte, believed that extra breasts and nipples were indicators of abundant fertility. Men with extra nipples, it was once believed, were more virile than their double-nippled brethren. While it is now known that additional nipples are not associated with enhanced fecundity, the idea was still taken seriously by medical practitioners as recently as the 1800s.      Unexpected places      Charles Darwin himself wrote about the presence of additional breasts or nipples in The Descent of Man, speculating that extra nipples were atavisms, or remnants of our evolutionary past that sneak in to the final human form during the development process. It's not a crazy idea: as an embryo develops it resembles our more fish-like and reptilian ancestors before becoming more obviously mammalian, and finally a primate. Many other mammals have more than two breasts along their milk lines – cows have four, dogs have eight to 10, rats have 12, and pigs have a whopping 18 – so he reasoned that when additional nipples appeared among humans, they were ancestral traits and, for some reason or another, were retained as the fetus developed. But because extra nipples can also occur beyond the milk lines, we now know that most are simply flukes of embryonic development.      If extra nipples are rare, extra nipples that fall outside the milk lines (they're called ectopic supernumerary nipples) are even rarer, but when they do occur, they can be found on the back, shoulder, limbs, neck, face, and even on the vulva (for women) or the perineum. Some have theorised that ectopic nipples are modified sweat glands, or are evidence that the mammary ridges became somehow displayed during embryonic development and wound up somewhere unexpected, where they went on to develop nipples, as is their tendency.      In most cases, extra nipples are hardly even noticeable, or may be mistaken for moles or birthmarks. But if there is glandular tissue – the same sort of breast tissue that comes with normal nipples – then they can suffer the same sorts of hormonal changes and diseases that can afflict normal breast tissue. Even if they don't reveal themselves to their owners until puberty or pregnancy, they can change pigmentation, swell, become tender, or even lactate. In those cases, they act like regular nipples and breasts, only they're found elsewhere on the body. They can also develop cancerous tumours, just as regular breasts can.      Extreme examples      While extra nipples and breasts themselves aren't atypical (aside from their number), some research has suggested a correlation between supernumerary nipples and kidney or urinary tract malformations. It isn't exactly clear what could cause the connection. It could be that the urinary, renal, and mammary systems grow around the same time during embryonic development. But while the frequency of urinary or renal tract defects in the general population is between 1-2%, it's thought to be as much as 14.5% among those with additional nipples, or even higher, though studies like these are often plagued by low sample sizes. Indeed, other researchers claim that the connection is spurious, saying that physicians do not need to go about looking for urinary or renal complications just because their patients have extra nipples.      Most owners of third nipples are unfazed by this quirk of their bodies. Others have them removed for cosmetic reasons. But some historical case reports offer more extreme tales. A case reported in 1827 refers to a French woman who had a complete third breast on her left thigh. After she gave birth, it began to produce milk. "It was offered to her infant who took it willingly," writes Grossl. "She apparently nursed five children during her life from all three of her breasts." And a 1980 report of an ectopic supernumerary nipple described a "well-formed mass resembling a female breast on the back thigh of a 74-year-old man." The "fatty tumour," as he called it, never really bothered him and he refused an offer to have it removed.

At the BBC, Jason Goldman reports that while some have considered the "supernumerary nipple" a fault of the evolutionary process, similar to wisdom teeth or the tailbone, recent research shows that extra-nipple formation may be far more involved. Here are key takeaways: Researchers are finding a correlation between gender, ethnicity, geographic region, and nipples. For instance, one study found 0.6% of white American infants have a third nipple, while their black American counterparts clock in at 1.63%; Israeli infants had an even higher rate of 2.5%. The supernumerary nipple is very unusual: Only an estimated 200,000 people are born in the US with what the National Institute of Health calls a "rare disease." Humans can and have had up to six additional nipples, though more than three is considered exceedingly rare. The nipples (both normal and supernumerary) form during the fourth week of embryo fertilization. Two strips of tissue across the chest (called "mammary ridges") regress in-utero, creating two nipples, but sometimes they don't regress completely, leaving an extra nipple. Some supernumerary nipples can contain breast tissue, and undergo the same hormonal changes as normal nipples. Though rare, supernumerary nipples exist in places other than the chest. One such "ectopic supernumerary nipple" was reportedly found on a French woman's thigh in 1827. It produced milk and "her infant ... took it willingly," writes Norman Grossl in the Southern Medical Journal. Click for Goldman's full story.

CHICAGO (FOX 32 News) - Gang violence on the South Side of Chicago is doing more than putting people in danger, it's also hurting business for hundreds of mom and pop stores.      But now, some of those business owners are fighting back.      Even though some of the shootings happened miles away, business owners in Chatham say they're feeling the aftereffects. People are afraid to take to the streets, and afraid to shop in their own neighborhoods.      Ken Blow has been cutting hair for two decades at the Bullseye Barber shop on west 79th Street. He has a long list of steady customers, but lately business has been bad.      “We normally have more people who walk in that are out and about looking for a haircut. They like to come by and move around without feeling threatened."      A raging gang war and spate of high profile shootings - including the cold-blooded murder of 9-year old Tyshawn Lee - has created what business owners describe as “a climate of fear in many South Side neighborhoods.      Contessa Houston opened a clothing boutique on west 79th last spring.      "The street traffic has stopped. People are afraid to walk down 79th street because of the retaliations that are going on,” Houston told FOX 32 News.      “It's bad for business. You're pushing more so online and trying to find new avenues for your business to basically grow."      Friday, a group of Chatham business owners and community leaders gathered to call attention to their plight. They say they're frustrated because the high profile crimes happened far away from their once-thriving business strip, yet they're still paying the price.      Sixth Ward Alderman Roderick Sawyer said, “the precipice for this press conference was some internet rants about violence going all the way from Damen to Cottage Grove. So we had to stand here in our neighborhood and say no, it's not happening here. This is a safe venue."      The business falloff at an area McDonalds has prompted the franchise owner to beef up security.      “We are gonna look back at that, adding security inside the McDonalds like we've done before. We normally do about 12 hours a day. Now I’ll have to reevaluate that," McDonald’s owner Derek Taylor said.      Already there are too many empty stores on the South Side and metal security gates that have been padlocked for years.      Contessa Houston says if it doesn't get better soon, she'll consider moving her business as well.      “You're following your dreams, but at the same time you still have to be conscious of your life."      The business owners say they believe many of their regular customers are going to other neighborhoods and the suburbs to do their shopping. They say if that doesn't change local jobs will disappear, which will then only strengthen the street gangs. ||||| A 9-year-old boy and a 20-year-old woman were gunned down two hours apart in separate homicides in Chicago recently. The 4th grader was shot execution style and the woman was an aspiring model visiting from nearby Evanston.      This spasm of violence on Chicago’s South Side plays out as the latest tragic day in a year that has seen murders on the rise. Tyshawn Lee dreamed of playing pro basketball and Kaylyn Pryor had just started her promising career as a fashion model, friends and family said the day after their deaths.      Still the men in the neighborhoods of Auburn Gresham and Englewood remain apathetic. All men in this city need to come out of the shadows of impotence and start protecting their women and babies. It's time for a sex strike, girls.      I want to preface this by saying I’m not usually in favor of using sex as a weapon in relationships. Communication to me is paramount and I’d sooner opt for talking it over. But drastic times call for drastic measures.      In a patriarchal society, a problem will not be addressed until it directly affects men. Abstinence has been used as a means of nonviolent protesting throughout history. Sex strikes are forms of resistance often used to meet political, social or economic goals. Even Spike Lee’s new film Chi-Raq is nothing more than a modern day adaptation of the ancient Greek play “Lysistrata” by Aristophanes. After the murder of a child by a stray bullet, a group of women led by Lysistrata organize against the on-going violence. So I got to thinking, why shouldn’t life imitate art? Maybe these ladies are on to something.      We share this planet equally. I’m interested in making the world a safer place for all little girls and boys. I want to nurture and guide them to become thought leaders who accumulate great wealth and build legacies that endure. But I can’t do any of that when the life expectancy on the south side ends by the fourth grade.      In the meantime, I’m taking some extreme punitive social measures. There should be severe consequences for your apathy. How long will you turn your backs on us? Where’s your accountability?      OPEN LETTER TO CHICAGO SOUTH SIDE MEN      The day after Tyshawn Lee and Kaylyn Pryor were shot dead on the south side within blocks of each other I watched you file into stores on State Street to buy gym shoes despite the fact that your neighborhoods are being torn apart. I watched in dismay as you carried on with your lives at work and at home as if this were of no consequence. I watched when you shook your heads and uttered, “That’s a damn shame,” on the CTA Red line with the newspaper in your large brown hands. I listened when you gave benign excuses about how there’s not much you can do about it and that somehow through it all, “God’s got it.”      You simply ran on Dunkin in the morning. And you supersized your fries at lunch time. As Londoner’s say, KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON. Seriously, you kept a little too fucking calm, in my opinion.      Step into your greatness and out of the shadows of impotence. I need you to be leaders, not consumers. I need you to cherish your woman and protect your babies using every ounce of fortitude and creativity you can muster. I need you to insist the adage “justice for all” includes you too.      No, Chicago men. I’m done marching. I’m fed up with chanting catchy slogans like, “Black lives matter.” My silent protest to fight this battle is by keeping my panties up and my skirt down, one day at a time. My legs are closed to you. IT’S GAME TIME. I’m bringing on some real life Lysistrata in Chicago, and I’m hoping to enroll thousands of other single and married women in this city before the end of this bloody week.      My headshot could be plastered just as easily on the front page of tomorrow’s headlines. How dare you shake your heads and just walk away. God gave man more muscle mass than woman because it’s his job to protect and defend. Isn’t it time ya’ll got on your job?      Just like Lysistrata entreated the mighty women of her city I implore the strong ladies of Chicago to take this oath. If you are a woman who is sick and tired of the senseless violence then please, please take this pledge.      THE PLEDGE FOR PEACE IN THE STREETS      Until an official treaty is signed and an actionable plan is in place by all black men who live in this city, I take a vow of celibacy. I vow to refuse sex to any man I’m dating, engaged to or married to until the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are brought to justice. I vow to keep my affections for men vocal, spirit filled and non-sexual until all children on the south side are safe to play outside their doors. I vow to stay celibate until black men organize and create a strategy to keep the peace in our neighborhoods. All men must take responsibility to take back their communities and behave as global citizens who patrol their own streets until every block in every neighborhood can all breathe again in ease.      Until ALL men in every neighborhood take a solemn oath that they will stay proactive instead of passive I will remain vigilant to the cause.      GENTLEMEN, THE CANDY STORE IS OFFICIALLY CLOSED. WE ARE ON STRIKE. PANTIES UP. SKIRTS DOWN. Let the lockdown begin...      Sign here. Stay Strong. Stay Posted.      -April D.

It's even the premise of the new movie "Chi-Raq".With Chicago reeling from an autumn of gun violence, seeing a mostly-male crowd camped out for a new shoe store recently left April Lawson enraged."You're watching these guys just like buying gym shoes and carrying on like life is normal," Lawson said.

This list is based on Alan Sommerstein's 1973 translation.[1] Written by Aristophanes Chorus Old men      Old women Characters Lysistrata      Calonice      Myrrhine      Lampito      Magistrate      Cinesias      Baby      Spartan Herald      Spartan Ambassador      Athenian Negotiator      Two Layabouts      Doorkeeper      Two Diners      Stratyllis      Five Young Women Mute Ismenia      Corinthian Woman      Reconciliation      Four Scythian Policemen      Scythian Policewoman      Athenian citizens, Spartan envoys, slaves et al. Setting Before the Propylaea, or gateway to the Acropolis of Athens, 411 BCE      Lysistrata ( or ; Attic Greek: Λυσιστράτη, Lysistrátē, "Army Disbander") is an ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes, originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC. It is a comic account of a woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War between Greek city states by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of the warring cities to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace—a strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes.      The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career.[2] It was produced in the same year as the Thesmophoriazusae, another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition. At this time, Greek theatre was a profound form of entertainment, which was extremely popular for all audiences as it addressed political issues relevant to that time.      Plot [ edit ]      LYSISTRATA There are a lot of things about us women That sadden me, considering how men See us as rascals. CALONICE As indeed we are!      These lines, spoken by the Athenian Lysistrata and her friend Calonice at the beginning of the play,[3] set the scene for the action that follows. Women, as represented by Calonice, are sly hedonists in need of firm guidance and direction. Lysistrata, however, is an extraordinary woman with a large sense of individual and social responsibility. She has convened a meeting of women from various Greek city states that are at war with each other (there is no mention of how she managed this feat) and, very soon after confiding in her friend about her concerns for the female sex, the women begin arriving.      With support from the Spartan Lampito, Lysistrata persuades the other women to withhold sexual privileges from their menfolk as a means of forcing them to end the interminable Peloponnesian War. The women are very reluctant, but the deal is sealed with a solemn oath around a wine bowl, Lysistrata choosing the words and Calonice repeating them on behalf of the other women. It is a long and detailed oath, in which the women abjure all their sexual pleasures, including the Lioness on the Cheese Grater (a sexual position).      Soon after the oath is finished, a cry of triumph is heard from the nearby Acropolis—the old women of Athens have seized control of it at Lysistrata's instigation, since it holds the state treasury, without which the men cannot long continue to fund their war. Lampito goes off to spread the word of revolt, and the other women retreat behind the barred gates of the Acropolis to await the men's response.      A Chorus of Old Men arrives, intent on burning down the gate of the Acropolis if the women do not open up. Encumbered with heavy timbers, inconvenienced with smoke and burdened with old age, they are still making preparations to assault the gate when a Chorus of Old Women arrives, bearing pitchers of water. The Old Women complain about the difficulty they had getting the water, but they are ready for a fight in defense of their younger comrades. Threats are exchanged, water beats fire, and the Old Men are discomfited with a soaking.      The magistrate then arrives with some Scythian archers (the Athenian version of police constables). He reflects on the hysterical nature of women, their devotion to wine, promiscuous sex, and exotic cults (such as to Sabazius and Adonis), but above all he blames men for poor supervision of their womenfolk. He has come for silver from the state treasury to buy oars for the fleet and he instructs his Scythians to begin levering open the gate. However, they are quickly overwhelmed by groups of unruly women with such unruly names as σπερμαγοραιολεκιθολαχανοπώλιδες (seed-market-porridge-vegetable-sellers) and σκοροδοπανδοκευτριαρτοπώλιδες (garlic-innkeeping-bread-sellers).[4]      Lysistrata restores order and she allows the magistrate to question her. She explains to him the frustrations women feel at a time of war when the men make stupid decisions that affect everyone, and their wives' opinions are not listened to. She drapes her headdress over him, gives him a basket of wool and tells him that war will be a woman's business from now on. She then explains the pity she feels for young, childless women, ageing at home while the men are away on endless campaigns. When the magistrate points out that men also age, she reminds him that men can marry at any age whereas a woman has only a short time before she is considered too old. She then dresses the magistrate like a corpse for laying out, with a wreath and a fillet, and advises him that he's dead. Outraged at these indignities, he storms off to report the incident to his colleagues, while Lysistrata returns to the Acropolis.      The debate or agon is continued between the Chorus of Old Men and the Chorus of Old Women until Lysistrata returns to the stage with some news—her comrades are desperate for sex and they are beginning to desert on the silliest pretexts (for example, one woman says she has to go home to air her fabrics by spreading them on the bed). After rallying her comrades and restoring their discipline, Lysistrata again returns to the Acropolis to continue waiting for the men's surrender.      A man suddenly appears, desperate for sex. It is Kinesias, the husband of Myrrhine. Lysistrata instructs her to torture him and Myrrhine then informs Kinesias that she can't have sex with him until he stops the war. He promptly agrees to these terms and the young couple prepares for sex on the spot. Myrrhine fetches a bed, then a mattress, then a pillow, then a blanket, then a flask of oil, exasperating her husband with delays until finally disappointing him completely by locking herself in the Acropolis again. The Chorus of Old Men commiserates with the young man in a plaintive song.      A Spartan herald then appears with a large burden (an erection) scarcely hidden inside his tunic and he requests to see the ruling council to arrange peace talks. The magistrate, now also sporting a prodigious burden, laughs at the herald's embarrassing situation but agrees that peace talks should begin.      They go off to fetch the delegates; and, while they are gone, the Old Women make overtures to the Old Men. The Old Men are content to be comforted and fussed over by the Old Women; and thereupon the two Choruses merge, singing and dancing in unison. Peace talks commence and Lysistrata introduces the Spartan and Athenian delegates to a gorgeous young woman called Reconciliation. The delegates cannot take their eyes off the young woman; and meanwhile, Lysistrata scolds both sides for past errors of judgment. The delegates briefly squabble over the peace terms; but, with Reconciliation before them and the burden of sexual deprivation still heavy upon them, they quickly overcome their differences and retire to the Acropolis for celebrations.      Another choral song follows; and, after a bit of humorous dialogue between tipsy dinner guests, the celebrants all return to the stage for a final round of songs, the men and women dancing together. All sing a merry song in praise of Athene, goddess of wisdom and chastity, whose citadel provided a refuge for the women during the events of the comedy, and whose implied blessing has brought about a happy ending to the play.      Historical background [ edit ]      Some events that are significant for our understanding of the play:      424 BC: The Knights won first prize at the Lenaia. Its protagonist, a sausage-seller named Agoracritus, emerges at the end of the play as the improbable saviour of Athens (Lysistrata is its saviour thirteen years later).      won first prize at the Lenaia. Its protagonist, a sausage-seller named Agoracritus, emerges at the end of the play as the improbable saviour of Athens (Lysistrata is its saviour thirteen years later). 421 BC: Peace was produced. Its protagonist, Trygaeus, emerges as the improbable champion of universal peace (Lysistrata's role 10 years later). The Peace of Nicias was formalised this same year, ending the first half of the Peloponnesian War (referred to in Lysistrata as "The Former War"). [5]      was produced. Its protagonist, Trygaeus, emerges as the improbable champion of universal peace (Lysistrata's role 10 years later). The Peace of Nicias was formalised this same year, ending the first half of the Peloponnesian War (referred to in as "The Former War"). 413 BC: The Athenians and their allies suffered a catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition, a turning-point in the long-running Peloponnesian War.      411 BC: Both Thesmophoriazusae and Lysistrata were produced; an oligarchic revolution (one of the consequences of the Sicilian disaster) proved briefly successful.      Old Comedy was a highly topical genre and the playwright expected his audience to be familiar with local identities and issues. The following list of identities mentioned in the play gives some indication of the difficulty faced by any producer trying to stage Lysistrata for modern audiences.      Pellene was also the name of a Peloponnesian town resisting Spartan pressure to contribute to naval operations against Athens at this time. It was mentioned earlier in the Birds.[41]      Discussion [ edit ]      As indicated below (Influence and legacy) modern adaptations of Lysistrata are often feminist and/or pacifist in their aim. The original play was neither feminist nor unreservedly pacifist. Even when they seemed to demonstrate empathy with the female condition, dramatic poets in classical Athens still reinforced sexual stereotyping of women as irrational creatures in need of protection from themselves and from others.[42]      In fact the play might not even be a plea for an end to the war so much as an imaginative vision of an honorable end to the war at a time when no such ending was possible.[43] According to Sarah Ruden, Lysistrata (Hackett Classics, 2003), the play "nowhere suggests that warfare in itself is intolerable, let alone immoral"(87).      Old Comedy [ edit ]      Lysistrata belongs to the middle period of Aristophanes' career when he was beginning to diverge significantly from the conventions of Old Comedy. Such variations from convention include:      The divided Chorus : The Chorus begins this play being divided (Old Men versus Old Women), and its unification later exemplifies the major theme of the play: reconciliation. There is nothing quite like this use of a Chorus in the other plays. A doubling of the role of the Chorus occurs in two other middle-period plays, The Frogs and Thesmophoriazusae , but in each of those plays the two Choruses appear consecutively and not simultaneously. The nearest equivalent to Lysistrata's divided Chorus is found in the earliest of the surviving plays, The Acharnians , where the Chorus very briefly divides into factions for and against the protagonist.

Parabasis : The parabasis is an important, conventional element in Old Comedy. There is no parabasis proper in Lysistrata . Most plays have a second parabasis near the end and there is something like a parabasis in that position in this play but it only comprises two songs (strophe and antistrophe) and these are separated by an episodic scene of dialogue. [45] In these two songs, the now united Chorus declares that it is not prepared to speak ill of anyone on this occasion because the current situation ( ta parakeímena ) is already bad enough—topical reference to the catastrophic end to the Sicilian Expedition. In keeping however with the victim-centered approach of Old Comedy, the Chorus then teases the entire audience with false generosity, offering gifts that are not in its power to give.      : The parabasis is an important, conventional element in Old Comedy.

In keeping however with the victim-centered approach of Old Comedy, the Chorus then teases the entire audience with false generosity, offering gifts that are not in its power to give. Agon: The Roman orator Quintilian considered Old Comedy a good genre for study by students of rhetoric[46] and the plays of Aristophanes in fact contain formal disputes or agons that are constructed for rhetorical effect. Lysistrata's debate with the proboulos (magistrate) is an unusual agon[47] in that one character (Lysistrata) does almost all the talking while the antagonist (the magistrate) merely asks questions or expresses indignation. The informality of the agon draws attention to the absurdity of a classical woman engaging in public debate.[48] Like most agons, however, it is structured symmetrically in two sections, each half comprising long verses of anapests that are introduced by a choral song and that end in a pnigos. In the first half of the agon, Lysistrata quotes from Homer's Iliad ("war will be men's business"), then quotes 'the man in the street' ("Isn't there a man in the country?"—"No, by God, there isn't!") and finally arrives at the only logical conclusion to these premises: "War will be women's business!" The logic of this conclusion is supported rhythmically by the pnigos, during which Lysistrata and her friends dress the magistrate like a woman, with a veil and a basket of wool, reinforcing her argument and lending it ironic point—if the men are women, obviously the war can only be women's business. During the pnigos of the second section, the magistrate is dressed like a corpse, highlighting the argument that war is a living death for women. The agon in Lysistrata is thus a fine example of rhetoric even though it is unusually one-sided.

summarize: PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A Rhode Island court was flooded with people contesting speeding tickets Monday after a new school zone speed camera program resulted in 12,000 tickets in 33 days.      WPRI-TV reports more than 2,600 tickets were on the docket at Providence Municipal Court, which most days has about 300. The courtroom holds 90 people.      A court spokesperson said not everyone is expected to show up, although hundreds of people did. They filled the waiting areas outside the courtroom at the Providence Public Safety Complex and snaked out the door and around the building Monday morning to get into court.      Municipal Court Judge Frank Caprio, who presided over a morning session, dismissed many of the tickets because of errors, according to The Providence Journal .      Caprio is well known from videos filmed in his courtroom. He presides with a folksy humor as people dispute their tickets for red-light running and expired parking meters. Clips from the local show "Caught in Providence" have had more than 1 billion views on social media. The show will begin airing in major media markets this year.      The errors with the speeding tickets included different notices with conflicting information, such as one notice saying the posted speed limit was 30 mph and another saying it was 20 mph.      "The city has to get it right the first time," Caprio said.      The station reported last week that the city issued 12,193 tickets between Jan. 16 and Feb. 22 from five new speed cameras. The tickets cost $95 each and can be issued when a vehicle is caught traveling at least 11 mph over the posted speed limit at certain times.      State Rep. Anthony Giarrusso introduced a bill last week that would end the use of traffic cameras in Rhode Island. It's unclear whether Giarrusso, a Republican, will have any success in the Democratic-controlled legislature. In a statement Monday, he said the camera systems are "nothing more than a government cash grab." ||||| Related Coverage Here’s where Providence has placed its speed cameras      PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) – The city of Providence issued more than 12,000 speeding tickets – averaging 369 per day – during the first 33 days that its new school-zone speed camera program was in use, according to a Target 12 review of traffic violation data.      A total of 12,193 tickets were generated from five speed cameras between Jan. 16 and Feb 22, with nearly all of the tickets coming from three locations: Mount Pleasant Avenue, Charles Street and Thurbers Avenue. (The cameras are not in use on Sundays.)      At $95 per ticket, that means violators were charged $1.15 million in just over one month. The city had already received $370,000 as of Feb. 22, records show. Six additional cameras will be deployed in various neighborhoods next week.      “Ultimately this is about keeping families safe, especially in areas with many children around,” Mayor Jorge Elorza, a Democrat, said when the program launched. “Tragedies can be prevented with innovative solutions and that’s exactly what these cameras do.”      Rhode Island lawmakers first approved speed cameras in 2016 when they passed the Automated School-Zone-Speed-Enforcement System Act permitting municipalities to install them within a quarter-mile of any type of school. The Providence City Council voted last May to allow up to 15 speed cameras to be installed around the city.      Tickets can be issued for any vehicle caught traveling at least 11 miles per hour over the posted speed limit between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, according to the city’s contract with Conduent State and Local Solutions Inc., the private vendor that oversees both speed cameras and red light cameras in the city.      Conduent earns $2,978 per month for each camera and $7.50 per violation processed, meaning it was set up to make more than $100,000 during the first month of the program. The Maryland company, a subsidiary of a New Jersey-based corporation that was formerly a division of Xerox, also receives a $3.50 convenience fee every time a violator uses their credit card to pay a ticket.      The cameras are also portable, and the city’s contract with Conduent allows for two to be moved to new locations each week. As of Feb. 22, the camera in front of Mount Pleasant High School has generated 4,795 tickets; one on Charles Street generated 4,236 tickets; and another on Thurbers Avenue generated 3,126 tickets.      Two other cameras on Daniel Avenue and Peace Street generated only 36 tickets combined, but the one on Peace Street was stolen in January. (It has since been replaced.)      Every potential violation is reviewed by a Providence police officer and state law requires the tickets to be sent within two weeks of the violation, but the Elorza administration has asked the General Assembly to extend the notification period to 28 days. (The city successfully lobbied lawmakers for a similar extension of red light camera violations last year.)      The camera program has received mixed reviews from the public, with critics suggesting the city is simply using them to generate new revenue and supporters saying they are already seeing vehicles slow down in school zones.      Anthony Brown, a North Providence resident, said while he understands the safety concerns, “I don’t believe people are at school until 8:00 at night.” He also claims his wife got a speeding ticket on Charles Street in the middle of the day, but the picture that accompanied the violation notice appeared as though it was dark outside.      “I don’t know where in Providence or the state of Rhode Island where it’s dark at 11:42 a.m.,” he said. Brown said he plans to challenge the ticket in municipal court.      Billy Kepner, a spokesperson for the city, said “an overlay is placed on the vehicle which could cause the photo to look darker.” He said zero tickets have been dismissed.      The cameras came to Providence just over two years after a teacher at Mount Pleasant High School was killed while crossing the street near the school. The teenage driver, Tarchae Powell, fled the scene but later turned herself into police. She was charged with operating a vehicle without insurance. The teacher’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Powell in 2016.      Nesha Kingston, a Providence resident, said the cameras seem to be working. She said she sees the Charles Street unit flashing constantly.      “It has slowed the cars down a lot,” she said.

The tickets are just a fraction of the 12,000 that were generated within the first 33 days after speed cameras were installed in the city in January, WPRI reports. Outrage over the $95-a-pop tickets has ensued, with thousands contesting them. Typically, the court has just 300 people on the docket on any given day. Not everyone who is appealing their ticket is expected to actually appear in court, though the AP reports hundreds of people did show up. Per the AP, "many" of the tickets have been dismissed so far due to errors like signs that give conflicting information as to the actual speed limit. A state representative has introduced a bill to end the use of traffic cameras in the state, calling the system "a government cash grab," but it's not clear whether the bill will find success in the Democratic-controlled legislature. Also Monday, Providence is set to install six more speed cameras; the city currently has five.
summarize: A Whitter couple arrested after the body of a child was found in a duffel bag at the U.S.-Mexico border will be prosecuted in Los Angeles County instead of San Diego, where they were arraigned in August.      Johnny Lewis Hartley, 43, and Mercy Mary Becerra, 39, had been charged with murder by the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office.      On Wednesday, that office dismissed the case so that the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office could take over.      The defendants are expected to be arraigned Friday on four felony charges: murder, human trafficking to commit pimping/pandering, torture and assault on a child causing death.      If convicted, they each face life in prison.      According to prosecutors, Becerra and Hartley trafficked a woman — the mother of the dead child — between November 2012 and August of this year.

summarize: TAMPA -- A man who killed another motorist with a single punch during a road rage attack pleaded guilty and will spend nearly 12 years in prison.      Gary Durham, who had faced up to 30 years in prison, agreed to the plea deal Thursday.      Durham, 26, and Timothy Gibbs, 48, exchanged angry words after they nearly had a car accident on Oct. 24.      Durham then followed Gibbs into the parking lot of an auto repair shop.      Both men exited their vehicles, and Durham, who weighs 180 pounds and is 6 feet tall, punched Gibbs in the head. Gibbs was 160 pounds and was 5 feet 8 inches tall.      Gibbs' hands were at his side when he was punched, said prosecutor Doug Covington.      Gibbs fell and hit his head on the pavement.      He was in the hospital for nine days before brain swelling killed him.      Durham had previously served prison time for grand theft, aggravated assault and trafficking in stolen property.      As a habitual felony offender, Durham faced up to 30 years in prison on a manslaughter charge.      But prosecutors worried about the risk involved in persuading a jury to convict him.      Prosecutors agreed to recommend an 11.7-year sentence followed by five years of probation.      After Gibbs died, Durham turned himself in to authorities and said he had thrown the punch in self-defense and had not meant to kill Gibbs.      "Gary's taken responsibility for this from day one," said Durham's defense attorney, Brian Gonzalez.      Gonzalez said his client, who now has a 4-month-old child, would undergo anger management counseling as part of his sentence.      But Gibb's wife, Nancy, said Durham has not apologized to her and her three children.      "He's shown no remorse. He's a nasty, angry person," she said. "My husband was 48 when he died, and he should have been a lot older. . He got killed. It wasn't an accident."      Circuit Judge Ronald Ficarrotta will sentence Durham on Sept. 30.      He told Durham that if he commits any crimes while awaiting sentencing, the plea agreement is off and Durham could get the maximum sentence. ||||| PLANT CITY — Fifteen years ago, Gary Lynn Durham killed a man after arguing in traffic. For that, he did 10 years in prison.      On Wednesday morning, Durham got into another rush-hour fight. This time, Hillsborough sheriff's deputies said, the other driver killed him.      It happened before sunrise on a rural stretch of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, east of Forbes Road in Plant City.      Durham, 40, stopped his black Mazda pickup in the middle of the eastbound lane, deputies said. He got out and walked toward Robert Padgett, who had stopped behind the truck in a Ford sport utility vehicle.      Exactly why the men stopped is unclear. But sheriff's officials called what happened next "the end result of a road rage incident."      As the men argued, Padgett, 42, pulled a handgun, deputies said. He shot Durham at least once.      As the man lay in the road, Padgett tried to administer first-aid, authorities said. When deputies arrived, Durham was dead.      Padgett has cooperated with investigators, sheriff's officials said. Sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski said detectives would consider whether the state's self-defense laws apply to the case. No charges have been filed pending a review by the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office.      "It's been a very taxing day," Padgett said at midday outside his Valrico home. He declined further comment, saying authorities had advised him not to speak about the incident.      It was an ironic end for Durham, a man who lost a decade of freedom for what police had also dubbed a case of "road rage."      In October 2001, Durham turned in front of another driver, Timothy James Gibbs, at the intersection of N Armenia and W Linebaugh avenues. A witness said Durham yelled at Gibbs before stepping out and walking toward his car.      He got back in his car, made a U-turn and pulled into a parking lot where Gibbs had stopped, according to a Tampa police report. A witness saw Durham walk toward Gibbs with his arms extended. The two men yelled at each other. Durham punched Gibbs in the face.      Gibbs fell and hit his head on concrete. Durham got back in his car and drove off. Gibbs died days later from a brain hemorrhage and skull fracture.      Durham was convicted of manslaughter in 2002. He served about 10 years in prison and was ordered to take anger management classes. It was his third, and longest prison stint, having previously racked up convictions for aggravated assault, grand theft and trafficking in stolen property, state records show. He was released from prison in 2012 but remained on probation until 2017.      "It's a shame that he didn't learn his lesson while in jail," Gibbs' widow, Nancy Gibbs, told the Times. "I'm just glad I don't have to worry about him or running into him somewhere. It's ironic that he died in the same way as my husband."      A hand-written sign at Durham's home in Brandon discouraged reporters from making contact there. His wife, Heather, later spoke via phone about the man she knew.      She said her husband was a generous man, who gave money and rides to homeless people, liked riding dirt bikes and enjoyed working on anything with a motor.      They met through mutual friends in 2013. They married in February 2015.      She knew about his time in prison. She believes what Durham always maintained: that two men got in a fight, and he didn't mean to kill Gibbs.      "Just because he went to jail, that did not define who he was," Heather Durham said. "He wasn't this angry person who went around angry all the time. People only see the side that the media spreads. They don't know him like I did or his family did."      Gary Durham had worked for Your Green Team, a lawn care business in Plant City, for about six months, his wife said. They told each other "I love you," before he left their Brandon home about 6 a.m. Wednesday like he always does on a work day.      When someone from Your Green Team called and said her husband hadn't shown up for work, Heather Durham called authorities to see if he'd been involved in an accident. When that turned up nothing, she got in her own car and retraced his route.      She came upon the blocked intersection at Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Forbes Road, where deputies told her what happened. She said she's not passing judgment on her husband or the man who killed him.      "I don't know what happened this time, who was the aggressor or if both people were at fault," she said. "In my mind it doesn't matter, because he died over something stupid. It's not going to bring him back."      The two-lane road where Durham died is dotted with lines of trees and clusters of mobile homes and business. Cathi White, a manager at a Marathon gas station nearby, said she could hear a bevy of gunshots early Wednesday about the time when rush-hour traffic starts to pick up.      "It went 'boom, boom, boom, boom,' " White said. "I saw the deputies blocking off the road, and I knew something was wrong down there."      "It seems like this world's going to hell," she said. "It's getting worse and worse. Nothing surprises me anymore."      Times senior news researcher John Martin contributed to this report. Contact Dan Sullivan at [email protected] or (813) 226-3386.

By JANEL STEPHENS      © St. Petersburg Times      published October 1, 2002 TAMPA -- The daughter of a man who was killed by a single punch during a road rage incident last October recounted the last few moments of her father's life to the man who killed him. "I had to hold his cold hands," said 23-year-old Kelly Gibbs, the daughter of Timothy Gibbs. "Hands that were so strong. That built the house we lived in, that built my life." Gary Durham, the man who pleaded guilty to killing Timothy Gibbs in July, was sentenced Monday to 11.7 years in prison followed by five years of probation. Before Durham's sentencing, Gibbs' wife, Nancy, expressed her disappointment in the judicial system, saying that pleas to bring justice to her husband's death "fell on deaf ears." But Circuit Judge Ronald Ficarrotta told her, "I can assure you the statements on both sides did not fall on my deaf ears." In addition to prison, Durham must serve 300 hours of community service and seek psychological and drug evaluations and anger management counseling. Durham was driving on N Armenia Avenue on Oct. 24 when his Infiniti nearly collided with a Chevrolet Suburban driven by Gibbs, 48. The men exchanged angry words and gestures. Durham followed Gibbs into the parking lot of an auto repair shop where, witnesses told authorities, Durham punched Gibbs in the head. Gibbs hit his head on the asphalt and died 11/2 weeks later. Durham has served prison time for grand theft, aggravated assault and trafficking in stolen property. As a habitual offender, he faced up to 30 years on a manslaughter charge.

The Florida man, who had served a decade in prison in connection with a 2001 road-rage incident that ended in a man's death, was himself killed in what police say was another case of road rage. The 40-year-old reportedly stopped his Mazda pickup in the middle of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Plant City early Wednesday morning, and Robert Padgett pulled up behind him. Why isn't clear, but what is clear is that an argument escalated, and Padgett shot Durham. Responders to the scene found the 42-year-old, who had called 911, giving Durham CPR, but he died on the scene, reports WFTS. Police are calling the death "the end result of a road rage incident," reports the Tampa Bay Times. On the earlier incident, the AP and St. Petersburg Times reported Durham and Timothy James Gibbs argued after their two cars nearly collided on Oct. 24, 2001. The two traded hand gestures while driving, then ended up in a parking lot, where a single punch landed Gibbs on the ground. Durham left the scene, and Gibbs succumbed to a brain hemorrhage and skull fracture nine days later. The prosecutor said Gibbs' hands were by his side when he was hit. Durham was convicted of manslaughter the following year and released from prison in 2012. No charges have been filed against Padgett pending a review of the case. What Gibbs' widow had to say to WFLA: "I know it’s not the Christian thing to say, but this is poetic justice." (This judge handed out an odd sentence in another road-rage case.)
summarize: Disgraced Subway Pitchman Jared Fogle Sues Parents of Alleged Victim      RELATED VIDEO: The Story Behind the Story: Inside Jared Fogle's Life in Prison      Jared Fogle has filed a federal complaint against the parents of an alleged victim who sued the disgraced former Subway pitchman after he allegedly received secret recordings of her changing her clothes and bathing, according to court papers obtained by PEOPLE.Last March, the girl's parents filed a lawsuit against Fogle, who is serving more than 15 years in prison for conspiracy to receive child pornography and traveling to have sex with a minor, for emotional distress.The parent's lawsuit alleges that Russell Taylor, the former head of Fogle's charity, secretly filmed the underage girl and other children while they were changing clothes and bathing at Taylor's house and gave the footage to Fogle. The lawsuit filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of Indiana is seeking at least $150,000 in damages.In the motion filed Thursday, Fogle says the girl's parents “through their actions, caused or significantly contributed to the injuries and damages alleged by Jane Doe in her Complaint against the Defendants.”Fogle alleges the parents were responsible for their daughter's depression, anxiety and emotional distress because of their "hateful and abusive relationship toward each other, which included, but was not limited to, engaging in frequent fighting and arguing between themselves; abusing alcohol and getting drunk; and engaging in frequent fighting, physical abuse, and arguing with Jane Doe."Fogle also claims that the parents abuse and neglect caused their daughter's alcohol and substance abuse, self-mutilation, and suicidal ideations.Fogle's attorney, Ron Elberger, declined to comment.In June, Fogle lost a bid to have his prison sentence reduced. At that time, Elberger had argued that the sentencing judge abused her authority after prosecutors in a plea deal had agreed to seek no more than 12 1/2 years, or 150 months, following Fogle's guilty plea.Fogle currently is serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood in suburban Denver, Colorado. ||||| Disgraced Subway pitchman Jared Fogle has found a new way to inflict pain on one of his victims, blaming her parents rather than himself for her emotional distress.      The unidentified Indiana girl’s parents filed suit against Fogle, currently serving 16 years in federal prison, earlier this year for injuries from his invasion of privacy and negligence.      Fogle’s friend Russell Taylor, sentenced to 27 years in prison, was found guilty of secretly recording their daughter and others changing clothes and bathing at his house over more than four years and distributing the images to the former spokesman.      The suit filed in March had asked for $150,000 in damages, though a motion from Fogle’s legal team wants to name the girl’s parents as defendants.

summarize: (Vatican Radio) At the request of Pope Francis, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is writing to Diocesan Bishops to remind them that it falls to them above all to duly provide for all that is required for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.      Below find the English language translation of Circular letter to Bishops on the bread and wine for the Eucharist      CONGREGATION FOR DIVINE WORSHIP      AND THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SACRAMENTS      Prot. N. 320/17      Circular letter to Bishops      on the bread and wine for the Eucharist      At the request of the Holy Father, Pope Francis, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is writing to Diocesan Bishops (and to those who are their equivalents in law) to remind them that it falls to them above all to duly provide for all that is required for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper (cf. Lk 22: 8,13). It is for the Bishop as principal dispenser of the mysteries of God, moderator, promoter and guardian of the liturgical life in the Church entrusted to his care (Cf. CIC can. 835 § 1), to watch over the quality of the bread and wine to be used at the Eucharist and also those who prepare these materials. In order to be of assistance we recall the existing regulations and offer some practical suggestions.      Until recently it was certain religious communities who took care of baking the bread and making the wine for the celebration of the Eucharist. Today, however, these materials are also sold in supermarkets and other stores and even over the internet. In order to remove any doubt about the validity of the matter for the Eucharist, this Dicastery suggests that Ordinaries should give guidance in this regard by, for example, guaranteeing the Eucharistic matter through special certification.      The Ordinary is bound to remind priests, especially parish priests and rectors of churches, of their responsibility to verify those who provide the bread and wine for the celebration and the worthiness of the material.      It is also for the Ordinary to provide information to the producers of the bread and wine for the Eucharist and to remind them of the absolute respect that is due to the norms.      The norms about the Eucharistic matter are given in can. 924 of the CIC and in numbers 319 – 323 of the Institutio generalis Missalis Romani and have already been explained in the Instruction Redemptionis Sacramentum issued by this Congregation (25 March 2004):      “The bread used in the celebration of the Most Holy Eucharistic Sacrifice must be unleavened, purely of wheat, and recently made so that there is no danger of decomposition. It follows therefore that bread made from another substance, even if it is grain, or if it is mixed with another substance different from wheat to such an extent that it would not commonly be considered wheat bread, does not constitute valid matter for confecting the Sacrifice and the Eucharistic Sacrament. It is a grave abuse to introduce other substances, such as fruit or sugar or honey, into the bread for confecting the Eucharist. Hosts should obviously be made by those who are not only distinguished by their integrity, but also skilled in making them and furnished with suitable tools” (n. 48).      “The wine that is used in the most sacred celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice must be natural, from the fruit of the grape, pure and incorrupt, not mixed with other substances. […] Great care should be taken so that the wine intended for the celebration of the Eucharist is well conserved and has not soured. It is altogether forbidden to use wine of doubtful authenticity or provenance, for the Church requires certainty regarding the conditions necessary for the validity of the sacraments. Nor are other drinks of any kind to be admitted for any reason, as they do not constitute valid matter” (n. 50).      In its Circular Letter to the Presidents of the Episcopal Conferences regarding legitimate variations in the use of bread with a small quantity of gluten and the use of mustum as Eucharistic matter (24 July 2003, Prot. N. 89/78 – 17498), the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published the norms for the celebration of the Eucharist by persons who, for varying and grave reasons, cannot consume bread made in the usual manner nor wine fermented in the normal manner:      “Hosts that are completely gluten-free are invalid matter for the celebration of the Eucharist. Low-gluten hosts (partially gluten-free) are valid matter, provided they contain a sufficient amount of gluten to obtain the confection of bread without the addition of foreign materials and without the use of procedures that would alter the nature of bread” (A. 1-2).      “Mustum, which is grape juice that is either fresh or preserved by methods that suspend its fermentation without altering its nature (for example, freezing), is valid matter for the celebration of the Eucharist” (A. 3).      “The Ordinary is competent to give permission for an individual priest or layperson to use low-gluten hosts or mustum for the celebration of the Eucharist. Permission can be granted habitually, for as long as the situation continues which occasioned the granting of permission” (C. 1).      The same Congregation also decided that Eucharistic matter made with genetically modified organisms can be considered valid matter (cf. Letter to the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, 9 December 2013, Prot. N. 89/78 – 44897).      Those who make bread and produce wine for use in the Mass must be aware that their work is directed towards the Eucharistic Sacrifice and that this demands their honesty, responsibility and competence.      In order to facilitate the observance of the general norms Ordinaries can usefully reach agreement at the level of the Episcopal Conference by establishing concrete regulations. Given the complexity of situations and circumstances, such as a decrease in respect for the sacred, it may be useful to mandate a competent authority to have oversight in actually guaranteeing the genuineness of the Eucharistic matter by producers as well as those responsible for its distribution and sale.

In a letter, Cardinal Robert Sarah said the bread could be low-gluten.      But he said there must be enough protein in the wheat to make it without additives.

The Vatican has decreed that the small wafers, or hosts, used in the ceremony must contain gluten, reports the BBC. The directive went out to bishops worldwide in a letter posted by Vatican Radio. "Hosts that are completely gluten-free are invalid matter for the celebration of the Eucharist," reads the letter, which spells out that the bread "must be unleavened, purely of wheat, and recently made so that there is no danger of decomposition." Using anything else to make it gluten-free is thus off-limits. Low-gluten wafers are fine, however.
summarize: Gabriella Doolin's body was found Saturday night behind Allen County HS in Scottsville, KY. Kentucky State Police are handling her death as a homicide.      A candlelight vigil was held Sunday in memory of 8-year-old Gabriella Doolin, who was found murdered near the high school football stadium on Saturday night.      A 7-year-old girl was found dead on Saturday night near a high school football stadium and police suspect murder.      Around 600 people in the community came together for a vigil on the Scottsville town square on Sunday to pray and remember Gabriella Doolin.      The Doolin family were attending a youth football game at Allen County-Scottsville High School when Gabby disappeared in the small crowd.      Brian and Amy Doolin lost their daughter in the crowd at 7:40 p.m. They immediately asked the stadium announcer to call her name.      “It came over the intercom the third time and they shut it down,” said family friend Mike Willoughby. “We quit and the entire community started looking for her. We had a complete lockdown of the school. I mean it was super quick.”      It wasn’t quick enough. Gabby Doolin was found in a creek, apparently murdered, about 400 yards away from the stadium.      The news has been unbearable for people in Scottsville, which has a population of about 4,000. More than 500 people attended the candlelight vigil.      Even Brian and Amy Doolin attended, held upright by and encircled by love.      “We, as a community Brian, stand with you. This whole town stands with you tonight,” said pastor Keith Patrick. “We are praying for you. We are crying with you. We are mourning with you.”      “We are a great city, a great community,” said Willoughby. “We love one another. You never expect it. But it’s a constant reminder that evil has no borders or boundaries.      “Just like Paris, you wake up and something happens like that in your own backyard.”      No one attempted an explanation for what happened, they simply said to pray for the family and pray for justice.      “I love you. I ain’t no speaker, but I have love in my heart,” said Brian Dooley at the vigil. “Hold those babies tight. I’d love to hold Gabby just one more time, just hold her tight.”Allen County Sheriff Jeff Cooke posted a message to the family and community on his personal Facebook page, which was then shared by the Sheriff’s Office. It reads, in full:      I want to thank our community for all the help and support you are giving and have given to the Doolin family and law enforcement agencies. The help last night will never go unnoticed in my heart. We have a special bond in our community and it's been rocked to it's core. I cannot say a lot, but believe me we are trying to do everything with our boundaries that is allowed. Please continue to pray do this family and our community. I will update you when I can. Thank you for all the calls and concern, we are blessed to have the support we have.”      In the meantime, many in the area are sharing their sympathies on a public Facebook group with the goal of assisting the family and raising money.      Kentucky State Police sent the body to Louisville, KY, for an autopsy, which was completed late Sunday afternoon. KSP said they are narrowing a suspect list and finding the suspect is a top priority.      Scottsville is just over 50 miles northeast of Nashville and is just north of Westmoreland.

The 7-year-old girl was found dead 25 minutes after she disappeared from a youth football game in Scottsville, Ky., Saturday night, and police have confirmed that she was murdered. Gabriella's brother, Alec, 11, had been playing in the game, and she was there with her parents. They asked the stadium announcer to call her name as soon as they lost her in the small crowd. "It came over the intercom the third time and they shut it down," a family friend tells WSMV. "We quit and the entire community started looking for her. We had a complete lockdown of the school. I mean, it was super quick." Her body was found in a creek behind the high school, and authorities have not released autopsy results or details of the investigation. No arrests have been made, but the case "is being treated as an isolated incident and we do not feel that there is an ongoing threat," the Allen County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post. The Bowling Green Daily News provides a closer look at the girl known as Gabbi—"the blue-eyed blonde was an avid reader and a girlie girl who at one time said she wanted to play in the NFL." She opted for cheerleading, instead. The Saturday night game was actually an all-star game, and had it been a regular contest, Gabbi would have been on the sideline cheering on Alec. She "was a child that loved," says a former teacher, who considers herself "blessed" to have had Gabbi in the classroom. "She always had a smile on her face and the personality to make all those around her laugh." (In Alabama, authorities are dealing with case of an 8-year-old accused of murdering an even younger victim.)
summarize: LIVINGSTON — It’s been almost 70 years, but Marsha Kreuzman still remembers the moment she lay outside the steps of a Nazi crematorium wishing she could die.      Kreuzman had already lost her mother, father and brother to the Holocaust, and death seemed inevitable, she said.      But then an American soldier picked up her 68-pound body and whisked her to safety.      "I wanted to kiss his hand and thank him," she said. "From the first day I was liberated, I wanted to thank them, but I didn’t know who to thank."      Since then, the now-90-year-old Livingston resident has been on a decades-long quest to find American soldiers who liberated the Mauthausen concentration camp, one that didn’t have any success until she met Joe Barbella, two months ago, quite by chance.      Their unlikely meeting — and now a budding friendship — has given Kreuzman a pleasant twist to an otherwise-tragic story about surviving the Holocaust.      That tale begins in Krakow, Poland.      After the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, Kreuzman and her family were sent to the Krakow ghetto. In 1940, her mother was taken to the Majdanek concentration camp, where she was killed.      Marsha Kreuzman says the rest of the family was then taken to the Plashov, a labor camp just outside of Krakow, built on top of two former Jewish cemeteries.      There, she recalls, Nazis would punish or kill those who were too sick or weak to work.      "If they were able to work, they would be able to live," said Michael Riff, director of Ramapo College’s Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies. "It was a matter of life or death.      THE FIGHT TO SURVIVE      It was a strategy Kreuzman and her family would come to know intimately.      "They didn’t let us live, but they didn’t let us die," Kreuzman said.      At one point, Kreuzman didn’t finish building a road because it was raining, and guards responded by beating her with a wet horse’s whip. The scars from knots that were tied into the whip remain on her back to this day, she said. Another time, they hung her upside down on a door for several hours during the night after she tried to visit her brother, she said.      On Yom Kippur in 1943, Kreuzman’s father was found hiding in a ditch, where the camp’s bathrooms were. Nazi soldiers lined up him and dozens of other Jews one by one in front of the camp’s occupants and shot them to death, according to Kreuzman.      "They shot him in front of us," she said.      Her brother, Stephan Grunberg, would be next.      On May 13, 1944, Nazi soldiers rounded up some of the camp’s prisoners, including Grunberg. German doctors inspected each person and sent those they deemed capable of working to the right and those who were considered unable to work to the left.      Grunberg was sent to the left — and later to Auschwitz to be killed. "Then I was alone," Kreuzman said.      In January 1945, Kreuzman and other prisoners were marched for five days and four nights to Auschwitz. She said she was eventually transferred to concentration camps across Eastern Europe: Bergen-Belsen, then Flossenbürg and finally Mauthausen.      By that time, Joe Barbella was serving in the 11th Armored Division. Because he had learned to type at Central High School in Newark, when he was drafted into the Army, he was quickly assigned to be a record keeper for the division’s medical unit, he said.      On May 5, 1945, U.S. soldiers from the 11th Armored Division would cross the Linz border in Austria and liberate Mauthausen. Barbella wouldn’t enter the camp with the medical unit until the day after it was liberated, he said.      "When we got there, we saw all these people were skin and bones," Barbella said.      Kreuzman said she remembers lying down just outside the camp’s crematorium when the soldiers arrived. She heard the words: "You’re free."      She fainted and a soldier carried her to a field hospital, where doctors would start nursing her back to health, she said.      HER SEARCH      After the war, Barbella returned to New Jersey, building a comfortable life in Union Township with his wife, Anne.      Kreuzman spent a few years in England before moving to the United States in 1952. For years, she and her husband lived in Union, where she worked as a nurse.      But in the back of her mind, she always wondered about the American men who crossed enemy lines to free her and other Jews from the Austrian concentration camp.      She even wrote letters to men in telephone books she thought might have been connected to the Army division that liberated Mauthausen.      "I always look for liberators," she said. "I wasn’t giving up."      Then, in October, nearly 70 years after her liberation, she came across a wedding anniversary announcement in The Star-Ledger for Joe and Anne Barbella’s 65th anniversary.      "A veteran of World War II, Joseph served in the 11th Armored Division which liberated the Mauthausen concentration camp," the announcement said.      The next day, a tearful Kreuzman called the Barbellas and told Anne Barbella that she was one of the Jews whom Joe liberated.      They arranged a meeting at the Barbellas’ home later that month through the New Jersey Jewish News and the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest NJ.      "They really welcomed me with open arms," Kreuzman said about the two-hour visit.      Barbella said he felt like he has known Kreuzman for years, though he shied away from her descriptions of his work as heroic. "I’m just an ordinary solider," he said.      Since they met, the two have become fast friends. Kreuzman talks to the Barbella family regularly on the phone. She even hosted Joe Barbella, his wife and daughter for lunch at her apartment.      And last week she brought him a Christmas gift.      "He deserves to be honored."

Marsha Kreuzman weighed just 70 pounds when the troops came in to liberate Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria in May of 1945. She was 18 years old at the time.      WCBS 880’s Wayne Cabot spoke with Kreuzman, now 90, about finding one of the American soldiers who helped rescue her.      Livingston Holocaust Survivor Reunites With Liberator 68 Years Later She said she was reading the local paper in October when she came across a name in a wedding anniversary announcement. The listing said Joe Barbella had helped liberate Mauthausen as a soldier during World War II. Kreuzman looked up Barbella, 93, and after a tearful conversation, visited him at his Union Township home. “I was crying and I was kissing him and I was hugging him and I was kissing his hands,” Kreuzman told Cabot. Kreuzman said her entire family was killed in the Holocaust and didn’t think she’d survive. “When I was liberated, I was lying on the crematorium door waiting to be shuffled to crematorium. I was sick and when the American soldiers picked me up, I looked [and] he looked like he was in heaven because I was on the floor and he was a very tall man,” Kreuzman said. She said she fainted when he picked her up and carried her to freedom. Kreuzman said she brought the Barbellas Christmas gifts last week. She had spent decades looking for the men who helped liberate her. Kreuzman said she’d tried to meet two other liberators but said they died before she was able to track them down.

Kreuzman and her family were forced into the Krakow ghetto in 1939, when she was in her teens; the next year, her mother was taken to a concentration camp and killed. Kreuzman herself went to a labor camp, then to Auschwitz, then Bergen-Belsen, then Flossenbürg, then Mauthausen. Along the way she saw her father shot, and lost her brother.

summarize: Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey showed no remorse over the alleged bad behavior of a former "hero" cop who is now being held on a $60 million dollar bail -- charged with sex assaults at gunpoint. (Published Monday, May 20, 2013)      Former Philadelphia police officer Richard DeCoatsworth, once honored by President Barack Obama for his heroism, remains in jail on $60 million bail for allegedly raping two women -- forcing one into prostitution.      Now, NBC10 has learned the City of Philadelphia is spending more than $1.5 million defending itself against DeCoatsworth's checkered past on the force.      Law enforcement sources say DeCoatsworth had nine citizen complaints against him over his nearly five year stint with the department. The complains, sources say, included allegations of assault, abuse and misconduct.      Issues with the 27-year-old began to arise in 2005 when he was in the Philadelphia Police Academy. DeCoatsworth allegedly injured a Girard Avenue business owner during a fight. However, he was allowed to remain a recruit despite the allegations.

NBC10's Katy Zachry has the latest details. (Published Sunday, May 19, 2013)      In 2007 as a rookie officer, DeCoatsworth was severely injured after being shot in the face. After being shot, he managed to chase down the suspect for several blocks before collapsing. He called in enough information by radio that police were able to track down and arrest the suspect later the same day.      His actions earned him an invitation from Vice President Joe Biden to attend President Obama’s first congressional address at the U.S. Capital in February 2009. The officer sat in the gallery with First Lady Michelle Obama during the speech. He was also honored by his peers as a 2008 Top Cop.      Exclusive Beaten Man Flabbergasted by Police Arrest      Soon after, though, he was involved in two more dramatic incidents.      In April 2009, police say DeCoatsworth was jumped and attacked by a man when he tried to disperse a crowd at the Logan section of the city. During the struggle, sources say DeCoatsworth’s gun went off and hit the suspect who took off running. Another officer responding to the scene shot the suspect dead, according to sources.      Bail Set at $60M for Hero Officer Charged With Rape      Bail was set at $60 million Saturday for a former Philadelphia police officer Richard Decoatsworth who has been charged with raping two women at gunpoint. NBC10's Nefertiti Jaquez reports on the developing case. (Published Sunday, June 9, 2013)      In September 2009, DeCoatsworth and another officer stopped a man on a motorcycle in the Kensington section of the city. While they were questioning him, a second man allegedly jumped on the motorcycle and drove at the officers. Police say DeCoatsworth shot at the suspect, who sped off. The suspect was found later at the hospital where his mother had taken him to be treated for a shotgun wound.      During the incident, local witnesses claimed the two suspects did nothing wrong and that DeCoatsworth and the other officer acted recklessly -- shooting while children were nearby.      In November 2011, Internal Affairs investigated an alleged scuffle between DeCoatsworth and another officer, according to Philly.com.      DeCoatsworth retired from the police force on disability back in December 2011.      Hero Officer Charged With Raping Women      A former Philadelphia police officer once hailed as a hero and given a seat next to the first lady at a speech by President Obama has been arrested and charged with raping two women and other crimes. Former officer Richard DeCoatsworth was arrested and charged Saturday with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats and related offenses. NBC10's Cydney Long reports. (Published Saturday, May 18, 2013)      In February of 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for DeCoatsworth after he allegedly threatened a woman in Port Richmond.      The most recent incident began two weeks ago after DeCoatsworth allegedly met a woman at a bar on North Front Street. Police say the former officer forced the woman into prostitution at a Days Inn hotel along Roosevelt Boulevard in the Lawncrest section of the city.      Then, between 2 a.m. Thursday and Friday evening, DeCoatsworth went to the woman’s home along North Howard Street in the Fishtown-Kensington area, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation.      Once he arrived, DeCoatsworth allegedly forced that woman and a second woman, both in their 20s, to use drugs and perform oral sex on him at gunpoint. The alleged victims reported the assault Friday only after DeCoatsworth went home, according to police.

(Published Saturday, May 18, 2013)      Police raided DeCoatsworth’s house on the 2700 block of Salmon Street in the Port Richmond section of Philadelphia around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday.      He was arraigned and charged with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats and other related offenses. Police also confiscated drugs and guns from the home, according to a source. No word yet on what kind of drugs were removed from the home.      Video Crossing Gate Hits School Bus as Train Approaches      According to court documents, bail was set at $25 million for each of the alleged victims. Another $10 million bail was set in a separate domestic violence case DeCoatsworth is now being charged with, according to investigators.      Police say he assaulted his live-in girlfriend on May 9. The $60 million bail is reportedly one of the highest set in Philadelphia history.      DeCoatsworth faces more than 32 crimes in all three cases. He is scheduled for another court appearance on June 17.      One of DeCoatsworth’s neighbors said she was relieved to hear about his arrest.      “I am scared to be saying this now but I hope he stays where he is at, he has been a thorn in the side of this neighborhood for so long,” said the woman who did not want to be identified.      Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter's Office says of the nine complaints lodged against DeCoatsworth -- one resulted in a lawsuit. The suit alleged DeCoatsworth used aggressive behavior while on the job.      The city settled that suit for $1.5 million. However, officials say Philadelphia has accrued other legal costs related to DeCoatsworth.      Last year, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told police he believed he failed DeCoatsworth by letting him go back to work with a stressful unit too soon after he was shot in the face.      "I think I screwed up on that," Ramsey told the Daily News. "I think I should have given him more time. He didn't want more time but I should have done that."      In light of his most recent arrest however, Ramsey had much harsher words for DeCoatsworth on Monday.      "He has to be held accountable," Ramsey said. "Just like anybody else. There should be no special consideration given simply because he once served as a police officer."      DeCoatsworth is being held on $60 million bail. A figure that is rarely seen in the U.S. criminal justice system.      Philadelphia District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson said prosecution did not request a high bail amount, rather that DeCoatsworth be held without bail.      “Being held without bail is the highest bail situation you could face as a defendant in Philadelphia," Jamerson said, “At DeCoatsworth's arraignment on Saturday, we requested that he be held without bail, but the judge instead chose to impose bail at $60 million.”      Other high-profile cases, including federal trials held in Pennsylvania, have included large sums, but none are near what the 27-year-old is held on.      While many with similarly egregious crimes are held without bail, some are held on bonds that reach into the millions of dollars.      Christina Regusters, the 20-year old woman charged with abducting and raping a 5-year old girl in Cobbs Creek, is currently held on $4 million bond.      Ariel Castro, the Ohio man who is facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape for holding three women captive in his home for a decade, is held on only $8 million.      While DeCoatsworth is listed as being represented by a public defender, family members are currently helping him acquire an attorney.

Richard DeCoatsworth in happier times, as he joined first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden at a presidential address in 2009. (Associated Press/File)      A retired Philadelphia police officer once hailed as a hero and invited by Michelle Obama in 2009 to sit next to her during the president's State of the Union address has been arrested and charged with raping and holding two women captive for two days. Richard DeCoatsworth, 27, was taken into custody early Saturday. When police arrived at his Port Richmond house on the 2700 block of Salmon Street, DeCoatsworth, who was armed, went to the basement to open a garage door and let out his pit bull, a law enforcement source said. The dog ran away after police fired two flash grenades. DeCoatsworth, discarding his gun, ran into the bedroom, where there was a loaded shotgun. Police subdued and arrested him without incident, the source said. DeCoatsworth had been under investigation by the Special Victims Unit after two women alleged that he forced them to use drugs and engage in sexual activity.      The women said they came into contact with DeCoatsworth about 2 a.m. Thursday at a party, said Officer Christine O'Brien, a police spokeswoman. They left the party with him, and the three went to another location.      Police did not identify the site of the party or say where the alleged crimes took place.      At the second site, DeCoatsworth took out a handgun and allegedly forced the two women "to engage in the use of narcotics and sexual acts," O'Brien said.      The women reported the incident to police, and DeCoatsworth was charged with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats, and related charges. His bail was set at $60 million.      The women told police DeCoatsworth had held them captive for two days, according to the law enforcement source.      It was a long fall from grace for the former officer, who in 2007 was lauded as a hero.      2009 tribute      As a 21-year-old rookie, DeCoatsworth took a shotgun blast to the face and, bleeding heavily and returning fire, pursued his attacker for several blocks before collapsing and radioing for help.      The gunman, Antonio Coulter, was caught and later pleaded guilty in the shooting. DeCoatsworth underwent extensive surgery and returned to duty in June 2008.      His heroism in that case led to an invitation to sit next to the first lady during the president's 2009 address.      DeCoatsworth then became involved in two controversial incidents in which he shot at suspects. In April 2009, he shot Anthony Temple when the man lunged for his gun, police said, and a backup officer then shot and killed Temple.      The following September, he wounded a man in a leg who allegedly ran at him on a motorcycle.      DeCoatsworth racked up a number of Internal Affairs complaints, and he retired in December 2011 at age 25. He left, a police spokesman said at the time, due to injuries from the 2007 shooting.      'Something like this'      Some in the Police Department had feared DeCoatsworth was badly troubled. One officer said DeCoatsworth's unpredictable behavior and temper had led some in the department to view him as a time bomb.      "I hate to say it, but I did see something like this coming," the officer said Saturday.      Neighbors at a diner down the block from DeCoatsworth's home said he had been known to behave erratically. A woman who asked not to be named said she avoided the former officer after an incident in the fall in which his pit bull allegedly charged at her chihuahua.      "From the look in his eyes," she said, "I was terrified."      Shattered glass from DeCoatsworth's door spilled out over his front steps Saturday afternoon, and people inside refused to answer the door. When two people left the apartment, they declined to comment.      Contact Jonathan Lai      at 856-779-3220, jlai@phillynews.com, or follow on Twitter @elaijuh.

Yesterday, he was arrested on charges of rape, sexual assault, and terroristic threats, as police raided his home, also confiscating guns and drugs, NBC Philadelphia reports. According to police, DeCoatsworth met two women at a party, then is alleged to have pulled a gun on them and forced them "to engage in the use of narcotics and to engage in sexual acts." His bail was set at $60 million. DeCoatsworth received a "Top Cops" award in 2008 and was promoted to an elite highway patrol unit following his act of bravery. But he retired from the force in 2011, after accruing a large number of Internal Affairs complaints and two controversial incidents where he shot at suspects, reports the Inquirer.

With last year's quiet launch of a service called Price Promise, the car shopping website is trying to "be as close as possible to Amazon.com for the automotive experience," president Seth Berkowitz explained at an industry gathering yesterday. What that means, per the Detroit Free Press: Berkowitz says car shoppers' No. 1 gripe is the lack of a clear, exact car price; Price Promise cuts out the haggling that follows as a result by allowing dealers to email the exact price of a vehicle found on the site to shoppers who request it. Shoppers can then print out a certificate bearing the number; the dealer must sell the car for that price. Ergo, no haggling. Though the site hopes the feature will set it apart from the competition, TrueCar.com has offered a similar program since 2009, the Free Press notes; it claims 6,200 participating dealers, to Edmunds.com's 600. The service also doesn't factor in a buyer's credit history, which could change the monthly payments, points out the Wall Street Journal. Price Promise doesn't necessarily meaning getting the lowest price, either. Dealers say they sell cars to Price-Promise users for $300 to $500 more than traditional buyers. But according to Berkowitz, it's a worthwhile tradeoff for those looking to save time and avoid headaches.
summarize: Bernie Sanders gave a victory speech early in the evening on Super Tuesday, when more than 10 states hold their primaries and caucuses for party presidential nominations.      Sanders, an independent senator who is running for the Democratic nomination, was projected as the winner of his home state of Vermont shortly after polls closed there. He then took the stage to thank his supporters and look forward to the next stops on his campaign.      "This campaign is not just about electing a president," Sanders said. "It is about transforming America."      Sanders also emphasized his "Vermont values" and continued pushing his message of a "political revolution" to undercut the "billionaire class" in the US.      "In our state, we have town meetings and people come out and they argue about budgets and then they vote," Sanders said. "One person, one vote. Billionaires do not buy town meetings. We're going to not allow billionaires and their super PACs to destroy American democracy."      He also took a shot at his rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the political establishment at large.      "I know that Secretary Clinton and the establishment people think I'm thinking too big," Sanders said. "I don't think so."      And while many political watchers still believe that Clinton is the likely Democratic nominee, Sanders made clear that he's pushing forward and focusing on states that still have to vote.      Sanders said:      Ten months ago, as you know ... we were at 3% in the polls. We have come a very long way in 10 months. At the end of tonight, 15 states will have voted, 35 states remain. And let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for world of peace, to every one of those states.      Later in the night, Sanders was also projected to defeat Clinton in Oklahoma. ||||| Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife Jane Sanders, stand up after voting in the Vermont primary at the Robert Miller Community and Recreation Center in Burlington,... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton were sweeping through the South on Super Tuesday, with the front-runners claiming victory in their parties' primaries in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. Clinton also picked up a win in Virginia, while Trump carried the Republican contest in Massachusetts.      Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. With elections in every region of the country, the contests put a spotlight on candidates' strengths and weaknesses with a broad swath of American voters.      For Clinton and Trump, the voting marked an opportunity to begin pulling away from their rivals and charting a course toward the general election. Each entered Super Tuesday having won three of four early voting contests, and more strong showings could start putting the nominations out of reach for other contenders.      Seconds after polls closed in Georgia, a confident Trump wrote on Twitter, "Thank you Georgia!"      Clinton was steadying herself after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator did carry his home state decisively on Tuesday, and told the crowd at a raucous victory party that he was "so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country."      Early exit polls underscored Sanders' continued weaknesses with black voters, a core part of the Democratic constituency. Clinton led with African-Americans, as well as both men and women, in Georgia and Virginia, according to surveys conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks.      Sanders continued to show strength with young voters, carrying the majority of those under the age of 30.      Democrats were voting in 11 states and American Samoa, with 865 delegates up for grabs. Republicans were voting in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake.      The contests come at a turbulent time for the GOP, given Trump's strengths in the face of opposition from many party leaders. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz launched furious verbal attacks on the billionaire businessman in recent days, but some in the party establishment fear the anti-Trump campaign has come too late.      Trump's wins in the South were a blow to Cruz, who once saw the region as his opportunity to stake a claim to the nomination. Now Cruz's future hinges on a victory in his home state of Texas, the biggest prize of the day.      Rubio's goal was even more modest. He was seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hoping to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.      Even before the first results started flowing in, Trump was calling on Rubio to give up if he didn't win anywhere on Tuesday.      "He has to get out," Trump told Fox News. "He hasn't won anything."      Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to only grow stronger, winning states and drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.      In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama supported the proposal, according to the early exit polls.      Worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump later said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did repudiate him.      House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual.      "When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games," Ryan said.      The disarray among Republicans comes as Clinton appears to be tightening her grip on the Democratic field. Her wins in Georgia and Virginia were the first of what her campaign hoped would be a sweep of the South, a region where large segments of the Democratic electorate are black.      In Georgia, just under half of Democratic voters on Tuesday were black, with 8 in 10 backing Clinton. About a quarter of Virginia's Democratic voters were black, and also overwhelmingly backed Clinton, according to exit polling.      Democratic voters were more likely to want a continuation of Obama's policies than switch to more liberal policies in eight of nine states where surveys were conducted.      Signaling her growing confidence, Clinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.      "What we can't let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side," she told voters in Springfield, Massachusetts. "It really undermines our fabric as a nation."      States holding voting contests in both parties were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. Republicans also vote in Alaska and Democrats in Colorado. Democrats also have a contest in American Samoa and for Democrats Abroad.      ___      Colvin reported from Palm Beach, Florida.

When the first polls closed, CNN quickly projected Clinton the winner in Georgia and Virginia—both states she lost to Barack Obama in 2008—with Sanders winning his home state of Vermont. Clinton then racked up wins in Alabama, Tennessee, and Arkansas (where she was once the state's first lady), before adding Texas. The latter gave her a sweep of Southern states holding primaries, reports the AP. She also won Massachusetts in a close contest, along with American Samoa. The night ended well for Sanders, however, as he added Oklahoma, Colorado, and Minnesota to his tally. Earlier, Clinton declined to make any predictions. "Let's see what voters decide in all these states that are lined up today and then we'll take stock after it's over," she said. Sanders spoke in Vermont and said his campaign, which has plenty of money, is in it for the long run, reports Business Insider. He noted that most of the states have yet to vote. "Let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for world of peace, to every one of those states." All told, Clinton and Sanders were competing for 865 delegates in 11 states and American Samoa on Tuesday, the biggest single-day prize of the 2016 campaign. Click here for Republican results.

Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen 's sister Elizabeth has moved past her earlier work in projects such as The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley: The Case of Thorn Mansion. Way past it.In fact, the 21-year-old actress's two new films set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, are dark and gritty, tackling topics such as cults and sexual abuse.Elizabeth's earlier roles in her sister's films were significantly less taxing. "Sometimes I had lines, and sometimes I'd just sit on a stool," she tells PEOPLE, laughing. "I couldn't pronounce my r's."After studying acting in high school and then attending New York University's Tisch Schol of the Arts, Olsen, who is three years younger than Mary-Kate and Ashley, quickly landed work in independent films, including the duo of films premiering at Sundance, Silent House and Martha Marcy May Marlene, which both garnered her praise.Olsen insists that working on these darker projects wasn't calculated to distinguish herself from her earlier, kid-friendly fare."I wasn't trying to shape any beginnings of a career," she says. "You can't guess how things are going to go." ||||| Until now, she is best known for being the Elizabeth in Elizabeth and James. But in the next year, we will be getting to know Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley, much better because, well, she’s made more movies recently than her sisters combined. In fact, she has two flicks premiering at Sundance this year. After the jump, the deets on Elizabeth.      Elizabeth, or Lizzie as she is often called, made several cameo appearance alongside her sisters. Her first was at age four, in their first movie, aptly titled “Our First Video.” She also appears in “How the West Was Fun.” Rather than going the TV or movie route, Elizabeth opted to act in plays. This came in handy while filming the movie “Silent House,” which premiered at Sundance this week and was sold to Lionsgate. Elizabeth stars as a girl who believes her summer home is haunted, and the film was shot in one take. “When I was auditioning, I was like, ‘Just so you know I’m used to the medium of theater, so like I can stand on my feet for this long,’” she said.” While her twin sisters took “leaves of absence” from NYU and never went back, Elizabeth has a diploma from the school that she can hang on her wall. She recently graduated from Tisch School of the Arts. Her second Sundance flick is “Martha Macy May Marlene.” Elizabeth stars as a woman who escapes a scary, brainwash cult and goes to live with her sister. Only, she has serious trouble adjusting to normal life and goes crazy in the process. Elizabeth is three years younger than her twin sisters, but she knows what to expect if she ever becomes half as famous as them. “When I would go shopping with my sisters when I was younger, it would be dangerous. People would almost get us into car accidents,” she said. “I just think it’s crazy in general but I want to be an actor – and I have since I was a little girl – and if that happens, then you figure out how to deal with it where it doesn’t completely infringe upon your life.”      [Huffington Post]      [Wikipedia]      [Sundance] |||||	– Cue the inevitable jokes about a full house, but there's a new Olsen in town, reports People. Elizabeth Olsen—at age 21 three years younger than her famous twin sisters—is rolling out a pair of indie movies at Sundance that are causing a stir. "It's hard for independent films when they want to get money," says Olsen. "And to have a lead be an unknown—it's kind of a risk for people to take. And so the fact that they took that risk was like made my year, my life, I don't know! It was really exciting." Olsen is appearing in Silent House, based on a Uruguayan film, made by the folks behind Open Water, and shot in one continuous take. She moves from that to Martha Macy May Marlene, a tale of young women adjusting to life after leaving a cult. All of which are a shade darker than her roles in her sisters' movies: "Sometimes I had lines, and sometimes I'd just sit on a stool," she laughs. "I couldn't pronounce my r's."

summarize: In a conference call this morning, Herman Cain told his senior staff that he is “reassessing” whether to remain in the race. He will make his final decision “over the next several days.”      UPDATE: National Review was on the call. It lasted five minutes.      “Obviously, you’re all aware of this recent firestorm that hit the news yesterday,” Cain began, his voice somber. “First thing I want to do is say to you what I have said publicly: I deny those charges, unequivocally. Secondly, I have known this lady for a number of years. And thirdly, I have been attempting to help her financially because she was out of work and destitute, desperate. So, thinking that she was a friend — and I have helped many friends — I now know that she wasn’t the friend that I thought she was. But it was a just a friendship relationship.”      “That being said, obviously, this is cause for reassessment,” he continued. “As you know, during the summer we had to make some reassessments based upon our financial situation. We were able to hang in there; we reassessed the situation and kept on going. We also did a reassessment after the Iowa straw poll and we made another reassessment after the Florida straw poll. When the previous two accusations, false accusations, came about, we made another assessment. The way we handled those was, we continued on with our schedule. We made an assessment about what was going to happen to our support. But our supporters, and even some folks that we didn’t have as supporters, they stood with us, and they showed it not only in terms of their verbal support, they showed it in terms of their dollars.”      “Now, with this latest one, we have to do an assessment as to whether or not this is going to create too much of a cloud, in some people’s minds, as to whether or not they would be able to support us going forth,” Cain said.      “Over the next several days, we are going to continue with the schedule as usual,” he said. “I’ve got a major speech tonight at Hillsdale College on national security and foreign policy, and I will deliver it with vim, vigor, and enthusiasm. And then tomorrow we’ve got some media appearances scheduled. So we’re going to continue until we complete our assessment over the next several days.”      “But if a decision is made, different than to plow ahead, you all will be the first to know,” he said. “So until that time, I want to continue to thank you all for your support, thank you for your prayers. It’s taken an emotional toll, but the people in the audience tonight will never know it.”      “It’s also taken a toll on my wife and family, as you would imagine,” he concluded. “Any time you put another cloud of doubt, unfortunately, in the court of public opinion, for some people, you’re guilty until proven innocent. And so, the public will have to decide whether they believe her or whether they believe me. That’s why we’re going to give it time, to see what type of response we get from our supporters.” ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine      This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds)      The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. |||||	– Herman Cain is “reassessing” his campaign in the wake of Ginger White’s allegations. “This is cause for reassessment,” Cain told staffers on a conference call today, according to a transcript posted on the National Review.

summarize: Image copyright Yulia Skripal/Facebook Image caption Yulia Skripal was treated in Salisbury District Hospital for more than a month after being exposed to a nerve agent      Yulia Skripal, the poisoned daughter of Russian ex-spy Sergei, has been discharged from hospital.      The 33-year-old left Salisbury District Hospital on Monday and has been taken to a secure location.      The hospital said: "This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone."      Her 66-year-old father remains in hospital and is "recovering more slowly than Yulia". Doctors hope he will be discharged "in due course".      The pair were taken to hospital on 4 March after being exposed to the toxic nerve agent Novichok.      The father and daughter were found slumped on a park bench in the centre of Salisbury.      Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent, but has since been discharged.      A statement from Ms Skripal released through the Metropolitan Police last week said her "strength is growing daily".      Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital but is no longer in a critical condition.      Medical director Dr Christine Blanshard said he has made "good progress", adding: "Although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope he too will be able to leave hospital in due course."      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hospital boss says release "significant milestone" for ex-spy's daughter      The government says Russia was behind the poisoning, and Prime Minister Theresa May said Moscow was "culpable" for the attack.      But the Russian government denied any involvement and has accused the British of inventing a "fake story".      According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, Whitehall officials have compiled a list of 26 alternative explanations for the attack that have been put forward by Russia's government and media.      So far they have attached blame to Ms Skripal's mother-in-law, Theresa May, and a drone, among others.      Meanwhile, Mrs May welcomed the news of Ms Skripal's discharge from hospital and wished her the best for her recovery.      The Russian Embassy congratulated Ms Skripal but said: "We need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will."      Responding to a Sunday Times report that the Skripals could relocate and be offered new identities, the embassy said it would view any possible resettlement as an "abduction".      On Sunday the Anglican Bishop of Salisbury will host a "service of cleansing and celebration" for the attack victims at St Thomas' Church, less than 200m from where the Skripals were found.      It will be followed by a procession near to the bench where they became ill.      Police said the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent at their home.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Specialist officers in protective suits have retrieved samples from multiple sites in Salisbury      The BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher said Novichok prevents enzymes called acetylcholinesterase from functioning normally at nerve junctions, including those required to keep the heart beating.      He said: "But over time, the nerve agent is metabolised and excreted by the body and new acetylcholinesterase is made.      "The question is whether doctors can keep patients alive long enough for that to happen."      BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the highest concentration was found on the Skripals' front door handle.      Traces of Novichok were also found at the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury, where the Skripals spent the afternoon.      Zizzi, the Mill, the Maltings shopping centre and the Skripals' home remain cordoned off, Wiltshire Police said.      Investigators identified 131 people who had potentially been in contact with the nerve agent, and up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant were told to wash their clothes and possessions.      Analysis: Will Russia get access to Yulia Skripal?      By BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner      Unseen by the public, Yulia Skripal was discreetly discharged from hospital in Salisbury last night, hours ahead of this morning's announcement.      She is understood to have been taken to a secure location somewhere in Britain while discussions take place over her future safety and protection.      For the UK government this could prove to be a delicate diplomatic problem. She is a Russian citizen and Moscow has been pressing for consular access.      But it is by no means clear where she will want to settle given her narrow escape from death in this failed assassination attempt on her and her father, Sergei.      Whitehall officials say reports that the Skripals are to be given a new identity in the US are premature.      Samples of the nerve agent have been tested by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire, in an attempt to verify its source.      Its head said the precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a "state actor".      A diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West has followed, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK.      Russia's request for a new, joint investigation was voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hague on 4 April.      Image caption Yulia and Sergei Skripal were taken to Salisbury District Hospital after being found slumped on a bench in Salisbury      Mr Skripal is a retired military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.      He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006, but was released in 2010 as part of an exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI.      Ms Skripal regularly travelled between the UK and Moscow, and had returned from Russia the day before the pair were poisoned.

Viktoria Skripal has been refused a UK visa to visit her relatives.      The Home Office said the application did not comply with immigration rules, but a government source told the BBC it appears Russia is "trying to use Viktoria as a pawn".      Viktoria later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. ||||| SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - Yulia Skripal has left hospital more than five weeks after she and her father, a former Russian spy, were poisoned with a nerve agent in an attack that has sparked one of the biggest crises in the West’s relations with the Kremlin since the Cold War.      An undated photograph shows Yulia Skripal, daughter of former Russian Spy Sergei Skripal, taken from Yulia Skripal's Facebook account in London, Britain, April 6, 2018. Yulia Skripal/Facebook via REUTERS      Yulia and Sergei Skripal, 66, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain’s MI6 foreign spy service, were found unconscious on a public bench in the English cathedral city of Salisbury on March 4.      Britain accused Russia of being behind the nerve agent attack and Western governments including the United States expelled over 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind.      The Skripals were in a critical condition for weeks and doctors at one point feared, even if they survived, they might have suffered brain damage. But the Skripals’ health since then has begun to improve rapidly.      Yulia, 33, has been discharged from Salisbury District Hospital, Christine Blanshard, medical director of the hospital, told reporters on Tuesday and her father could be discharged in due course.      “We have now discharged Yulia,” Blanshard said. “This is not the end of her treatment, but marks a significant milestone.”      “Her father has also made good progress,” Blanshard said. “ “Although he is recovering more slowly than Yulia, we hope that he too will be able to leave hospital in due course.”      Yulia has been taken to a secure location, the BBC said. The Sunday Times reported that Britain was considering giving the Skripals new identities and a fresh life in the United States to protect them from further attacks.      Russia said it would consider any secret resettlement of the Skripals as an abduction of its citizens.      “The world, while having no opportunity to interact with them, will have every reason to see this as an abduction of the two Russian nationals or at least as their isolation,” a spokesman for the Russian embassy in London said.      DIPLOMATIC CRISIS      British Prime Minister Theresa May said the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok, a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.      Russia has denied Britain’s charges of involvement in the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two and suggested Britain carried out the attack itself to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.      Russia has said it does not have such nerve agents and President Vladimir Putin said it was nonsense to think that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and his daughter.      Blanshard, a doctor with 25 years experience, said nerve agents work by attaching themselves to particular enzymes in the body that then stop the nerves from functioning. She said this had resulted in sickness and hallucinations.      Giving the first details about the medical treatment of the Skripals, she said doctors had first sought to stabilise them to ensure that they could breathe and that blood could circulate.      “We then needed to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients, until they could create more enzymes to replace those affected by the poisoning,” Blanshard said. “We also used specialised decontamination techniques to remove any residual toxins.”      She did not say when Yulia had been discharged.      Both Britain and Russia congratulated Skripal, a Russian citizen, on her recovery.      “We congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery,” the Russian embassy in London said, adding that it had not been granted consular access to her.      Slideshow (6 Images)      Sergei Skripal, who was recruited by Britain’s MI6, was arrested for treason in Moscow in 2004. He ended up in Britain after being swapped in 2010 for Russian spies caught in the United States.      Since emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, Skripal lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found poisoned. He has British citizenship. |||||	– More good news for the daughter of a poisoned former Russian spy: Yulia Skripal is out of the hospital. "This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone," says a statement from the UK's Salisbury District Hospital, per the BBC. The 33-year-old had been treated there since last month after she and her father, Sergei Skripal, were found poisoned by the nerve agent Novichok. The hospital said the elder Skripal also was improving, but not as quickly as his daughter, who will continue her recuperation at an undisclosed location. The US and Britain continue to blame Russia for the attacks, while Moscow continues to deny any involvement, notes Reuters.

(Associated Press)      A rock spray-painted by students sits in memory of 16-year-old stabbing victim Maren Sanchez on Friday, April 25, 2014, sits outside Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Conn. Sanchez was stabbed to death... (Associated Press)      Police haven't released the suspect's name, but people who saw him taken into custody identified him as Chris Plaskon, a friend of the victim, 16-year-old Maren Sanchez.      Plaskon's attorney, Richard Meehan, says his client is being held in a hospital under psychiatric evaluation and will not appear at his arraignment, scheduled for Monday in New Haven.      Plaskon is charged as a juvenile but Meehan has said he expects him to eventually be charged as an adult.      The stabbing occurred Friday morning at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, hours before the school's prom, and authorities are investigating whether Sanchez was stabbed after turning down the boy's invitation to the dance.      Connecticut's chief medical examiner said Sunday that Sanchez died of wounds to her torso and neck.      Milford Alderwoman Greta Stanford said the school would remain closed Monday. A memorial service is scheduled for 7 p.m. on the school's football field. Organizers are seeking donations so the junior class can buy a memorial bench in Sanchez's honor.      Mark Robinson, a technical education teacher who saw the suspect being taken out of the school in handcuffs, said Plaskon is the third of five brothers and has a good sense of humor. His family has deep roots in the community, Robinson said.      "There's no reason to suspect he would have done this. I think that's what makes it harder," Robinson said.      Classmate Imani Langston, who saw Plaskon being read his rights and taken away in a police car, said Sanchez and the boy were just friends and had never dated.      Sanchez, a member of the National Honor Society who was active in drama and other school activities, had been focused on prom in the days before her death. She had posted a photograph on Facebook of her blue prom dress and was looking forward to attending with a new boyfriend.      People who know Plaskon said he is an athlete and described him as genial and respectful.      "His family is devastated not only for him, but the youngster who was killed," Meehan said." It's a terrible situation all the way around." ||||| A 16-year-old high school student could be arraigned as soon as Monday in a Connecticut courtroom after being accused of stabbing a fellow classmate, Maren Sanchez, to death after Sanchez turned down his invitation to the prom.      She died of wounds to her neck and torso sustained Friday morning, hours before she was supposed to go to the dance, reports CBS News correspondent Don Dahler.      The junior prom at Jonathan Law High School was postponed, but Maren Sanchez's friends put on their gowns and tuxes anyway. At a nearby beach, they released balloons, held up her prom dress, and crowned the slain 16-year-old as their prom queen.      "She was always happy, and it took a lot to get her down, and she was always there for you if you were her friend," said Evelyn Castro, Sanchez's friend.      Sanchez was found stabbed early Friday morning inside her school. She died of her injuries at a local hospital about half an hour later.      The teenage suspect, whom CBS News is not identifying, was taken into custody. According to his attorney, he is undergoing a medical evaluation.      Students were surprised the suspect was one of their own.      "He seemed like a nice guy. I didn't really get into any in-depth conversations with him, but just 'Hi,'" said student Brittany Welkes. "He didn't seem like anything to be worried about."      Friends say Sanchez was looking forward to going to her prom with her boyfriend, which is why she had turned the suspect down.      "Maren should be celebrating at her prom this evening with her friends and classmates. Instead we are mourning her death and we are trying, as a community, to understand this senseless loss of life," said Edward Kovak, the victim's cousin.      Sanchez was popular. She was an honor student, class president and active in sports and theater.      "She loved getting involved in stuff and being head of things, and she was good at it," Castro said.      Sanchez's name has been painted on a rock at the high school, which remains closed this morning. A memorial service is planned for tonight on the school's football field. Sanchez was supposed to take part in a school production of "Little Shop of Horrors" at the end of the week.      The show will go on in her honor.      As for the suspect, his lawyers expect he will eventually be charged as an adult. |||||	– Maren Sanchez was allegedly killed for refusing to go to prom with her attacker—but her friends ensured that the slain Connecticut 16-year-old was still a part of the dance. Though Friday's prom was postponed, her friends wore tuxes and dresses to the beach, where they brought Maren's dress and named her prom queen, CBS News reports. As for the 16-year-old suspect, who's set to be arraigned today: "He seemed like a nice guy. I didn't really get into any in-depth conversations with him, but just, 'Hi,'" a student says. The boy was a likeable athlete with a sense of humor and strong family ties to the community, others say. Another student tells the AP that the suspect and Sanchez were friends.

Colbert was back hosting "The Colbert Report," which last week mysteriously canceled the tapings of two episodes. Colbert's 91-year-old mother, Lorna Colbert, is ill. And while the comedian didn't address her by name, he offered a "confidential" message to "a lovely lady."      Said Colbert: "Evidently, having 11 children makes you tough as nails."      Colbert is the youngest of 11 children. His father, James Colbert, and two of his brothers were killed in an airplane crash in 1974.      He also comically addressed the rumors stoked by the brief absence of what he called "the hub around which the republic turns." |||||	– Stephen Colbert sent a shout-out, apparently to his mom, last night upon his return to the Colbert Report. "Evidently, having 11 children makes you tough as nails," he said. "Confidential to a lovely lady." The comment appeared to confirm his sudden hiatus was in fact related to his mother's health, the Huffington Post notes. But Colbert first had to address all the rumors surrounding his departure, noting that some thought his show had been canceled due to an impending presidential run and Joan Rivers suspected he was getting a nose job.

summarize: Field Museum art sold for $17 million      Anonymous bidder snags 34 paintings in dramatic auction      Included in the sale were 31 paintings of American Indians and bison by artist and adventurer George Catlin, representing the bulk of the Field's Catlin collection, which the museum has owned since shortly after it was founded in 1893.      NEW YORK — In an auction that involved daylong drama and suspense, Chicago's Field Museum sold a collection of 19th Century Western art for $17.4million Thursday to an anonymous bidder and pledged to use the money to expand its holdings of contemporary anthropological artifacts.      The decision this fall to auction the Catlins, which the artist is thought to have painted during his travels in the American frontier in the 1830s, generated controversy within the museum and on the Field's board of trustees, but museum officials said the sale was part of a strategy to focus its holdings on scientific materials and to expand its collections.      "Our museum is over 100 years old, and our collection is over 100 years old," Jonathan Haas, head of the Field's anthropology department, said after the auction at Sotheby's. "We currently have no acquisition budget. This gives us an acquisition budget."      Before the sale, Sotheby's estimated that the collection, which includes three paintings of Indians by other artists, would yield $9 million to $15 million before commission. After an intense round of bidding that lasted 10 minutes, Sotheby's Vice Chairman David Redden hammered the auction to a close with a final bid of $15.5 million.      Sotheby's commission brought the final price to $17.4 million.      Sotheby's spokeswoman Diana Phillips said the buyer wanted to remain anonymous. Haas, who was present for the sale, and museum officials in Chicago said they were in the dark about who bought the collection.      "We do not know, and we may never know," said museum spokeswoman Pat Kremer.      Sotheby's has the paintings and will ship them to the purchaser.      Without knowing the identity of the buyer, it is impossible to know the fate of the collection, which once belonged to Benjamin O'Fallon, a 19th Century Indian agent in St. Louis and nephew of explorer William Clark, co-leader of the Lewis and Clark expedition.      The paintings could go to a private collector, be sold off individually or end up back in a museum.      That uncertainty troubled Chicago business consultant Edward Hirschland, who resigned from the museum's board of trustees this year over the decision to sell the Catlin collection. Hirschland maintained that the paintings represented part of Chicago's "cultural patrimony" and that they have scientific value as a record of the appearances of Plains Indians in an age before photography.      "Shame on the Field for not ensuring that the collection went to a museum or a public institution," Hirschland said. "I feel terrible for Chicago."      Haas said the museum spent 15 months negotiating with public institutions in Chicago and elsewhere in an effort to sell the collection as a whole and make it available to the public.      "These are not a part of a treasured patrimony of Chicago," Haas said. "Most of them haven't been on display, and the ones that have been are not something that people come to the museum to see."      The museum is keeping four Catlin paintings, including a portrait of the Sauk and Fox Chief Black Hawk, who led an Indian rebellion in Illinois in 1832. ||||| Field has mulled selling artifacts      Money from 2004 auction of Western art was used to pay staff, records show      But within seven years, the museum had sold off the four remaining works by famed artist George Catlin and used some of the money to create a fund whose earnings would go toward certain staff salaries.      When the Field Museum sold more than 30 works of 19th-century Western art for millions of dollars in 2004, it eased controversy by announcing plans to spend the proceeds on new artifacts and by holding on to four of the best paintings from the collection.      This George Catlin portrait of the Sauk and Fox Chief Black Hawk was held back from a 2004 Field Museum auction that included 31 other Catlin works. But four years later the Field's board voted to sell it and three other Catlin paintings remaining in the Field collection. That sale was completed in 2011.      Since then, records show, some scientists and executives at the Field have considered selling other treasures.      In late 2010, on the recommendation of a financial consulting firm, the museum went through its collections to determine whether any items could be sold. And this year, a committee of scientists and executives tasked with evaluating the museum's financial situation suggested in a report to the president that the museum's rare book collection could fetch up to $50 million.      Such moves often are a signal that a museum is under financial stress, museum scholars say. Several said using collections sales to fund salaries skirts the edge of preferred museum practice.      The Field reported in December that it is planning significant budget cuts — including slashing millions from scientific research — after a decade of capital projects and expansions left the institution heavily burdened with debt.      Field spokeswoman Nancy O'Shea said in written responses to questions that the museum has acted in accordance with "all applicable ethical principles" concerning its collections and that the sale of the Catlins was not initiated for budgetary reasons. No sales of collection items are pending, she said.      "The museum has made careful decisions as to how to use its assets to best steward its collections overall," O'Shea said.      She said the Field's decision to put collections income toward salaries of staff who care for artifacts and specimens was the result of "careful contemplation" and that it is an appropriate use of collections funds.      "Care and conservation of collection items is an integral part of the maintenance of a natural history collection," O'Shea said in a statement. "And in fact, such care is essential to allow the museum to fulfill its obligations to the public with regard to those collections."      Selling items from collections is not uncommon at U.S. museums as a practical way to weed out less-critical works and free up resources for new purchases. But such sales often lead to controversy because preserving paintings and artifacts is so central to a museum's mission.      "The big idea, the public trust, (is that) you don't have these things to buy them and sell them to make money off them," said Julie Hart, senior director of museum standards and excellence at the American Alliance of Museums. |||||	– The Chicago Field Museum—perhaps best known as the home of Sue, the largest T. Rex skeleton ever discovered—is $5 million in debt, thanks to the recession and endowment-dinging stock market slumps. So when is it OK to start selling off dinosaur bones? NPR takes a look at the murky ethical territory many struggling cultural institutions face using the Field Museum as example. In 2004, the museum auctioned off more than 30 George Catlin paintings, earning it $15.5 million, the Chicago Tribune reported at the time. Such a move is generally considered kosher in the museum world so long as the proceeds are used to acquire new pieces or care for existing ones, which is what the Field Museum has done. But the Tribune last month reported that the museum's decision to use some of the money to pay salaries of some staff who tend to the collections—and to sell its final four Catlin paintings—has rankled some. Part of the problem: People bequeath items and collections to museums expecting them to stay there forever. If word gets out it's selling off works, donors might be dissuaded from handing over their triceratops skeletons. "It makes donors in the future fear for the security of the things they leave to the organization," says the co-founder of the University of Chicago's Cultural Policy Center.
