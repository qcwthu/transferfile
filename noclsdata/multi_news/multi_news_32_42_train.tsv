summarize: A Ware Police patrol car passes the yellow house on Pulaski Street Friday, July 28, 2017, in Ware, Mass., which will be home for Paul Shanley, a priest in the Boston Roman Catholic priest sex abuse scandal... (Associated Press)      BOSTON (AP) — A defrocked priest at the center of Boston's Roman Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal was released from prison on Friday and settled into an apartment across the street from a children's dance studio.      Paul Shanley, who had been convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Boston, after being released from the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater, where he completed a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware, followed by a group of reporters and photographers.      His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install "state-of-the-art" security systems and to make sure every child leaves the studio accompanied by an adult.      "It's awful that he's even on the streets of Ware," Lask told The Boston Globe. "Whether it's across the street or down the road, there are children everywhere."      As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16.      Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender and posters will be displayed around town notifying the public that Shanley is living in the area, which is typical procedure for the police department.      "We're going to do what we need to do to make sure the citizens are protected and his rights are also protected," Crevier said.      Shanley will be at least the third sex offender living on his street, he said.      Prosecutors sought to hold Shanley beyond his criminal sentence under a law that allows civil commitment of people deemed sexually dangerous. But two psychologists hired by the state found he did not meet the legal criteria to hold him.      A lawyer who represented Shanley in his criminal appeal said he's confident Shanley will not harm anyone. But attorney Robert Shaw Jr. said he understands the reaction from those who opposed Shanley's release from prison.      "I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to fulfill their obligation and be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe," Shaw said.      The state's sex offender registry designates Shanley as a Level 3 offender, considered the most likely to reoffend. But the two psychologists cited Shanley's advanced age and his health issues and concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low.      Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented dozens of men who say they were abused by Shanley, said the evaluations were incomplete because the psychologists didn't interview Shanley. Instead, they reviewed police reports, prosecutors' files and Shanley's church personnel file containing numerous sexual abuse complaints against him.      "Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children," Garabedian said.      Both psychologists found Shanley meets the psychiatric criteria for pedophilic disorder. But they said research suggests recidivism rates for people of his age are extremely low. They also cited Shanley's health issues, which were blacked out from the reports, and the fact his last reported offense was in 1990.      Shanley was a street priest who ministered to alienated youths in the 1960s and '70s. Dozens of men came forward decades later and said Shanley had molested or raped them. He was defrocked by the Vatican in 2004 and was convicted of raping a boy at a Newton parish in 2005.      The archdiocese said this week it will not provide Shanley with financial support or benefits. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said he will review the standards for civilly committing convicted sex offenders who have served their prison sentences.      Reporting by the Globe's Spotlight team helped break open the priest sex abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of Boston in 2002. The reporting uncovered how dozens of priests in the archdiocese had molested and raped children for decades while church higher-ups covered it up and shuffled abusive priests from parish to parish.      A movie about the Globe's reporting, called "Spotlight," won the 2016 Academy Award for best picture.      ___      Associated Press writers Collin Binkley and Bob Salsberg contributed to this report. ||||| WARE — Residents in this tiny town were reeling after defrocked pedophile priest Paul Shanley moved into a quiet residential street across from a dance studio and right next door to three other Level 3 sex offenders.      Shanley, 86, walked out of Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater early yesterday after completing a 12-year sentence for the 1980s rape of a boy in a Newton church. He surfaced hours later in this small western Massachusetts community adjacent to the Quabbin Reservoir. |||||	– A defrocked priest at the heart of Boston's Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal was released from prison Friday and settled into an apartment across the street from a children's dance studio.

summarize: Significance      A large body of medical research suggests that women are less likely than men to survive traumatic health episodes like acute myocardial infarctions. In this work, we posit that these difficulties may be partially explained, or exacerbated, by the gender match between the patient and the physician. Findings suggest that gender concordance increases a patient’s probability of survival and that the effect is driven by increased mortality when male physicians treat female patients. Empirical extensions indicate that mortality rates decrease when male physicians practice with more female colleagues or have treated more female patients in the past. ||||| Female heart attack patients treated by male doctors have a worse chance of survival than those treated by female doctors, a study suggests.      Previous studies based on data from Australia and Sweden have revealed that men and women experience different care if they have a heart attack, while UK research has shown women are more likely to be misdiagnosed.      Now researchers say the gender of the doctor might affect female patients’ chances of survival.      “We find that gender concordance increases a patient’s probability of surviving a [heart attack] and that the effect is driven by increased mortality when male physicians treat female patients,” said Dr Brad Greenwood, associate professor of information and decision sciences at the University of Minnesota.            Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Greenwood and colleagues describe how they looked at records from Florida of emergency department admissions for heart attacks between 1991 and 2010.      As well as looking at the patients’ age, gender, and whether they had other health problems, the team also looked at whether the patient died during their stay in hospital and whether the emergency room doctor primarily looking after them was a man or a woman.            The results from more than 580,000 patients reveals that overall, 11.9% of heart attack patients died while in hospital.      Women 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed after heart attack – study Read more      However, the team found that when patients shared the same gender as their doctor, they were more likely to survive, with the probability of death falling by just over 0.6 percentage points once factors including the patients’ age, other health problems, the physician, and hospital-specific differences were taken into account.      Further analysis showed that men and women had similar chances of survival when they saw female doctors. But male doctors were linked to worse outcomes, particularly for women.      Female patients treated by male doctors were about 1.5 percentage points less likely to survive a heart attack than male patients in the care of female doctors.      The team also found women were more likely to survive if the emergency department had a higher proportion of female doctors who had treated heart attacks – a trend particularly strong if the woman was being treated by a male doctor. That, said Greenwood, could be because female doctors might share their experience in tackling heart attacks in women. In addition, the more female patients a male doctor had previously treated for heart attacks, the better the chances of survival a woman had.      Women get worse care after a heart attack than men – must they shout louder? | Ann Robinson Read more      “These results suggest a reason why gender inequality in heart attack mortality persists: most physicians are male, and male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,” the authors write. They suggest more female doctors are needed within emergency departments, and say training of doctors needs to be improved to make sure heart disease is not seen only as a male issue.            Greenwood speculated that there could be several reasons for the trend. “One could be that female patients are more comfortable advocating for themselves with a female physician,” he said. “[Or] it could be because women are more likely to present atypically and female physicians are better at picking up cues than their male colleagues.”      Chris Gale, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the latest research but has worked on previous studies in the field, welcomed the new research but cautioned that the study was based on US data, meaning it is not clear if the same trend is present in other healthcare systems including the NHS. What’s more, Gale noted that as in the UK, US patients are generally seen by a number of healthcare professionals if they seek medical help, meaning that looking at the gender of just one doctor is a limitation.      Women with heart disease are dismissed, and it's killing them | Nikki Stamp Read more      Gale added that the longstanding idea that a heart attack patient is generally a middle-aged man with risk factors such as smoking, being overweight and having diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol could be putting women at a disadvantage.      “What we do know is that women present with heart attack as well, and you don’t necessarily need to have those risk factors – although it is much more likely if you have a risk factor,” said Gale. “We also know that women with heart attack do have symptoms just like men do, but they can also present atypically as well.”       ||||| (Reuters Health) - Women who show up in the emergency room with a heart attack are less likely to die if they are treated by a female physician rather than a male, a new study finds.      Researchers scrutinizing data from nearly 582,000 heart attack patients found that women treated by male doctors were 1.52 percent less likely to survive than men treated by female doctors, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.      That means if 1,000 women went to the emergency room with a heart attack, 15 more would die if they were treated by a male doctor, study leaded Brad Greenwood of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities told Reuters Health.      Intriguingly, women treated by a male doctor were more likely to survive if there were many female physicians in the ER.      “The key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,” Greenwood said. “The challenge of (future) research is to figure out how and why this occurs. It’s a tricky question and there’s a lot of speculation that comes into it.”      Male doctors do seem to learn from their mistakes. “We do see improvement as they spend time in practice,” Greenwood said. “But these later benefits come at the expense of earlier patients.”      Greenwood allows that the researchers’ calculation may be an underestimate since it only includes patients who were eventually admitted to the hospital. Women who were misdiagnosed and sent home wouldn’t have been counted in the analysis.      Why would women treated by male physicians be dying at a higher rate than those treated by female doctors even though they were admitted to the hospital?      Greenwood suspects the excess deaths are due to delays in treatment because the male doctors took longer to diagnose the heart attack.      Greenwood and his colleagues reviewed anonymous medical data on 338,642 men and 243,203 women who were seen in emergency rooms in Florida hospitals between 1991 to 2010. Most - 520,078 - were treated by male doctors, while 61,719 were treated by female physicians.      The Florida database included information such as patients’ age, race, gender and medical history, along with hospital quality. Even after accounting for these factors, women were still less likely to survive when treated by a male ER doctor.      While noting that this kind of data is “fraught with potential errors and many unmeasured variables, there’s a growing drumbeat of data suggesting that women physicians have better outcomes,” said Dr. Karol Watson, director of the Women’s Cardiovascular Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.      There are some possible explanations for the new findings, said Watson.      “Everybody knows, but nobody has proven, that women are better listeners,” Watson told Reuters Health. “And women physicians spend more time with their patients. I can’t tell you how many times the critical piece of information comes as the patient is walking toward the door.”      The new study highlights the importance of having “a strong female physician workforce,” said Dr. Jennifer Haythe, co-director of Columbia Women’s Heart Center at the Columbia University Medical Center.      “As a doctor who is very aware of gender bias particularly as it relates to cardiac disease, one can’t help but wonder if improved outcomes stem from the fact that female physicians take women’s symptoms more seriously, thereby expediting the workup and cardiac care of these women and improving mortality,” Haythe told Reuters Health.      Acknowledging that we can’t choose the physician who treats us in the ER, Haythe has some advice for women: “They should certainly feel comfortable asking for their symptoms to be taken seriously. If they are concerned that they may be having a heart attack they should ask the treating physician - man or woman - if they have had an appropriate evaluation to determine this, and if not, why not.”      SOURCE: bit.ly/2M8ElFS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, online August 6, 2018. |||||	– Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? "Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do," says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, "the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients," he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. (Breastfeeding may help the heart.)
summarize: A Syrian warplane has destroyed a petrol station near Damascus, killing and wounding dozens of people and igniting a huge fire in what could be one of the bloodiest attacks in weeks during the 22-month civil war.      Activists on Wednesday said a single Russian-built MiG fighter fired a missile that hit the station, setting off an inferno in the eastern suburb of Mleiha. Black smoke was seen billowing from the site.      An amateur video posted online showed charred bodies and gruesome carnage at the scene.      Mohammed Saeed, an activist who visited the area, said the missile struck as drivers waited in line with their cars at the station.      Syria has been facing a fuel crisis, and people often wait for hours to get petrol.      “Many of the people who were there were killed,'' Saeed said via Skype. "Body parts could be seen on the ground".      He said the missile fired by the plane caused a crater a metre deep.      An amateur video showed several vehicles on fire and a cloud of smoke rising into the air.      It was unclear why the Syrian military targeted the petrol station. There have been clashes and shelling in nearby areas in the past days.      Saeed said there were two other air raids in the nearby suburbs of Maadamiyeh and Deir al-Asafir.      "Since yesterday the raids have been very intense,'' he said.      Airbase attacked      Meanwhile, in the country's northwest, fierce fighting has resumed between President Bashar al-Assad's forces and opposition fighters after rebels attacked regime troops stationed around an airbase in Idlib province, a human rights watchdog says.      Wednesday’s clashes between rebel fighters and Assad's forces at the Afis military airport near the main Aleppo-Damascus highway killed four armed men and an unknown number of soldiers, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.      The UK-based monitoring group said Syrian rebels fired machine guns and mortars at helicopters grounded at the base.      The rebel assault came after authorities announced the temporary closure of the international airport in Aleppo province on Tuesday, after days of attacks there by the rebels who hold large swathes of territory in northern Syria.      A local resident told the AFP news agency that the army was carrying out air raids around the Taftanaz base in an attempt to repel the multi-pronged attack.      Fighting also broke out around the crucial Wadi Deif base, one of the last regime bastions in the northwest, the Britain-based observatory said, in a fresh bid to wrest control of the strategic post.      Rebels captured the nearby town of Maaret al-Numan, located on the important Damascus-Aleppo highway, in October.            Air raid      Regime warplanes also bombed the town of Moadamiyet al-Sham, southwest of the capital, killing at least 12 members of the same family, most of them children, the watchdog said.      Warplanes also attacked the towns of Shebaa to the southeast and Deir Assafir south of Damascus, where 11 children were killed in November when cluster bombs were dropped on a playground, according to Human Rights Watch.      The deadly strikes came as forces loyal to Assad battled rebels with artillery fire in Harasta and Douma, rebel strongholds to the northeast of the capital, and in Daraya to the southwest.      Army reinforcements have been massing for weeks in Daraya in a bid to drive rebel Free Syrian Army fighters from the town, the site of the bloodiest massacre of the conflict in which hundreds died in August.      Northeast of Damascus, the army shelled Qaboon district, the observatory said, while in the south, residents of a Palestinian refugee camp that faced deadly air raids in December, fled once again amid mortar attacks.      The UN on Wednesday said more than 60,000 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising against Assad's regime erupted in March 2011. ||||| The Virtual Memorial      Launched on November 10, 1998, The Virtual Memorial is a commemorative website created to extend the legacy of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer. And the violence continued today with what may have been one of the worst attacks so far, al-Jazeera reports: Dozens were killed when a Syrian warplane fired a missile at a gas station near Damascus where people were waiting in line to fill up their cars.
summarize: A political cartoon, published in a newspaper at some point in the early 1990s, has long been burned into my memory. In it, newly elected President Clinton is being shown around the White House by a man in a butler’s uniform. Clinton arrives at a wall on which sit an abundance of political levers and buttons and, thrilled, his eyes widen. Yet he is quickly disappointed. “Sorry, sir,” the orderly’s speech bubble reads, “but these are all connected to Congress.”      The brinkmanship, gridlock, and rancor that the fight over the continuing resolution has yielded is disliked, at least in some manner, by almost everyone involved. But opinions as to what might be done about it vary wildly. On Friday, Wonkblog’s Dylan Matthews provided a suggestion: Americans, he wrote, “oughta start thinking seriously about how to prevent divided government from ever happening again.”      This is not partisan posturing. On the contrary, Matthews earnestly and consistently believes that America’s system is intrinsically unviable, and that it is to blame for our current predicament. And he is tapping into a sentiment that is reasonably popular among his peers. The last time that the United States teetered toward a shutdown or a default, Slate’s Matthew Yglesias wrote at length about what he regards as the “long-simmering problems with the basic structure of American political institutions.” Were Yglesias to draw the next panel of the old cartoon, he would presumably have Clinton do some rewiring.      This line is not a new one. Hostility toward America’s rigid separation of powers has a rich, if unappealing, history on the Left. Woodrow Wilson — a man whose animus to the constitutional order that he had sworn to uphold approached almost treasonable levels — was savvy enough to recognize that the expansive long-term ambitions of the Progressive movement were simply incompatible with the country’s founding documents. In consequence, Wilson proposed, Americans should change their expectations of government, invest their democratic ambitions in one man (the president), and abandon the country’s messy political settlement in favor of a streamlined and “efficient” state that was more akin to that in the Kaiser’s Germany or in the King’s Britain. “The Constitution,” Wilson wrote, “was not made to fit us like a straitjacket. In its elasticity lies its chief greatness.”      While his insistence that the Constitution was not supposed to be a “straitjacket” is incorrect, Wilson and his descendants are correct in their basic complaint: Separation of powers is inefficient; it is an obstacle to substantial change; and it will not only “allow” gridlock but it is explicitly designed to encourage it. Where they are wrong is to conclude that this should change with the times. The Constitution is the product of abiding insight into politics — an insight that does not change with the wind. Rather amazingly, Yglesias claims the opposite to be the case: The problem of gridlock, he wrote in 2011, stems directly from the Founders’ having had “little in the way of experience to guide them in thinking about how political institutions would evolve.”      This is not simply untrue, it is the perfect opposite of the truth. Having watched the radical transformation of the British system during the 17th and 18th centuries — and studied undulations of the classical world, for good measure — most of the Founders were strikingly well versed in political theory. The introduction of limiting tools such as the rule of law, term restrictions, a codified constitution, a bill of rights, and divided government were intended to dispense with the presumption, famously termed “elective dictatorship” by Lord Hailsham, that the man who is voted in as leader every four or so years should have carte blanche to get things done. In other words, the Founders sought to block precisely what Yglesias and his cohorts covet. Nobody is perfect, of course, but I would wager everything I own that the architects of America were more au courant with the vagaries of human nature and the concentrating tendency of political actors than are the writers at Slate.      In some respects, Wilson has got his wish. Witness, for example, the peculiar manner in which many citizens, journalists, and legislators have presumed that Obama’s wishes for the congressionally designed budget should be the national starting point. Why? Because he won election to head up the executive branch, obviously! It seems that our debate has been upside-down from the start: Constitutionally speaking, if any elections should suggest the direction of the budget and of the laws, they are the 435 that determine the composition of the House. Alas, this no longer appears to be the case.      The truth that dare not speak its name is that the pronounced disharmony on show in the United States has a clear root cause — and it is not the structure of government. Democrats who complain that the House is being particularly obstinate are absolutely correct — it is. But rarely do they stop and ask “Why?” It seems obvious to me that at the root of our interminable trench warfare is the fact that one party made the regrettable decision to push through the most controversial piece of social legislation in a century without a single opposition vote. That party was, of course, entirely within its rights to do this when unified government presented them with the chance. Nevertheless, it is childish for it to complain that, the other side having been given a clear mandate to try to undo the measure, it is now doing just that. Elections do indeed “have consequences” — and that means all of them.      Critics of the United States correctly, if oddly, point out that the system of separated powers works only here. “We are the only country in the world in which . . .” is a typically witless refrain. In South America, where presidential democracies have been tried, gridlock has customarily led to the president “speaking for the people” by ordering a military coup and removing from the equation the legislators who demonstrated the temerity to serve as a check and a balance.      As a result of its mature political heritage and its British roots, the United States was spared this trend, blossoming quickly into a country in which the conflict that usually results from divided government is virtuously accepted by the people as the price of liberty. In America, Yale’s Juan Linz argues, strife that has led to violence in less-developed nations has become regarded as “normal.” Make no mistake: Dylan Matthews and his myopic ilk would unashamedly like to change this, rendering illegitimate the positions of the minority and subjugating the exquisite fractiousness of Congress to the imperium of a national leader. This is, of course, a prerogative they enjoy as free men. But there is nothing “progressive” about it at all.      — Charles C. W.

Almost all of these analyses use the shutdowns of 1995-1996 as their starting point. While I don't think this development will be great for Republicans, many of the concerns are likely overwrought. Here are four points to ponder:      1. While the GOP’s tactics are similar to those employed in the mid-’90s, the goals are different. The earlier budget debates were broad in nature and dealt with the scope of government. The 104th Congress, led by Newt Gingrich, believed that they were the culmination of the realignment supposedly begun by Ronald Reagan, that Bill Clinton’s election was a fluke caused by Ross Perot’s candidacy, and that they had been elected with a mandate to shrink the size and scope of government dramatically.      They entered the shutdown believing that the public would rally to their side, that Clinton’s job approval would fall in the wake of the shutdown, and that he would ultimately cave on their demands. Despite the lore that has since sprung up, this wasn’t a completely harebrained view of the underlying politics: An earlier shutdown, in 1990, did play an important role in persuading George H.W. Bush to abandon his famous “no new taxes” pledge a few weeks later.      Of course, that isn’t how it played out at all in 1995 and 1996; Bill Clinton was widely viewed as having held the line against the Republican onslaught, although he actually did give substantial ground on taxes and a number of other issues. The budget fight became the focal point of Democrats’ attempt to take back the House and Senate in the 1996 elections.      But the Democrats didn’t actually use the shutdown itself as their main line of attack on Republicans. It was part of it, but the real attacks came over the Republicans’ motivation for the shutdown. Because of the expansive nature of the GOP’s cuts, the Democrats were able to focus on several unpopular portions of the GOP budget: the so-called M2E2 strategy. They commenced a mantra-like repetition of their opposition to Republican attempts to gut “Medicare, Medicaid, Education and the Environment” in favor of a “risky tax scheme” that benefited the rich.      In other words, in evaluating 1996 as an illustration of what will happen to the GOP today, we probably have to separate the tactic of a shutdown from the substance of what motivates it. And today, the GOP is focused on defunding Obamacare, a law that isn’t particularly popular. For the analogy to 1995-96 to really stick, the GOP will probably have had to try something along the lines of shutting down government to implement the Paul Ryan balance-budget plan.      While public opinion might be against the shutdown tactic, there probably won’t be the same level of outrage against the underlying policy motivation, which is what 1995-96 was mostly about. If Obamacare turns out to be the train wreck some conservatives predict (I have no clue whether it will or won’t), the tactic itself might be viewed as less of a negative.      2. John Boehner is not Newt Gingrich, and Barack Obama is not Bill Clinton. This is a fairly minor point, but Gingrich’s public persona did play a part in bringing the shutdown to an unhappy end for the GOP. He was polarizing from the start, and the media didn’t bend over backwards to help him out. Case in point: The Daily News cover depicting him as a crybaby who shut down the government because he had to sit in the back of Air Force One. Boehner, on the other hand, has kept a much lower profile, and while he isn’t all that popular, he isn’t a lightening rod either (although Ted Cruz seems to be inching toward filling Gingrich’s shoes in that regard).      At the same time, Obama is not really Clinton. The current president’s ability to present himself as a cautious centrist in political face-offs with Republicans to date have been mixed at best; his strength has always been energizing the liberal base for elections rather than tacking to the center. Clinton might be the most successful president of my lifetime when it comes to publicly framing a debate in a way favorable to his side (see, for example, the M2E2 strategy above). There are actually few examples, if any, of Obama rallying the public to his side in the various battles he’s fought; there are plenty of failures, with the fight over sequestration being the most recent case in point.      3. The net effect of the shutdown was small in the 1990s. For all the talk of the sustained damage the Republicans suffered, the actual evidence for this is pretty weak. In 1994, Republicans won 230 seats in Congress. Five party switches and a special election victory later, they entered the 1996 elections with 236 seats.      They emerged from those elections with 228 seats, for a loss of eight total (including the open seat of one of the Democratic Party switchers). So while Republicans lost seats, it ended up being something of an empty victory for Democrats: Americans elected a Republican Congress back-to-back for the first time since the 1920s. Republican candidates won the popular vote for the House, albeit very narrowly (Democrats won the vote only if you split up votes cast for candidates running on multiple party lines, e.g., a Republican also running on the Conservative Party line in New York). Republicans even gained a seat in a special election held in a Democratic-leaning district in between government shutdowns, and only narrowly lost a Senate seat in Democratic-leaning Oregon immediately after the shutdown (Republicans proceeded to win another open Senate seat in the same state by four points in November).      Those Republican House losses weren’t terribly surprising. Republicans were overexposed as a result of the 1994 “wave election” that swept a number of weak members into swing-to-Democratic-leaning districts. Losing representatives like Andrea Seastrand, Michael Flanagan and Fred Heineman was more a part of regression-to-the-mean than any wholesale rejection of Republicans.      Of the 21 House seats that Democrats claimed from Republicans in 1996 (it was actually 22, but I don’t have presidential data for Louisiana’s 7th District), Clinton had carried 18 in 1992. The other four seats were all something of special cases: Bob Dornan in California, Gary Franks in Connecticut, David Funderburk in North Carolina, and Toby Roth’s open House seat in Wisconsin.      This presents a problem for Democrats hoping to capitalize on the 2013 shutdown: The seats are much better sorted these days. Going into the 1996 elections, 79 Republicans occupied seats that had voted for Clinton in 1992. In other words, they lost 23 percent of their caucus from “Clinton seats.” Today, only 17 Republicans come from “Obama seats” to begin with. If Republicans suffered losses in unfriendly territory at the same rate as they did in 1996, they’d lose only four seats, before we start looking at the effect on Democrats from “Romney seats.”      Perhaps Republicans would have fared better had they not attempted to shut down the government in the first place. Republicans picked up 10 open House seats and defeated three Democratic incumbents in 1996; absent the shutdown, perhaps they might have gained seats. In the Senate, Republicans narrowly lost open Democratic seats in Louisiana and Georgia, while missing good opportunities to defeat Tom Harkin in Iowa and Max Baucus in Montana.      But as Harry Enten has ably demonstrated, Republicans did about as well in the House and in presidential elections as we would have expected given the performance of the economy, especially when you consider that exit polls showed Ross Perot pulling votes disproportionately from Republicans (unlike 1992, when he pulled evenly from both parties). Clinton’s comeback was likely due more to the flurry of good economic news in the run-up to the election than to anything else. Indeed, while Clinton’s job approval improved over the course of the shutdown, it had also improved in the months leading up to the shutdown at a similar rate.      Senate losses in Louisiana and Georgia look bad today, but in 1996 both states were more Democratic; Clinton had carried both states in 1992 and only narrowly lost Georgia in 1996 while winning Louisiana by 12 points. Republicans had only won two narrow Senate elections in Georgia before 1996 (and hadn’t won the governorship since Reconstruction), while Republicans had never won a Senate election in Louisiana and were burdened by a controversial candidate in Woody Jenkins. Republicans were unable to defeat Harkin, Baucus or Mary Landrieu in the good GOP year of 2002.      4. What happens to red state Senate Democrats?      Of course, the real action for 2014 is not the House, where the GOP will continue to control the agenda except in the unlikely event that it loses 17 seats. The real fight is for control of the Senate, which in turn revolves around races in eight states: West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, South Dakota, Louisiana, Alaska, Montana and North Carolina. Obama lost those states by, respectively, 27, 24, 23, 18, 17, 14, 14 and two points, respectively.      The politics of a shutdown in these states are very different than in the nation as a whole. We can try to estimate the popularity of a shutdown by taking as a national baseline CNN’s recent finding that 46 percent of voters would blame Republicans for a shutdown vs. the 36 percent that would blame Obama. If we adjust these numbers according to the results of the presidential election in 2012, we would estimate that the president would shoulder the blame for a shutdown in each of those states save for North Carolina, and that outright majorities would blame the president in West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky.      The last thing Democratic candidates in these states want is a public spat over a piece of legislation that is highly controversial, that might have a problematic rollout in the coming weeks and months, and that places them on the side of an unpopular president. If there’s an upside for the GOP, this is probably it. Even after the 1995-96 shutdowns, the GOP managed to gain Senate seats, largely by making gains in reddish states.      Of course, none of this should be read as advocating the shutdown, or predicting that it could not possibly have any negative consequences for the GOP. For starters, a government shutdown is essentially lighting a fuse without knowing exactly where it will go. This is something that could easily get out of control if the shutdown stretches out for weeks and bleeds into the debt ceiling battle, which could be potentially catastrophic for the county.      Moreover, it could give Democrats an issue to rally around. Unlike 1996, the economy is weak; the president’s job approval has suffered in recent months as a result of his perceived failure to move the Democratic agenda forward, and the aborted intervention in Syria. Many of these losses have come as a result of Democrats becoming dissatisfied with the president. If the election were held with the president’s job approval at its present level, Democrats would probably lose another 10 House seats or so, giving Republicans their largest House majority since 1946 (and possibly 1928). A dustup with congressional Republicans would probably help bring these Democrats back into the fold, especially if the president emerges victorious from the fight, helping to limit Democratic losses.      Finally, we should also remember that the current weak recovery has been ongoing now for 52 months. It’s already longer than six of the 11 recoveries in the post-War era. By this time next year, it will be longer than seven of them. By 2016, only the booms of the mid-’60s, mid-’80s, and mid-’90s will have lasted longer. And, well, this recovery doesn’t much resemble those recoveries so far.      In other words, there’s a decent chance that we’ll encounter a downturn in the economy in the next year, and a very good chance that we’ll encounter one in the next three years. Obama is probably reaching the end of the time period where his predecessor can be blamed for the state of the economy. But a lengthy shutdown could conceivably give Democrats ammunition to place the blame back on Republicans.      The bottom line is this: The shutdown will probably not be a good thing for the GOP, and there’s a good chance Republicans won’t achieve their intended goal of limiting Obamacare’s reach. But at the same time, a lot of the prophecies of doom for Republicans are heavily overwrought. Unless things get too far out of control, the predictions of heavy GOP losses from a shutdown are likely overstated. ||||| They say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Why is it that the Republicans in Congress seem so determined to prove this maxim?      Let’s start with the Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare. The exchanges that are at the heart of Obamacare — making it possible for people who are currently uninsured to buy health care — open for business on Tuesday. Ever since the Republicans took control of the House, they have held vote after vote to roll back the law, even while ignoring important business like, say, fixing the Postal Service. I think it’s been 43 times in all — votes that have been utterly pointless, in that the Senate is still run by Democrats, and the law is President Obama ’s signature achievement, and there’s no way on God’s green earth it will be repealed.      But never mind. As Oct. 1 has neared — the date both Obamacare kicks in and the government needs to be funded — Republicans moved to another tactic, which was every bit as hopeless. They began demanding that Obamacare be reversed — or at least delayed — as part of any deal to keep the government running. (At one point they had a lengthy wish list that was so implausible it was almost laugh-out-loud funny.)      But to the surprise of absolutely no one, when Republicans added the anti-Obamacare language to the “ continuing resolution ” designed to finance the government (for all of six weeks!), the Senate quickly rejected the House bill and insisted instead on a continuing resolution that did nothing but what it was supposed to do: fund the government. Republicans, meanwhile, would not back away from their demand that the “C.R.” had to be linked to a delay in Obamacare.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “I see almost no hope of avoiding a government shutdown,” Representative Jim Cooper , a conservative Democrat from Nashville , told me Monday afternoon. It’s possible, of course, that House Republicans will pass a continuing resolution in the wee small hours, after this column has gone to bed. But it’s very unlikely.      Photo      And that’s the second way in which Republican strategy seems to have run off the rails. This constant brinkmanship, which Republicans bring on with their unrealistic demands and deadlines, consistently redounds against them. It makes you wonder what they are trying to accomplish. ||||| If you can judge people by the quality of their enemies, one quality shared by many opponents of the tea party is their conservatism. Like many ideological factions, tea-party activists display a special intensity in fighting the “near enemy” — other elements on the right that don’t share their tactics. President Obama may be their ultimate foe, but conservative pragmatists are their rivals. And rivals are the more immediate problem.      So the Senate Conservatives Fund runs ads against Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and other solid Senate conservatives for opposing a counterproductive strategy to defund Obamacare. The circle of tea-party purity is drawn so tightly that it excludes Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.) — some of the most reliably conservative members of Congress.      Ideological conflict between Republican factions is, of course, nothing new. The modern conservative movement arose in opposition to Eisenhower Republicanism, which it regarded as ideologically compromised. Ronald Reagan challenged and defeated Rockefeller Republicanism — and seldom has a political defeat been more complete. But Reagan still viewed the Republican Party as a coalition, not as a faction. He campaigned vigorously for Republican moderates such as Sens. Chuck Percy, Robert Packwood and Mark Hatfield (who was the congressional chair for his first inauguration).      During the Obama era, Republican ideological conflicts have intensified. The latest round began with a typical, largely healthy revolt against leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who were viewed as tired and uncreative (though easier to criticize than replace). The young guns — including Reps. Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor — would finally take on Medicare reform and push big questions about the role of government in American life. This involved political risk but had the virtue of intellectual seriousness.      Tea-party populism, however, moved quickly beyond this point. We are no longer seeing a revolt against the Republican leadership, or even against the Republican “establishment”; this revolt is against anyone who accepts the constraints of political reality. Conservatives are excommunicated not for holding the wrong convictions but for rational calculations in service of those convictions.      1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Right’s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site’s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

The biggest right-wing radio show host in America has spoken to a generation of conservatives. Micah Walter/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      What explains this development? Some of this is a reaction to the unique provocation of Obamacare. Tea-party activists assert that the launch of health­insurance subsidies and exchanges will cause immediate and pervasive entitlement addiction — creating a permanent new class of Democratic-voting clients of the state. It seems more likely that Americans will see the flaws of a hastily and poorly designed system and express their displeasure in midterm elections. But the notion that the character of the country is about to suddenly change helps explain the state of emergency in tea-party circles.      This is reinforced by the development of an alternative establishment — including talk-radio personalities, a few vocal congressional leaders and organizations such as FreedomWorks and Heritage Action — that creates a self-reinforcing impression of its power to reshape politics (while lacking much real connection to the views of the broader electorate).      And these ideas do have some resonance among conservative activists who are convinced that Republicans lost recent presidential elections because their candidates lacked combativeness. At least, the argument goes, Ted Cruz has some backbone. It is the political expression of pent-up anger. “If we’re going to fight,” says Michele Bachmann, “we need to fight now.” Few believe any longer that Republicans will be able to defund Obamacare in this session of Congress; it is the fight that counts. This is a word that crops up frequently in tea-party discourse. Not winning. Not strategy. Not consequences. The fight.      Under normal circumstances, this faction — composing less than 20 percent of the House Republican caucus — might exercise a marginal influence. But we have the peculiar situation of a divided Congress and a weak president. The tea-party faction holds the margin of victory in a slim Republican House majority. Boehner has kept some semblance of order by appeasing it — an approach of diminishing utility. And now, in a series of budget showdowns, the interests of tea-party activists have suddenly aligned with those of Obama (who needs a dramatic reshuffling of the political deck). Both sides prefer a powerless, discredited Republican leadership.      The problem for Republicans (as Democrats found in the 1970s and ’80s) is that factions are seldom deterred by defeat. Every loss is taken as proof of insufficient purity. Conservatives now face the ideological temptation: inviting an unpleasant political reality by refusing to inhabit political reality.

A former speaker of the House, he was a candidate in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries.      (CNN) -- The worst possible outcome for the country from the impasse over the continuing resolution that would prevent a government shutdown would be for House Republicans to cave.      This is a pivotal conflict that will define the relationship between Congress and the executive branch for the next three years. The country will be much better off if Congress does not abdicate its constitutional role and if the president cannot ignore that role.      When President Barack Obama is willing to negotiate with Russian, Syrian and Iranian leaders but unwilling to negotiate with the U.S. House of Representatives, it is time for the House to stand firm.      When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says, according to unnamed sources quoted in Politico, that he will refuse to attend a negotiation at the White House because House Republicans have to cave and surrender to his terms, it is time to stand firm.      When a senior, unnamed Democratic official is quoted Monday morning calling for no negotiations and saying "it's time to punch the bully in the nose," it is time to stand firm.      Begala: Bet on Obama in shutdown showdown      When Obama spends a week making three partisan speeches attacking Republicans and then calls House Speaker John Boehner to tell him, "I will not negotiate," it is time to stand firm.      It is a sad commentary on Obama's attitude toward the elected majority of the House of Representatives that he could have a more pleasant conversation with the head of the Iranian dictatorship than with the elected leader of the U.S. House.      The left has sold itself on a false history of the 2012 election. According to the left, Obama won the election and therefore we should do whatever he wants.      This ignores that there was also an election for the "People's House" in 435 congressional districts, and the Republicans won. It also ignores the 63 million Americans who voted against his re-election and his agenda. Winning 52% does not mean he gets 100% of what he wants.      Zelizer: Government shutdown threat is getting very old, very fast      The president has decided to seek to bully and bluff his way to get what he wants. House Republicans must not abdicate their responsibilities now.      Any surrender on the continuing resolution would confirm the contempt with which Obama and Reid already hold Boehner and his Republican colleagues. This fight is about something much bigger than the Republican Party and the future of Obamacare.      It is about whether the president dictates to America's elected representatives or negotiates with them when they disagree. It will be very bad for America if a president whose hubris is astounding is reinforced in the belief that he can bully his way into getting everything he wants by making demagogic attack speeches.      The next few weeks might be painful if House Republicans insist on getting to a compromise and refuse to surrender. But the next three years will be frightening if House Republicans cave and the president learns that nothing stands between him and his ability to use overweening power outside the Constitution to advance his ideology.

And yes, "separation of powers is inefficient," admits Charles CW Cooke at the National Review; "it will not only 'allow' gridlock, but it is explicitly designed to encourage it." And that's not a mistake. "The Constitution is the product of an abiding insight into politics—an insight that does not change with the wind." This is how the system is supposed to work. Not everyone agrees: Republicans have driven the government past the point of rationality, complains Joe Nocera at the New York Times. "A government that functioned would fight over the budget, but would ultimately pass a budget. This government can barely hobble from one CR to the next." Michael Gerson at the Washington Post notes that the Tea Party's most vociferous opponents are now fellow Republicans, and it's gone beyond traditional GOP ideological disputes. "We are no longer seeing a revolt against Republican leadership," he observes. "This revolt is against anyone who accepts the constraints of political reality." The man who orchestrated the last shutdown, on the other hand, thinks Democrats are the ones being unreasonable "When President Barack Obama is willing to negotiate with Russian, Syrian, and Iranian leaders, but unwilling to negotiate with the US House … it is time for the House to stand firm," Newt Gingrich writes in a CNN op-ed. If Republicans cave, he argues, Obama will be able to bully them for years to come. Regardless of who's right, Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics thinks that politically, Republicans will suffer but survive. A shutdown will give Democrats ammunition to blame them for the next economic downturn. But their cause is more popular than Gingrich's was. "The prophesies of doom for Republicans are heavily overwrought."
summarize: Megyn Kelly takes issue with 'NYT' book review      CLOSE Days after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, the New York Times has released a review of Megyn Kelly's forthcoming memoir, Settle for More. USA TODAY      The New York Times published a review of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's memoir, Settle for More, after obtaining an early copy of the book scheduled to be published on Nov. 15. Kelly disputes The Times' characterization of two sections of her book; one which implies she said someone leaked Trump her first question in the first primary debate; and another that implies she thought she may have been poisoned the morning of the same debate.      Kelly writes that Trump was livid the day before the first debate of the Republican primary campaign after he heard that Kelly's planned first question "was a very pointed question directed at him," The Times reports. "This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women," The Times wrote. While she doesn't delve into who might have leaked the question, the book gives the clear impression that former Fox New CEO Roger Ailes and others within the network "seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee," according to The Times.      Kelly went on Twitter late Thursday to shoot down the inference that the question was leaked.      For the record, my book "Settle for More" does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016      Kelly also wrote that on the day of the debate, what The Times describes as an "overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver" drove her to the event and insisted on making her coffee. She writes that she drank it and then was violently ill within 15 minutes, according to The Times. "Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her," The Times reported. (A stomach bug was going around, she notes.) But the episode spooked her enough that she shared it later with Roger Ailes and a lawyer friend of his. Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide."      Again, Kelly took to Twitter to clarify her position. "Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did," she wrote at midnight Thursday.      Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the first debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did. — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016      There is one passage of The Times report Kelly has not yet disputed. Before the debate, Kelly did a piece on her show The Kelly File about Trump that the businessman did not like. According to Kelly, Trump refused to make a scheduled appearance on her show unless she called him, The Times reports.      “I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account against you,” she says Trump told her, according to The Times, "and I still may."      Trump followed through with his threat after the debate, repeatedly insulting her with terms such as "bimbo" and "lightweight reporter." He also implied her question at the debate was somehow tied to menstruation. "You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever," he said in a CNN interview with Don Lemon.      A report last week from Radar Online, which also says it obtained a copy of the book, detailed Kelly's allegations of sexual harassment against Ailes.

Kelly took to Twitter to clarify two things: She doesn't think she was poisoned the morning of the first GOP debate, and she doesn't think any questions were leaked to Donald Trump in advance, reports USA Today. Kelly doesn't explicitly state either thing in the book, Settle for More, but Times reviewer Jennifer Senior reads between the lines. For instance, on the leak, Kelly wrote in her memoir that Trump was angry the day before the debate because he'd heard that the first question would be a tough one from Kelly, which turned out to be true—it was about his treatment of women. Reads Senior's review: "She doesn’t speculate where the leak came from. (She reports. You decide.)" But the review adds that an "unambiguous takeaway from this book" is that then-Fox chief Roger Ailes and others "seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee." Kelly, though, tweeted that her book "does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did." As for the other incident: Kelly wrote in her book that a driver picked her up to take her to the debate and insisted on fetching her coffee, even though she had repeatedly declined; she was violently sick minutes later. "Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her," adds the review. "But the episode spooked her. ... Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide." In her tweet, Kelly says that, "for the record," she thinks she caught a stomach bug that was going around, the same one Rand Paul had.

He said he heard his parents fighting. He said he saw his father shove his mother. Then, he said, he watched his mother grab a knife, drive it through his father’s chest and toss it into the sink.      His father, Robert Takach, died at the hospital at age 25.      His mother, Shannon Smith, now 29, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence in the 2009 slaying. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.      Smith appeared Wednesday in court in Warren County, Ohio, to ask for early release. In anticipation, her now 10-year-old son, Bradyn, penned a letter to the judge, asking him to keep his mother behind bars.      “Dear Judge Peeler: I feel that my mom should stay in prison because I seen her stab my dad clean through the heart with my sister in his arms,” Bradyn wrote in pencil.      “Life for me would be 10 times better if mom didn’t kill my dad because that took a big amount of happiness out of mine and my sister’s life,” he wrote.      [Pre-teen girls accused of stabbing friend 19 times to honor mythological creature]      At Wednesday’s hearing, the judge set Smith’s release date for December 2016, marking seven years of incarceration, her attorney, Charlie Rittgers, said. For three years after her release, she will be on community control, which is similar to probation, and she will be on house arrest the first year.      “We’re happy that the decision was made to let her out early,” he said. “We know it was a difficult decision for everyone involved. Hopefully she can start to mend her relationships and reunite with her children.”      Takach’s mother, Patty Todd, said in an interview after the hearing that she was still in shock.      “The judge said she needed to be out to be there for her children — but her children are afraid of her,” Todd said. “She took a life in front of her children. The court just disregarded the children’s lives, my son’s life.”      Shannon Smith. (Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction)      By most accounts, Smith and Takach had a rough relationship. The two met when they were children and, in 2004, had one of their own: Bradyn. The new parents moved in together and, in 2007, had a girl, whom they name Brooklynn.      But violence, drugs and alcohol kept coming between them.      In 2008, Takach was ordered to undergo treatment at a rehabilitation center in Ohio, according to a 2011 court opinion.      Three months later, Takach went home. Smith, however, had moved on and was pregnant with another man’s child.      Regardless, in January 2009, Takach was at her doorstep with his belongings.      “Smith did not want Takach to move back in, because she wanted to start a new life,” according to the 2011 opinion from now-retired Judge William Young of Ohio’s 12th District Court of Appeals. “However, she did not ‘say anything because [she] didn’t want there to be a problem’ and so she agreed to let Takach stay for a day so he could spend some time with their children.”      It was Jan. 29, 2009, and the two were fighting in the apartment in Franklin, about 20 miles from Dayton. Smith later told police that Takach started “pushing” her on the stomach, asking, “How could [she] do this to him?” according to the court document.      She said he grabbed her throat. She said she could not breathe or tell him to stop, so she pulled a knife and swung it, intending to cut his arm, the court document said.      When investigators arrived at the scene, then-4-year-old Bradyn told them that “his mommy stabbed his daddy and put the knife in the sink,” according to the document.      [Sitter stumbles upon blood-covered stabbing suspect who says he ‘slayed the beast’]      Smith was charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. At trial, she was acquitted of murder but convicted on the other two charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison.            From left: Brooklynn, Robert Takach, Shannon Smith and Bradyn. (Courtesy of Patty Todd)      “The jury found in the case that the crime was a result of serious provocation, which is a mitigating factor but not an excuse for Shannon’s actions; she realizes that,” Rittgers said before Wednesday’s hearing. “She has spent every day thinking about her wrongdoing, and she’ll think about this regardless of the outcome.      “She’ll think about this until the day she dies.”      Still, Takach’s family feared an early release.      “She knew when she did this it would devastate the people who once loved her. She did it to her children. She did it to her family,” Todd said before the hearing. “It’s just not justice. At least we should get the justice that was handed out.”      “In another five years, Bradyn will be 15; Brooklynn will be 13,” she added. “They’ll be older and better able to handle the situation. They’re afraid of her, and I don’t want them to have to go through that.”      Several weeks ago, Todd told Bradyn that his mother was trying to get out of prison.      “I don’t believe in keeping secrets from Bradyn,” she said. “I felt the need to tell him his mother may be able to get out of prison. When I told him, he wound up crying in my lap for an hour.”      Bradyn told Todd that he wanted to talk to the judge.      Instead, the court encouraged him to write a letter.      The letter, scribbled on two pages torn from a notebook and shared with The Washington Post, is filled with Bradyn’s memories of his father — and mentions of the new memories he would have made if his father “was still here.”      “I think it would be better for me and my sister if my mom would stay in prison,” he wrote in the letter, “because I am afraid of her because I have seen what she did to my dad.”      Todd read the letter at Wednesday’s hearing. Asked what the judge said, she replied: “Nothing. Nothing.”      But Smith’s attorney said the letter rattled his client.      “She cried throughout the hearing,” Rittgers said. “It was difficult, obviously, to hear the pain people have gone through. It was difficult hearing that letter, as it would have been difficult for any mother to hear.”      But Rittgers said that in the presence of Smith’s family, Bradyn shows a different sentiment.      “Obviously he’s nervous, but he has told them he’s excited to see his mother,” he said.      [‘Mad’ stabbings turn Ikea store in Sweden into a house of horrors]      Smith’s father, Michael Smith, sent a letter to the judge explaining that her children had not “actually been held, kissed and hugged” by Smith in years and “have been without their parents long enough.”      Her mother, Wendy Geis, wrote that the only positive piece left from the couple’s relationship is their children.      “I know there is nothing anyone can do to change what happened that horrible day,” Geis wrote. “I do not believe what happened that day was intentional. Not only did we lose Robbie that day, but we lost a part of our daughter that will never be the same. She will carry with her the rest of her life that tragic day.”      It’s a day Bradyn will carry forever, as well, his grandmother said.      “He remembers it,” she said. “It’s in his brain. It’s in his heart. It’s something he’s never going to forget.”      This story has been updated.

The family of Robbie Takach was asking that she serve the full 10-year sentence for his death.      Exclusive: Woman hopes letter grandson wrote judge will... At a coffee shop in Middletown, Patty Todd wiped away tears as she reads a letter written by her 10-year-old grandson, Bradyn. More      Neither side got exactly what they wanted during a court hearing in Warren County on Wednesday.      Watch this story      The family of Robbie Takach gathered before the hearing began to call for his killer to stay behind bars. They carried signs that read “Killers belong in prison,” and “Sociopaths show no remorse.”      The courtroom of Judge Robert Peeler was packed for the judicial release hearing, with dozens of people there on either side.      Smith spoke out, expressing remorse for her actions.      “I’m so very sorry and I hate what I’ve done - I hate the pain that I’ve caused so many people,” Smith said.      Smith was convicted of voluntary manslaughter more than five years ago. She fatally stabbed her boyfriend Takach in the chest while he held their young daughter.      The jury found her not guilty of murder because of the circumstances surrounding his death.      Peeler cited their volatile and violent relationship and had sentenced Smith to the maximum of 10 years at trial, but he granted her request for an early release.      “She regrets her actions and realizes how this has affected so many lives,” said Mike Smith, Shannon’s father.      Takach’s mother read a letter from his son who was just four years old when he saw his father stabbed.      “Life for me would be 10 times better if mom didn’t kill my dad,” said Patty Todd. “I feel my mom should stay in prison because I seen her stab my dad clean through the heart with my sister in his arms and try to hide the knife."      In granting Smith's release, Peeler cited her efforts to improve herself while behind bars.      “Look at what she’s done – I don’t think anybody can dispute she’s been a model inmate, that she’s made an effort to rehabilitate,” Peeler said.      But Smith will remain in prison until she’s served a full seven years, with a scheduled release in December 2016 -- a victory for Smith’s family and a disappointment for the family of Robbie Takach.      “Her staying in prison isn’t going to bring Robbie back. It’s not going to bring Robbie back, but her getting out early does seem like my son’s life wasn’t worth much,” Todd said. |||||	– "Hopefully she can start to mend her relationships and reunite with her children," Shannon Smith's lawyer said Wednesday after an Ohio judge granted her early release from prison, where she's serving 10 years for the slaying of her children's father. Smith's 10-year-old son, Bradyn—who saw his mom stab his dad, Robbie Takach, in the chest while Takach held his 15-month-old daughter in 2009—had asked the Warren County judge to keep Smith in jail because "I am afraid of her." However, the judge ruled that Smith, convicted of voluntary manslaughter, will be released after serving seven years in December 2016. She will be on house arrest for one year and probation-like community control for three, reports the Washington Post. "The judge said she needed to be out to be there for her children—but her children are afraid of her," the children's paternal grandmother, who is raising them, said after the hearing. She had previously expressed that she thought Bradyn and younger sister Brooklynn would be "better able to handle the situation" if their mom was released after the full 10 years, at which point they'd be 15 and 13, respectively. Smith told the judge, "I'm so very sorry and I hate what I've done. I hate the pain that I've caused so many people," reports WLWT. Her lawyer added she "cried throughout the hearing" and had a hard time hearing her son's letter. But he also argued that Bradyn expressed different feelings in the company of Smith's family members. "Obviously he's nervous, but he has told them he's excited to see his mother," he said. Read more on the 10-year-old's letter here.

Chinese authorities have demanded "severe punishment" for a man who allegedly stole the thumb of a terracotta warrior statue on display in the US, Chinese state media report.      The 2,000-year-old statue, worth $4.5m (£3.2m), is one of 10 on loan to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.      Last week, Michael Rohana was charged with theft and concealment of a major artwork, and later released on bail.      The Terracotta Army is one of China's most important archaeological finds.      A selfie and a theft      According to court documents, Mr Rohana, 24, was attending an Ugly Sweater Party at the Franklin Institute on 21 December when he made his way into the Terracotta Warriors exhibit, which was then closed.      Mr Rohana allegedly used a mobile phone as a torch and took a selfie with one of the warriors, according to Chinese state media Xinhua, quoting the FBI.      He then allegedly put his hand on the left hand of the statue and appeared to break something off from it. He pocketed the item and left.      Museum staff noticed the missing thumb on 8 January and the FBI later traced it to Mr Rohana. He later admitted that he had kept the thumb in a desk drawer.      On Monday, the director of the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Centre, the government-run organisation which loaned the statues out, "strongly condemned" the Franklin Institute for being "careless" with the statues, CCTV reported.      "We ask that the US severely punish the perpetrator. We have lodged a serious protest with them," said Wu Haiyun.      Mr Wu said the centre would be sending two experts to the US to assess the damage and repair the statue with the recovered thumb. There would be a claim for compensation, he added.

The statues were built by the Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang, who died in 210 BCE, and who believed they would protect him in the afterlife.      They were discovered in China's Xi'an city in 1974 by a group of Chinese farmers.      What other cases have there been of historic artefacts being vandalised? ||||| Terracotta Warriors which guarded the tomb of China's First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, on loan from China are displayed in The World Museum, Liverpool, Britain February 6, 2017. (Xinhua/REUTERS)      WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Federal authorities have said that a U.S. man stole late last year a thumb of a Chinese terracotta warrior statue being displayed at a Philadelphia museum in state of Pennsylvania.      According to an arrest affidavit filed Friday, Michael Rohana, a 24-year-old man from state of Delaware, was attending a party held at the Franklin Institute on Dec. 21 last year when he made his way into the museum's special exhibit "Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor."      The FBI said that Rohana used a cellular telephone as a flashlight, looked at various exhibits displayed in the then-closed showroom, stepped up onto a platform supporting one of the statues, and took a selfie with it.      Rohana, according to the affidavit, put his hand on the left hand of the statue, appeared to break something off from the Calvaryman's left hand and put it in his pocket, and then left.      Museum staff noted the missing thumb on Jan. 8 and a special agent from the FBI's Art Crime Team tracked down Rohana days later and showed up at home in Bear, Delaware to question him about the finger, authorities said.      In front of his father, Rohana admitted it that he had stashed the thumb in his desk drawer.      A U.S. attorney has decided to charge him with theft of a major artwork from a museum, concealment of major artwork stolen from a museum, and interstate transportation of stolen property.      He was arrested and released on a 15,000-USD bail, on the condition that he hand over his passport, consent to drug testing, and refrain from leaving the country before trail.      It was not immediately clear whether he had retained a lawyer.      A spokeswoman for the museum said that the statue will be repaired, adding that a security contractor did not follow standard procedures the night of the alleged theft.      The statue that temporarily lost its left thumb, called the Cavalryman, dates back to 210 and 209 B.C. It is one of 10 elegant Chinese Terracotta warrior statues currently on display at the Franklin Institute.

The BBC reports Michael Rohana was attending such a party four days before Christmas at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia when he allegedly entered a room that was closed to guests but, per the Guardian, had an unlocked door. Inside were 10 of China's famed 8,000 terracotta warrior statues, on loan from China. Xinhua reports on the FBI's allegations: that the 24-year-old took a selfie with the statues, touched the left hand of one and seemed to break something off it, then left. On Jan. 8, museum staffers discovered the statue he was said to have touched—valued at $4.5 million—was missing a thumb. An investigation led to Rohana and his home in Bear, Del.; he allegedly confessed to having broken off the thumb and placed it in his desk drawer. An FBI affidavit states that a friend claims Rohana also Snapchatted a photo of the finger the day after the party, reports the Courier Post. China is incensed, with the head of the organization that loaned the statues to the US asking "that the US severely punish the perpetrator. We have lodged a serious protest with them." Two of the organization's members will travel to the US to see the damage first-hand and make the repair with the now-recovered thumb. China will seek monetary damages. Rohana has been charged with concealment of a major artwork and was released on bail after giving up his passport. (How was the Terracotta Army made? Ears reveal a clue.)
summarize: DETROIT -- Detroit defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was ejected from the Lions' 27-15 loss to the unbeaten Green Bay Packers on Thursday after he stomped on an opposing offensive lineman.      Suh was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct and ejected early in the third quarter after the Lions thought they'd stopped the Packers on third down near the Detroit goal line. A replay showed Suh and Green Bay's Evan Dietrich-Smith scuffling on the ground briefly before the All-Pro defensive tackle first pushed Dietrich-Smith's head into the turf a few times, then stomped on the player's upper right arm.      "I want to apologize to my teammates, my coaches and my true fans for allowing the refs to have an opportunity to take me out of this game," Suh said. "What I did was remove myself from the situation the best way I felt, with me being held down."      Suh was quick to defend himself, saying he was trying to keep his balance while freeing himself from the brief scuffle.      "My intention was not to kick anybody, as I did not, removing myself," he said. "I was on top of a guy, being pulled down, and trying to get up off the ground -- and why you see me pushing his helmet down, because I'm trying to remove myself from the situation, and as I'm getting up, I'm getting pushed, so I'm getting myself on balance."      Dietrich-Smith wouldn't say it was a dirty play.      "Stuff happens," he said.      Green Bay defensive end Ryan Pickett was more outspoken.      "There's no place for that," Pickett said.      Ndamukong Suh was ejected after stomping Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith. Andrew Weber/US Presswire      In October 2006, then-Tennessee Titans defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth drew a five-game suspension for stomping on former Dallas Cowboys center Andre Gurode's head.      Mike Pereira, the former vice president of officiating for the NFL who now works for Fox as a rules analyst, said Thursday he expects Suh to be suspended multiple games.      "Stomping on a guy is way over the line. He's not a dirty player, he's a filthy player," Pereira tweeted.      Suh's third-quarter dismissal helped turn a close game into a rout. It came on third down when the Lions appeared to have forced Green Bay to settle for a short field goal. Instead, the Packers scored a touchdown moments later, taking a 14-0 lead on John Kuhn's 1-yard run.      It was 24-0 at the start of the fourth, and although the Lions (7-4) scored a couple late touchdowns, they lost on Thanksgiving for the eighth straight time.      For Suh, it was another data point in the growing discussion about whether the 6-foot-4, 307-pounder plays dirty. In less than two seasons as a pro, Suh has established himself as one of the game's strongest and most athletic defensive linemen, but he's also received his share of fines.      Suh requested and received a meeting earlier this season with commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss his play. He said that dialogue was helpful, but now the league will have to decide whether more discipline -- be it a fine, a suspension or both -- is merited in this case.      "I can't speak on that," Suh said. "I don't have a decision in that."      In August, Suh was fined a third time for roughing up a quarterback after grabbing Cincinnati's Andy Dalton and throwing him to the turf after he had gotten rid of the ball in a preseason game. He was fined last season for hits on Chicago's Jay Cutler during the regular season and Cleveland's Jake Delhomme in the preseason.      Suh disputed the notion that he'd stepped on another player intentionally Thursday.      "Not by any means. I understand, in this world, because of the type of player and the type of person I am, all eyes are on me. So why would I do something to jeopardize myself and jeopardize my team, first and foremost?" Suh said. "I did push his helmet multiple times because he's holding on to me. He's grabbing me. That's the reason I'm on top of him and I'm not at the quarterback, because I'm being held down by him and so I'm pushing him off of me."      The Packers had a player ejected in the first half, when Pat Lee appeared to take a swing at a Detroit player while covering a punt.      Late in the second quarter Thursday, Lee became entangled with a couple of Lions and appeared to take a swing at Detroit's Aaron Berry well after the play was over. It was part of a first half that included 12 penalties -- eight by the Lions.      The 27-year-old Lee was drafted in 2008 out of Auburn. He's started only one game in his NFL career.      Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh is sorry for his third-quarter ejection for kicking Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith in the chest -- well, he's kind of sorry.      In an unrepentant and at times defiant postgame rant, Suh maintained that he did not intentionally kick the Packers' guard and declined to apologize to the offended party for his Thanksgiving Day tussle.      "What I did was remove myself from the situation the best way that I felt in me being held down in the situation that I was in," Suh explained following the Lions' 27-15 loss. "My intentions were not to kick anybody, as I did not. (I was) removing myself, as you see, I'm walking away from the situation. And with that I apologize to my teammates, and my fans and my coaches for putting myself to be in position to be misinterpreted and taken out of the game."      The altercation occurred after Suh was pulled to the ground by Dietrich-Smith following an Aaron Rodgers incompletion on third-and-goal. Suh could be seen on video repeatedly pushing Dietrich-Smith's head to the ground, and he then kicked the Packer as he was getting pulled from the pile.      An official immediately threw a flag, and Suh was ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct.      Suh said it was clear, from his perspective, that his actions were misinterpreted.      "I was on top of a guy being pulled down and trying to get up off the ground, which is why you see me pushing his helmet down," Suh said. "As I'm getting up, I'm getting pushed so I'm getting myself unbalanced. ... With that a lot of people are going to interpret it as or create their own storylines, ... but I know what I did, and the man upstairs knows what I did."      Suh added: "I understand in this world because of the type of player and type of person I am, all eyes are on me. So why would I do something to jeopardize myself, jeopardize my team, first and foremost? I don't do bad things. I have no intentions to hurt someone. If I want to hurt him, I'm going to hit his quarterback as I did throughout that game.      " ... If I see a guy stepping on somebody I feel like they're going to lean into it and forcefully step on that person or stand over that person. I'm going in the opposite direction to where he's at."      Suh did not say if he expected to receive a suspension or fine from the NFL, and Lions coach Jim Schwartz just said, "We're worried about losing this game" when asked if he thought Suh might be suspended.      In 2006, then-Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth was suspended without pay for five games by the NFL for stomping on the face of Cowboys center Andre Gurode, who required 30 stitches following the incident. While Suh did not stomp on the exposed face of a player however, his fine and infraction history -- he has already been docked $42,000 this season -- likely won't be working in his favor when the NFL reviews the incident.      This latest incident certainly will give fodder to those who claim Suh is a dirty player. Lions running back Kevin Smith dodged the subject when asked by NFL Network's Albert Breer about Suh's not exactly golden reputation.      "The dirty player comment, I stay out of that," Smith said, "But we need him on the field -- that's the bottom line." |||||	– The Detroit Lions' Ndamukong Suh showed a huge Thanksgiving Day audience exactly why he is considered one of the NFL's dirtiest players. The defensive tackle was ejected in the third quarter of the Lions' 27-15 loss to the Green Bay Packers after the replay showed him pushing the head of Packers guard Evan Dietrich-Smith into the turf, then stomping on the player's right arm, ESPN reports. (See video at NFL.com here.) Suh claims he was merely trying to keep his balance. "What I did was remove myself from the situation in the best way I felt,” he told reporters. “My intentions were not to kick anybody, as I did not, removing myself." Dietrich-Smith—saying "stuff happens"—declined to call it a dirty play, but his teammates were more outspoken. "There's no place for that," said defensive end Ryan Pickett. The win takes the Packers to a franchise-best 11-0.

When Minnesota high school senior Priscilla Samey found herself without a prom date, she decided that instead of sulking she would just take her Harvard acceptance letter to the dance. The daughter of Togolese immigrants says she got the idea from her sister, and then took to Twitter Saturday to post a photo of herself kissing the Harvard2021 folder with the caption: "Couldn't find a man to accept me for prom so I took a college that did." The frugal 17-year-old, whose dress was made by a family friend, adds that her date "was pretty low maintenance, so I didn't have to pay for his dinner," reports the Grio. Twitter users responded with open arms, as her tweet racked up more than 28,000 retweets and 123,000 likes, with many writing words of encouragement. The Champlin Park High School senior, who was also accepted by Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Brown, and the University of Pennsylvania, tells BuzzFeed that "my secret for admissions to top schools is definitely be yourself." She says that while she wanted to get in, her top priority was to "stick to your roots" and show her true self. She seems to have done that with her prom date, too, bringing a sense of humor to what could have easily been a disappointing event. Her date, meanwhile, "stayed in the car most of the time," she says, noting that "he's shy and also I didn't want it to get trampled." (This teen managed quite the Ivy League feat.)

But Lochte has unwittingly found a huge audience with his real-life escapades here, as he departed the country and left behind three younger teammates to answer for their actions and millions of Olympic viewers clamoring to know, What did Lochte do?      It is not the first time American swimmers have gotten into hot water at an Olympics. At the 1988 Seoul Games, Troy Dalbey and Doug Gjertsen, who each won two gold medals, were sent home after being arrested on charges of stealing a marble lion’s head from a hotel.      The United States Olympic Committee, after a meeting of its executive board, ordered the pair dropped from the team and sent home. Dalbey was suspended by U.S.A. Swimming from national and international competition and team training camps for 18 months. Gjertsen was exonerated from any involvement in the theft but was suspended for three months. Unlike some nations’ team officials, U.S.A. Swimming did not set a curfew for swimmers of legal drinking age after the final night of competition.      In a statement late Thursday night, the U.S.O.C. said, “The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members. We will further review the matter, and any potential consequences for the athletes, when we return to the United States.”      After failing to medal in his last event here, the 200 I.M., Lochte was asked if he intended to retire. He sidestepped the question, saying he just needed a mental and physical break from the rigors of training and competition. Given the suspensions that U.S.A. Swimming levied on Dalbey and Gjertsen, and more recently, Phelps, it is hard to imagine that he will not be forced out of the sport for some period of time.      In a conversation with his family that was caught on camera during his reality show, Lochte said he envisioned a future in Los Angeles.      “I see me being a designer, I see me being a model, I see me being a TV star,” Lochte said.      He did corral the spotlight in Rio, just not the way he planned. |||||	– Can Ryan Lochte dance his way to redemption? The disgraced swimmer is set to join the celebrity cast for the upcoming season of Dancing with the Stars, a source tells People. Though the ABC show wouldn’t confirm the report, an “insider” says “Ryan has wanted to be on the show for years.” Lochte, 32, could use some good PR. Slammed for fabricating a robbery story, Lochte has insisted he only “over-exaggerated” details of the incident in Rio. This week, the 12-time Olympic medalist was dumped by Speedo and Ralph Lauren. Lochte wouldn’t be the first bold-face name to seek a comeback on the top-rated show. One such dancer was Paula Deen, who signed on after making racist comments in 2013 that landed her a raft of negative press, notes the Atlantic. DWTS isn’t the first TV gig for Lochte, who capitalized on a jokey persona cultivated during the 2012 London Olympics to land a short-lived reality show on E! The low-rated What Would Ryan Lochte Do? was cancelled in 2013, per the New York Times. The shaggy-haired swimmer, who gained semi-fame by playing the quirky foil to super-serious Michael Phelps, also played a part as a “sex idiot” on 30 Rock. “I see me being a designer, I see me being a model, I see me being a TV star,” Lochte once said.
summarize: Couple Tells Of Forced Abortion In Chinese City; 'One Child' Policy Blamed      After running afoul of China's One Child policy, a Chinese couple expected to be hit with a fine. But instead, officials demanded that the woman — who was in the eighth month of her pregnancy — have an abortion, according to a new Al Jazeera report.      In telling the couple's story, Al Jazeera reporter Melissa Chan gained access to a hospital where a distraught Xiao Ai Ying said doctors had given her womb an injection. As Chan describes it, the two spoke while Xiao awaited a procedure to remove the dead fetus.      The couple's story, along with a separate video interview with Xiao's husband, is heartrending. And what makes it even more unusual, according to Chan, is that it occurred in the city of Xiamen, which sits on the coast across from Taiwan. Earlier reports of forced abortions in China have mostly been centered in the rural areas of the country's western regions.      In fact, the Al Jazeera report has many of the same sad details as a 2007 story from NPR's Louisa Lim, who spoke to a couple who had just undergone a similar experience.      In that case, Wei Linrong of Guanxi Province said she was seven months' pregnant with her second child when family planning officials came to her house and demanded that she report to the hospital for an abortion.      That report also included a reason why forced abortions and crackdowns might be more the work of regional officials — and not the result of a central edict:      Official figures published by the Xinhua news agency shed some light on why a forced abortion campaign might be judged necessary. They show that the Baise government missed its family planning targets last year. The recorded birth rate was 13.61 percent, slightly higher than the goal of 13.5 percent. This is significant because the career prospects of local officials depend upon meeting these goals.      Al Jazeera's Chan notes that the central government does not condone forced abortions — and that, in addition to financial rewards for having just one child, parents can be fined as much as $40,000 for having a second baby.      The country's official China Daily says that some 13 million abortions are performed in China each year. But that report also warned that the actual number could be far higher, as "figures are collected only from registered medical institutions." ||||| China's one-child policy leads to an estimated 13 million reported abortions every year, with many of those ordered by the authorities enforcing the system.      Al Jazeera's Melissa Chan gained access to a hospital in the southeastern city of Xiamen, where she found one mother in a terrible condition.      Xiao Ai Ying was forced to have an abortion eight months into her pregnancy because she already has a ten-year-old girl.      Forced abortions sometimes happen in remote areas of China, but this one occurred in one of the country's most modern cities. They are not condoned by the central government.      Mothers who violate China's one-child policy usually pay a fine anywhere from $1 to $40,000, but are then often sterilised to prevent them from having another child.      Although the officials figures of 13 million abortions seem high, physicians and medical researchers quoted by the state-run newspaper China Daily on Thursday said that once unreported and medication-induced abortions are counted, the actual number is substantially higher.      The rate of abortion in China is about 24 abortions for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44, the World Health Organisation and the Guttmacher Institute said in a joint report.      In 2003, the report put the number of abortions in China at nine million, out of a total of 42 million worldwide.      Al Jazeera approached Chinese authorities in Xiamen for comment on this story, but they declined to speak to us. |||||	– China's one-child policy, long a staple of its public policy for urban, ethnic Han Chinese, officially exists on the national level as a series of monetary incentives for those who hold to it and monetary punishments for those who run afoul. Numerous interviews and investigations, however, consistently uncover the policy as it is often applied: through forced, sometimes very late-term, abortions. China's national government continues to hold to the position that such action is strictly against stated policy—a policy apparently routinely violated by local and regional authorities eager to meet population growth control guidelines in order to secure their lucrative party seats.

"Our students come to Central with their unique goals, hopes and dreams, and Nikita was undoubtedly no different."

The OSU Alumni Association, which organizes the "Homecoming Sea of Orange Parade," also offered condolences to victims in a statement, as did Stillwater's mayor, Gina Noble.      Officials considered postponing the 2:30 p.m. homecoming game against the University of Kansas, but decided not to. "We're going to play and we're going to remember the victims at the game," Hargis said. The flag at OSU's Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff, and a moment of silence was held. Most of OSU's players knelt in prayer after running onto the field before kickoff, The Associated Press reported.      The OSU Cowboys beat the Kansas University Jayhawks 58 to 10. "This victory is dedicated to those lost this morning and to the recovery of those injured," the OSU Alumni Association wrote on Twitter.

Of the nearly 50 people injured, about one quarter were juveniles between the ages of 1 and 13.      [Previous story, published Saturday, 9:49 p.m. ET]      (CNN) -- A woman suspected of drunken driving crashed a car into a crowd of spectators at Oklahoma State University's homecoming parade, killing four people -- including a 2-year-old -- authorities in Stillwater said Saturday.      Three adults were pronounced dead at the scene, while the fourth victim, the young boy, died from his injuries at OU Medical Center Children's Hospital, according to a Stillwater police statement.      Spokesman Capt. Kyle Gibbs said Saturday night that 44 people had been injured, an uptick from previous reports.      Four children and three adults were hospitalized at OU Medical Center, according to hospital spokeswoman Vallery Brown.      "While our thoughts and prayers are with the Oklahoma State University community tonight following the tragic events during OSU's homecoming parade this morning, it is with deep sadness that I ask you to extend those sentiments to the family and friends of one of our own students," wrote President Don Betz.

Adacia Avery Chambers of Stillwater, Oklahoma, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving under the influence.      Gibbs said the car's driver, Adacia Avery Chambers of Stillwater, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving under the influence and taken to the city jail. She is not believed to be an OSU student, he said.      According to a police statement, Chambers drove her 2014 Hyundai Elantra into an unmanned police motorcycle before careening into the crowd of spectators.      When asked by a reporter whether the 25-year-old Chambers was "obviously intoxicated," Gibbs said, "Certainly probable cause for the arrest, yes sir."      Gibbs said that Oklahoma state law mandates blood tests for any "serious fatality accident." The results of those tests won't be known for several days, he said.      The deadly crash occurred at 10:31 a.m. (11:31 ET), just hours before the school's centerpiece homecoming event -- a football game between the nationally ranked, undefeated OSU Cowboys and the University of Kansas -- and only two blocks from the soon-to-be jam packed 50,000-person Boone Pickens Stadium.      'People flying in the air'      The festive scene turned into one of horror, one the university president called a "horrible tragedy."      "We are shocked and heartbroken by this horrible tragedy," said President V. Burns Hargis. "The Oklahoma State University Homecoming parade is the most wholesome of events and to have it marred in such a way is incomprehensible."      "I can't describe it any more clearly than this: People flying in the air," OSU graduate student Paul Sims said of the moment of impact.      Another witness, Geoff Haxton, said he was about 100 yards from the crash site.      "All there was was smoke and panic. Half the emergency personnel in the county were here," Haxton said." People were running. (My) first instinct was to get my kids away from the street."      Two Stillwater Fire Department vehicles participating in the parade were among the scene's first responders, according to Tom Bradley, the city's fire chief.      Game goes on      After careful deliberation, officials decided to let the football game proceed, Hargis said.      "We're going to play, and we're going to remember the victims at the game, and we're going to move forward," Hargis said. "But we will remember what's happened today."

Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality, raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that — where possible — are sustainably grown and raised responsibly with respect for the animals, the land and the farmers who produce the food. In order to achieve this vision, we focus on building a special people culture that is centered on creating teams of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. This people culture not only leads to a better dining experience for our customers, it also allows us to develop future leaders from within. Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in 1993 and operates more than 1,850 restaurants, including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S. and 11 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, and is an investor in an entity that owns and operates three Pizzeria Locale restaurants.

The Sept. 9 "National Career Day," which would grow the chain's 59,000 employees by 7%, will host interviews for up to 60 applicants at every US Chipotle location between 8am and 11am, a press release notes; interested parties can register for an interview on the National Career Day website. The event, being promoted starting today via social media and Pandora, would be the latest jump by "limited-service" eateries to attract the decreasing pool of workers, defecting more often to higher-end restaurants paying higher wages, per the Journal. Competitors like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Cheesecake Factory have already raised the bar by offering higher wages and perks such as tuition reimbursement; Chipotle has taken a similar tack, upping tuition reimbursement, vacation, and sick days. But it's now enticing candidates with apprenticeships (where workers can earn an average salary of $53,000 a year) and the status of "restaurateur" (the chain's term for upper management, with an average salary of $133,000). Chipotle also says candidates don't necessarily need experience, just qualifications based on its 13 main hiring traits, including honesty, curiosity, and being "infectiously enthusiastic" (all 13 are here). Glassdoor.com reviews indicate the salaries listed by Chipotle may be exaggerated, but Monty Moran, Chipotle's co-CEO, insists those assessments are wrong, per the Journal.

summarize: North Korea tried to export gas masks to Syria but they were seized in Turkey along with arms and ammunition, Japanese media said Tuesday, as the United States threatened action over an alleged chemical weapons attack.      A Libyan-registered vessel, identified as Al En Ti Sar, left North Korea for Syria earlier this year with the consignment, the Sankei Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources from the U.S. military, Japanese and South Korean intelligence.      The U.S. military, which obtained the information, was tracking the ship in coordination with other countries, the report said.      The vessel sailed through Dardanelles in Turkey on April 3 and was searched shortly after by Turkish authorities, who had been tipped off by the U.S.      Turkish officials seized 1,400 rifles and pistols and some 30,000 bullets as well as gas masks, apparently for chemical protection, the newspaper report said.      U.S. authorities believe that the ship was intending to unload its cargo in Turkey and send it overland to the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, the report said.      Turkey detained the captain of the vessel and later charged him after he admitted his ship was on its way from North Korea and was carrying arms bound for Syria.      Damascus is the subject of sanctions by the European Union, the U.S. and its allies banning the sale of weapons.      North Korea is barred by United Nations sanctions from trading in weaponry in the wake of nuclear and missile tests. If confirmed, Pyongyang could face additional U.N. sanctions over the shipment.      North Korea and Syria have reportedly had a military relationship for some years, including during the current civil war in the Middle Eastern country.      There were also widespread reports that North Korea helped Syria build a nuclear plant that was destroyed by Israeli bombers in 2007.      The West has ramped up its rhetoric following accounts of a deadly chemical attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, which it blames on Assad’s regime. ||||| BEIJING -- North Korea tried to export gas masks to Syria this spring, presumably for use in the Middle East nation's chemical weapons program, but the shipment was intercepted by Turkey along with arms and ammunition, a Japanese newspaper reported Tuesday.      The Libya-flagged ship El Entisar (“Victory”) was stopped April 3 by Turkish authorities as it passed through the Dardanelles, the Sankei Shimbun reported. Acting on the tip from the United States, authorities searched the ship and seized 1,400 rifles and pistols and about 30,000 rounds of ammunition as well as the gas masks.      The captain of the vessel admitted that the shipment had come from North Korea, according to the newspaper, which said the plan was for the arms to be unloaded in Turkey and transported by land into Syria to support the government of President Bashar Assad.      The revelation comes amid international outrage over accusations that Syrian troops used chemical weapons against civilians suburbs of Damascus last week. Any connection between North Korea and the alleged attacks could further isolate North Korea.      U.N. sanctions imposed after North Korea conducted nuclear and missile tests prohibit international sales of the nation's weapons, once a major source of hard currency. Syria is also subject to sanctions.      "Gas masks and protective gear are considered weaponry because they are used for atomic, biological and chemical weapons. So if this equipment was sold by North Korea to Syria, on orders of the Syrian government, it shows that the Syrian government was contemplating the use of chemical weapons,’’ said Shin In-kyun, a South Korean military expert and head of the Korea Defense Nework.      This is not the first time that North Korea has been accused of supplying equipment related to chemical arms to Syria. In November 2009, Greece seized almost 14,000 suits that provide protection from such weapons on a North Korean ship they believed was headed to Syria. South Korean authorities also intercepted a North Korean shipment of protective gear on a vessel sailing near the South Korean port of Busan that year.      "There is a long-term relationship between North Korea and Syria, similar to the agreement with Iran, on nuclear and conventional weapons," said Park Syung-je, a military expert at the Asia Strategy Institute in Seoul. “I don’t see any signs that it has diminished.”      A Syrian delegation was reported to have visited Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, in late July. The Korean Central News Agency quoted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saying the talks were aimed as “boasting bilateral relations” between their countries.

The report in the Sankei Shimbun says Turkish officials acting on a tip from the US stopped a ship from North Korea, seizing the gas masks along with arms and ammunition, according to the Japan Times. The apparent plan was to unload the cargo in Turkey, then transport it over land to Bashar al-Assad's army. The revelation (based on anonymous sources) comes as the US weighs military action over Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons. "There is a long-term relationship between North Korea and Syria, similar to the agreement with Iran, on nuclear and conventional weapons," an expert at the Asia Strategy Institute in Seoul tells the LA Times. “I don’t see any signs that it has diminished.” If confirmed, the report would put Pyongyang in violation of UN sanctions that prohibit the sale of its weapons. It also would add further weight to assertions that Assad planned to use poison gas.

Per WTVR, Clayton Litten was perusing his new bathroom floor from his perch on the porcelain throne when he spotted what he says is a "one in a trillion" sighting—a "perfect" depiction of the GOP presumptive nominee within the tile's riveting Rorschach, standing with arms folded. "This cannot be. There's no way," Litten tells the station he said when his eyes fell upon this lavatory vision, which he confirmed with workers who were still toiling away on his bathroom remodel. Litten, who's said to be suffering from incurable lung cancer, doesn't leave the house except for doctor visits, and he mainly corresponds with people via email, per the Genorosity.com page set up in his name. He tells WTVR he used that email account to shoot off a pic of the tile to Trump's campaign in the hopes that he might snag a meeting with the candidate when he's in nearby Richmond Friday for a rally. He adds he's a Republican who, tile or no tile, intends to vote for Trump in November (Litten says he hasn't heard back yet). Meanwhile, the station is crowdsourcing opinions about the tile, tweeting an image of Litten's Trump and a poll asking if others see Donald, don't see him, or … see Hillary. (Slate also wants to know if you can spot the Donald in these other six photos.)
summarize: Black metal legend. Radio show host. Music journalist. Heavy metal DJ. Norwegian post office employee. Hiking metal punk. Darkthrone ’s Gylve “ Fenriz ” Nagell is all of these things, but now he can add “local politician” to his CV as well. For reasons that have more to do with the vagaries of Norwegian politics than Fenriz’s desire to participate in them (read: none), our man was recently elected as a substitute member of the town council in Kolbotn, the Oslo suburb in which he makes his home. He’s not sure how to translate his official title into English, but he explains it thusly: “Basically, I have to step in when the usual people who go to the big meetings are sick or something. Then I have to go sit there and feel stupid among the straight people.”      When we speak with him in late June, Fenriz is getting ready to enjoy five weeks off from at least most of his gigs. “It’s holiday season starting tomorrow, so I’ll have a chance to get all the backed-up emails done and so forth. There’s no real holiday anymore with computers and whatnot,” he laments. “I guess everyone is experiencing the same thing.”      Fenriz is considerably more enthusiastic about Darkthrone’s forthcoming 17 th (!) album, which he says will probably be called Arctic Thunder . As it turns out, this is the first interview he’s done for said album. In fact, he and Darkthrone vocalist/guitarist Ted “Nocturno Culto” Skjellum have just received the test pressing. “We got the audio files for the mastering many months ago, but then we started arguing about the color of the logo on the front cover, and that actually took a longer time to agree on than recording the whole album,” he reports. “It might actually be delayed because of that very reason. People are always asking me for a release date, but I have no clue. I’m hoping October, though.” [the album will be released October 14 on Peaceville - eds]      How did you decide on the title Arctic Thunder ?      It’s the name of an old Norwegian band, so we asked the band members that are now in Red Harvest if we could use it. They never really released anything, I think. I don’t know if Arctic Thunder is official yet, but I just hope no one is snatching it. We’ve been stealing a lot of titles over the years. My lyrics are never stealing anything — it’s just right out of my brain — but when it comes to titles, I’m just always paying respect, it seems. I think we have quite a few albums that have retrospective titles that are about other people’s bands and music. But, you know, I have some original titles, too.      Can you share some of the song titles?      I don’t know if I can! [ Laughs ] We haven’t really told anyone anything yet. And if I tell it to one person and it gets out, I’m going to have to suspicious of everyone. I have no clue. But “The Wyoming Distance” is one.      How many songs did you record this time?      Eight. No real epic stuff this time, dude. No real long tracks because, as you know, we’re in the same business now and I’m getting so many promos, and I guess it’s totally normal now to have intense Transilvanian Hunger- type black metal stuff, only it can surely last for 17 minutes! [ Laughs ] There’s been so many promos like that, it’s crazy. I’ve been doing the radio show and, as we all know, radio doesn’t really work with six-, seven- or eight-minute-long tracks. I play those anyway, but when we’re talking over 10 minutes or something, I can’t do it. But it’s beginning to be the norm that bands have tracks that are like 20 minutes now. No matter how good it is, you can’t play it.      So, Darkthrone is going in the opposite direction: shorter songs.      Yeah, the AOR part of our career is kicking in. [ Laughs ] I don’t mind AOR or anything, man, but what happened was that for the first time in a long time I’m not doing any vocals, because we’re moving into a little bit more serious territory. We’ve had a nice run of the freestyle style that we’ve been enjoying since we got our own studio in 2005. We’ve released five albums that have been totally freestyle. And we’re still doing the freestyle thing — it’s just a bit more somber, maybe. [ Laughs ] So, Ted is doing all the vocals. And you know, there’s a real difference when you listen to an album that has two vocalists and an album that has just one. I wanted it back to that, but mainly I got a real kick out of an album that’s two years old now. The album is called Mountain and the band is called Anguish , from Sweden. It’s very introverted, so I thought I wanted to go in that direction.      What about Ted’s material?      We don’t hear each other’s material until we meet and record it, but I told him, “Man, I’m doing all this slow heavy metal now”; but he’s got other plans, because he did slow heavy metal for his [Gift of Gods] solo EP, so I was thinking he’d really be wanting to kick out more of those jams. But hell no! [ Laughs ] He didn’t bring any slow heavy metal to the table, so I’m fighting this slow heavy metal battle alone. But a lot of people who would like the old style to return would probably like the Nocturno Culto songs best, I’m thinking. But no big shockers on our new album. People will just think, “Oh, it’s getting a bit more serious now.”      Besides listening to Anguish, what made you want to go in a more serious and somber direction?      Well, we actually kinda did that on the previous album. We brought more metal to the plate. There’s even more metal now, and the other inspirations have been cut out. But I want to assure you that the decision to have only Nocturno Culto vocals is based on this Anguish band. But not any of the material — none of the music or riffs or anything.      What did Ted say when you told him you thought it would be better if he did all the vocals?      He said, “Do I have to do more lyrics, then?” [ Laughs ] I was like, “No, man — I can write five.”      What can you tell us about the lyrics you wrote?      I never really talk about the lyrics. When I do the lyrics, I’m in the zone and I can’t explain that zone. That’ll just freak me out. And I’m never returning to the zone. I’m never like, “I wonder what the zone was like when I did Soulside Journey and I tried to be a necromancer.” [ Laughs ] I’ll never get to that mood again. Never. But for those who care, they’ll be good lyrics. No bullshit, man.      Do you tend to write lyrics fairly quickly, or is it a long process?      Both, but we had a period of trying to do more songwriting as opposed to the riff-o-rama of the metal world. Songwriting is more from rock 'n’ roll, where it’s not really that based on riffs, per se. But now I’m back to the old days, just writing lyrics because I have no control over how Ted sings them anyway. So, if Ted does vocals, I can write anything because he just takes the material home and does it. There’s no communication about where I want vocals or anything like that. He’s totally got his vocal cords free to do what he wants. Sometimes it works for me and sometimes it doesn’t. But people outside the Darkthrone cabin, they think, of course, that everything is set in stone, right? But it’s not. So, I’m finally coming to terms with this idea that when you release the music, it’s no longer yours. [ Laughs ]      Has it always been like that? You don’t give Ted any vocal direction for your lyrics?      Yeah. For the first album, we never even rehearsed with vocals. And now we rehearse a song like one time before we start recording. For some songs along the way, I have given him my ideas for where or how to do some vocals. For instance on “In the Shadow of the Horns,” which is one of our more known songs, I probably coached him through the verse and refrain on that one. Apart from that, it’s just been tiny specks of coaching. But that’s the only one I can think of, and that was a long time ago — the summer of ’91, man. Goddamn 25 years ago right now.      In the past, you’ve talked about having songs ready to go for Darkthrone albums, but you’ll end up scrapping them before you meet up with Ted to record because you want to use the newest material possible. Did you end up scrapping many this time around?      Yup, I’ve done that when the pauses in between recording sessions are too long. This time, we fetched all the equipment from the rehearsal place we’ve had the last 10 years and moved it up here because I moved back to Kolbotn. So, now we’re using the same rehearsal place now that we used in ’88 and ’89. It’s a bunker/bomb shelter place and it’s magical for us because it’s got the same smell it did back then. That was in August, and then we made the first session for late September. So, we had six weeks to write. I wrote two and he did two. Usually we only do one each [per session], but this time we wanted to move faster. But between that session and the time we finished the last album was three years, so there were many great ideas — not full songs — scrapped. Maybe between two and four songs altogether? But I’m not crying any tears over that. You’ve got to move on. You can’t sulk — not because of that. [ Laughs ] But I can sulk because of other stuff.      So, there’s something about the spontaneity that’s important to you.      It’s the freshness. I really can’t stand mulling songs over. I really like the part where I make the riff and decide what to do with it — the part where I’m making the song, basically. Then I want to record it fast as hell. When I started recording on my own with Isengard stuff, it was always like that. I could use quite a bit of time on making the songs and getting them right in my head, but when that was done, I never wanted to do many takes. I get bored very easy. Impatience is one of my middle names, and Reluctance is one of the others. The Lord of Reluctancy. Try to get me to DJ sometime. [ Laughs ] It’s impossible. And I’m pissed off when I finally say yes. It’s horrible.      You’re not DJing at the bars anymore?      No, I find DJing metal is becoming more and more of a nuisance. Sometimes it’s nice to do it — maybe three or four times a year. It really moves in waves. Like, for example, in September and October, I know I’ll be drenched in interviews. This is the first one I’m doing for the new album, but I’m thinking I gotta not do what I did last time, which was 104 interviews. Which really kills me. I wrote them down and everything. This time I think I gotta take it down to 70. So, I don’t want to have anything on my calendar from September 'til December because I know that’s going to be all interviews.      Courtesy of Mikael Ohlson      I know you don’t go to many live shows, either, but have you seen anything good in the last year or so?      Oh yeah. I go more than I used to because I’m writing for this magazine [Sweden’s Close-Up ] now. When I go to a show, I can deduct it from the tax and everything if I don’t get on the guest list or whatnot. There was a festival here in the middle of Norway last September, and I wrote about that for the magazine. What else did I see lately? I saw Steelwing and Lethal Steel, which are two of the bands that had releases last year that I bought on vinyl. I bought 44 vinyls from last year. This year it’s lower, man. I don’t know if you see the same, but I get about 1,000 [digital] promos, and so far I’ve only bought six on vinyl from this year. And we’re half through 2016 already. So, a slow year.      You keep track of exactly how many interviews you do and how many records you buy. What else do you keep track of?      You have to have a system. If you do a radio show, you have to be really systematic so you don’t play the same stuff. I got systems out my ass — for everything — but especially when it comes to music. You can’t be cool about it anymore. If you cross the line of having four or five hundred promos, you have to have some kind of system or else you’re really screwed.      Are you enjoying being a music journalist?      I’m not enjoying it at all. I’m always thinking of quitting. I don’t really enjoy reviewing albums, either. Maybe one every two months — and always something I like. I don’t like to slag bands. I like to slag styles and production values, but I don’t like to slag directly this and that band. There’s so much great stuff out there, so you can send people to that. But you have to have a system, because I’m hearing a lot of crap out there to get to the good parts.      How do you convince yourself to keep doing it if you’re always thinking of quitting?      Well, I haven’t been doing the writing for that many years. I’m just seeing how it feels, how it sits with me from day to day. But basically, other people’s bands — not my own band — have been my main priority since I got into the scene in ’86, when I was 15. So, I reckon it’s in my blood. It’s like my day job: I’m always thinking of a plan to retire early, but [...] I can’t quit because I’ve been doing it since I was an adolescent. I mean, I’m not gonna quit eating, even though I’m suddenly tired of some foods, you know? It’s just that interval of my life.      You’ve been doing a radio show for the last year and a half as well. How did you get into that?      When I was at around 500 promos a year, I started doing The Band of the Week [blog]. But then I said yes to the cloud that people can send to for the magazine I write for, which is an additional 500 a year. Believe me, this is an accurate number. I’m writing everything down and making notes. And then, of course, I have to do something with everything I’m listening to because I’m realizing there’s so much great stuff out there.      I was stuck at work listening to music, writing notes and rating shit when two radio shows for metal here in Norway got canceled. I was on them frequently, but I didn’t want to quit doing radio. I enjoy it, and it’s good to promote other people’s bands through radio. So, now I do it on my own with a shoestring budget, totally DIY. I think the microphone I use cost like 300 bucks. It makes me sound even more like a Donald Duck nasal kind of dude. I hate how my voice sounds, but I like doing it this way because on professional radio everyone sounds like Frank Zappa. I sound like a total dork, man, but I don’t give a shit because the songs are great. [ Laughs ] It’s a public service, because I put 40 hours into each show and there’s no income whatsoever.      You put 40 hours into each show?      Yeah, because I have to listen to so many promos to get 10 or 12 songs for each show. Into that goes 30 or 40 promos, so I have to listen to those and mark which songs are really good for radio. And then there’s the actual recording. And then NTS Radio [based in London] wanted my show, which is annoying because after you record a show you really want feedback, but now I can’t get it at once because I have to wait for them to air it, and by then I’m already working on the next show. [ Laughs ] But I’ll get used to that. And I can do it sober, drunk or whatever. Who’s gonna come down on me?      What are some of your current favorites?      Hexvessel. Their new album is fantastic. It’s proto-metal now, and not so forest-y anymore. So, I’m thinking that’s gonna be the album of the year. And the new Virus album is great. Vulture from Germany had a great EP out, and Black Viper from here in Norway, and a thrash band from Chile called Ripper — they have the best thrash album out so far this year. And I’ve heard quite a lot of thrash. It’s my main style since I was in adolescence, so I’m really choosy about thrash. I bought a couple more … I should go up and check the vinyl. Oh yeah! The new Blood Ceremony.      That’s my favorite so far this year.      Great! I’ve been liking that band on and off before, but I was sold on the new album from the first second. The band went to England to record, and there was something special there.      They recorded in an all-analog studio.      It doesn’t really matter if it’s all-analog, I’m thinking. We don’t record in analog, but we record in an analog way. We have no filters; we do nothing with the sound after we record. We can put some treble and bass, but that’s it. [ Laughs ] We also record the drums and guitars at the same time, so the guitars will leak into the drum track and the other way around. It’s very primitive. We’re basically doing demos in the '80s style. People that know us wouldn’t be shocked if they saw our recording sessions, but I’m sure other people would think we are total Stone Age characters. [ Laughs ] It lacks of finesse.      I feel like that’s part of the attraction.      Yeah, I’m not saying other people should do it that way. [ Laughs ] The less people doing it, the better for us, because we like cornering our own little market. But I guess every band is saying that.      Courtesy of Mikael Ohlson      You mentioned earlier that you guys moved back into the old Darkthrone rehearsal bunker last year.      Yeah, it’s like a whole new start. It’s not really a rehearsal space, because we don’t really rehearse. But it’s only 200 meters away, dude.      Do you go down there often to practice drums on your own?      Fuck that, man. [ Laughs ] I don’t really enjoy rehearsing. I enjoy making . It’s been a long time since I rehearsed on any drums — at least 20 years. Also, I didn’t have an amplifier for about 20 years. If I want to make a riff, I just make it with no amplifier.      What was it like the first time you walked back into that bunker after all these years?      Awesome, of course. It’s still got the same smell, the same lamps — it’s as nasty as ever. But the guy who is the sort of janitor there had taken down the Chet Atkins Me and My Guitar poster that we always remembered from when we were kids. We were never really into any upheaval or anything, and that poster was hanging in there when we first moved in. It was always a reference point for us. We never pulled it down or fucked around with it because it was so distant from what we were playing. I mean, we used to warm up with “Hell Awaits” by Slayer because it was pretty cold down there. We never knew how that Chet Atkins album sounded, but I actually listened a little to it recently. And I printed out the Chet Atkins album cover and put it back down there. So, we’ll tour the new album if people just say, “Come play here … we’ve got a Chet Atkins Me and My Guitar poster …” [ Laughs ]      And it’s an actual bomb shelter?      Yeah. Now, there’s more people rehearsing there — more drum kits set up and stuff. We couldn’t do that in '88/'89 because there was the Cold War going on and every bomb shelter had to be totally clear. So, every time we rehearsed, we had to carry all the equipment down, set everything up, and then disassemble everything and carry it out when we were done. When we got the record deal in 1990, we got a new rehearsal space so we wouldn’t have to do that anymore — and then the Cold War ended maybe six months later. [ Laughs ] So, that was stupid.      What is life like in Kolbotn these days?      Nowadays, I’m the neighbor that really takes care of the lawn. But now I’m in the local papers because I got voted in as a politician — involuntarily, I might add. So, I’ve got some support, I guess. But Kolbotn is a tiny place, maybe 9,000 people.      You got voted in involuntarily? Couldn’t you just decline the position?      No, if you get voted in, you have to stay in that position for four years. And then you can pull out. But I’m used to these sort of long-term commitments. [ Laughs ] Basically, they called and asked if I wanted to be on the list [of backup representatives]. I said yeah, thinking I would be like 18 th on the list and I wouldn’t really have to do anything. They just need a list to be able to … well, it’s hard to talk local politics in another language. My campaign was a picture of me holding my cat saying, “Please don’t vote for me.” But people just went nuts. After the election, the boss called me and told me I was a representative. I wasn’t too pleased, and I’m not too pleased about it. It’s boring. There’s not a lot of money in that, either, I can tell you!      So, you’re on the town council, basically.      Yep, that’s it. I’m a local politician. But Norway is very small, so when you’re a local politician, you’re local , man. [ Laughs ] I’m a pillar of my community.      Courtesy of Marte Evenrud      Did your cat get voted in with you? Is she obligated to go to meetings as well?      Aw … no, she’d really hate that. That would be impossible, like a Blackadder episode or something.      What’s your cat’s name?      I don’t know exactly how you would call it in English — it’s like “Peanut Butter,” I guess. But we didn’t name her. In Norway, there’s really strict rules for pets. That means you can’t really get the pet when they’re super small. You have to wait three months so they can get used to their mother and various things. By that time, they have a name. So, now I’m outside yelling “Peanut Butter!” all the time. That was pretty weird for the neighbors to hear before they knew I was calling for the cat.      That’s a great image.      As time goes on, you get closer and closer to Larry David, I’m thinking. For me, when I watch Curb Your Enthusiasm , it’s like looking into a crystal ball. ||||| Black metal figurehead Glyve “Fenriz” Nagell now has another job in addition to being one half of Darkthrone: he’s a backup representative for his local town council in Kolbotn, Norway. In a new interview with Clyrvnt, Fenriz discusses how he was involuntarily elected to his new political position. “Basically, they called and asked if I wanted to be on the list [of backup representatives]. I said yeah, thinking I would be like 18th on the list and I wouldn’t really have to do anything,” he said. “My campaign was a picture of me holding my cat saying, ‘Please don’t vote for me.’ But people just went nuts.

There’s not a lot of money in that, either, I can tell you!”      Fenriz will have to serve as a backup representative for four years, until his commitment expires. But don’t expect the new gig to slow anything down for Darkthrone: the band’s 17th studio album, Arctic Thunder, is due out October 14 via Peaceville. Listen to a new song, “Tundra Leech,” below. ||||| Darkthrone is a black metal band from Kolbotn, Norway. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death.[3][4] In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory[5] and Celtic Frost[5] and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene.      Their first three black metal albums—A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Under a Funeral Moon and Transilvanian Hunger (sometimes dubbed the "Unholy Trinity")[6][7] — are considered the peak of the band's career[8] and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz ever since the guitarist Zephyrous left the band in 1993. The band have sought to remain outside the music mainstream.[9] Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal, being likened to Motörhead.[9]      History [ edit ]      Death metal years: 1986–1991 [ edit ]      The band that would become Darkthrone formed in late 1986 in Kolbotn, a small suburb of Oslo. They were a death metal band by the name of Black Death whose members were Gylve Nagell, Ivar Enger and Anders Risberget. Their main inspirations were Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer and Cryptic Slaughter.[citation needed] In late 1987, the band changed their name to Darkthrone and were joined by Dag Nilsen. Ted Skjellum joined in spring of 1988. During 1988 and 1989, the band independently released four demo tapes: Land of Frost, A New Dimension, Thulcandra, and Cromlech.      They were subsequently signed to the independent record label Peaceville Records with a four-album contract. In 1990, they recorded their first studio album, Soulside Journey. Because of a small recording budget, the band could not afford the kind of studio they wanted but, thanks to the members of Nihilist and Entombed, they were able to record their album at Sunlight Studios. Although mainly death metal in style, there were some elements of black metal present in terms of artwork and songwriting.      Immediately following the release of this album, the band continued writing and recording new material, recording every new song on tape until it was a full album. These demos were entirely instrumental but they demonstrated the band's gradual shift towards black metal. In 1997, they would be released on the compilation album Goatlord.      Black years [ edit ]      Early black metal years: 1991–1994 [ edit ]      During 1991, Darkthrone adopted the aesthetic style that would come to represent the black metal scene, wearing corpse paint and working under pseudonyms. Gylve Nagell became "Fenriz", Ted Skjellum became "Nocturno Culto" and Ivar Enger became "Zephyrous". In August 1991, they recorded their second album, which was released at the beginning of 1992 and titled A Blaze in the Northern Sky. The album contained Darkthrone's first black metal recordings, and Peaceville Records was originally skeptical about releasing it due to Darkthrone's extreme diversion from their original death metal style.[10] After the album was recorded, bassist Dag Nilsen left the band, and is merely credited as "session bass" with no picture on the album.      The band's third album, Under a Funeral Moon, was recorded in the summer of 1992 and released in early 1993. It marked Darkthrone's total conversion to the black metal style, and is considered a landmark for the development of the genre as a whole. This album also marked the last album on which guitarist Zephyrous would perform.      It was followed by their fourth album, Transilvanian Hunger, which was released in February 1994. This was Darkthrone's first album to have just two members, Nocturno Culto and Fenriz. The band would remain a duo from this point onwards. Transilvanian Hunger was characterized by a very "raw" or "low fidelity" recording style and musical simplicity. The album's release caused some controversy: half of its lyrics were written by the infamous Norwegian black metal musician Varg Vikernes, and its booklet contained the phrase "Norsk Arisk Black Metal", which translates into English as "Norwegian Aryan Black Metal".      With Moonfog Records: 1995–2004 [ edit ]      Darkthrone moved to another independent record label, Moonfog Productions, for subsequent releases. The label was run by Satyr of the black metal band Satyricon.      Their fifth album, Panzerfaust, was released in 1995. The album was received well, although its production, which is similar to that of Transilvanian Hunger, encountered some criticisms. Their sixth album, Total Death, was released during 1996 and is notable for featuring lyrics written by four other black metal musicians, and none at all written by the group's main lyricist Fenriz.      During the years 1993–1995, drummer Fenriz was involved with numerous side projects. This included his solo ambient project Neptune Towers, recording an album with Satyr as the trio Storm, and playing bass on Dødheimsgard's debut album. Also he began playing drums for Valhall again, after having been one of the founding members in 1988 but leaving in 1990 to concentrate on Darkthrone.      In 1999, Darkthrone released the album Ravishing Grimness, and in 2001 their following album, Plaguewielder. While Transilvanian Hunger and Panzerfaust had songs written solely by Fenriz, these two albums had songs mostly written by Nocturno Culto and were both recorded in Ronny Le Tekrøe's studio at Toten, Norway. This explains the somewhat "clearer" sound on those records.[11]      In the last years of the 1990s, two Darkthrone tribute albums were released: Darkthrone Holy Darkthrone in 1998 and The Next Thousand Years Are Ours in 1999. The band also released Preparing for War, a compilation of songs from 1988–1994. In 2002, the intro of their song "Kathaarian Life Code" appeared in the last scene of the film Demonlover.      In 2003, the band released the album Hate Them. Although this record and their next contain electronic introductions, they remain true to Darkthrone's early black metal style. Sardonic Wrath was released in 2004. It was the band's last album with Moonfog Productions and their last to be recorded solely in the black metal style. This album was nominated for Norway's Alarm Awards; however, the album's entry was withdrawn at the band's request. Their next releases would feature strong crust punk traits.      Change in direction: 2005–present [ edit ]      In 2005, Darkthrone confirmed that they had returned to Peaceville Records, after leaving the record label in 1994. They had also started up their own record label, Tyrant Syndicate Productions, to release their future albums. To celebrate their return, Peaceville re-issued the Preparing for War compilation with a bonus CD of demos and a DVD of live performances. Darkthrone's first four albums were also re-released with video interviews about each of them.      Darkthrone released their eleventh album, The Cult Is Alive, during early 2006. The album represented a shift in the band's style as the music incorporated crust punk traits. While Darkthrone's black metal roots were still evident, their shift from the genre's typical sound was more noticeable. The Cult Is Alive was the first Darkthrone album to appear on the album chart in Norway, debuting at number 22.[12]      In July 2007, the band released the EP NWOBHM (an acronym for 'New wave of black heavy metal', a take-off on the original 'New wave of British heavy metal') as a preview for their next album. In September that year, Darkthrone released the album F.O.A.D. (an acronym for Fuck Off and Die). The phrase was used by many thrash metal and punk bands during the 1980s. While the music partially continued the punk-oriented style that was introduced on The Cult Is Alive, this time the band focused more on traditional heavy metal.      Also during 2007, Nocturno Culto completed and released The Misanthrope, a film about black metal and life in Norway. It includes some of his own solo recordings. In October 2008, Dark Thrones and Black Flags was released, using much the same style as the previous album. In 2010, the band released the album Circle the Wagons, which again mixed crust punk along with speed metal and traditional heavy metal.      In late 2010, Peaceville acquired the rights to the band's Moonfog albums and re-issued Panzerfaust as a two-disc set and on vinyl. The re-issue of Total Death was set for March 14, 2011. In July 2012, Darkthrone announced a new album, titled The Underground Resistance; it was released on February 25, 2013.[13] The band released their 16th studio album, titled Arctic Thunder, on October 14, 2016.[14][15]      On October 22, 2016, the band revealed via Facebook that they would be issuing a compilation album entitled The Wind of 666 Black Hearts. The album, released November 25, 2016, is composed of demos recorded in 1991 and 1992 for songs which later appeared on A Blaze In the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon. [16]      In June 2018, it was announced that Darkthrone would record a new studio album in October of the same year.

After agreeing to join a “backup list” of potential candidates for the local neighborhood council in Kolbotn, a suburb of Oslo, he was unexpectedly elected.      “They called and asked if I wanted to be on the list [of backup representatives],” he explained. “I said yeah, thinking I would be like 18th on the list and I wouldn’t really have to do anything. They just need a list to be able to … well, it’s hard to talk local politics in another language.”      Never underestimate the power of a cute cat, though. Fenriz jokingly shared a photo of himself holding his cat (whose name roughly translates to Peanut Butter) specifically asking people to not vote for him. Now he will be required to serve as Councilman Gylve Fenris Nagell for four years before stepping down is an option.      “Basically, I have to step in when the usual people who go to the big meetings are sick or something. Then I have to go sit there and feel stupid among the straight people,” he told CLRVYNT. “I’m a pillar of my community.”      Take a look at the photo below and listen to Darkthrone’s volcanic ‘Tundra Leech’ before Arctic Thunder’s October 14 release. |||||	– The frontman of Darkthrone, a Norwegian "black metal" band, has accidentally gotten himself elected to his local town council, Pitchfork reports. As Glyve "Fenriz" Nagell explained to Clrvynt last week, "basically, they called and asked if I wanted to be on the list [of backup representatives]. I said yeah, thinking I would be like 18th on the list and I wouldn’t really have to do anything." He then took a campaign photo of himself holding his cat, Peanut Butter, with the message, "Please don't vote for me." People did not listen. Nagell was indeed elected to be a backup representative in Kolbotn, an Oslo suburb, a role that lasts four years and, he complains, doesn't pay much. "I'm not too pleased about it," he says. "It's boring." As for how exactly he got added to the list of candidates in the first place, he says, per FACT, "They just need a list to be able to … well, it’s hard to talk local politics in another language." He says he will be required to step in if another council member is sick or otherwise unavailable. Meanwhile, Darkthrone has its 17th studio album coming out Oct. 14.

It is among a group of companies that act as the plumbing in the electronic transaction chain, authorizing millions of transactions a day. That makes the companies prime targets for data thieves looking to steal richly detailed financial information.      The details of the data breach are still unknown, but bank officials said Friday that they were told by Visa and MasterCard that the breach happened between late January and late February. The hackers gained access to what is known as Track 1 and Track 2 data, which includes names, card numbers and validation codes.      Ahead of a scheduled conference call, Global Payments announced on Sunday that hackers had compromised only 1.5 million card numbers. In a statement, the company also reassured investors and customers that the data theft was limited to Track 2 data and did no include Social Security numbers, addresses or cardholder names. “Based on the forensic analysis to date, network monitoring and additional security measures, the company believes that this incident is contained,” the company said in the statement. That’s not enough to earn Global Payments a spot on Visa’s approved provider list. In a statement Sunday, Visa confirmed its decision to remove Global Payments from its list of approved providers. The decision was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.      “Based on Global Payments’ reported unauthorized access, Visa removed the company” from its list of providers, Visa said in a statement.      Amy Corn, a spokeswoman for Global Payments, said the company expected to be reinstated, but she did not indicate how long that would take. “We continue to process transactions for our merchants and customers with the same efficiency and care that they have come to expect,” she said. |||||	– Visa has made credit card processor Global Payments persona non grata after some 1.5 million numbers were breached in a massive hack announced Friday, and the New York Times notes that the figure could be as high as 3 million. Global Payments has been removed from Visa's list of "compliant service providers," and Visa is also calling for renewed certification of Global Payments' security compliance. MasterCard is waiting on an independent investigation before taking action against the card processor, the Wall Street Journal reports. The perpetrators "exported" the data they collected, heightening the threat to customers—though the hackers didn't get access to names, addresses, or Social Security numbers, says Global Payments, which calls the breach "contained." Global Payments can still process payments, but the loss of Visa's stamp of approval could drive away customers. "We are making rapid progress toward bringing this issue to a close," says the processor's CEO, according to Forbes.
summarize: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - With no sign of Judgment Day arriving on Saturday as forecast by an 89 year-old California evangelical broadcaster, followers were faced with trying to make sense of his failed pronouncement.      Harold Camping, the former civil engineer who heads the      Family Radio Network of Christian stations, had been unwavering in his message that believers would be swept to heaven on May 21.      His Oakland, California-based network broadcasts over 66 U.S. stations and through international affiliates. With the help of supporters it posted at least 2,000 billboards around the United States warning of the Judgment Day.      In New York, retired transportation agency worker Robert Fitzpatrick was inspired by Camping's message to spend over $140,000 of his savings on subway posters and outdoor advertisements warning of the May 21 Judgment Day.      As he stood in Times Square in New York surrounded by onlookers, Fitzpatrick, 60, carried a Bible and handed out leaflets as he waited for Judgment Day to begin.      By his own reading of Bible, which was slightly different than Camping's, Fitzgerald expected the great worldwide event to begin at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.      When the hour came and went, he said: "I do not understand why ...," as his speech broke off and he looked at his watch.      "I do not understand why nothing has happened."      Camping, who previously made a failed prediction Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1994, had said doomsday would begin at 6 p.m. in the various time zones around the globe.      NEW DAY COMES      That meant it would begin in Asia and Oceania, but with midnight local time having come and gone in those areas, taking them well into May 22, and no indication of an apocalypse, Camping seemed to have gone silent.      During the day, his Family Radio played recorded church music, devotionals and life advice unrelated to Judgment Day.      The headquarters of his network was shuttered on Friday and Saturday, with a sign in the door that read "This Office is Closed. Sorry we missed you!"      Camping, whose deep sonorous voice is frequently heard on his radio network expounding the Bible, could not be reached for comment.      The shades were drawn and no one answered the door at his house in Alameda, California.      Sheila Doan, 65, who has lived next door to Camping since 1971, said he is a good neighbor and she was concerned about Camping and his wife because of the attention his pronouncement has received.      "I'm concerned for them, that somebody would possibly do something stupid, you just don't know in this world what's going to happen," she said.      Tom Evans, a spokesman for Camping, said earlier this week that at least several tens of thousands of people listen to Family Radio's message.      The network is heard in more than 30 languages through international affiliates, according to Family Radio.      In recent weeks, dozens of Camping's followers had crossed the United States in recreational vehicles emblazoned with the May 21 warning. Volunteers also handed out pamphlets as far away as the Philippines, telling people God had left clear signs the world was coming to an end.      In Camping's description of Judgment Day, the Earth would be wrenched in a great earthquake and many inhabitants would perish in the coming months, until the planet's total destruction on October 21.      On Saturday, some atheists in different parts of the country held celebrations and get-togethers to mark the failure of Camping's May 21 prediction to come true.      In Oakland, the same city where Camping's network is based, over 200 people gathered at an atheist convention where speakers joked about the Judgment Day pronouncement and a vendor sold jewelry with the words "Good without God."      Cara Lee Hickey, 32, a Christian turned atheist, said Camping's prediction got people talking.      "I've heard a lot of name-calling, but most of it is from other Christians calling him a false prophet," she said.      (Additional reporting by Erik Tavcar, Jonathan Allen and Noel Randewich; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jerry Norton) ||||| Sue Espinoza was planted before the television, awaiting news of her father's now infamous prediction: cataclysmic earthquakes auguring the end of humanity.God's wrath was supposed to begin in New Zealand and then race across the globe, leaving millions of bodies wherever the clock struck 6 p.m. But the hours ticked by, and New Zealand survived. Time zone by time zone, the apocalypse failed to materialize.On Saturday morning, Espinoza, 60, received a phone call from her father, Harold Camping, the 89-year-old Oakland preacher who has spent some $100 million — and countless hours on his radio and TV show — announcing May 21 as Judgment Day. "He just said, 'I'm a little bewildered that it didn't happen, but it's still May 21 [in the United States],'" Espinoza said, standing in the doorway of her Alameda home. "It's going to be May 21 from now until midnight."But to others who put stock in Camping's prophecy, disillusionment was already profound by late morning. To them, it was clear the world and its woes would make it through the weekend.Keith Bauer, a 38-year-old tractor-trailer driver from Westminster, Md., took last week off from work, packed his wife, young son and a relative in their SUV and crossed the country.If it was his last week on Earth, he wanted to see parts of it he'd always heard about but missed, such as the Grand Canyon. With maxed-out credit cards and a growing mountain of bills, he said, the rapture would have been a relief.On Saturday morning, Bauer was parked in front of the Oakland headquarters of Camping's Family Radio empire, half expecting to see an angry mob of disenchanted believers howling for the preacher's head. The office was closed, and the street was mostly deserted save for journalists.Bauer said he was not bitter. "Worst-case scenario for me, I got to see the country," he said. "If I should be angry at anybody, it should be me."Tom Evans, who acted as Camping's PR aide in recent months, took his family to Ohio to await the rapture. Early next week, he said, he would be returning to California."You can imagine we're pretty disappointed, but the word of God is still true," he said. "We obviously went too far, and that's something we need to learn from."Despite the failure of Camping's prediction, however, he said he might continue working for him."As bad as it appears—and there's no getting around it, it is bad, flat-out—I have not found anything close to the faithfulness of Family Radio," he said.Others had risked a lot more on Camping's prediction, quitting jobs, abandoning relationships, volunteering months of their time to spread the word. Matt Tuter, the longtime producer of Camping's radio and television call-in show, said Saturday that he expected there to be "a lot of angry people" as reality proved Camping wrong.Tuter said Family Radio's AM station in Sacramento had been "severely vandalized" Friday night or Saturday morning, with air conditioning units yanked out and $25,000 worth of copper stripped from the equipment. He thinks it must have been an angry listener. He was off Saturday but planned to drive past the headquarters "and make sure nothing's burning."Camping himself, who has given innumerable interviews in recent months, was staying out of sight Saturday. No one answered the door at his Alameda home, though neighbors said he was there.By late afternoon, a small crowd had gathered in front of Camping's Oakland headquarters. There were atheists blowing up balloons in human form, which were released into the sky just after 6 p.m. in a mockery of the rapture. Someone played a CD of "The End" by the Doors, amid much laughter.There were also Christians, like James Bynum, a 45-year-old deacon at Calvary Baptist Church in Milpitas, holding signs that declared Harold Camping a false prophet. He said he was there to comfort disillusioned believers."Harold Camping will never hand out poisoned Kool-Aid," Bynum said. "It's not that kind of a cult. But he has set up a system that will destroy some people's lives." ||||| 'Judgment Day' came and went on Saturday, and John Ramsey hasn't been able to sleep.      The 25-year-old Harrison, N.J. resident had rearranged his life in recent months to devote himself to spreading a fringe California preacher's prediction that May 21 would bring worldwide earthquakes and usher in a five-month period of misery before the world's destruction.      Like many of those convinced of the Rapture was pending, Ramsey quit his job, donated "a couple thousand" to Harold Camping's Family Radio network and convinced family members to join him to spread news of the Rapture on Manhattan streets.      His family nervously huddled in their apartment living room Saturday, holding their Bibles open, switching between CNN, Facebook and Google for news of quakes in the Pacific.      They cried. They hugged. They argued. But mostly, they waited. Nothing happened.      On Sunday, a dejected Ramsey said he faces a "mixed bag."      He has to find a new job. So does his mother. His 19-year-old brother, who had quit high school the year prior ("It's pointless to graduate," the brother had said), is thinking of re-enrolling or finding employment.      His wife, Marcia Paladines, had come to accept that she might never meet her unborn baby, whom she and Ramsey had named John Moses. Now, she's praying for a healthy birth. The child is due as early as Friday.      "Life goes on," Ramsey said Sunday. "I get to live. I get to be a dad."      The May 21 prediction came from the Biblical numerology of Harold Camping, an 89-year-old televangelist who owns the Oakland, Calif.-based Christian Family Radio network. Camping had previously predicted a similar end-times scenario in 1994.      Several Camping followers previously interviewed by The Huffington Post did not return phone calls and emails Sunday. But a few did publicly declare their reactions.      WATCH:                  "I guess no man knows the day or the hour," said Peter Lombardi, a 44-year-old from Jersey City, N.J. who had had taken an "indefinite break" from his job in April to preach about May 21.      He had fitted his Dodge minivan with stickers proclaiming the "awesome news" of Judgment Day and paraded with neon green Caravans through Manhattan's business districts to hand hundreds of fliers about the date. On Sunday, he was peeling the stickers off.      Lombardi said he is going back to work -- he owns a construction business -- and said he has "no regrets." He added, "I'm not disappointed. I'm still living today." He believes Camping and others must have read the Bible incorrectly.      Lombardi had donated $1,100 to Family Radio in recent months to help the organization purchase thousands of billboards and other ads throughout the country, but said he doesn't expect any of his money back.      "What can you do?" he said. "I don't think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say Monday on the radio show."      "It's not [Camping's] fault," said Ramsey, who added he also won't ask for his money back. "Nobody held a gun to my head. I read the Bible. The math added up. I don't think anybody would do something like this without meaning it."      Camping was mostly silent over the weekend, but he spoke briefly outside his Alameda, Calif. home on Sunday with a San Francisco Chronicle Reporter.      "It has been a really tough weekend," he said, adding he was "flabbergasted" and "looking for answers." Camping said he would make a detailed announcement on Monday.      The Family Radio web site has not been updated. A countdown on the site says there are zero days left to 'Judgment Day' and an image shows the numbers "2012" crossed out.      "Mr. Camping certainly won't shy away from this," Family Radio spokesman Tom Evans told The Huffington Post on Sunday, adding "how that will happen will be forthcoming."      Evans, who had spent 'Judgment Day' with his wife and kids, said he was happy that he gets more time to be with his family, but added that "a believer's highest hope is to be with the Lord forever." As for his belief in the second coming, "nothing has changed other than the ramifications for Family Radio and Mr. Camping's credibility in the world."      After Camping's failed Rapture prediction in 1994, Evans stayed with Family Radio, but he declined to say whether he would stay on the job this time.      WATCH:                  Camping, who told The Huffington Post last week that May 21 was "no laughing matter," had refused to discuss what he would do with donations if the day passed without event. In recent months, followers have given generously to his company, which runs 66 radio stations in the U.S. and is worth at least $120 million.      On Sunday, Evans said Family Radio's assets "far outweigh its liabilities," and that it will "certainly do everything it can to take care of people." But he said that there has been no decision on giving money back to donors.      In 2009, the last year Family Radio publicly released a tax return, the group reported $18.4 million in income from contributions and $1 million from investments and other income. It spent $36.7 million and employed 348 people paid a total of more than $9 million in wages and benefits. Camping has said he has worked without pay for several years.      Articles have noted that the station's lease runs through 2023 and that several employees were planning last week to show up to work on Monday.      Followers like Ramsey and Lombardi said they had few hard feelings toward Camping and still agreed with some of the self-taught preacher's views, such as one that says all churches and denominations have been corrupted.      "I have learned to study the Bible really well. This guy has opened my eyes to a lot of truths," said Lombardi.      "If he makes another prediction, I can't tell you what I am going to do," said Ramsey. "But I've really taken an interest in the Bible. I know it's the word of God. And I've been reading into more parts today."      He quoted Mark 13:22: "For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall [show] signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect." ||||| the end is near Long Island Firefighter’s Wait for the Rapture Goes Unfulfilled      “Wanna order a pizza?" Jeff asks. "I don’t know if we’ll have time to eat it, but we might as well get it.”            It is 4:48 p.m. on May 21, and earthquakes have not yet riven the Earth. “When the sky goes dark and you feel a rumbling, I’m going to ask you and the kids to step outside very quickly," Jeff told me when I first arrived at his small ranch house in Hicksville, Long Island. "God willing, we’ll all be taken up in a whirlwind to Heaven. I know it might sound strange, but that’s my understanding of how it’s going to go.” His 6-year-old son was in the living room, playing a Star Wars game on the Wii. His 4-year-old daughter, wearing a Spider-Man bike helmet from a recent tricycle trip around the backyard, tapped me on the shoulder to show me a crayon drawing of a rainbow.            Jeff orders a large Sicilian pie for delivery. “And please put a rush on it,” he tells the person taking his order. “We’re — we’re in a rush here.”      Jeff is visibly nervous now, taking deep breaths. “And listen,” he says into the phone, “if you have a radio, put on 94.7. They’re talking about Judgment Day and telling everyone to ask God for mercy. It's important.” WFME 94.7 is the New York outlet for Family Radio, the station Jeff was listening to three years ago when he heard Harold Camping prophesying the End of Days. That's when Jeff left the Catholic Church and begin studying Biblical numerology. Thousands of Camping's followers fervently believe that the Rapture will occur on May 21, 2011; millions more know of the prophecy thanks to Family Radio billboards and newspaper ads.      Jeff, 44, is a muscular firefighter from Flushing with a square jawline. When the pizza arrives, Jeff calls his friend Ron, “One of the only true believers I know who will talk to me about this stuff," and they reassure each other by speakerphone, parsing choice psalms and proverbs.            “So, from the Biblical evidence you’re finding,” Jeff asks Ron, “at what hour do we now think this earthquake is going to happen?” According to Harold Camping, the earthquakes were to start at 6 p.m. at the International Date Line — 2 a.m. Eastern Time — and spread eastward around the world. When Jeff woke up on Saturday and everything was still calm, he decided this was a potentially ominous sign: “This morning the sky was crystal clear, just like 9/11. I was a firefighter then, and I couldn’t believe that on such a beautiful day, such destruction could come.” With the Rapture seemingly running behind schedule, Jeff hypothesized then predicted the earthquakes would come between 3 and 5 p.m. ET, and would wreak destruction over all the world simultaneously. After three, his prediction changed again: “Six now looks more likely, but really it might be any time before midnight.” Ron, over the phone, refuses to predict the hour. “In all this time, I’ve always been blown away by the evidence pointing to the day, but never the exact hour.”            Rosana, Jeff’s wife, who had been out at a friend's birthday party, comes home a little after six. “What, nothing happened?” she asks with no small amount of contempt.      Jeff buries his head in his Bible. He and Ron debate the virtues of King Solomon for another hour, while Rosana loudly opens and closes cabinets. Jeff warms up another slice of pizza and pours Pepsi into a Miller Lite pint glass. Finally, he hangs up the phone. Rosana turns to face him.      “Jeff, starting at midnight tonight, I don’t want to hear any more of this crap, okay?”      “Look,” he says, “I told you I knew the day, but I never claimed to know the hour—“      “I don’t want to hear it, Jeff. I’m telling you, I can’t take it.”      Rosana gives me a helpless look, and she and I go into another room to chat. “I don’t know what happened to him,” she whispers to me. “He used to be normal. Now all he can talk about is the Bible and this May 21 stuff. He took all his vacation days in a row, so all he’s doing the last four weeks is sitting around reading the Bible and driving me nuts. Thank God he didn’t quit his job like some of them did.”      Meanwhile, Jeff is checking his text messages. “There are a bunch of friends here who are mocking me,” he says. “And that’s all right! I just put on my spiritual shield and endure.”      Ron calls again, and he and Jeff come up with a new interpretation: May 21 will not end, technically, until midnight in Hawaii. “There will be a lot of people mocking me after midnight tonight if nothing does happen,” Jeff says, breathing quickly again, “but what they don’t realize is that May 21 hasn’t been completed everywhere in the world yet. So we really can’t tell anything until six in the morning here. That’s when the truth will really be tested.” ||||| The hour of the apocalypse came quietly and went the same way _ leaving those who believed that Saturday evening would mark the world's end confused, or more faithful, or just philosophical.

(Associated Press)      Believers had spent months warning the world of the pending cataclysm. Some had given away earthly belongings. Others took long journeys to be with loved ones. And there were those who drained their savings accounts.      All were responding to the May 21 doomsday message by Harold Camping, an 89-year-old retired civil engineer who has built a multi-million-dollar Christian media empire that publicizes his apocalyptic prediction.      "I had some skepticism but I was trying to push the skepticism away because I believe in God," said Keith Bauer _ who hopped in his minivan in Maryland and drove his family 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometers) to California for the Rapture.      He started his day in the bright morning sun outside Camping's gated Oakland headquarters of Family Radio International.      "I was hoping for it because I think heaven would be a lot better than this earth," said Bauer, a tractor-trailer driver who began the voyage west last week, figuring that if he "worked last week, I wouldn't have gotten paid anyway, if the Rapture did happen."      According to Camping, the destruction was likely to have begun its worldwide march as it became 6 p.m. in the various time zones, although some believers said Saturday the exact timing was never written in stone.      He had been projecting the apocalyptic prediction for years far and wide via broadcasts and websites.      In New York's Times Square, Robert Fitzpatrick, of Staten Island, said he was surprised when the six o'clock hour simply came and went. He had spent his own money to put up advertising about the end of the world.      "I can't tell you what I feel right now," he said, surrounded by tourists. "Obviously, I haven't understood it correctly because we're still here."      Many followers said the delay was a further test from God to persevere in their faith.      "It's still May 21 and God's going to bring it," said Family Radio's special projects coordinator Michael Garcia, who spent Saturday morning praying and drinking two last cups of coffee with his wife at home in Alameda. "When you say something and it doesn't happen, your pride is what's hurt. But who needs pride? God said he resists the proud and gives grace to the humble."      The Internet was alive with discussion, humorous or not, about the end of the world and its apparent failure to occur on cue. Many tweets declared Camping's prediction a dud or shared, tongue-in-cheek, their relief at not having to do weekend chores or take a shower.      The top trends on Twitter at midday included, at No. 1, "endofworldconfessions," followed by "myraptureplaylist."      As 6 p.m. approached in California, some 100 people gathered outside Family Radio International headquarters in Oakland, although it appeared none of the believers of the prophecy were among them. Camping's radio stations, TV channels, satellite broadcasts and website are controlled from a modest building sandwiched between an auto shop and a palm reader's business.      Christian leaders from across the spectrum widely dismissed the prophecy, and members of a local church concerned Camping's followers could slip into a deep depression come Sunday were part of the crowd outside Family Radio International. They held signs declaring Camping a false prophet as motorists drove by.      "The cold, hard reality is going to hit them that they did this, and it was false and they basically emptied out everything to follow a false teacher," the Rev. Jacob Denys, of the Milpitas-based Calvary Bible Church, said earlier. "We're not all about doom and gloom. Our message is a message of salvation and of hope."      About a dozen people in a partying mood were also outside Family Radio International, creating a carnival-like atmosphere as they strolled in a variety of costumes that portrayed monks, Jesus Christ and other figures.      "Am I relieved? Yeah. I've got a lot going on," Peter Erwin, a student from Oakland, said, with a hint of sarcasm. "Trying to get specific about the end of the world is crazy."      Revelers counted down the seconds before the anticipated hour, and people began dancing to music as the clock struck 6 p.m. Some released shoe-shaped helium balloons into the sky in an apparent reference to the Rapture.      Camping has preached that some 200 million people would be saved, and that those left behind would die in a series of scourges visiting Earth until the globe is consumed by a fireball on Oct. 21.      Family Radio International's message has been broadcast in 61 languages. He has said that his earlier apocalyptic prediction in 1994 didn't come true because of a mathematical error.      "I'm not embarrassed about it. It was just the fact that it was premature," he told The Associated Press last month. But this time, he said, "there is ... no possibility that it will not happen."      As Saturday drew nearer, followers reported that donations grew, allowing Family Radio to spend millions on more than 5,000 billboards and 20 RVs plastered with the doomsday message. In 2009, the nonprofit reported in IRS filings that it received $18.3 million in donations, and had assets of more than $104 million, including $34 million in stocks or other publicly traded securities.      Marie Exley, who helped put up apocalypse-themed billboards in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon, said the money allowed the nonprofit to reach as many souls as possible.      She said she and her husband, mother and brother read the Bible and stayed close to the television news on Friday night awaiting word of an earthquake in the southern hemisphere. When that did not happen, she said fellow believers began reaching out to reassure one another of their faith.      "Some people were saying it was going to be an earthquake at that specific time in New Zealand and be a rolling judgment, but God is keeping us in our place and saying you may know the day but you don't know the hour," she said Saturday, speaking from Bozeman, Montana. "The day is not over, it's just the morning, and we have to endure until the end."      Still, the world wasn't without its normal and sometimes dreadful disturbances Saturday. Among them: a tornado killed one person and damaged at least 20 homes in Kansas, a 6.1-magnitude quake stuck 600 miles (1,100 kilometers) off New Zealand with no reports of injury, a much smaller quake, 3.6, was felt my many people Saturday evening in the San Francisco Bay area, and Iceland's most active volcano started erupting.      Camping, who lives a few miles (kilometers) from his radio station, was not home late morning Saturday, and an additional attempt to seek comment from him late in the evening also was unsuccessful, with no one answering his front door.      Earlier in the day, Sheila Doan, 65, Camping's next-door-neighbor of 40 years, was outside gardening and said the worldwide spotlight on his May 21 forecast has attracted far more attention than the 1994 prediction.      Doan said she is a Christian and while she respects her neighbor, she doesn't share his views.      "I wouldn't consider Mr. Camping a close friend and wouldn't have him over for dinner or anything, but if he needs anything, we are there for him," Doan said.      ___      Associated Press reporters Terry Chea in Oakland, Don Babwin in Chicago, Mike Householder in Detroit, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans, David R. Martin in New York and video journalist Haven Daley in San Francisco contributed to this report.

A sampling of reactions from the Huffington Post, Reuters, the AP, and the Los Angeles Times: John Ramsey, 25, quit his job, donated thousands of dollars to Camping’s Family Radio, and took to the streets of Manhattan with his family to spread word of the coming end of days. Now, he and his mother must find new jobs and his 19-year-old brother, who quit high school, might re-enroll. The good news is, Ramsey’s wife will get to have her baby. “Life goes on,” he says. “I get to be a dad.” Peter Lombardi, 44, who took an “indefinite break” from his job last year, acknowledges that perhaps “no man knows the day or the hour” the world will end. He spent yesterday peeling Judgment Day stickers off his minivan, but says he’s “not disappointed.” He does want an explanation from Camping, to whom he donated money: “I don’t think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say … on the radio show.” Robert Fitzpatrick, who spent much of his life savings on advertisements for the rapture, stood in Times Square at 6pm and simply said, “I do not understand why … I do not understand why nothing has happened.” He added, "I can't tell you what I feel right now. Obviously, I haven't understood it correctly because we're still here." Keith Bauer, 38, loaded his family into his SUV and drove from Maryland to California to await the end of days. Though he “had some skepticism,” he says he truly wanted to believe, since he figured “heaven would be a lot better than this earth.” Even so, he says he’s not upset with Camping. “Worst-case scenario for me, I got to see the country. If I should be angry at anybody, it should be me."

Fire investigators said on Monday they did not believe the fire was started deliberately.      The dogs are thought to have been left in the vehicles while their owners attended the Liverpool international horse show at the neighbouring Echo Arena.      Firefighters rescued the animals after extinguishing the “ferocious” fire which whipped through the car park in Kings Dock on New Year’s Eve.      The overwhelming majority of the estimated 1,400 vehicles in the seven-storey structure were destroyed, according to Merseyside’s chief fire officer, Dan Stephens. Just a few on the roof level and at the corners of the building were spared, he added.

Two people were treated at the scene for minor smoke inhalation, along with a woman who had hurt her hand as she ran from the flames, said Stephens.      No sprinklers were fitted in the building, he said. “Had the car park had sprinklers, that would certainly have suppressed the fire and might even have extinguished the fire,” he said.      The Labour mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, said fire service cuts had contributed to the devastation. He tweeted:      Joe Anderson (@mayor_anderson) Car Park fire was reported to me at 4.45pm and I was told it was containable,it would have been if we had enough appliances responding,Chief Fire officer confirmed my view that 2 years ago we would have had 8 fire engines from 4 stations responding instead of 2 #cutscost      Stephens told the Guardian that over the course of the fire 12 fire engines attended, along with three aerial appliances and three high volume pumps (two borrowed from neighbouring forces), while 85 firefighters were involved.      Fire investigators believe the fire started shortly after 4.30pm on Sunday, when the engine compartment of a Range Rover Discovery on the second level went up in flames. “There is nothing to suggest it was anything other than an accidental ignition,” said Stephens.      The fuel in the burning cars emitted such heat that firefighters did not have enough water to extinguish the blaze quickly using the water mains, he said.      By the time they had set up a high-volume pump to draw from the Mersey, the building had been engulfed in flames. It took some time before further pumps arrived from Greater Manchester and elsewhere in Lancashire.      “It’s a bit like Grenfell. With these very high temperatures, you were never going to put the fire out without the whole building taking hold. The speed at which the fire spreads means you simply aren’t going to put it out,” said Stephens.      Crews rescued four dogs on Monday from a car on the roof level, he continued. A further two had been rescued from a car on the second floor on Sunday night before the fire fully took hold.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The remains of the car park at the Liverpool Echo Arena. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA      “It’s fair to say that the owners were very relieved,” said Stephens. “That was one good outcome at least. We are very fortunate that there were no serious injuries, barring a few people with minor smoke inhalation.”      Witnesses described abandoning their vehicles, grabbing possessions and running for their lives after the blaze broke out. Neighbouring flats were also evacuated, with those unable to return or find alternative accommodation housed temporarily in a shelter at a nearby leisure centre.      The fire caused the cancellation of the final day of the horse show on Sunday.      Sue Wright and her husband, former England footballer Mark, were attending, with friends. She said she saw a car with its engine on fire and helped to lead some of the horses to safety.      “It looked like a ball of fire on the front of the car and it was producing a lot of smoke. We just left everything in [our] car – handbags, telephone, cash – and just went. It was all insignificant as long as everyone was OK and we could get the horses out.”      She said of one of her children spotted the fire and smoke and that she called the emergency services before rushing to the stables. She could hear “bangs and popping” as she arrived.      “The water was coming down to ground level as the firefighters were tackling the fire but it was spooking the horses.”      Wright told the grooms to bridle the horses and they managed to get them out through two exits. “Everybody was helping each other out. It was all hands on deck in the stables,” she said.            Crews were first called at 4.42pm and were on the scene eight minutes later.      Kevin Booth, 44, from Manchester, had left his Fiat 500X in the car park as he took his wife, Julie, and 16-year-old daughter, Holly, to see the horse show as a treat.      “The flames and the smoke were unbelievable,” he said. “People were saying that they would just wait and get their cars back.      “I thought: ‘Have you seen the fire? Are you joking?’ It was frightening, we could hear the bangs of car windows exploding.”      Merseyside police have advised anyone affected by the fire to go to the Pullman hotel, Kings Dock, where staff will be able to provide assistance, aided by the British Red Cross.      Anyone whose car was in the car park should not call police but instead contact their insurers, the force said.      A spokeswoman for the Echo Arena said: “All people and horses are safe and secure.”      About 4,000 people had been expected to attend Sunday evening’s show. |||||	– A massive fire New Year's Eve in a multi-story parking garage in Liverpool, England, destroyed around 1,400 cars, with one exploding every few seconds at the height of the blaze, authorities say—but no humans or animals were seriously injured. Horses had been stabled in the garage before performances at the Liverpool International Horse Show, but they were moved to safety inside the nearby Echo Arena, the AP reports. Firefighters say six dogs that had been left in cars were rescued, including four from a vehicle on the roof of the seven-story structure and two that were saved from the second floor before the fire took hold, reports the Guardian. Police say an "accidental fire within a vehicle caused other cars to ignite." The fire was brought under control Monday morning. The horse show was canceled and shelters were opened for people—and horses—needing emergency accommodation. Visitor Kerry Matthews tells the BBC that he left his car in the parking garage while visiting the city for New Year's Eve. "A fireman said the whole car park is on fire. He said, 'What level is your car on?' We said six," Matthews says. "He said, 'Well, you best go and have a couple of drinks to celebrate [the] new year because you're not going to get your car back.'"
summarize: WBUR, and The Boston Globe, announced today they have joined forces to launch Last Seen, a weekly podcast that will debut on September 17. Hosted by WBUR’s award-winning producers and reporters Kelly Horan and Jack Rodolico, and with exclusive contributions from Boston Globe’s Pulitzer prize-winning reporter Stephen Kurkjian, author of “Master Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World’s Greatest Art Heist,” Last Seen examines the most valuable and confounding art heist in history: the theft of 13 artworks, including Rembrandt’s only seascape, from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.      “Twenty-eight years later, this unsolved crime still exerts an irresistible curiosity, and we’re excited to offer WBUR and The Boston Globe’s first true-crime podcast on this significant case originating in the city where it happened,” said Iris Adler, Executive Director for Programming, Podcasts and Special Projects at WBUR. “The producers of Last Seen have obtained unprecedented access to case files, first-ever interviews and this podcast is the result of a year of investigative reporting to unravel the crime’s many mysteries.”      "Our reporters have spoken to key people who have never before publicly talked. They have seen places and documents that no other reporters have seen before. Their work even led federal authorities to conduct a high-stakes excavation in a residential neighborhood in Florida. It all comes together in a provocative look not only at the crime and all the colorful characters around it, but at the investigation that has failed to solve it," said Jane Bowman, Vice President, Marketing and Strategic Partnerships, The Boston Globe.      The podcast begins with the night of the robbery. Like many museums in the 1990s, the Isabella Gardner Museum was uninsured and poorly secured. On March 18, 1990, the thieves — dressed in police uniforms — tied up the security guards and stole 13 pieces of artwork valued at $500 million, including three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, a Manet and sketches by Degas. The empty frames, where the treasured art once hung, still line the walls of museum.      Despite promises of immunity and a profitable reward, which started at $1 million and now stands at $10 million, no one has ever been charged in the crime, and none of the artwork has been recovered.      Who pulled off what the FBI describes as the largest property crime case in U.S. history? Was it a mob associate who ran the TRC Auto Electric repair shop in Dorchester, the Irish Republican Army and Whitey Bulger, two wannabe rock ‘n’ rollers or someone else entirely? Last Seen looks at these and many more suspects as hosts Horan and Rodolico travel from Boston to Philadelphia, Florida, Ireland and Italy investigating motives, scenarios and dead bodies with key players and leading experts on the robbery.      Last Seen offers unprecedented access to many of the key players involved in the case including:      • Richard Abath, the night watchman who let in the robbers who were disguised as policemen;      • A first-ever interview with the second security guard on duty the night of the heist;      • Anthony Amore, the Gardner Museum’s chief investigator for the past 12 years;      • Shelley Murphy, renowned Boston Globe investigative journalist and co-author of “Whitey Bulger: America’s Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice;”      • Brian Kelly, former assistant US attorney who oversaw the investigation for a decade;      • David Nadolski, a former FBI agent who ran the robbery task force and had the infamous Anthony Romano as an informant;      • Myles Connor, lifelong thief, suspect, would be rock star and Mensa member; and      • the lawyers and family members of numerous suspects.      Last Seen, a 10-episode series, will launch on September 17, 2018 with new weekly episodes available every Monday to stream or download on Apple Podcasts. The podcast, along with supporting documentation, photographs and additional reporting will be online at bostonglobe.com and wbur.org/lastseen—users can also subscribe to be notified when the podcast becomes available. ||||| Rembrandt’s “The Storm on the Sea of Galilee” was one of the paintings stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990.

Police said Behr and another skier fell when they “inadvertently” collided on Wagner Trail, near the main lodge.      Police said Behr sustained injuries to his face and neck and initially was treated at the scene.      He was taken to the Ski Patrol's medical office, where emergency medical technicians continued to tend to his injuries.      Behr was the former longtime president of Delmont Area Athletic Association.      Sean Susick, vice president of baseball for the association, said Behr used his knowledge of the construction industry to help improve its facilities. He credited Behr with coordinating major improvements to its concession stand.      “He got things done,” Susick said.      “He really did so much for the community,” Susick said. “It's shocking and disturbing and upsetting that such a good guy went.”      Frank Musto, the association's president, could not be reached for comment Sunday.      The resort, in a prepared statement released to the media on Sunday, expressed its condolences to Behr's family.      “Our entire mountain family is deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred last evening,” resort officials said. “While we continue to work to uncover the details of how this occurred, our thoughts and prayers go out to this gentleman's family, friends and loved ones during this unspeakably difficult time.”      Police said an investigation is ongoing.

summarize: Philadelphia art dealer 'smuggled tonne of ivory'      Continue reading the main story Related Stories      An art dealer has been arrested and accused of smuggling a tonne of African ivory into the US for sale at his Philadelphia store.      Victor Gordon, 68, paid a conspirator to fly to Africa, purchase raw ivory and have it carved to his specifications, prosecutors said.      The conspirator dyed the carvings in order to make them appear old before smuggling them into the US, they said.      Traffic in ivory is tightly restricted under US and international law.      "It's safe to say dozens of elephants sit before you," Edward Grace, deputy chief of law enforcement for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, told reporters in Philadelphia.      There, officials displayed for reporters intricately carved whole tusks and smaller sculptures and figurines that agents had seized from Mr Gordon's shop and from his customers.      Elephants are protected under the 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Ivory more than 100 years old can be sold can be legally imported into the US.      "The amount of the elephant ivory allegedly plundered in this case is staggering and highlights the seriousness of the charged crimes," United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta Lynch said.      "We all have a responsibility to protect endangered species, both for their sake and for the sake of our own future generations."      Ms Lynch's office described the seizure of the ivory in the case as one of the largest in US history.      According to an indictment filed in federal court in New York, Mr Gordon paid an unidentified co-conspirator $32,000 (£19,500) to undertake several trips to purchase "raw" ivory in central and west Africa between May 2006 and April 2009.      The co-conspirator had the ivory carved and stained to disguise its newness, then smuggled it into the US through JFK International Airport in New York.      It was then delivered to Mr Gordon's retail store in Philadelphia, according to the indictment.      In April 2009, federal fish and wildlife officers seized hundreds of ivory tusks and carvings from Mr Gordon's shop in Philadelphia.      As the investigation progressed over the next year-and-a-half, agents seized more pieces from his customers in the states of New York, Kansas, California and Missouri.      Mr Gordon was arrested on Tuesday and charged with 10 counts of violating US anti-ivory smuggling laws, including statutes aimed at protecting endangered species and enforcing the CITES.      If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. ||||| The store's name is Victor Gordon Enterprises, at 31 N. 3rd Street in Old City. It was closed this afternoon, with the lights off and the pull-down security gate lowered/locked in place.            In the store's windows are various African sculptures and masks. Also in the windows, 2 signs that say "The Most Unusual Store in Philadelphia"            *Mark Jones, a Philadelphia Parking Authority employee who tickets the area around Gordon's store, said he's ticketed some suspicious cars that were illegally parked outside the shop over the past 3-4 years. "They're always out of state plates, and they come in cars, not delivery vans or trucks. They make the deliveries around the back of the store, instead of through the front door." Legitimate delivery services would know to park legally, especially after receiving a ticket the first time, he added.            "He's an odd bird, just a little peculiar," said Vince Horne, 35, who's works in Strands Hair Salon next door for 11 years. He walks up and down the street often, Horne said, but most people try to avoid conversation with him |||||	– Tusks from large numbers of elephants killed by poachers in west and central Africa ended up in the hands of a Philadelphia art dealer, federal investigators say. The dealer is accused of paying a co-conspirator to travel to Africa, buy raw ivory for carving, and stain it so the specimens looked much older than they were, the BBC reports. Hundreds of carvings and scores of tusks, amounting to more than a ton of ivory worth at least $1 million, were seized from the dealer and his customers, notes the Philadelphia Inquirer. "It's safe to say dozens of elephants sit before you," a federal agent said as the haul, one of the biggest in US history, was displayed to reporters. The dealer has been charged with 10 counts of violating anti-ivory smuggling laws, and faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.

(Associated Press)      CORRECTS AGE TO 88 - FILE - In this June 25, 2008 file photo, author Tom Wolfe arrives to a special screening of "Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson" in New York. Wolfe died at a New York City hospital. He was 88. Additional details were not immediately available. (AP Photo/Peter Kramer,... (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — Tom Wolfe, the white-suited wizard of "New Journalism" who exuberantly chronicled American culture from the Merry Pranksters through the space race before turning his satiric wit to such novels as "The Bonfire of the Vanities" and "A Man in Full," has died. He was 88.      Wolfe's literary agent, Lynn Nesbit, told The Associated Press that he died of an infection Monday in a New York City hospital. Further details were not immediately available.      An acolyte of French novelist Emile Zola and other authors of "realistic" fiction, the stylishly-attired Wolfe was an American maverick who insisted that the only way to tell a great story was to go out and report it. Along with Gay Talese, Truman Capote and Nora Ephron, he helped demonstrate that journalism could offer the kinds of literary pleasure found in books.      His hyperbolic, stylized writing work was a gleeful fusillade of exclamation points, italics and improbable words. An ingenious phrase maker, he helped brand such expressions as "radical chic" for rich liberals' fascination with revolutionaries; and the "Me" generation, defining the self-absorbed baby boomers of the 1970s.      Wolfe was both a literary upstart, sneering at the perceived stuffiness of the publishing establishment, and an old-school gentleman who went to the best schools and encouraged Michael Lewis and other younger writers. When attending promotional luncheons with fellow authors, he would make a point of reading their latest work.      "What I hope people know about him is that he was a sweet and generous man," Lewis, known for such books as "Moneyball" and "The Big Short," told the AP in an email Tuesday. "Not just a great writer but a great soul. He didn't just help me to become a writer. He did it with pleasure."      Wolfe scorned the reluctance of American writers to confront social issues and warned that self-absorption and master's programs would kill the novel. "So the doors close and the walls go up!" he wrote in his 1989 literary manifesto, "Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast." He was astonished that no author of his generation had written a sweeping, 19th century style novel about contemporary New York City, and ended up writing one himself, "The Bonfire of the Vanities."      His work broke countless rules but was grounded in old-school journalism, in an obsessive attention to detail that began with his first reporting job and endured for decades.      "Nothing fuels the imagination more than real facts do," Wolfe told the AP in 1999. "As the saying goes, 'You can't make this stuff up.'"      Wolfe's interests were vast, but his narratives had a common theme. Whether sending up the New York art world or hanging out with acid heads, Wolfe inevitably presented man as a status-seeking animal, concerned above all about the opinion of one's peers. Wolfe himself dressed for company — his trademark a pale three-piece suit, impossibly high shirt collar, two-tone shoes and a silk tie. And he acknowledged that he cared — very much — about his reputation.      "My contention is that status is on everybody's mind all of the time, whether they're conscious of it or not," Wolfe, who lived in a 12-room apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side, told the AP in 2012.      In 1978, Wolfe married Sheila Berger, art director of Harper's magazine. They had two children, Alexandra and Tommy.      He enjoyed the highest commercial and critical rewards. His literary honors included the American Book Award (now called the National Book Award) for "The Right Stuff" and a nomination for the National Book Critics Circle prize for "The Bonfire of the Vanities," one of the top 10 selling books of the 1980s. Its 1998 follow-up, "A Man in Full," was another best-seller and a National Book Award nominee. Wolfe satirized college misbehavior in "I Am Charlotte Simmons" and was still at it in his 80s with "Back to Blood," a sprawling, multicultural story of sex and honor set in Miami.      A panel of judges organized in 1999 by the Modern Library, a Random House imprint, picked "The Right Stuff" as No. 52 on its list of the century's 100 best English-language works of nonfiction. Another panel of experts, listing the best journalism of the century, cited Wolfe three times on its list of 100, for "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test," ''The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby" and "The Right Stuff."      Wolfe, the grandson of a Confederate rifleman, began his journalism career as a reporter at the Springfield (Massachusetts) Union in 1957. But it wasn't until the mid-1960s, while a magazine writer for New York and Esquire, that his work made him a national trendsetter. As Wolfe helped define it, the "new journalism" combined the emotional impact of a novel, the analysis of the best essays, and the factual foundation of hard reporting. He mingled it all in an over-the-top style that made life itself seem like one spectacular headline.      "She is gorgeous in the most outrageous way," he wrote in a typical piece, describing actress-socialite Baby Jane Holzer.      "Her hair rises up from her head in a huge hairy corona, a huge tan mane around a narrow face and two eyes opened — swock! — like umbrellas, with all that hair flowing down over a coat made of ... zebra! Those motherless stripes!"      Wolfe traveled during the '60s with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters for his book on the psychedelic culture, "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test." One of his best-known magazine pieces, "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's," took a pointed look at fund-raising for the Black Panther Party by Leonard Bernstein and other wealthy whites. And no one more memorably captured the beauty-and-the-beast divide between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones: "The Beatles want to hold your hand," he wrote, "but the Rolling Stones want to burn down your town!"      Wolfe had many detractors — including fellow writers Norman Mailer and John Updike and the critic James Wood, who panned Wolfe's "big subjects, big people, and yards of flapping exaggeration. No one of average size emerges from his shop; in fact, no real human variety can be found in his fiction, because everyone has the same enormous excitability."      But his fans included millions of book-buyers, literary critics and fellow authors.      "He knows everything," novelist Kurt Vonnegut once wrote of Wolfe. "... I wish he had headed the Warren Commission. We might then have caught a glimpse of our nation."      Thomas Kennerly Wolfe Jr. was born in Richmond, Virginia. As a child, he did rewrites of the Authurian legends and penned biographies of his heroes. He became co-editor of his high school newspaper before moving on to Washington and Lee University, where he graduated with honors and was remembered by fellow student, the novelist Tom Robbins, as holding the very highest status: the big man on campus.      Wolfe had an unsuccessful pitching tryout with the New York Giants before heading to Yale University, from which he earned a Ph.D. in American studies. His career didn't immediately take off; Wolfe once took The Associated Press writing test and "dismally failed," he later recounted, noting that he was faulted for embellishing the test material, a primal sin at the AP.      But in 1957, he joined the Springfield paper and instantly fell in love with journalism. Two years later he jumped to The Washington Post, where he won Washington Newspaper Guild awards in 1960 for his coverage of U.S.-Cuban affairs and a satiric account of that year's Senate civil rights filibuster.      New York was his dream and by 1962 he was working at the now defunct New York Herald-Tribune, with colleagues including Jimmy Breslin and Charles Portis, who later wrote the novel "True Grit." The next year, Wolfe was assigned to cover a "Hot Rod & Custom Car" show. He completed a story, the kind "any of the somnambulistic totem newspapers in America would have come up with."      But he knew there was a much richer, and longer story to tell, one about a thriving subculture that captured the post-World War II economic boom and the new freedom to "build monuments" to one's own style. No newspaper could contain what Wolfe had in mind, so he turned to Esquire magazine, wrote up 49 pages and helped give birth to a new kind of reporter.      "For the who-what-where-when-why of traditional journalism, he has substituted what he calls 'the wowie!'" according to a 1965 Newsweek story.      That same year, his first book appeared: "The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby," a collection of 23 Wolfe articles that included the title piece, his seminal work on custom cars. In 1968, another collection — "The Pump-House Gang" — appeared, as did his book on the Pranksters.      It wasn't until the early '80s that Wolfe turned his attention to fiction. His topic: New York City in the late 20th century, a melange of sexual tension, class struggles and racial animus. "The Bonfire of the Vanities" first appeared as a serial in "Rolling Stone" magazine in 1984-85, with Wolfe writing the book one chapter at a time. When it was released as a novel in 1987, "Bonfire" became an immediate sensation even as it was criticized for its portrayal of blacks. One black character, the publicity-seeking Reverend Bacon, was based on a then-little known Al Sharpton. But a film version starring Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis was so disastrous that it inspired a nonfiction account of the wreckage, Julie Salomon's "The Devil's Candy."      "A Man in Full" turned Wolfe's smirk to Atlanta society. His 2004 novel, "I Am Charlotte Simmons," looked at life on a fictional elite college campus rife with drinking, status obsession and sex. The book received poor reviews and was a commercial disappointment, leading Wolfe to switch publishers in 2008 from Farrar, Straus & Giroux — where he had been for 40 years — to Little, Brown and Company. Other recent works, including the nonfiction "The Kingdom of Speech," were not well received. But he was never without ideas for future projects.      "There are still so many things I don't know about the city and I'd just like to see what's out there," he told the AP in 2012. "The Latin American population has increased enormously since 'Bonfire' and Wall Street has changed enormously. I'll follow my usual technique of just taking in a scene and seeing what happens."      ____      Former Associated Press writer Larry McShane contributed to this report. ||||| Tom Wolfe, an innovative journalist and novelist whose technicolor, wildly punctuated prose brought to life the worlds of California surfers, car customizers, astronauts and Manhattans moneyed status-seekers in works like “The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,” “The Right Stuff” and “Bonfire of the Vanities,” died on Monday in a Manhattan hospital. He was 87.      His death was confirmed by his agent, Lynn Nesbit, who said Mr. Wolfe had been hospitalized with an infection. He had lived in New York since joining The New York Herald Tribune as a reporter in 1962.      In his use of novelistic techniques in his nonfiction, Mr. Wolfe, beginning in the 1960s, helped create the enormously influential hybrid known as the New Journalism.      But as an unabashed contrarian, he was almost as well known for his attire as his satire. He was instantly recognizable as he strolled down Madison Avenue — a tall, slender, blue-eyed, still-boyish-looking man in his spotless three-piece vanilla bespoke suit, pinstriped silk shirt with a starched white high collar, bright handkerchief peeking from his breast pocket, watch on a fob, faux spats and white shoes. Once asked to describe his get-up, Mr. Wolfe replied brightly, “Neo-pretentious.” |||||	– Tom Wolfe, author of works including The Right Stuff, the Bonfire of the Vanities, and A Man in Full has died in Manhattan at age 88, reports the New York Times. The cause of death was unclear, but Wolfe had been recently hospitalized for an infection. In addition to his works of fiction, Wolfe became known as a pioneer in the field known as New Journalism, in which he employed "novelistic techniques" in nonfiction pieces, reports the Times. An acolyte of French novelist Emile Zola and other authors of "realistic" fiction, the stylishly attired Wolfe was an American maverick who insisted that the only way to tell a great story was to go out and report it, per the AP. Along with Gay Talese, Truman Capote, and Nora Ephron, he helped demonstrate that journalism could offer the kinds of literary pleasure found in books. Wolfe's hyperbolic, stylized writing work was a gleeful fusillade of exclamation points, italics, and improbable words. An ingenious phrase maker, he helped brand such expressions as "radical chic" for rich liberals' fascination with revolutionaries; and the "Me" generation, defining the self-absorbed baby boomers of the 1970s. One panel of experts, listing the best journalism of the century, cited Wolfe three times on its list of 100, for The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, and The Right Stuff. Whether sending up the New York art world or hanging out with acid heads, Wolfe inevitably presented man as a status-seeking animal, concerned above all about the opinion of one's peers. "My contention is that status is on everybody's mind all of the time, whether they're conscious of it or not," Wolfe said in 2012.

Sarah Palin, poses for a photograph at the home he's renting next to Palin's home in Wasilla,... (Associated Press)      Whether insisting on the guilt of a murder suspect after seemingly befriending him or moving next door to Sarah Palin's house for a most unauthorized biography, McGinniss was unique in his determination to get the most inside information, in how publicly he burned bridges with his subjects and how memorably he placed himself in the narrative.      McGinniss, the adventurous and news-making author and reporter who skewered the marketing of Richard Nixon in "The Selling of the President 1968" and tracked his personal journey from sympathizer to scourge of convicted killer Jeffrey MacDonald in the blockbuster "Fatal Vision," died Monday at age 71.      McGinniss, who announced last year that he had been diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer, died from complications related to his disease. His attorney and longtime friend Dennis Holahan said he died at a hospital in Worcester, Mass. Optimistic almost to the end, he had for months posted regular updates on Facebook and Twitter, commenting on everything from foreign policy to his health.      The tall, talkative McGinniss had early dreams of becoming a sports reporter and wrote books about soccer, horse racing and travel. But he was best known for two works that became touchstones in their respective genres — campaign books ("The Selling of the President") and true crime ("Fatal Vision"). In both cases, he had become fascinated by the difference between public image and private reality.      McGinniss was a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1968 when an advertising man told him he was joining Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign. Intrigued that candidates had advertising teams, McGinniss was inspired to write a book and tried to get access to Humphrey. The Democrat turned him down, but, according to McGinniss, Nixon aide Leonard Garment allowed him in, one of the last times the ever-suspicious Nixon would permit a journalist so much time around him. Garment and other Nixon aides were apparently unaware, or unconcerned, that McGinniss' heart was very much with the anti-war agitators the candidate so despised.      The Republican's victory that fall capped a once-unthinkable comeback for the former vice president, who had declared six years earlier that he was through with politics. Having lost the 1960 election in part because of his pale, sweaty appearance during his first debate with John F. Kennedy and aware of his reputation as a partisan willing to play dirty, Nixon had restricted his public outings and presented himself as a new and more mature candidate.      McGinniss was far from the only writer to notice Nixon's reinvention, but few offered such raw and unflattering details. "The Selling of the President" was a sneering rebuttal to Theodore H. White's stately "Making of the President" campaign books. It revealed Nixon aides, including Roger Ailes, disparaging vice presidential candidate Spiro Agnew, drafting memos on how to fix Nixon's "cold" image and debating which black man — only one would be permitted — was right for participating in a televised panel discussion.      Historian David Greenberg wrote in "Nixon's Shadow," published in 2003, that McGinniss "sneaked in under the radar screen, presenting himself to Nixon's men as such an insignificant fly on the wall that they never thought to swat him away."      "If White was the voice of the liberal consensus, with its sonorous even-keeled wisdom," Greenberg wrote, "McGinniss was an emissary from the New Journalism, with his countercultural accents, youthful iconoclasm, and nonchalant willingness to bare his left-leaning political views."      "The Selling of the President" was published in 1969, spent months on The New York Times' best-seller list and made McGinniss an eager media star. He quit the Inquirer and followed more personal interests. He wrote a novel, "The Dream Team," and the idiosyncratic "Heroes," a memoir that told of the breakup of his first marriage and romance with his eventual second wife, Nancy Doherty, and his failed quest for role models, among them author William Styron and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy.      In 1979, he was a columnist for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner when an argument without end was born: McGinniss was approached by MacDonald, a fellow California resident, about a possible book on the 1970 killings for which the physician and former Green Beret was being charged.      In the early hours of Feb. 17, 1970, MacDonald's pregnant wife and two small children were stabbed and beaten to death at the family's home in Fort Bragg, N.C. The date, location and identities of the victims are virtually the only facts of the case not in dispute.      MacDonald, who sustained a punctured lung and minor injuries, had insisted that the house was overrun by a gang of drug-crazed hippies that chanted slogans such as "Acid is groovy" and spelled "PIG" in blood on a bedroom wall, a murderous rampage seemingly inspired by the then-recent Charles Manson killings.      But investigators suspected otherwise, believing that MacDonald killed his family and arranged the apartment to make it appear others had committed the crime. MacDonald was initially cleared of charges, then indicted, then finally brought to trial in 1979. He was found guilty and sentenced to three consecutive life terms.      "Fatal Vision," published in 1983, became one of the most widely read and contested true crime books. McGinniss wrote not just of the case but of his own conclusions. He had at first found MacDonald charming and sincere but came to believe he was a sociopath who'd committed the killings while in a frenzied state brought on by diet pills.      McGinniss' findings weren't welcomed by MacDonald or by some fellow journalists. MacDonald sued in 1987, alleging McGinniss had tricked him by pretending to believe in his innocence, and he received an out-of-court settlement of $325,000. New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm cited McGinniss as a prime case of the reporter as a "kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance, or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse."      McGinniss wrote in his defense: "The attempt to manipulate through 'cons and lies' was — it seems clear to me now in retrospect — something Jeffrey MacDonald engaged in with me. Appearance of the book was forceful proof he had not succeeded."      While MacDonald remained in prison, insisting on his innocence, the case was revisited in books, essays and opinion pieces. Jerry Allen Potter and Fred Bost defended MacDonald in "Fatal Justice," published in 1997. Filmmaker Errol Morris, a MacDonald backer, came out with the book "A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald" in 2012.      McGinniss hoped to have the last word with the e-book "Final Vision."      "Jeffrey MacDonald was convicted of the murders of his wife and two young daughters in 1979," McGinniss said in 2012. "In all the years since, every court that has considered the case — including the United States Supreme Court — has upheld that verdict in every respect. MacDonald is guilty not simply beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt."      McGinniss, who had been working on a book about his illness, wrote openly about his personal and professional follies and setbacks, whether cheating on his first wife or helping himself to the gourmet crabmeat in Styron's kitchen. He struggled financially at times and battled depression and alcohol abuse. A 1993 biography of Sen. Kennedy, "The Last Brother," was widely ridiculed for including invented dialogue.      None of his latter books approached the popularity of "Fatal Vision" or such other crime works as "Cruel Doubt" and "Blind Faith." He returned a $1 million advance to write a book on the O.J. Simpson murder trial, expressing disgust that the former football star had been acquitted.      But by the 21st century he had cleaned himself up. He was an enthusiastic commentator on Facebook, posting regular updates about his health and current events. And he was back in the news, if not on the best-seller lists, with a biography of Palin, "The Rogue," which failed to sell many copies despite allegations of drug use and a premarital fling Palin had with basketball star Glen Rice. The real headlines were in the reporting: Anxious for a close look into Palin's world, McGinniss scored a front-row seat when he rented a house next door to her in Wasilla, Alaska.      "At first, Sarah will probably be less than thrilled to learn I'm here," McGinniss wrote in the 2011 book's introduction. "And who can blame her? Nonetheless, once she understands that I'm not here to hassle her, or to invade her family's privacy in any way, maybe we can become, if not friends, then at least reasonably cordial summer neighbors." ||||| “Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible,” the essay, published in 1990 as a book, “The Journalist and the Murderer,” began.      Dr. MacDonald has maintained his innocence — in 2012 he was granted a hearing to determine if new evidence warranted a new trial — and his claims have drawn others to criticize Mr. McGinniss, most notably the writer and filmmaker Errol Morris. His 2012 book, “The Wilderness of Error,” re-reports the MacDonald case and castigates Mr. McGinniss.      Mr. McGinniss wrote lengthy defenses of his own book, his techniques and his integrity. “As I see it, what really happened was that from the moment he first laid eyes upon me, MacDonald tried to con me, and through me — as, later, through Janet Malcolm — the public,” Mr. McGinniss wrote in an epilogue to “Fatal Vision” published in 1989.      Joseph McGinniss was born on Dec. 9, 1942, in Manhattan. The only child of Joseph A. McGinniss, who ran a travel agency, and the former Mary Leonard, who worked as a secretary for CBS, he grew up in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens and in Rye, N.Y. At a young age, his wife said, he was offered the chance to choose a middle name, and he chose Ralph, after the baseball star Ralph Kiner. He attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains and College of the Holy Cross in Worcester. When he was not admitted to the graduate school in journalism at Columbia — “which he wound up feeling very proud about,” his wife said — he went to work for The Worcester Telegram. He later wrote sports for The Philadelphia Bulletin before joining The Inquirer.      Mr. McGinniss’s first marriage, to Christine Cooke, ended in divorce. He is survived by their three children, Suzanne Boyer, Christine Marque and Joseph Jr.; by Ms. Doherty, whom he married in 1976; their two sons, Matthew and James; and seven grandchildren.      Mr. McGinniss was the author of several well-received books that provoked considerably less controversy. Among them was “Going to Extremes” (1980), about the unique geography, politics and people of Alaska (a copy of which, in a friendly overture, he gave to the Palin family), and “The Miracle of Castel di Sangro” (1999), about a soccer team in an Italian village. Two other books were about gruesome crimes: “Blind Faith” (1989) about a New Jersey man who had hired hit men to kill his wife; and “Cruel Doubt” (1991), about a murder contrived by teenagers in emulation of the role-playing game “Dungeons and Dragons.” All three of Mr. McGinniss’s crime books, including “Fatal Vision,” were made into television mini-series.      A gregarious man who was generous with other writers, Mr. McGinniss taught for a time at Bennington College, where his students included the novelists Bret Easton Ellis and Donna Tartt. Fond of telling stories, at his death he was working on a memoir. |||||	– Joe McGinniss, the bestselling author of books that ranged from politics to true crime, and more recently the provocateur behind the most famous fence in Wasilla, has died at the age of 71. McGinniss announced last year that he'd been diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer; he died yesterday in Massachusetts from its complications, reports the AP. McGinniss came to fame at age 26, notes the New York Times, when he published The Selling of the President, his account of Richard Nixon's 1969 campaign. "McGinniss was an emissary from the New Journalism," wrote historian David Greenberg, "with his countercultural accents, youthful iconoclasm, and nonchalant willingness to bare his left-leaning political views." McGinniss authored other books and worked as a newspaper columnist, but cemented his legacy with 1983's Fatal Vision, his controversial account of the murders of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald's pregnant wife and two children. McGinniss, who was initially invited to chronicle the trial by MacDonald himself, eventually came to believe MacDonald was guilty and inserted himself blatantly into his own narrative; MacDonald was convicted, but eventually sued McGinniss successfully. In 2011, he authored The Rogue, his very unauthorized biography of Sarah Palin. That tome scored more headlines for McGinniss' antics than any bombshells he dropped.
summarize: Woman thrown in jail after calling 9-1-1 four times over bad manicure      My Fox Orlando Cynthia Colston was arrested after dialing 911 four times over a bad manicure.      A fight over a bad manicure landed one Florida woman in jail after she called 911 four times.      Cynthia Colston told My Fox Orlando that she called after the nail technician became aggressive with her when she refused to pay as much as the store was charging for nails that she said were too short.            When a deputy came, she said he was entirely unhelpful and called the emergency line again because she found him unhelpful when he told her she could not file charges.            That time, she said, she told the dispatcher that it was a non-emergency call and she just wanted to see what else could be done for her situation.            That, according to authorities, is not a good reason to tie up the emergency phone line.            "She was trying to get a non-emergency number and yet there was a deputy standing right there with her," a Volusia County official told the television station.      Colston was arrested after she called the line two more times -- which she said she accidentally dialed because she was dialing with her knuckles.            But that was enough for authorities to arrest Colston on charges of misues of the 911 system.            "Day after Christmas, I'm in jail," she told a reporter, shaking her head.            A Volusia County official told My Fox Orlando that their problem with Colston's use of the system was that there was a deputy standing right next to her who could help her with whatever she was calling the emergency line about.            As for her nails, Colston will have to go someplace else to get them redone.            "I had to take them off when I was in jail," she said, laughing.            nmandell@nydailynews.com ||||| Man charged with killing, burying father Authorities say a 40-year-old man killed his father and buried him in their yard…      'Tebow' nabs suspected drug smuggler It's more heroics for Tebow as police said he sniffed out more than a kilo of …      Woman arrested Kissimmee home invasion A woman has been arrested in connection with a home invasion in Kissimmee.

ESPN Radio 100.1 WFAY Fayetteville is dropping Saturday’s game in what the parent company’s CEO calls a “protest to the protest.”      In a statement shared below by WTVD sports anchor Mark Armstrong, Colonial Media CEO Jeff Andrulonis called the protests “shameful,” and said “a message needs to be sent.”      This is something else – ESPN Fayetteville radio won't carry ECU-USF because of the band protest pic.twitter.com/2UwHgkfZBZ — Mark Armstrong (@ArmstrongABC11) October 4, 2016      “(R)oughly a dozen band members disgraced themselves on the football field this past weekend,” Andrulonis said. “I’m proud of our country and I’m proud of our soldiers.”      Andrulonis claims to have unanimous support from station sponsors on the move, though he hasn’t spoken to all of them yet.      “They’re college students and it’s about time they get an education on the concept that their actions have consequences,” Andrulonis said. “And the consequence in this case is that the ECU Pirates will not be heard on ESPN Fayetteville this weekend.”      The “protest to the protest” is only scheduled to last for one week. The station currently plans to carry next week’s East Carolina game.

Here is the statement provided by Colonial Media:      This is something else – ESPN Fayetteville radio won't carry ECU-USF because of the band protest pic.twitter.com/2UwHgkfZBZ — Mark Armstrong (@ArmstrongABC11) October 4, 2016      Company Chairman and CEO Jeff Andrulonis took exception to the protests, which began earlier this year when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick used the anthem as a way of protesting police killings of African Americans. Andrulonis apparently believed the protest was against the United States military, saying “I’m proud of our country and I’m proud of our soldiers … especially our soldiers from Fort Bragg… fighting for our country so I’ve decided that ESPN Fayetteville will ‘protest the protest.'”      Later, Andrulonis says “The band members could have quietly protested in the early morning hours before the game. But that would have required them to wake up early.”      A few things. One, punishing the band members by not airing the game on radio is a pretty weird punishment because, you know, they’re at the game. They don’t need the radio.      Second, taking a knee to protest police killings has nothing to do with soldiers, at Fort Bragg or otherwise. No one is protesting them.      Third, “quietly” protesting “in the early morning hours” wouldn’t be much of a protest, would it? The point of a protest is to force people to confront an idea that they don’t want to confront, as its clear Andrulonis really, really doesn’t want to confront this idea that police kill African Americans at a disproportionately high rate in this country. This has nothing to do with band members waking up early (which also, what?), this has to do with a scared dude making a grand, ultimately impotent gesture rather than confront something that makes him uncomfortable.      Sorry, football-loving radio listeners of Fayetteville. You are the ones paying the cost this week. |||||	– In what its parent company's CEO is calling a "protest to a protest," ESPN affiliate radio station 101.1 FM (WFAY) is turning its back on broadcasting East Carolina University's football game Saturday against South Florida after members of the ECU marching band took a knee during the national anthem last weekend to protest oppression of black people, Mediaite reports. "Roughly a dozen band members disgraced themselves on the football field this past weekend," Jeff Andrulonis, head of parent company Colonial Media, said in a statement shared by a local sports anchor. "They're college students and it's about time they get an education on the concept that their actions have consequences." Andrulonis claims that every ECU football sponsor he's spoken to so far thinks the band's protest that continued what Colin Kaepernick began was "shameful" and that "a message needs to be sent." He also says he supports the band members' constitutional right to free speech and that they could've protested before the game, "but that would have required them to wake up early." ESPN has responded to the incident in a statement sent to Sports Illustrated, noting, "100.1 FM is an affiliate that carries some ESPN Radio national programming. Local programming decisions, however, are strictly in their purview." (For the Win calls the refusal "ridiculous.")
summarize: Exxon says it will begin offering benefits to legally married same-sex couples in the U.S. for the first time as of Oct. 1.      The company says it will recognize "all legal marriages" when it determines eligibility for health care plans for the company's 77,000 employees and retirees in the U.S.      That means if a gay employee has been married in a state or country where gay marriage is legal, his or her spouse will be eligible for benefits with Exxon starting next year.      Exxon Mobil Corp., which is facing a same-sex discrimination lawsuit in Illinois, said Friday it was following the lead of the U.S. government. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted in other states. And in recent months, federal agencies have begun to offer benefits to legally-married same sex couples.      "We haven't changed our eligibility criteria. It has always been to follow the federal definition and it will continue to follow the federal definition," said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers in an interview. ||||| A state court judge said in a ruling Friday that same-sex couples must be allowed to marry in New Jersey, and that the rights given to them under the state's civil unions law are not equal to federal benefits now granted to married gay couples.

Judge Mary Jacobson granted a summary judgment requested by Garden State Equality, which had claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of the federal Defense of Marriage Act meant that same-sex couples in civil unions in New Jersey were being denied equal protection.

summarize: When they finally had overrun Moammar Kadafi 's vast fortress and crushed the illusion that he still ruled them, euphoric rebels hunted down symbols of the power Libya's leader had held over nearly every aspect of their lives.They torched the Bedouin tent where Kadafi famously met with dignitaries and journalists. They drove around in one of the golf carts in which he navigated the compound. They mocked him by trying on a cheap plastic military hat that he might have worn in photos and on television.Rebel fighters converging onTripoli from several directions burst Tuesday into the Bab Azizia compound, where Kadafi had once lived and ruled. Neither he nor his most high-profile son was there, but the triumph at Bab Azizia all but marked the end of the aging leader's nearly 42 years in power.The fast-moving rebel takeover plunged Tripoli into chaos, with celebratory fire from automatic weapons and even antiaircraft weaponry lighting up the sky late into the night. At midnight, crowds still were gathered in the capital's Martyrs' Square, renamed since the rebels captured it Sunday.Drivers leaned on their horns and the city's mosques echoed with calls in praise of God. The red, black and green rebel flag flew over Bab Azizia, which President Reagan bombed in 1986."There is no fear anymore," said Khaled Azwam, a man in his 30s, who sat in his car with his wife and two sleeping children. They were waiting for things to quiet down so they could return home safely. "Kadafi is almost gone."The heavy fighting in recent days has taken a toll on the city's civilians. Dr. Fathi Arabi, an orthopedist at Tripoli's Central Hospital, reported between 50 and 100 dead and hundreds wounded at his facility alone by Tuesday afternoon.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization , whose campaign of airstrikes has greatly aided the rebels, reported continued heavy resistance from Kadafi loyalists in a long stretch of the Mediterranean coast. They said Kadafi's forces fired another Scud missile late Monday toward rebel forces, but it did not appear to cause any casualties. Along the front line in easternLibya, NATO said its forces destroyed two rocket launchers that were firing into rebel-held territory.The explosion of people power showed Libyans' rage at a regime that made them subject to Kadafi's whim. But it also exposed challenges for both the Transitional National Council , the rebel authority in the eastern city of Benghazi, and Western officials who conducted a bombing campaign that greatly assisted the rebel cause.Evidence of lawlessness was pervasive. Young men armed with assault rifles staffed checkpoints — part of a whole class of newly armed men who may not be willing to hand their weapons over to the authorities.Though the rebels apparently defeated Kadafi, many wonder whether they will be able to provide security despite rebel leaders' blithe assurances that fighters have been trained to protect facilities. Libya's future leaders must quickly decide what to do with the both the rebel fighters and the regular armed forces.Many of the best Libyan fighters are from the Nafusa Mountains in the west, and they are largely Berber. Their recent advances appeared to have made the decisive difference in the nearly six-month conflict. They probably will demand a greater say in the future of Libya, including language rights that may rankle the country's Arab majority.It remains unclear how many Libyans genuinely supported Kadafi. "You're not welcome here," one man said as he glared at a pair of Western journalists, yelling an obscenity.Though many of the rebels complain that Kadafi squandered and stole the country's vast oil wealth, oil production ground to a halt during the conflict, and the national economy with it. U.S. and European countries said Tuesday that they were preparing to remove a freeze on billions of dollars in Libyan assets to help rebel authorities restart the economy.Rebel spokesmen in Benghazi said the Transitional National Council would move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli this week.Kadafi's whereabouts remained a mystery, and it was unclear why his forces appeared to give way Tuesday. Just hours earlier, his son and onetime heir apparent, Seif Islam, appeared at a hotel still controlled by Kadafi loyalists to prove to Western journalists that he had not been captured, as the rebels had claimed.Kadafi is a master operator, who has throughout his career been a coup plotter, a terrorist mastermind, an opportunist and, to the disdain of his fellow Libyans, the Brother Leader, a title he bestowed upon himself as he spread his image across villages and cities.In a local radio broadcast, Kadafi said he had made a tactical withdrawal from his compound, which he accused NATO of leveling with airstrikes. He vowed to fight to the death. His last audio broadcast had been Sunday. He was rumored to have moved to his tribal stronghold of Surt farther east along the Mediterranean, or perhaps to a hiding place along the border with Chad or Algeria. Or perhaps he was on his way to Venezuela. A longtime acquaintance in Russia said he had received a short telephone call in which Kadafi said he was still in Tripoli. ||||| A large, half-packed suitcase on the floor of Salem Farhani's house showed just how fast he and his family bolted from their home — which had the bad fortune to be located within Moammar Kadafi 's Bab Azizia compound.Inside the once-feared residential and leadership complex, the base that allowed Kadafi and his most trusted lieutenants to menace this country of 6 million for decades, rebels and ordinary Libyans pillaged and plundered. Some were rummaging through Farhani's home in search of valuables, others were snatching the thousands of weapons and ammunition stashed throughout the area.A band of rebels climbed to the balcony of the main building to hang the red, black and green flag that predated the strongman. Then they peered out onto a grassy field, as Kadafi would, and even modeled garish military hats found inside that the Brother Leader might have worn.And all the while, exuberant Libyans flowing throughout the compound grabbed whatever they could."The money of the Libyan people is now going to the Libyan people," said Mohammad Manjoub, a 40-year-old bank employee making off with an electric space heater, a satellite receiver and a massive dagger from the homes of now-vanished regime loyalists.For decades, Libyans could only imagine what it was like behind the heavily fortified walls and green gate of Bab Azizia. Sure, they caught glimpses when adoring supporters would be bused in to show adulation during speeches Kadafi would deliver from the balcony of the palace-turned-museum that President Reagan bombed in a 1986 airstrike.But few ordinary Libyans had an inkling of what went on inside the drab buildings and military barracks — until Tuesday. And after getting a close-up look at the place, they decided to take a lot of it home.One man made off with a print of a Koranic verse. He said he wanted to protect it from looters. Another carried a sword he had found in someone's home. A few were carefully trying to hot-wire Toyota Land Cruisers.Abdullah "Lucas" Mohammad, a 27-year-old engineer, commandeered all the printer cartridges he could find. "I'm a businessman," he said with a laugh.More than a few young men had an eye out for caches of guns, with some cradling as many as three assault rifles in their arms. The common refrain was that they intended to hand the weapons over to leaders of the interim government. But the potential disaster of the gun looting became apparent immediately, when a particularly choice cluster of assault weapons sparked a ferocious, if short, gun battle.Unlike Baghdad after the fall of Saddam Hussein , though, there were few, if any, reports of looting outside Bab Azizia."They are only stealing and looting Bab Azizia, not banks or even government institutions," said Mustafa Bahrouni, 25, a rebel supporter inside the compound who was sporting a new assault rifle. "We took things because, for 42 years, he took everything from us."Some rebels, however, preferred to bask in their status as fighters for a cause instead of being seen as soldiers enjoying the spoils of war.His fight against Kadafi over for now, Misurata native Addullah Hamid Ahmad took it upon himself to guard two foreign journalists as they made their way through the riotous compound."I was in this war for seven months," the 25-year-old physiotherapist said. "My uncle was killed. My sister was abducted. I don't want any more weapons." |||||	– Rebels and their supporters gleefully looted Moammar Gadhafi’s Bab Azizia compound in Tripoli today, celebrating the fall of the regime by making off with various valuables and weaponry from hastily abandoned homes. “The money of the Libyan people is now going to the Libyan people,” one bank employee told the LA Times, as he helped himself to a space heater, a satellite receiver, and a huge dagger. Other groups of rebels burned symbols of Gadhafi’s rule, like his famed Bedouin tents. Still others made for his weapons—a brief firefight broke out over one particularly enticing stash of assault rifles. But there were almost no reports of looting outside the complex. “They are only stealing and looting Bab Azizia, not banks or even government institutions,” pointed out one rebel supporter. “We took things because, for 42 years, he took everything from us.”
summarize: Richard Hatch, who managed to star in two Battlestar Galacticas, has passed away. He was 71.            The news broke on Bleeding Cool and was confirmed by TMZ.      Hatch began his television career in the 1970s, first appearing as Philip Brent in All My Children and following it up with roles in Hawaii Five-O, The Streets of San Francisco, and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. But the role we all associate with him came in 1976, when he starred in Battlestar Galactica as Captain Apollo. And even though he would never stop advocating for a proper continuation to that show, he almost didn’t take the part:      When I first got the original Battlestar script, I didn’t even want to do it. But the stupid part of it was, looking at the script with all the Ralph McQuarrie art, and seeing the character flying through the universe in one of those Vipers, the little boy in me wanting to fly through the stars ultimately said yes. When we watched the original Star Wars, didn’t we all fall in love with getting in those X-Wings? So when it comes down to it, it’s the little kid in us that usually wins out.      Advertisement      Hatch clearly felt deeply attached to that show. Even though it only lasted one season, Hatch tried to continue the show for years. In the late 1990s, Hatch made a 30-minute Battlestar Galactica movie called The Second Coming, and traveled with a trailer to drum up fan support and to convince Universal that a revival was viable. He continued to write novels in the original BSG universe.      And even though bringing back the original Battlestar Galactica universe and telling more stories there was always his goal, he managed to get over his disappointment in the existence of a reboot—which led to him playing Tom Zarek in the rebooted show. Instead of an unambiguous good guy pilot, Zarek was a convicted terrorist who emerged as a political foil for President Roslin throughout the show. Hatch played Zarek as smart, formidable, and very twisty.      As news broke of his death, people he worked with paid tribute on Twitter:      Advertisement      In 2009, Hatch said of his Battlestar Galactica experiences, “I’ve been lucky to be in two Battlestar series. Not too many people get to be in two series 30 years apart in a story that they love, working with actors, writers and producers that are just absolutely extraordinary. I had a great time.” ||||| Battlestar Galactica‘s Finale” width=”560″/>            The original Apollo, Richard Hatch discusses his role in the new Battlestar Galactica and the possibility that he’s the Final Cylon.      Q: Does the resurgent popularity of Battlestar ever surprise you?      A: It’s rare to get a really truly wonderfully written, acted and produced scifi show, period. Most remakes or re-imaginings turn out to be crap; the people that make them very rarely understand the fans or scifi. This is, honestly, a rarity. Despite the fact that it’s quite different in tone, it still has the heart of the original Battlestar at its core.      Q: You’ve been a proponent of making a continuation of the original series with the original cast. Would you still want that?      A: If it was viable and I was able to do it, I would love to. There’s a million ways to do Battlestar right. Tom DeSanto is a huge fan. He produced Transformers, X-Men, and his dying passion is to bring back the original Battlestar and do a continuation 30 years into the future. I would love to see that done, whether I was part of a production team or if I was asked to be in it as an actor.      Q: What was your reaction when Ronald Moore asked you to play Tom Zarek?      A: I have to sit down and talk to Ron — I want to find out if he created it with me in mind because it fits the formula perfectly. I had written all these scathing letters putting down the network for not listening to the fans who wanted to see a continuation. He e-mailed me and said, “Would you be open to coming in and discussing some options?” Ron said he had this Nelson Mandela-style revolutionary, and it was right up my alley. I love revolutionaries who have the courage to stand up against the status quo. They’re always misunderstood, but they’re the ones who are standing up for human rights.      Q: Now he’s a top candidate for the Final Cylon.      A: With Battlestar, nothing is what it seems. Because these writers always go in directions nobody ever thought of. But when you see it, you’ll go, “Oh of course!” It’s right below the surface, right in front of your face and yet most people miss it because they’re always looking for something far more complex. And yet the very thing that is the most logical, makes the most sense, is right in front of you. Really step out of the box and take a leap of faith; maybe you’ll come up with the right answer.      Q: Are you happy with the final episodes?      A: Ron was very smart — although I have to say I’m very sad because I think this show deserved at least another year or two — but SciFi almost canceled it last year, and I think the fear was that he didn’t want to go season to season. So he said, “OK, if you can’t give me a confirmation, I’m going to take one more year and wrap it up.” And that allowed him to write the stories he wanted and really tie up all the loose ends. This show should be on longer, but it is going to have probably one of the most powerful endings of any show I’ve ever seen.      Q: As the original Apollo, do you agree with the decision to take the new Apollo out of the cockpit?      RH: [Laughs]. You know something? Ehh. I think that because of the circumstance of life and death, even if he was taken out of the cockpit because there was something he felt a call to do, somehow, someway, the uniqueness should be that Apollo never gives up the cockpit. Once you’ve been in that place, it’s like a drug. When I first got the original Battlestar script, I didn’t even want to do it. But the stupid part of it was, looking at the script with all the Ralph McQuarrie art, and seeing the character flying through the universe in one of those Vipers, the little boy in me wanting to fly through the stars ultimately said yes. When we watched the original Star Wars, didn’t we all fall in love with getting in those X-Wings?
