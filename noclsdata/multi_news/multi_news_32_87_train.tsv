Bottled water, flashlights, batteries and other staples were flying off store shelves across Puerto Rico on Tuesday as nervous residents braced for the arrival of Hurricane Irma — already one of the strongest storms ever recorded and currently packing 185 mph winds.      The Category 5 storm was churning toward the Caribbean and expected to make landfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by Wednesday before sweeping across Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center warned.      Irma, which was heading westward at a speed of 15 mph, was expected to reach Florida later in the week and was already the same category storm as Hurricane Andrew, which devastated south Florida in 1992, killing 44 people and doing $25.5 billion in damage.      In Puerto Rico, there were already long lines at gas stations in Gurabo, a small city 45 minutes southeast of the capital San Juan that is predicted to be in the path of the monster storm.      Latest on the Storm      Destruction likely to begin in the northern Caribbean in less than 24 hours.      Puerto Rico's north shore will be in or very close to Irma's hurricane winds.      Florida's fate largely depends on if Cuba weakens Irma first.      All signs point to major or historic hurricane impact in South Florida this weekend.      Tourists ordered to evacuate the Florida Keys starting at sunrise Wednesday.      Miami Beach urges residents to prepare for possible evacuation.      Classes were canceled and schools were being stocked with supplies and starting to accept residents from low-lying areas who were heeding the warning of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello to "take Hurricane Harvey as a lesson" and evacuate their homes.      Flooding from Harvey claimed dozens of lives in Houston. Local police in Puerto Rico were going door-to-door in the most vulnerable areas to make sure there was no repeat there of the tragedies experienced in south Texas.      Rossello declared a state of emergency on Monday, activating the National Guard, canceling schools and freeing up $15 million in emergency funds for the financially troubled island, his office said in a statement.      The director of Puerto Rico's power company predicted that storm damage could leave some areas without electricity for four to six months. But "some areas will have power [back] in less than a week," Ricardo Ramos told radio station Notiuno 630 AM. The utility's infrastructure has deteriorated greatly during a decade-long recession, and Puerto Ricans experienced an island-wide outage last year.      Meanwhile, at the Ralph's supermarket in Gurabo, manager Angel Luis Rodriguez Velazquez was presiding over a packed store. Triple the usual number of customers were packing their shopping carts with bottled water, canned meats and other products, batteries and "first necessity products" like diapers.      "At this store, I've been working for seven years and it's the first time I see it like this during hurricane season," he told NBC News. "It been very fuerte [strong or difficult]."      Water bottles have been placed in front of partially empty shelves at Ralph's Supermarket in Gurabo, Puerto Rico, in preparations for Hurricane Irma, on Sept. 5, 2017. Mariela Santos / NBC News      Irma was upgraded to a "potentially catastrophic" hurricane earlier Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. And meteorologists warned the already dangerous hurricane could grow larger and stronger before it makes landfall.      "We had Patricia a couple years ago in the Pacific and that had over 200 mph winds," Dennis Feltgen, an NHC spokesman, told NBC News. "Irma is definitely in that elite group of super powerful storms."      Irma "is moving into waters that are warmer and [are] a very favorable environment for even further development," added Heather Tesch, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel.      NBC News meteorologist Sherri Pugh said Irma "will be a strong storm and doesn't have much opportunity to weaken."      "In the next 24 hours, I'm most concerned about the northern Leeward Islands and soon the Virgin Islands," Pugh said. The "storm surge is forecast to be 7 to 11 feet for most the U.S. and British Virgin Islands."      Irma, which was about 130 miles east of the island of Antigua as of 5 p.m. ET Tuesday, was also expected to dump anywhere from 4 inches to a foot of rain and generate life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, forecasters warned.      "This is not an opportunity to go outside and try to have fun with a hurricane," U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp warned. "It's not time to get on a surfboard."

Mariela Santos / NBC News      In Florida, all tourists vacationing on the low-lying Keys were ordered to evacuate starting at sunrise Wednesday.      "We value our visitors and want them to be safe,�? said Monroe County Administrator Roman Gastesi. “This is the reason why we need them to calmly leave the Keys with plenty of advance notice before the storm may reach our shores. We do hope they will return after the storm passes and we can reopen.�?      Gastesi said they also expect to issue a mandatory evacuation order for residents of the Florida Keys as well.      Related: Harvey's Toll Includes Ongoing Trauma Felt by Survivors      In Miami Beach, the city advised residents to "begin evacuation preparations" in anticipation of an evacuation order.      Earlier, Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced he was activating 100 members of the Florida Air and Army National Guard. He declared a state of emergency in all of the state's 67 counties, saying it was necessary for local governments to prepare immediately. And he asked President Donald Trump to approve an emergency declaration even before Irma makes landfall.      "Current forecast models have Florida in Irma's path — potentially impacting millions of Floridians," he said in a statement. "While the exact path of Irma is not absolutely known at this time, we cannot afford to not be prepared."      Florida's senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, urged Trump to approve Scott's request for an early emergency declaration "to ensure that full federal resources are made available."      "As we recently witnessed with Hurricane Harvey, preparation and up-front resources are paramount," the senators said in a statement.      Sunshine State residents appeared to be preparing for the worst.      Images posted to social media from Naples, in South Florida, and Temple Terrace, outside Tampa, and Delray Beach on the Atlantic Coast, showed bare store shelves as well.      "There's a drought in the water aisle and Home Depot is packed," NBC Miami reporter Ari Odzer joked on Twitter.      At a Home Depot in Royal Palm Beach, a sign alerted shoppers that it was short on wing nuts and 5-gallon jugs for gasoline and water.      A shopper there, David Graham, referenced Hurricane Harvey, which forced tens of thousands of people to flee to shelters and led to thousands of rescues. At least 48 deaths have been attributed to Harvey so far across six Texas counties.      Graham told NBC affiliate WPTV of West Palm Beach, "People are being more vigilant, I guess." ||||| (CNN) As Floridians cleared supermarkets of bottled water and emptied gas pumps, people in the northeastern Caribbean were making last minute-preparations before powerful Hurricane Irma hit their islands.      Late Tuesday, the massive Category 5 storm was almost upon islands like Antigua and Barbuda with near-record 185 mph sustained winds. In its 11 p.m. ET advisory, the US National Hurricane Center said the eye of the hurricane was 50 miles from the two islands.      The center of the storm was moving to the west-northwest at 15 mph.      The hurricane center said the extremely dangerous core of Irma would hit the northern Leeward Islands -- which include Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla -- Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.      It's too early to tell whether the storm will make landfall on the US mainland, but forecasts show it could turn toward Florida over the weekend.      Forecasters' most immediate concerns are for the people of the northeastern Caribbean, the hurricane center's Michael Brennan said.      "Anguilla, all the way toward (Antigua and) Barbuda, all the way up even toward the British Virgin Islands (are) in grave danger of an eye wall hit at (at least) 150 mph -- that devastates the island, no matter what island it is," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Tuesday.      Those islands are under hurricane warnings, as are Puerto Rico, the US and British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Martin/St. Maarten, and St. Barts.      One Twitter user in St. Barts posted a photo of rain coming down and winds beginning to sway the leaves of the palm trees Tuesday evening.      The hurricane center warned the storm is "potentially catastrophic," especially if the worst conditions hit islands at high tides.      Fishermen get boats out of water      Irma's forecast track currently has it near or over Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla by early Wednesday, and the British and US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday afternoon.      The Dominican Republic issued a hurricane warning Tuesday evening that included coastal cities from Cabo Engaño to the northern border with Haiti.      Preparations to protect life and property in those areas "should be rushed to completion," the hurricane center said in an 11 p.m. ET advisory.      These homes on Nikki Beach in St. Barts are deserted Tuesday ahead of Hurricane Irma.      "We could see storm surges of 7 to 11 feet -- that's certainly life-threatening -- and very, very heavy flooding rainfall" in the far northeastern Caribbean islands as well as winds that could cause catastrophic damage near the eye wall, Brennan said.      Hurricane warnings are issued to areas that are expected to experience hurricane-force winds (at least 74 mph).      JUST WATCHED Space station gets a look at Hurricane Irma Replay More Videos ...

The US Virgin Islands, with about 100,000 people, declared a state of emergency Tuesday and ordered the National Guard into active service.      John Klein, owner of White Bay Villas & Seaside Cottages on Jost Van Dyke island in the British Virgin Islands, told CNN they were rebooking the guests.      "We have backups for (our utilities), but in a storm of this magnitude it's not best for the guests to be there because they may get stuck," he said.      Computer models show the system possibly near the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday and Friday, and Cuba on Friday and Saturday -- and potentially turning north toward Florida by the weekend.      Puerto Rico: Long lines      Hundreds of people rushed to the stores, emptying shelves of food and drinking water just as Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard on Monday.      Crowds wait outside a store in Puerto Rico as Hurricane Irma nears.      For hours, people also lined up outside hardware stores hoping to get plywood, batteries and power generators. If Irma knocks out power, Puerto Ricans said they are worried it would take weeks or months before the power is restored.      "It (power) is something absolutely necessary, especially due to Puerto Rico's weather. We need to have the A/C or a fan on all night," a woman told CNN affiliate WAPA      Last month, the director of Puerto Rico's power utility, Ricardo Ramos Rodríguez, said several factors have made the island's electric system "vulnerable and fragile," WAPA reported.      One of those is the shortage of employees. Many workers recently retired or left their jobs for better prospects on the US mainland, Ramos Rodríguez said.      Public schools and officials at the University of Puerto Rico campuses have canceled classes, and many businesses are closed.      "Make a U-turn and die in the ocean, Irma. The Caribbean islands don't need more problems!" Twitter user mujertropical wrote about the storm.      Make a U-turn and die in the ocean, #Irma.

Miami-Dade County will start evacuating special-needs residents on Wednesday, and may announce other evacuations soon, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.      "I would rather inconvenience our residents" with evacuations than suffer loss of life, Gimenez said.      Schools and county offices are to be closed on Thursday and Friday.      And the state's Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys, said it will order visitors to evacuate by sunrise Wednesday , and residents should begin to evacuate 12 hours later.      In Florida, people were standing in lines at stores to buy water and other goods on Tuesday.      In Miami, supermarkets and other stores were already selling out of water and nonperishable food.      The @Publix on SW 27 Ave in #Miami is almost sold out of #water.

After declaring a state of emergency across Florida, Gov. Rick Scott said President Donald Trump had "offered the full resources of the federal government as Floridians prepare for Hurricane Irma."      White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert tweeted that the President had declared emergencies for Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.      Scott also ordered 7,000 National Guard troops to report for duty by Friday morning. Of those, 100 were activated Tuesday to begin helping with preparations, he said.      "I cannot stress this enough. Get prepared," Scott said at a news conference. "Learn your evacuation zone. Listen to your locals. This storm has the potential to devastate this state. You have to take this seriously."      Near-record winds      Irma has become one of the strongest storms recorded in the Atlantic, and is threatening to slam into Caribbean islands including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands with "potentially catastrophic" force on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said.      Irma was churning west Tuesday evening in the Atlantic with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph -- well above the 157 mph threshold for a Category 5 , the hurricane center said.      #Irma is only the 5th Atlantic basin hurricane with a peak wind speed of 185 mph or higher. pic.twitter.com/R3hZ2FG94b — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 5, 2017      The last storm with sustained winds that strong in the Atlantic was 2005's Hurricane Wilma , which weakened before it brushed Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, turned right and crossed Florida.

"Now is the time to prepare," Gonzalez said.      A tropical storm warning was issued for Dominca early Tuesday.      Hurricane watches in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra were changed to hurricane warnings late Monday. The government of Antigua also upgraded the hurricane watch for the British Virgin Islands to a hurricane warning.      Guadeloupe is under a hurricane watch.      The storm is about about 320 miles east of the Leeward Islands and hurricane-force winds are extending 45 miles out from the storm’s center.      As with previous advisories, the NHC warned that hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning areas by Tuesday night. |||||	– Hurricane Irma is now a Category 5 storm as it barrels toward Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. The National Hurricane Center, which describes Irma as a "dangerous major hurricane," says islands could start feeling hurricane conditions later Tuesday and it could make landfall in Anguilla early Wednesday, CNN reports. In Puerto Rico, a state of emergency has been declared and residents have been cleaning stores out of food and drinking water. Authorities warn the storm could generate waves 23 feet high. "This is not an opportunity to go outside and try to have fun with a hurricane," says US Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp. "It's not time to get on a surfboard." Meteorologists warn that Irma, which could dump up to 10 inches of rain on the area, is moving into warmer waters that are expected to give it added power, NBC News reports. The storm is expected to take a west-northwest turn on Tuesday night, putting it on course to potentially slam into Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency, the Miami Herald reports. Georgia and the Carolinas could also be at risk, says Evan Myers, chief operating officer of AccuWeather. Irma has the "potential to be a major event for the East Coast," he says. "It also has the potential to significantly strain FEMA and other governmental resources occurring so quickly on the heels of (Hurricane) Harvey."
summarize: Some Trader Joe's pistachios, dated between 2016 OCT 27 and 2016 NOV 04, are being recalled over possible salmonella contamination.      At least 11 people have been sickened and two hospitalized resulting from a multi-state salmonella outbreak linked to pistachios.      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the California-based company Wonderful Pistachios issued the recall voluntarily due to concerns of contamination.      The pistachios were sold under the brand names Trader Joe's, Wonderful, and Paramount Farms and were distributed across the U.S. and in Canada.      "Wonderful Pistachios takes food safety matters very seriously and is working closely with health officials to identify the source of the problem," the company said in a statement.      The affected states include Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Virginia, and Washington. The CDC says the investigation is ongoing.      Trader Joe's says the recall affects products it sold with "Best If Used By" dates between 2016 OCT 27 and 2016 NOV 04, along with the following code numbers:      Trader Joe's Dry Roasted & Unsalted Pistachios (UPC 0007 9990)      Trader Joe's Dry Roasted & Salted Pistachios (UPC 0007 9983)      Trader Joe's 50% Less Salt Roasted & Salted Pistachios (UPC 0011 1348)      Trader Joe's says it has not received any reports of illness related to these products.      Pistachios sold under the other brand names can be identified by a lot code number found on the lower back or bottom panel of the package. A complete list of the codes can be found on the FDA's website.      People began getting sick in December, the CDC reports, and those infected range in age from 9 to 69.      Officials say the products have a long shelf life and may still be in people's homes. Consumers are urged not to eat the pistachios and to either throw them away or return the nuts to the store at which they bought them for a refund.      Each year, salmonella is estimated to cause one million cases of foodborne illness in the United States, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths.      Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, which typically appear between 12 to 72 hours after the infection. Though the illness usually lasts four to seven days, sometimes the diarrhea may be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized, and it can lead to further complications and even death.      Children younger than five, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe infections.      People who think they may be infected with salmonella should contact their health care provider. ||||| LOST HILLS, Calif. - Wonderful Pistachios announced that it is voluntarily recalling a limited number of flavors and sizes of in-shell and shelled pistachios due to a risk of Salmonella contamination. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

summarize: Dubai Municipality has launched a community initiative under the slogan 'Your Weight in Gold' aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle and encouraging members of society to achieve and maintain their optimal body weight.            Hussain Nasser Lootah, Director General of Dubai Municipality, has launched this initiative after the success of the 'Yallah Walk' initiative launched in 2011. Senior officials from Dubai Municipality, Ahmed bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman of Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre and Anil Dhanak, General Manager of Dubai Gold and Jewelry Group, were present on the occasion.            "It is aimed at introducing walking tracks in different parks in Dubai. Walking is as an easy and economic way to stay fit and healthy that people can easily apply to their day-to-day life. Dubai Municipality has provided residents with safe and accessible walking tracks," Lootah said.            "Currently Dubai has 91 places to practice sporting activities, including residential parks, public parks, squares, jogging tracks and beaches. In addition, every year the civic body opens new parks in more areas and adds sports equipment and tools for the public to promote a healthy community," he said.            "Ramadan is the most appropriate season to launch such initiatives as it reminds us of the many health benefits of reducing weight and encourages us to take steps to change our bad lifestyles," he added.            Ahmed bin Sulayem said, "DMCC is proud to work with Dubai Municipality and DGJG to further support His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, in his ‘Your Weight in Gold’ health awareness drive to encourage society to change their daily routines in return for a healthier lifestyle.            "We would highly encourage everyone from all walks of life to take part in this great initiative and hope DMCC’s contribution of Dh100,000 worth of gold coins will help motivate individuals reach the final target of improving and sustaining a healthy lifestyle and consequently a better quality of life," he said.            Anil Dhanak, DGJG, said, "It is amazing to know that the municipality takes initiatives to encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and I believe that this how Dubai distinguishes from other cities in the world. I am sure Dubai can be the role model and astonish the world by its innovative ideas and initiatives."            The weight losing contest sponsored by DGJG and DMCC is open for public participation. The winners will get 2gm of gold if they reduce at least 2kg weight of their body within one month.            The overall winner will be the person who achieves the highest weight loss during the programme period of 30 days from its inception on July 19. The minimum weight to lose for eligibility is 2kg and participants will get one gram of gold for each kilo reduced from his/her body weight.            The top three winners will get a gold coin equivalent to Dh20,000 through a lucky draw. The weight of each participant will be measured at the point of initial registration and again at the end of the programme.                         ||||| Dubai’s overweight population is about to get a whole lot richer—that is, if residents can shed their pounds. The city is reportedly paying people in gold if they can lose weight. And the fatter they are, the more gold they stand to gain.      The AP reports that Dubai, the famously flashy oil-rich city in the United Arab Emirates, is giving residents one gram of gold (the equivalent of $45 at current prices) per kilogram (a little over two pounds) of weight lost. Participants, who weighed in for the first time on July 19th, have a month to lose as much weight as they can.      Dubai’s weight problems have grown along with the local economy. According to the Pulitzer Center, the city’s overweight population has skyrocketed as more restaurants, fast food joints, and shopping mall food centers have opened over the past 20 years. Now over half of all residents in the city are overweight. And now the same oil wealth that caused Dubai to grow so fat is being used to try to lure citygoers back to lower weights.      There are two main problems we see with the initiative. First, while over half the population in Dubai is overweight, a Philips Healthcare study claims that under 25% of overweight individuals in the city admit that they have a problem. And second: Dubai residents are already so rich (the UAE has a GDP per capita of over $45,000 per year) that getting a couple hundred bucks for giving up the convenience of McDonald’s may not be an attractive enough incentive—even though the biggest losers have the opportunity to win over $5,000 in a random lottery.      As the LA Times points out, the UAE doesn’t spend much on public health. One-off initiatives like this one may not do much if there’s no larger infrastructure to keep weights down. And in any case, weight is not always the ultimate indicator of fitness.      Ahmad Bin Sulayem, executive chairman of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, warns entrants about this conundrum in a Gulf News article:      "There are lots of ways to lose weight and also excuses to delay [getting fit]. A sprinter is different than a marathon runner, and everybody has their own techniques in becoming fit. If somebody wants to do body-building they can do so, but they have to be aware that they might gain weight," he added.       ||||| The flowing robes and abayas shrouding the people of the oil-rich United Arab Emirates can’t hide the truth of a federation-wide weight problem.      So the city of Dubai, famous for its opulent shopping centers and towering skyscrapers in the desert, on Friday will launch a public drive to get UAE residents on a diet, the Emirates24/7 website reports. The “Worth Your Weight in Gold” program will pay those who shed at least 2 kilograms in the next month – 4.4 pounds – the equivalent of $45 per kilo and give the top weight-losers a shot at a $5,000-plus jackpot.      The World Health Organization reports in “The Weight of Affluence” that the country’s affinity for fast food and sugary drinks has led to more than half the 5.5 million citizens becoming overweight or obese. Diabetes is also skyrocketing, the report noted.      The expanding waistlines and cultural disinclination to exercise have encouraged Dubai officials to stage the weight-loss competition from Friday through Aug. 16.      “We carry out a number of health initiatives every year to benefit the community, and this year’s event aims to encourage adults and children to lose weight and be healthy,” said Eng Hussain Nasser Lootah, director general of Dubai Municipality, Gulfnews.com reported Wednesday.      A 20-pound weight loss, for example, would earn the dieter about $450.      That sum might be an added incentive for those trying to slim down but in a country with the 15th highest GDP per capita in the world -- nearly $50,000 a year -- the promised payoff may not be powerful enough to separate citizens from their Big Macs and pistachio-stuffed pastries.      Despite the federation’s wealth, the government spends comparatively little on public health, ranking 172nd in the world with only 3.7% of the state budget devoted to medical care, according to the CIA World Factbook.

But if you live in Dubai, gold may be a more appealing option.      The city of Dubai has launched the "Your Weight in Gold" program, offering a gram of gold for every kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) shed, with a 2 kilo minimum weight loss to qualify, according to Emirates 24/7. It averages out to about $45 per kilo with no ceiling on the payout. Best of all, people who lose the most weight are entered into a separate lottery to win a gold brick worth over $5,000.      The campaign may be just what a city known for its extreme wealth needs to combat its increasing obesity rates. In the United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is one of the seven emirates, 30 percent of men and 43 percent of women are obese. One in every three children in neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi is obese, and the entire Persian Gulf region is struggling with a growing diabetes epidemic.      Home to the world's most expensive cupcake, Dubai is no stranger to combining opulence with dietary delights, but this time "the tiny emirate has outdone the world in flashy extravagance by tantalizing dieters," writes Charlene Gubash at NBC News.      The weight-loss program started this week and runs through Aug. 16 to specifically overlap with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Hussain Lootah, director general of the Dubai municipality, said it "is the most appropriate season to launch such initiatives as it reminds us about many health benefits of reducing weight and encourages us to take strong steps to change our lifestyles."      However, while gold for pounds may sound like a dieter's dream come true, there are potential downsides to the program. For one, since its GDP per capita is the 15th highest in the world at $50,000 per year, "the promised payoff may not be powerful enough to separate citizens from their Big Macs and pistachio-stuffed pastries," writes Carol J. Williams at the Los Angeles Times.      At the same time, paying people in gold to lose weight is somewhat ironic considering that the government allocates only 3.7 percent of its state budget to medical care and ranks 172nd in the world for public health spending, notes Williams.      Another flaw in the campaign is that a month-long weight-loss challenge suggests an emphasis on short-term results, which may not last. "Losing a bunch of weight that fast is always dubious," writes Meher Ahmad at Jezebel. Yet another is that Ramadan may not actually be a great time to try out that diet. Speaking from her own experiences of fasting from sunrise to sunset, Ahmad writes that "when you eat a million samosas (fried pastries with a spicy filling) and then don't eat for twelve hours, your body is all, 'we're in starvation mode, let's store this grease permanently.'"      Perhaps the most problematic aspect of Dubai's program, though, is that it does not tackle the underlying causes of the country's obesity epidemic. High temperatures (regularly over 100 degrees) that deter exercise coupled with the growing presence of Western fast food have had a toxic effect on weight and health. "Incentivising weight loss with gold seems like an unsustainable solution to a much bigger problem," writes Ahmad.      So, maybe there are certain problems that won't go away when you throw money, or even gold, at them. ||||| Shedding weight is as good as gold under an unusual slim-down initiative in Dubai over growing concerns about rising obesity levels in the wealthy Gulf city-state.

The plan is the latest attempt to encourage healthier lifestyles in the United Arab Emirates. Across the Gulf Arab states, authorities have raised alarms about rising obesity from increasing fast-food diets and lack of exercise. |||||	– Dubai is, generally speaking, a fat nation. It also happens to be a very rich nation, and those two factors have combined to create an unusual weight-loss offer from the government: It will give people gold based on how many pounds they drop, reports Emirates 24/7. The month-long initiative got underway this week. Specifically, people will get a gram of gold, worth about $45, for each kilogram (2.2 pounds) lost, reports AP. Participants also get a chance to win a $5,000 gold bar at the end. In a nation where half the people are considered overweight and where diabetes is on the rise, the government figures it needs to try something, notes the LA Times. But skeptics abound: "Dubai residents are already so rich (the UAE has a GDP per capita of over $45,000 per year) that getting a couple hundred bucks for giving up the convenience of McDonald’s may not be an attractive enough incentive," writes Ariel Schwartz at Co.Exist. And Emily Shire at the Week says the incentive doesn't address a root problem: "High temperatures (regularly over 100 degrees) that deter exercise coupled with the growing presence of Western fast food have had a toxic effect on weight and health." (The obese also might be able to blame their genes, now with scientific evidence to back them up.)
summarize: Policy-ish      Critics Lash Out At Chinese Scientists Who Edited DNA In Human Embryos      i iStockphoto iStockphoto      For the first time, scientists have edited DNA in human embryos, a highly controversial step long considered off limits.      Junjiu Huang and his colleagues at the Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, performed a series of experiments involving 86 human embryos to see if they could make changes in a gene known as HBB, which causes the sometimes fatal blood disorder beta-thalassemia.      The report, in the journal Protein & Cell, was immediately condemned by other scientists and watchdog groups, who argue the research is unsafe, premature and raises disturbing ethical concerns.      "No researcher should have the moral warrant to flout the globally widespread policy agreement against modifying the human germline," Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society, a watchdog group, wrote in an email to Shots. "This paper demonstrates the enormous safety risks that any such attempt would entail, and underlines the urgency of working to forestall other such efforts. The social dangers of creating genetically modified human beings cannot be overstated."      George Daley, a stem cell researcher at Harvard, agreed.      "Their data reinforces the wisdom of the calls for a moratorium on any clinical practice of embryo gene editing, because current methods are too inefficient and unsafe," he wrote in an email. "Further, there needs to be careful consideration not only of the safety but also of the social and ethical implications of applying this technology to alter our germ lines."      Scientists have been able to manipulate DNA for years. But it's long been considered taboo to make changes in the DNA in a human egg, sperm or embryo because those changes could become a permanent part of the human genetic blueprint. One concern is that it would be unsafe: Scientists could make a mistake, which could introduce a new disease that would be passed down for generations. And there's also fears it this could lead to socially troubling developments, such as "designer babies," in which parents can pick and choose the traits of their children.      The Chinese researchers say they tried this to try to refine a new technique called CRISPR/Cas9, which many scientists are excited about it because it makes it much easier to edit DNA. The procedure could enable scientists to do all sorts of things, including possibly preventing and curing diseases. So the Chinese scientists tried using CRISPR/Cas9 to fix a gene known as the HBB gene, which causes beta thallasemia.      The work was done on 86 very early embryos that weren't viable, in order to minimize some of the ethical concerns. Only 71 of the embryos survived, and just 28 were successfully edited. But the process also frequently created unintended mutations in the embryos' DNA.      "Taken together, our data underscore the need to more comprehensively understand the mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in human cells, and support the notion that clinical applications of the CRISPR system may be premature at this stage," the Chinese scientists wrote.      Rumors about this research have been circulating for weeks, prompting several prominent groups of scientists to publish appeals for a moratorium on doing this sort of thing.      In the wake of the report from the Chinese scientists, several of these researchers reiterated their call for a moratorium. Some said they hoped the difficulties that Huang and his colleagues encountered might discourage other scientists from attempting anything similar.      "The study simply underscores the point that the technology is not ready for clinical application in the human germline," Jennifer Doudna, the University of California, Berkeley, scientist who developed CRISPR, wrote in an email. "And that application of the technology needs to be on hold pending a broader societal discussion of the scientific and ethical issues surrounding such use."      But there are already reports that Huang's group and possibly others in China continue to try editing the genes in human embryos.      "We should brace for a wave of these papers, and I worry that if one is published with a more positive spin, it might prompt some IVF clinics to start practicing it, which in my opinion would be grossly premature and dangerous," Daley says. ||||| Gene editing could one day be used to remove disease genes from the gene pool.      In an ethically charged first, Chinese researchers have used gene editing to modify human embryos obtained from an in vitro fertilization clinic.      The 16-person scientific team, based at the Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China, set out to see whether it could correct the gene defect that causes beta-thalassemia, a blood disease, by editing the DNA of fertilized eggs.      The team’s report showed the method is not yet very accurate, confirming scientific doubts around whether gene editing could be practical in human embryos and whether genetically engineered people are going to be born anytime soon.      The authors’ report appeared on April 18 in a low-profile scientific journal called Protein & Cell. The authors, led by Junjiu Huang, say there is a “pressing need” to improve the accuracy of gene editing before it can be applied clinically—for instance, to produce children with repaired genes.      The researchers did not try to establish a pregnancy and say that for ethical reasons they did their tests only in embryos that were abnormal.      “These authors did a very good job pointing out the challenges,” says Dieter Egli, a researcher at the New York Stem Cell Foundation in Manhattan. “They say themselves this type of technology is not ready for any kind of application.”      The paper had previously circulated among researchers and had provoked concern by highlighting how close medical science may be to tinkering with the human gene pool (see “Engineering the Perfect Baby”).      In March, an industry group called for a complete moratorium on experiments of the kind being reported from China, citing risks and the chance they would open the door to eugenics, or changing nonmedical traits in embryos, such as stature or intelligence (see “Industry Body Calls for Gene-Editing Moratorium”). Other scientists recommended high-level meetings of experts, regulators, and ethicists to debate whether there are acceptable uses for such engineering (see “Scientists Call for a Summit on Gene-Edited Babies”).      The Chinese team reported editing the genes of more than 80 embryos using a technology called CRISPR-Cas9. While in some cases they were successful, in others the CRISPR technology didn’t work or introduced unexpected mutations. Some of the embryos ended up being mosaics, with a repaired gene in some cells but not in others.      Parents who are carriers of beta-thalassemia could choose to test their IVF embryos, selecting those that have not inherited the disease-causing mutation. However, gene editing opens the possibility of germ-line modification, or permanently repairing the gene in an embryo, egg, or sperm in a way that is passed onto the offspring and to future generations.      That idea is the subject of intense debate, since some think the human gene pool is sacrosanct and should never be the subject of technological alteration, even for medical reasons. Others allow that germ-line engineering might one day be useful but needs much more testing. “You can’t discount it,” says Egli. “It’s very interesting.”      The Chinese team performed the gene editing in eggs that had been fertilized in an IVF clinic but were abnormal because they had been fertilized by two sperm, not one. “Ethical reasons precluded studies of gene editing in normal embryos,” they said.      Abnormal embryos are widely available for research, both in China and in the United States. At least one U.S. genetics center is also using CRISPR in abnormal embryos rejected by IVF clinics. That group described aspects of its work on the condition that it would not be identified, since the procedure remains controversial.      Making repairs using CRISPR harnesses a cell’s own DNA repair machinery to correct genes. The technology guides a cutting protein to a particular site on the DNA molecule, chopping it open. If a DNA “repair template” is provided—in this case a correct version of the beta-globin gene—the DNA will mend itself using the healthy sequence.      The Chinese group says that among the problems they encountered, the embryo sometimes ignored the template, and instead repaired itself using similar genes from its own genome, “leading to untoward mutations.”      Huang said he stopped the research after the poor results. “If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100 percent,” he told Nature News. “That’s why we stopped. We still think it’s too immature.” ||||| Earlier this week, Chinese researchers reported that they edited the genes of human embryos using a new technique called CRISPR. While these embryos will not be growing up into genetically modified people, I suspect this week will go down as a pivotal moment in the history of medicine. David Cyranoski and Sara Reardon broke the news today at Nature News. Here I’ve put together a quick guide to the history behind this research, what the Chinese scientists did, and what it may signify.      There are thousands of genetic disorders that can occur if a mutation happens to strike an important piece of DNA. Hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis– the list goes on and on. As I wrote in the Atlantic in 2013, a particularly cruel genetic disorder, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva causes people to grow a second skeleton. It’s caused by a mutation that changes a single “letter” of a single gene, called ACVR1. The protein encoded by the gene doesn’t work properly, triggering a wave of changes in people’s bodies, with the result that when they heal from a bruise, they replace entire chunks of muscle with new bone.      In some cases, people can offset many of the symptoms of genetic disorders with simple changes, like watching what they eat. In other cases, like hemophilia, they have to take regular doses of drugs to remain healthy. In other cases, like fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, there’s no effective treatment yet.      For decades, scientists have tried to develop a new way to treat genetic disorders like these: to heal the patient, heal the gene.      This approach came to be known as gene therapy. As I wrote in Wired, gene therapy soared to heady heights of hype in the 1990s. Researchers developed viruses that they could load with working versions of people’s defective genes. They injected the viruses into their subjects, and the viruses delivered the genes to some cells–enough cells, in theory, to start doing the work required to make the people healthy again.      Gene therapy research crashed around 2000 when one volunteer died during a study due to an overwhelming immune response to the viruses he received. Since then, gene therapy researchers have found safer, more efficient viruses, and now gene therapy is starting to emerge in the clinic.      But the revival of gene therapy doesn’t necessarily mean that viruses are the best of all possible tools to fix broken genes. What if, for example, you could just remove the mutant DNA in a gene and replace it with the right sequence?      For a long time, that question was best left to late nights at bars and episodes of Star Trek. Nobody knew how to manipulate DNA with that kind of precision. But in just the past couple years, scientists have created exactly this kind of gene-editing tool, which is known as CRISPR.      As I wrote recently in Quanta, CRISPR didn’t spring fully formed from someone’s mind. It’s actually a collection of molecules that bacteria use to fight viruses. They can create molecules that can latch precisely to certain stretches of DNA and cut them apart. Shortly after scientists figured out how bacteria use CRISPR, they began to wonder if they could use it, too.      It soon became clear they could. They could easily synthesize “probe” molecules that would grab onto a specific stretch of DNA in just about any cell. Enzymes could then chop out that stretch. If the scientists supplied a different version of that stretch of DNA, the cell would incorporate it where the original stretch once was.      Delivering CRISPR into the bodies of people with genetic disorders could conceivably repair their genes. Of course, the success of this kind of treatment would depend on how efficiently the molecules could get inside the cells that needed repairing, and how accurately they cut the DNA. Still, some early experiments on animals suggest that the approach may someday work on people.      But what if you didn’t have to wait until so late in the game to repair a broken gene? If a fertilized egg ended up with a defective gene, you could conceivably use CRISPR to fix the mistake. That single cell could then give rise to an entire healthy human with trillions of cells that all had the correct version of the gene.      Last month, a team of leading scientists–including pioneers in both gene therapy and CRISPR–declared that this would be a bad idea. “At present, the potential safety and efficacy issues arising from the use of this technology must be thoroughly investigated and understood before any attempts at human engineering are sanctioned, if ever, for clinical testing,” they declared in a piece they published in Science.      But meanwhile, a team of researchers led by Junju Huang at Sun Yat-sen University were testing out CRISPR on human embryos. Huang told Nature that both Nature and Science rejected the paper based on ethical objections. So they ended up publishing the results in the journal Protein & Cell (open access, by the way).      The scientists tested out CRISPR as a form of embryonic gene therapy. Imagine an embryo had a mutation in a gene called beta-globin involved in making hemoglobin. It would develop into a person with the blood disorder beta-thalassemia. Would it be possible to cure the embryo by rewriting the gene?      The researchers set out to do the study on human embryos–but they didn’t want to use embryos that might ever actually be able to develop into a fully-formed human being. When fertility doctors fertilize eggs with in vitro fertilization, they sometimes end up with two sperm delivering their DNA into a single egg. These “tripronuclear zygotes” can start dividing as normal embryos do, but their abnormal collection of genes causes them to stop developing when they’re still just tiny clumps of cells. The researchers argue that this failure makes tripronuclear embryos “an ideal model system” for studying CRISPR therapy. (Bioethicists, start your engines!)      All told, the researchers injected 86 embryos, 71 of which survived long enough for them to study. CRISPR only managed to cut DNA in a fraction of the embryos, and in only a fraction of those embryos did cells manage to take up the new version of the target gene (called beta-globin).      Two big problems stick out from the results.      One is the fact that CRISPR sometimes missed its target and inserted DNA in the wrong places. Such a misfire wouldn’t just fail to fix a disease like beta-thalassemia. It could create a disease of its own.      The other big problem is that the embryos that did get edited correctly were actually a mix of edited cells and unedited cells–what’s known as a mosaic. Mosaics can give doctors a lot of headaches, as I’ve written in the New York Times. If fertility doctors used CRISPR to create healthy, hemophilia-free embryos, they’d need to make sure the embryos were repaired by picking off a cell and examining it up close. A cell from a mosaic embryo could give doctors the wrong picture of the embryo as a whole.      The authors conclude their paper by warning that these failures need to be “investigated thoroughly before any clinical application.”      Just because this experiment came out poorly doesn’t mean that future experiments will. There’s nothing in this study that’s a conceptual deal-breaker for CRISPR. It’s worth recalling the early days of cloning research. Cloned embryos often failed to develop, and animals that were born successfully often ended up with serious health problems. Cloning is much better now, and it’s even getting to be a business in the world of livestock and pets. We still don’t clone people, though–not because we can’t, but because we choose not to. We may need to make the same choice about editing embryos before too long.      Postscript 4/23 9:30 am: While I was hammering out this explainer yesterday, I got in touch with Jennifer Doudna, a CRISPR pioneer at Berkeley I wrote about in my Quanta piece, who co-authored the call for putting the brakes on human germline CRISPR research. She got back to me this morning with this to say:      Although it has attracted a lot of attention, the study simply underscores the point that the technology is not ready for clinical application in the human germline. And that application of the technology needs to be on hold pending a broader societal discussion of the scientific and ethical issues surrounding such use.      [Update: fixed the details on the beta-globin gene] ||||| A team of scientists in China dropped a bombshell earlier this month, and almost nobody noticed.      Researchers led by Junjiu Huang of Yat-sen University in Guangzhou published the world’s first scientific paper on altering the DNA of human embryos.      The pioneering research is controversial, though it was conducted on damaged embryos that could not have developed into a human. Many scientists contend that newly developed genetic-engineering methods need to be studied further in animals before running the risk of unpredictable human mutations and scarier developments in human evolution such as eugenic programs.      How could such a monumental paper go unnoticed? It was published on April 11 in the little-known online journal Protein and Cell, after being rejected by the more prestigious journals Science and Nature—partly on the grounds that the research was unethical, according to a report by Nature’s news division, which operates independent of the scientific journal. And that rejection highlights a major divide in the world of advanced genetic research: Scientists have discovered a powerful new tool, but they are also very concerned about where it may lead.      CRISPR: A fresh technique      The idea behind genetic medicine is fairly simple, even if the details are complex. Copies of a unique genetic code—in the form of DNA—are present in almost every human cell. People suffering from genetic disorders possess mutated genes—that is, misplaced letters in their DNA. The idea, then, is to heal genetic disorders by fixing the gene itself.      In the last few years, researchers have developed a powerful new method of snipping out defective DNA strands and replacing them with healthy one. The breakthrough tool—touted by MIT Technology Review as perhaps the biggest biotech discovery of the century—that enabled Huang’s team to conduct its research is called CRISPR (that stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, if you were wondering).      CRISPR was developed by observing the age-old battle between bacteria and viruses. In 2005, researchers discovered that bacteria use CRISPR genetic sequences as a biological weapon to remember, detect and dismember enemy viruses, honing in on specific sections of viral DNA and cutting them out.      Soon after this discovery, scientists were able to modify CRISPR to target genetic sequences in other living cells. This gave them the precision scissors that they had been looking for to target specific genes. It opened the door to fixing the mutated genes that cause hereditary disorders in both a very targeted way—honing in on specific DNA sequences—but also on a very broad scale, applied to every cell within an organism. CRISPR, combined with a few specialized proteins, essentially promises to be a find-and-replace tool for fixing damaged genetic material.      Here’s a video from MIT that goes into a little more detail:      Incidentally, some of the early CRISPR research was done by Rodolphe Barrangou, a scientist working for the yogurt company Danisco, who told the science writer Carl Zimmer that many dairy companies use CRISPR sequences in their bacterial cultures. “If you’ve eaten yogurt or cheese, chances are you’ve eaten CRISPR-ized cells,” he told Zimmer.      Mixed results      Huang’s team didn’t experiment with viable human embryos. Instead they used some of the abnormal, non-viable embryos that are inevitably created as part of in-vitro fertilization therapy, such as when two sperms insert their DNA into a single egg.      The team injected 86 embryos with engineered CRISPR sequences that targeted genes responsible for the blood disorder β-thalassaemia. About 71 of the embryos survived the 48-hour period needed for CRISPR to work. Fifty-four of the embryos could be genetically tested. Only 28 had the defective sequence removed, and an even tinier fraction of those ended up with the “pasted-in” healthy genetic sequence.      More worryingly, in some cases the CRISPR technique unintentionally caused mutations in other parts of the genome.      “If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%,” Huang told Nature. “That’s why we stopped. We still think it’s too immature.” (Huang was not immediately available for comment when Quartz tried to reach him via email.)      Don’t edit human DNA      A group of prominent geneticists published a paper in Science last month—including Jennifer Doudna, a University of California Berkeley professor who last year collected a $3 million Breakthrough Prize, bankrolled by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other tech billionaires, for her pioneering work on CRISPR—that urged scientists to refrain from testing the technique on human embryos.      The paper concluded that “the potential safety and efficacy issues arising from the use of this technology must be thoroughly investigated and understood before any attempts at human engineering are sanctioned, if ever, for clinical testing.”      Fifteen western European countries currently prohibit genetically modifying the germ line (which includes sperms, eggs, and embryos), and a major US health research committee has said (pdf, p.101) it “will not entertain proposals for germ-line alterations.”      The Science authors recommended that steps be taken to “[s]trongly discourage, even in those countries with lax jurisdictions where it might be permitted, any attempts at germ-line genome modification for clinical application in humans.”      A slippery slope?      Proponents of genetic engineering tend to talk about the potential benefits, such as eradicating hereditary diseases like hemophilia or sickle-cell anemia not just in a single patient, but in all of his or her descendants as well. Opponents talk about the dangers of genetic fixes gone wrong, or at the extreme end of the spectrum, the dystopian prospect of wealthy parents ordering up genetically perfect “designer babies.”      “Even unambiguously therapeutic interventions could start us down a path towards non-therapeutic genetic enhancement,” a group of scientists wrote in Nature in March. They told their colleagues around the world: “Don’t edit the human germ line.”      But it may be too late. According to an anonymous researcher cited by Nature, at least four groups in China are working on genetically modifying human embryos. The MIT Technology Review reported last month that research groups at Harvard Medical School and at least one other center in Boston are looking into so-called human germ-line engineering, along with other scientists in China and the UK. ||||| The CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-endonuclease complex, consisting of the Cas9 protein and the guide RNA (gRNA) (~99 nt), is based on the adaptive immune system of streptococcus pyogenes SF370. It targets genomic sequences containing the tri-nucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and complementary to the gRNA, and can be programmed to recognize virtually any genes through the manipulation of gRNA sequences (Cho et al., 2013; Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2012; Jinek et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013c). Following Cas9 binding and subsequence target site cleavage, the double strand breaks (DSBs) generated are repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination directed repair (HDR), resulting in indels or precise repair respectively (Jinek et al., 2012; Moynahan and Jasin, 2010). The ease, expedience, and efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system have lent itself to a variety of applications, including genome editing, gene function investigation, and gene therapy in animals and human cells (Chang et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2013; Cong et al., 2013; Friedland et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2014; Hwang et al., 2013; Ikmi et al., 2014; Irion et al., 2014; Jinek et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013a; Li et al., 2013b; Long et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2014; Mali et al., 2013c; Niu et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014a; Wu et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014b; Yang et al., 2013).      The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 is largely dictated by PAM and the 17–20 nt sequence at the 5′ end of gRNAs (Cong et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013a; Mali et al., 2013c; Pattanayak et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014a). Up to 5 mismatches may be tolerated for target recognition in human cancer cells (Fu et al., 2013). Unintended mutation in the genome can greatly hinder the application of CRISPR/Cas9, especially in studies of development and gene therapy (Hsu et al., 2014; Mali et al., 2013b; Sander and Joung, 2014). Interestingly, three groups recently found through whole genome sequencing that off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 appeared rare in human pluripotent stem cells (Smith et al., 2014b; Suzuki et al., 2014; Veres et al., 2014), raising the possibility that high frequencies of unintended targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 may be more prevalent in cancer cell lines. Additionally, lower rates of off-target effects (compared to human cell lines) have also been reported in mouse zygotes (Wu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013). Despite great progress in understanding the utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 in a variety of model organisms, much remains to be learned regarding the efficiency and specificity of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells, especially in embryos. Because ethical concerns preclude studies of gene editing in normal embryos, we decided to use tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes, which have one oocyte nucleus and two sperm nuclei.      Extensive studies have shown that polyspermic zygotes such as tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes, discarded in clinics, may serve as an alternative for studies of normal human zygotes (Balakier, 1993). Polyspermic zygotes, which occur in ~2%–5% of zygotes during in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinical trials, may generate blastocysts in vitro but invariably fail to develop normally in vivo (Munne and Cohen, 1998), providing an ideal model system to examine the targeting efficiency and off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 during early human embryonic development (Bredenoord et al., 2008; Sathananthan et al., 1999).      Here, we report that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can cleave endogenous gene efficiently in human tripronuclear zygotes, and that the DSBs generated by CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage are repaired by NHEJ and HDR. Repair template of HDR can be either the endogenous homologous gene or exogenous DNA sequence. This competition between exogenous and endogenous sequence complicates the analysis of possible gene editing outcomes make it difficult to predict the consequence of gene editing. Furthermore, mosaicism and mutations at non-target sites are apparent in the edited embryos. Taken together, our data underscore the need to more comprehensively understand the mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in human cells, and support the notion that clinical applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system may be premature at this stage. |||||	– Advances in DNA research are fairly common these days, but a new study out of China seems to qualify for bombshell status: Scientists there edited the genes of human embryos for the first time, reports Nature. This gets into controversial and "ethically charged" territory, notes the MIT Technology Review, because if a mistake is made at the embryonic level, the mutation could get passed on to future generations. It also raises a whole new set of concerns about "designer babies." To dampen the controversy, the researchers out of Sun Yat-sen University did not use embryos capable of developing into babies. As they explain in Protein & Cell, they used a new gene-editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9 on 86 embryos to try to modify a gene responsible for a blood disorder. Things did not go well. "Only 28 had the defective sequence removed, and an even tinier fraction of those ended up with the 'pasted-in' healthy genetic sequence," reports Quartz. Worse, mutations were introduced elsewhere. Researchers stopped the experiment, calling the technique "too immature." Critics not only agree, they want a moratorium on all such work. "There needs to be careful consideration not only of the safety but also of the social and ethical implications of applying this technology to alter our germ lines," a Harvard researcher tells NPR. At National Geographic, Carl Zimmer compares the controversy to the early days of human cloning and suspects "this week will go down as a pivotal moment in the history of medicine." This particular experiment may have tanked, but it's not a "deal-breaker" for the technology, he writes. But, as with cloning, society may now have to make some decisions about what's appropriate.
summarize: MEXICO CITY A 20-year-old man in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey has admitted to killing 45 people, and is being investigated for 34 more, officials said on Thursday.      Juan Pablo Vazquez was caught earlier this month in Monterrey where he was allegedly selling drugs, said Nuevo Leon state security spokesman Jorge Domene.      Vazquez, who said he was part of an unidentified local organized crime group, has already admitted being behind 45 killings and "is related to at least 79 murders, most of them committed in 2012," Domene told a news conference.      Mexico has suffered from a wave of drug-related violence, with about 1,000 people a month dying in gangland killings. About 80,000 people have died since 2007 in cartel violence.      (Reporting by Noe Torres and Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Simon Gardner and Peter Cooney) ||||| (CNN) -- The most shocking thing about the arrest of a man linked to 79 killings may be that authorities don't find it shocking.      At 20 years old, Juan Pablo Vazquez is accused of killing rivals, a policeman, a stripper and other innocent bystanders.      But you won't find authorities in the northern economic hub of Monterrey, Mexico, using any superlatives to describe the alleged killer. Not the worst they've ever seen, not the most ruthless, not the youngest or most prolific.      That's because Monterrey and its surroundings are an area disputed by rival drug cartels. From 2010 to the present, an average of 108 people have been killed each month in the state of Nuevo Leon, according to official statistics. Monterrey, the capital, has recorded 223 homicides so far this year.      Vazquez's arrest, then, merited a press conference, but no celebration as if an alleged serial killer had been brought down.      "We are witnessing a very severe crisis because of the war between cartels," one Mexican official said.      Vazquez was caught on October 8, but the arrest was not announced until Thursday.      He was arrested together with a woman, Nancy Ortiz, who police said was selling drugs with Vazquez. The pair was caught with 35 baggies of weed and 22 packets of cocaine, the state's security secretariat said.      The young man confessed to 45 killings, security officials said, and has been implicated in 34 other slayings between 2011 and this year.      Fear of reprisals from the warring cartels means that officials keep details to a minimum, not even revealing what gang a suspect belongs to.      The Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that Vazquez is a member of the Gulf cartel.      The Gulf cartel is fighting with the Zetas cartel for lucrative smuggling routes to the United States.      The official scoffed at the idea that Vazquez was any more dangerous or deadly than other alleged cartel hit men. He described Vazquez simply as the latest member of a large cell of assassins to be caught.      Vazquez was not necessarily the shooter in all the cases, but was a witness or otherwise involved in the killings, the official said. Sometimes he was just one of several shooters who aimed at their targets. Cartel members who were arrested before him fingered him in connection with the 34 killings he did not confess to, the official said.      And if the thought of a 20-year-old having a hand in 79 deaths sounds like an exaggeration, authorities released a list of dates and victims' names.      Among the killings he is accused of:      -- A transit officer who pulled him over on March 13.      -- An exotic dancer who had been kidnapped from a strip club on July 30.      -- A woman who happened to be accompanying a member of a rival cartel on January 16.      -- A group of eight rivals who were at a bar on August 13.      The list goes on and on. It is just a small fraction of the number of homicides committed in Nuevo Leon, the official said. |||||	– He's just 20 years old, but Juan Pablo Vazquez is believed to have killed 79 people ... at least. Reuters reports that Vazquez was nabbed this month in northern Mexico, and has since confessed to having a hand in 45 murders; he is being investigated in connection with another 34 that other cartel members have pinned on him. Security officials believe most of the homicides were committed in 2012, and if the word that comes to mind about all this is "shocking," well, CNN has news for you: Officials don't find his arrest "shocking." That's because Monterrey has been battered by drug cartels (Vazquez is reported to be a member of the Gulf cartel) in recent years, with an average of 108 people killed monthly in the state of Nuevo Leon, meaning Vazquez isn't necessarily the worst killer they've encountered. Vazquez may not have actually killed all 79; one official said that in some cases, a number of shooters—including, allegedly, Vazquez—fired at the intended targets. CNN lists a few of the people Vazquez is believed to have killed. On the list: a traffic cop who pulled him over and eight "rivals" who were at a bar. (Earlier this month, the notorious former leader of another cartel was assassinated ... by a clown.)
summarize: CLOSE There probably won’t be much of a frenzy at the mall this upcoming Black Friday. Veuer's Natasha Abellard(@NatashaAbellard) has the story. Buzz60      Black Friday doesn't have the shopping power it once had, a new analysis says (Photo: Andres Kudacki, AP)      When it comes to holiday shopping sprees, Black Friday is no longer the prime event.      A new analysis finds that more shoppers are choosing to spread out their holiday purchases rather than stick with the ritual of rising before dawn the morning after Thanksgiving in order to stand in line outside a store and then shop until they drop.      During the week that includes Thanksgiving, 35% of shoppers say they intend to do most of their shopping on Black Friday this year, down from 59% in 2015, according to the analysis released Tuesday by consultancy PwC.      Retailers are rolling out deep-discount deals, the "doorbusters" that were once the biggest drawing cards of Black Friday, earlier in the season to get first dibs on consumer dollars. Sears and Kmart launched a sale on Nov. 1 that offers their loyalty members 10% to 50% off all items through Nov. 25. Walmart's seasonal discounts began rolling out last weekend. And Target's special weekend offers will kick off Saturday.      But all that early activity has made Black Friday, the one-time busiest shopping day of the year, less of a draw. Since 2014, the Saturday before Christmas, known as "Super Saturday" has surpassed Black Friday in sales.      CLOSE The psychology behind Black Friday shopping. Time      "We're definitely seeing a decreased significance in Black Friday,'' says Dawn Eber, PwC’s U.S. consumer markets risk assurance leader and partner. "Consumers . . . know when the sales are. They're becoming more adept at their online shopping and walking into the stores on that particular day doesn't bear as much of a return in terms of pricing, which still is the number one driver.''

And she doesn't bother with Black Friday.      “I’ve never done it and will never do it,'' she says. "It’s more hype than a deal. Why would I be in such a huge crowd for $20 in savings?”      CLOSE Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly greeted customers as they entered a store in Minnesota on Thanksgiving night. Joly shook hands with shoppers and repeatedly shouted 'welcome to Best Buy!' (Nov. 24) AP      Among those surveyed by PwC, 63% of shoppers said price is what most moves them to take out their wallet. That compares to 39% who said they are spurred to make a purchase by free shipping. And 37% will fill their cart based on promotions.      CLOSE Experts pointed out the top trends for Black Friday this year. Buzz60      As Black Friday's appeal has faded, it has given rise to a new tradition of shopping before the Thanksgiving dinner dishes have been cleared. Some 58% saying they will shop on the holiday, compared to 40% who planned to do so last year.      They'll have plenty of Thanksgiving shopping options:      •Kmart. Stores will open at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving and some stores won't close until 10 p.m. the next day.      •Toys R Us. The toy emporiums will host their own holiday shopping marathon, welcoming crowds at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving and allowing them to browse and buy for 30 hours straight.      •Sears. It'll be open on the feast day. "Every year we ask (customers) basically for permission to be open,'' says Kelly Cook, chief marketing officer for Sears and Kmart. "And we keep getting the answer that says 'Yes, please be there for me.' ''      •Target. The chain, too, will once again be open.      Being open on a day that used to be reserved for feasting and football is just one of the ways retailers are luring shoppers in order to grab a chunk of the up to $1.05 trillion in sales that consultancy Deloitte is forecasting for this holiday season. Merchants are also featuring events and services that make a visit to an actual store worthwhile, instead of leaving shoppers to their home computer keyboards.      CLOSE Shoppers hit the stores early to snatch up the Black Friday deals. USA TODAY      Walmart hosted the first round of more than 20,000 holiday parties last Saturday, handing out catalogs and stickers to the youngest shoppers. Sears is guaranteeing loyalty members who head to a store to pick up an online purchase that they will get a $5 coupon off a future in-store purchase if they have to wait longer than five minutes.      And Target is offering cookies, hot cocoa, toy demonstrations and a photo op of a chimney made of Lego bricks to make its stores destinations.      Such experiences are necessary to grab shoppers who can now get much of what they need from online giant Amazon and other e-commerce sites.      "I buy clothes and shoes in the stores,'' says Carlitos Ramirez, 32, a mechanic who lives in Port Washington, N.Y. "At Amazon, I buy car parts.”      But Black Friday still has its fans.      It's a day "that's more of a social event with friends,'' says Coco Kulle, 19, a college student who lives in Manhattan.      Consumers are expected to spend roughly 6% more this holiday season as compared to last year, PwC says. And registers should keep ringing long after Thanksgiving week, with 70% of shoppers saying they won’t be done ticking off their holiday lists until after Cyber Monday.      "I should start earlier, but I never do,'' says Jared Accettura, 26, who works in software sales and lives in Manhattan. "I usually wait until the week before (Christmas) and buy everything.''

You know how it is: Every Black Friday, you are bombarded with lousy shopping deals that do not offer as much of a discount on an item as you think. But there is a bright spot: If you are shopping for a television, it really is the best time to buy one.      To stoke sales, electronics manufacturers typically slash prices of popular TV sets during Black Friday to the lowest all year. This week, you will be able to buy high-quality televisions for $500 to $1,500 after discounts of 15 percent to 30 percent. That’s a deal considering that typically, many TVs in the $500 range are just O.K. and high-end sets cost upward of $2,000.      But as always, there will be duds to watch out for. Many TV brands take this opportunity to sell sets with exaggerated features that have subpar picture quality. And inside stores, TVs often look different from the way they would at home, because you probably don’t have gigantic lights in your ceilings like the showrooms at Best Buy.      “A lot of Black Friday marketing is designed to get the consumer interested in something, sometimes with not a lot of facts but a gut feeling of ‘I need to buy this,’ ” said Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate, a consulting firm that studies TV and smartphone screens. ||||| “It’s like a haunted house,” she said. “But I think the point of that is to disorient you and scare you, so maybe this is the same tactic.”      The Polizzis have been shopping on Thanksgiving night for the last few years.      “Thanksgiving’s so low-key for us, so this is what we look forward to,” Jessica Polizzi said. “We have turkey, and then this is our evening activity.”      Also in line was Mohit Mundra, 37, of Hauppauge; but for Mr. Mundra, the shopping trip was nothing special.      “I was here for some general purchases,” said Mr. Mundra, who came with his wife and two daughters. “I just saw people outside who were in queue. Out of curiosity, I joined the queue.” — ARIELLE DOLLINGER      People may spend less this year than last.      The millions of deal-seeking shoppers who jam malls and store aisles over the next few days will be doing so in what is by most measures the best economy in a decade. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is at its lowest level since the Clinton administration.      But two questions loom over the holiday shopping season: How free will Americans be with their spending when wage growth remains anemic? And how much of that money will they spend in stores, given the continuing shift toward online shopping?      Over all, Americans appear confident in their economic prospects. The University of Michigan on Wednesday said consumer sentiment ticked down in November but remained close to its highest level since 2004. A separate survey conducted for The New York Times this month by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey likewise found that confidence was high and stable — neither survey has moved much in response to political turmoil in Washington or crises overseas. ||||| It’s that time of year. With Thanksgiving comes Black Friday: the annual holiday for shoppers hoping to score massive deals on products from retailers around the country.      Every year, stores like Best Buy, Target and Walmart offer stunning deals on high-priced items like televisions and phones, as well as markdowns on other products that could make good gifts for the holidays.      Black Friday is also a major test for retailers — many of which have struggled in the deteriorating brick-and-mortar landscape. The kinds of deals these retailers offer could give them a leg-up on the competition — and it appears Best Buy, Walmart, Target and Toys ‘R’ Us are here to play.      According to the National Retail Federation, About 164 million Americans plan to shop or have considered shopping during the Thanksgiving weekend — which over the years has extended beyond Black Friday and into Cyber Monday.      Still, most of the shopping will be done on Friday, Nov. 24. To get a sense of the biggest deals available, here are some of the most stunning mark-downs offered.      Best Buy      If you’re looking for a deal on a new TV, Best Buy is your best bet.      The consumer technology store is selling the Sharp 50″ LED 4K Ultra HD 2160p Smart Roku TV for $179.99. That’s a staggering $320 off.      Additionally, Best Buy is selling the Toshiba 55″ LED 4K Ultra HD 2160p Chomecast TV for $279.99 — a mark-down by $220.      Both of these products will only be available in stores.      Walmart      With the purchase of select iPhones or Samsung phones under a Verizon or AT&T plan in stores only, you can get a $300 Walmart gift card.      Toys ‘R’ Us      For parents with kids, Toys ‘R’ Us is selling the popular Barbie Pink Passport 3-Story Townhouse for $59.99. That’s 50% off its original price of $119.99.      Target      One of Target’s best offerings is on its Xbox One S 500GB. For just $189.99, shoppers can snag it for $90 off — and get a $25 Target gift card along with their purchase. ||||| Commerce Content is independent of Editorial and Advertising, and if you buy something through our posts, we may get a small share of the sale.

With 5% back on all Amazon purchases, you should probably have one of Amazon’s credit cards anyway. Now though, they’re boosting that to an astounding 20% on a wide array of items from throughout the store. You can find all of the eligible products, and also apply for the card, here. If you’re instantly approved, you’ll be able to use the card and score the cash back deals immediately.      An SSD is the best upgrade you can give your older computer, and Samsung’s 850 EVO line is the most popular one there is. A worldwide NAND shortage has reversed the previously inexorable downward price trend on these things over the past year or so, but today on Amazon, the 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB models are all down to the best prices of the year.      The Fire 7, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 aren’t ever going to be confused with iPad Pros, and that’s fine. They have good-enough screens, can play videos from all of the major online video services, and can handle basic gaming and web browsing with ease. Anecdotally, I’ve found that they’re also extremely popular devices for kids. So if you’ve had an inkling that you might want to buy one, Today’s the day to do it.            Advertisement      The Fire 7 is down to a ridiculously low $30, but it’s probably worth spending $20 more for the HD 8, which has a better screen, twice the storage, and 50% better battery life. If you’re going to primarily use the device as a portable TV screen, the 1080p HD 10 is a great bargain at $100.      Amazon’s breakthrough Echo smart speaker has spawned an entire family of products, and a whole bunch of them are down to all-time low prices for Black Friday, including a $20 discount on the brand new flagship Echo, a $30 discount on the smart home-ready Echo Plus, and a whopping $50 discount on the touchscreen Echo Show.            Amazon’s first-party gadgets are always hot commodities come the holidays, and all of their Black Friday deals (that we know of) are available now.      Home Theater            The full-size (and 4K-compatible) Fire TV isn’t discounted, but the compact and very capable Fire TV Stick is impulse-priced at $25.      Kindles            The two entry level Kindles are both $30 off, with additional savings available on Kids and Essentials bundles. Our advice - get the Paperwhite. The extra $40 is well worth a screen that’s twice as sharp, and includes a backlight. If you don’t mind buying a refurb, you can also get the Kindle Voyage, complete with an ambient light sensor and pressure-sensitive page-turning bezels, for $120.      Cloud Cam      Amazon only came out with the Cloud Cam about a month ago, but that won’t stop them from offering a $20 discount.      Amazon’s entire selection of Dash buttons is 50% off, bringing them all down to $2.50. The first time you use them though, you’ll still get a $5 account credit, so you actually stand to (sort of) make money here.      Have someone on your holiday list that’s difficult to shop for? I guarantee they’ll get use out of a good USB battery pack, because who doesn’t need extra battery power from time to time? Anker’s PowerCores are our readers’ favorites, and several models are on sale for Black Friday.            I’m partial to the PowerCore Fusion, because it has fold-out AC prongs, so you can plug it straight into the wall and use it as a regular wall charger.      If your giftee already has a big battery pack, it’s worth owning a pocket-sized model as well.      The PowerCore II 20000 features Anker’s newest technology, which ensures your phone will get the fastest possible charging speed.      And the classic PowerCore 10000 strikes a great balance between size (it can fit in a jacket pocket or small purse with ease) and capacity: About 2-3 full phone charges.      After teasing us with some appetizers earlier in the week, Anker just opened up the floodgates on their Black Friday deals, including several that our exclusive to our readers.            Your Favorite Anker Products Readers have purchased more than 10 million products through links on our network since 2012, and… Read more Read      There are too many deals to include them all here, but head over to this post for a complete roundup.      Whether you’re building a new gaming PC, buying one pre-made, or upgrading your existing rig, Amazon’s Black Friday PC gaming deal has something for you.            Advertisement      You can find all of the deals by heading to Amazon, but we also highlighted some of our favorites here.      Today only, the Google Home Mini is down to $29 from its usual $49, and if you buy it from Bed Bath & Beyond, you’ll get a bonus $10 BB&B gift card thrown in top.            Whether you need a new Wi-Fi router, more ethernet ports, a modem to call your own, or some smart switches to start automating your home, Amazon’s TP-Link Black Friday sale has you covered.            There are two pages of deals here spanning nearly all of TP-Link’s product line. A few of our favorite deals are below, but be sure to head over to Amazon to see the full selection. Just remember that these deals are only available today, so lock in your orders before Amazon pulls the plug.      Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 tablets are a lot like Surface Pros on the inside, except they come with they keyboard cover (sporting the iconic ThinkPad key design, of course), work with some unique add-on modules, and are a lot cheaper, at least with today’s deal. Prices range from $500 to $950 depending on the specs you choose, but they’re all solid values if you like the idea of a convertible Windows hybrid computer.            Anker has long been our readers’ go-to manufacturer for inexpensive mobile phone accessories, but now they’re stretching their tentacles into higher-end markets, and you can save $150 on one of their most ambitious products to date, today only with promo code P1NEBULA.      Your Favorite Anker Products Readers have purchased more than 10 million products through links on our network since 2012, and… Read more Read      Marketed under their Nebula home theater brand, the Mars Portable Cinema is a projector that you can take anywhere. Packing a 19,500mAh battery, the Mars can project a 150" image at 720p for up to three hours away from a power outlet; more than enough for an outdoor movie night, or even a watch party for a big game. Its built-in JBL speakers should also be sufficiently loud and clear, but you can of course plug in any sound system you want with a 3.5mm cable.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The Mars even runs Android (a weird version of it, admittedly) with support for a few popular streaming apps. But of course, any streaming stick like the Fire TV Stick can plug right into its HDMI port, and utilize the Mars’ USB port for power. And if you have an iPhone or iPad, you can even skip all of that and stream your content directly to the projector over AirPlay, no Apple TV required.      Today’s deal is $150 less than usual, $50 less than Prime Day, and a match for the best deal ever.      If you’re going to turn outdoor movie nights into a regular occurrence, you’ll also want to invest in a good screen. There are tons of outdoor-friendly options on Amazon, but Camp Chef’s seem to be the most popular.      You can never have enough hard drive space, especially when it’s this cheap. This Black Friday only, Amazon’s discounting a wide array of Seagate internal and external hard drives to great low prices.            Advertisement      Advertisement      You’ll want to head over to Amazon to see them all, but I suspect that the most popular items will be a 2TB portable drive for $60 (there are several colors available), or the 2TB FireCuda, which can speed up your PS4's loading times with a small amount of built-in flash storage.      23andMe’s Health + Ancestry DNA test kit would make for a unique holiday gift, and it’s half off its usual price today for Black Friday. You just provide them with some saliva, and they send you back over 75 reports about your ancestry, your genetic health risks, and a lot more. It’s a bit more to take in than the ancestry-only tests out there, but knowledge is power.            It should go without saying that digital photo frames make great gifts for parents and grandparents. But even I, a tech-savvy millennial, am pretty enamored with the Nixplay Iris. It usually sells for $200, but the Peach Copper model is down to $150 today.            For $122, you can also opt for the larger Nixplay Seed in a few different colors, though it’s not nearly as nice looking as the Iris.      Tile is the ultimate device for anyone who can’t stop losing their things, and you can get four Tiles (in two different designs) for $60 today, an all-time low. Plus, if you add this $10 gift card to your cart as well, you’ll get it for free!            You’ll get two Tile Slims, which are designed to slide into a wallet or stick to objects, and two Tile Mates, which you can attach to keychains or keep in bags. Once you have your Tiles in place, the Tile app on your phone can ping them over Bluetooth and cause them to beep until you find what you’re looking for. And if your lost item is outside of your phone’s Bluetooth range, it’ll show up on a map automatically any time another Tile user comes into range.      Advertisement      Advertisement      Buying these Tiles a la carte would set you back about $100, so if you can think of four things you want to track, this is a fantastic bargain.      It’s the most wonderful time of the year...to buy Sonos stuff. A bunch of the high-end audio gear is on sale for Black Friday, including the first ever discount on the Alexa-equipped Sonos One, $50 off the still-great PLAY:1 and PLAY:3, and $100 savings on the PLAYBAR and PLAYBASE.      4K monitors might be the new hotness, but if you just want to collect 1080p displays to build out a multi-monitor setup, two great discounts from ASUS are included in Amazon’s Black Friday deals today. Get a 23.6" screen for $95, or 27" for $145.            Sony’s WH1000XM2s put the noise-canceling headphone world on notice when they were released earlier this year, and now, you can get them at a discount for the first time ever. They’re still an investment at $298, but if you spend any significant amount of time in planes, trains, or just a noisy office, they’ll probably be the best thing you buy this year.            Last year’s model is also down to $228, though its battery only lasts 20 hours compared to 30 on the new one, and its noise-cancelling engine and sound quality aren’t quite as good.      If these are out of your price range, Sony’s extra bass noise canceling cans are also on sale for $123. They won’s sound nearly as good, and don’t have all the advanced features of the 1000XM2s, but that’s still a great deal.      Don’t need noise cancelation at all? Sony’s standard wireless over-ears and on-ears are on sale for Black Friday too.      Want noise cancellation in a pocket-sized package? Sony’s brand new noise-canceling true wireless headphones are on sale, down to $178 from their usual $200. They don’t have great battery life, so you can’t use them continuously all day at work, but their included charging case makes it easy to top them off. And hey, they’re freaking noise-cancelling truly wireless earbuds. That’s amazing!            If price has been the barrier to entry keeping you from better audio, here’s the first opportunity since Prime Day to grab Status Audio’s CB-1s for their lowest price ever, $55, beating the previous best deals by $8.            Status is a direct-to-consumer headphone company, building great cans in proven form factors without the markup that comes with popular brands. In fact, there’s no branding here whatsoever.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The CB-1s are extremely comfortable out of the box, more so (for me) than the ATH-M50X, MDR7506, SR60e, or V-MODA Crossfade Wireless, just to name a few off the top of my head (ha!).      The CB-1s have a (relatively) flat frequency response that’s great for listening to a variety of music or audio/video editing, with a wide sound stage in a closed back design. I get good isolation/seal with the updated pads. The inclusion of two detachable cables- coiled and straight, is also generous and welcome. Even better that they smartly attach with a twist lock.      Advertisement      We know from five years of Kinja Deals that great over-ear, closed back headphones for under $60 is no joke. Depending on what you’ve shelled out for in the past, they might even blow away your much more expensive pairs.      Yesterday’s big SanDisk sale is expired, but a few items remain at or near their all-time low prices for Black Friday, including some microSD cards that’ll work with your new action cam or Nintendo Switch.            It’s the best time of year to buy a Fitbit, as most of the lineup is on sale for Black Friday. Fitbit Alta HR for $100 is probably the one you want to buy, unless you’re interested in a full-featured smart watch, in which case the Fitbit Ionic comes with a $50 Amazon gift card today. For the rest of the deals, head below.            Fitbit Ionic | $300 | Amazon | Plus $50 gift card      We see deals on leaf-style HDTV antennas pretty frequently, but if you won’t settle for anything less than the brand that started the trend, you can score a huge deal on the Mohu Leaf 30 and amplified Leaf 50 today.            The the Leaf 30 is rated for the 30 miles, and the Leaf 50 for 50 miles, but keep in mind that those figures are only under ideal circumstances, and your actual range will likely be lower. But still, it’s just about the most powerful omnidirectional antenna you can get that doesn’t require outdoor or attic installation, and these are the best prices we’ve seen. Just be sure to use promo code MOHUBLACK at checkout to maximize your savings.      DJI’s Spark is the most exciting new drone of the year. It’s roughly the size and weight of those cheap toy drones you see out there, but with significantly better flight time and performance, an automatic follow-me mode, and most crucially of all, a gimbal-stabilized 1080p camera that shoots some seriously great footage.            It was already a bargain at its $500 launch price, but its Black Friday deal just took flight, bringing it down to $397, so go earn your wings.      Ultimate Ears’ water-resistant Bluetooth speakers are some of the best looking and best sounding options out there, and two different models are on sale for all-time low prices for Black Friday.            It’s not quite as cool looking as Ultimate Ears’ offerings, but the JBL Charge 3 is our readers’ favorite waterproof speaker, and it’s also on sale for $90.      The budget-friendly Anker SoundCore 2 also remains on sale for $32, complete with its 24 hour battery life, and surprisingly great bass.      The Greenco G Pen Elite was already one of the best vaporizers for the money at its usual $150, but for Black Friday, you can get it for an all-time low $85 with promo code KINJA-BFCM.      Advertisement      Advertisement      Of, for just $66 with the same code, you can also opt for the smaller G Pen Pro, which should perform similarly, but with a smaller chamber capacity and less precise temperature adjustment. Either way, these deals aren’t available for long, so get in before they go up in a puff of smoke.      From Gizmodo’s review:      “Pleasant” has come to define much of my time with the Grenco G Pen Elite. It charges quickly via USB and has battery life that last for days of regular use. It also feels great in my tiny hands and fits easily in a coat pocket or a purse. The thing that takes it from “perfectly pleasant” to near outstanding is the price. It’s just $170. That’s damn cheap compared to it’s competitors. The Firefly 2 costs $329.95 and the Crafty retails for $339. Sure those products heat via convection instead of roasting a ceramic chamber, they’re much easier to pull on, and the clouds they produce are enough to fishbowl someone sitting with you, but for nearly half the price the Grenco G Pen Elite is a fantastic deal.      The Roku Streaming Stick+ packs more features than you’d ever think was possible in such a small dongle. You get 4K, HDR, advanced Wi-Fi, a voice remote, basically anything else you could want in a larger streaming box. It’s only about a month old, but you can already get it for $48 for Black Friday, a ~$20 discount.            What started with the reader-favorite and budget-friendly Yi action cam has since grown into an entire lineup of cameras, and they’re all on sale right now for Black Friday, from the original on up to the 4K+, which features 4K/60 capture for an all-time low $210. Personally, I think most people should go for the Yi Lite at $73, which features a built-in screen, and 1080/60 capture, or 4K up to 20 frames per second.            LG’s OLED TVs seem to have cornered the high-end market this year, and four different models are down to their lowest prices ever on Amazon right now, in anticipation of Black Friday. Choose from 55" or 65", and between the B7A and C7 line. The picture quality between the two will be identical (i.e. completely stunning), but the C7 has a higher quality industrial design and onboard Dolby Atmos audio processing.            If you’re still listening to your TV through its built-in speakers, it’s time to drop what you’re doing and grab a sound bar on sale.      Advertisement      Advertisement      For just $75, you can get an AmazonBasics sound bar with a built-in subwoofer. The bass won’t be as deep as it would be from a discrete woofer, but it’s better than nothing.      If you’d prefer a little more bass, for $158, you can step up to a 2.1 channel model from Samsung with a wireless subwoofer, or go for a 3.1 channel system for $218. Both of those prices are all-time lows.      The cool thing about those Samsung systems is that you can turn them into wireless 4.1 and 5.1 surround sound systems (respectively) with this expansion set, which is actually also on sale right now for $68.      Brother is our readers’ favorite printer brand and it’s easy to see why: they basically never jam, the toner is relatively cheap, and it prints fast (up to 32 pages per minute). The one trade off is that they don’t print in color, which when I think back to the last couple of things I’ve printed, it’s been a bunch of boring forms, so I don’t think it would be too hard of a pill to swallow.            Plus, this refurbished EHLL2360DW includes the ability to print from your mobile device. At $55, what are you waiting for?      If you really need to be able to print in color, the 3170CDW is also on sale for $160, its lowest price of the year.            VPNs are in the news these days, and with good reason. So if you’re curious to sign up and start protecting your browsing history and personal data (or, you know, getting around websites’ geoblocks), NordVPN charges less per month than a typical trip to Starbucks.      NordVPN has long been one of the most popular and reliable VPN providers out there, and if you sign up for a one-year membership, promo code VIP70 will drop your annual price from $69 to $48.

Nest’s iconic thermostats don’t go on sale often, and sizable discounts their other products are even rarer still, so Black Friday really is the best time of year to join the ecosystem, or expand your collection. Save $50 on the third generation Nest Learning Thermostat, $20 on the Protetct smoke detector (both the battery and wired versions), $50 on the outdoor Nest Cam, or $60 on the indoor one.            Weighted blankets can work wonders for your anxiety, or at the very least keep you warm and cozy all winter long, and you can save 10% on both kid and adult-sized blankets today with promo code INYARD10. These burst onto the scene recently, and we haven’t really seen any deals before this one, so you should take advantage if you want to give one as a gift this holiday season.            It might look like something Rey would wear while scouring for spare parts on Jakku, but this neck wrap is actually a travel pillow, and a top-selling one at that.            Advertisement      Advertisement      The Trtl pillow uses a hidden ribs to support your neck as you doze off in your tiny coach airline seat. Just wrap Trtl around your neck, placing the ribs on whichever side you want to lay your head (including directly under your chin) pop on some noise-cancelling headphones, and try your darnedest to get some shut-eye.      In case it wasn’t obvious, the big advantage of this design is size; Trtl weighs less than 1/3 of a pound, can attach to your luggage, and is far less bulky than a memory foam pillow. Amazon’s got it marked down to $21 today for Black Friday, a rare discount from its usual $30, so if you have any holiday travel on the horizon, I wouldn’t sleep on this discount.      The Breville Smart Oven is our readers’ favorite toaster oven, and the 650XL model is one of my personal favorite possessions. If I would normally cook something in the oven, I’ll try everything in my power to make it fit into the Breville instead, which usually isn’t hard, because it can fit a lot.            It’s worth every penny at its usual $180, so you’d be making a terrible mistake to miss it at $110.      If you live in a city with Amazon’s same-day Prime Now delivery service, but haven’t gotten around to using it yet, they’re running a fantastic promotion for new members to celebrate Black Friday            Advertisement      Advertisement      For a limited time, you can save $10 on your first Prime Now order with promo code BFCMGET10, and receive an additional $10 credit to use within a month. Prime Now requires you to spend $35 per order, so that means you can basically save 50% on snacks, ice cream, household essentials, and more brought right to your front door. Or, if you’ve used Prime Now before, you’ll get 25% off select items.      If you don’t own a pressure cooker, today’s a great day to fix that. The newest, pint sized 3Qt Instant Pot Mini wants a permanent home on your kitchen counter, and it just got its biggest ever discount down to just $49, the first time it’s ever been under $50.            If you’re cooking for a larger family, the extra large 8Qt model is incredibly down to $82. For context, the previous all-time low price was $112, so this is a massive discount, and one that we likely won’t see again for some time.      This is also our readers’ favorite slow cooker, and one of their favorite rice cookers too. To put a fine point on it: It’s one of the most versatile kitchen gadgets you can own. Even if you already have one, I don’t need to tell you that these make great gifts.            It’s like AmazonBasics is having a garage sale. This giant Gold Box is full of a bunch of random AmazonBasics and Pinzon brand products, like bedding, pet supplies, cables, telescopes, and more. I’ve highlighted a couple of stand-out products below but you’re going to have just go check out and start scrolling for yourself. Thankfully, they you can navigate between categories at the top.

One of the easiest home upgrades you can make is replacing that crappy shower head that came with your house or apartment. This Delta two-in-one was ranked as your absolute favorite, and today it is at its lowest price ever at $88. I bought this exact shower head six months ago and it has been worth every penny. You (probably) shower everyday, might as well make it as enjoyable as possible.      If your tires are about due for a replacement, Discount Tire Direct is offering up to $100 in Visa gift card rebates (in addition to any manufacturer rebates) when you order four new tires, plus an additional $100 if you order wheels as well, plus an extra $60 on each if you use a Discount Tire credit card. Just enter your make and model, click the options to see tires on promotion, and you’ll see the rebate amount (either $25, $75, or $100) on the right hand side.

Their space-saving Inissia model with included milk frother is down to $66 and the Nepresso VertuoPlus is down to $80 for Black Friday. Those deals ought to perk you right up, because these two are some of the best we’ve ever seen.            Advertisement      If you’re trying to decide between the two, the VertuoPlus is a little more powerful and larger, holding about double the amount of water, and can make three different sized drinks (espresso, coffee, and 14-ounce alto). The Inissia only weighs 5 pounds with a much smaller footprint and has two available coffee sizes.      Anova dominates the sales charts, but in many ways (raw heating power, looks, size, software quality), the Joule sous-vide circulator is actually the superior product, and Amazon’s running an unprecedented $30 discount on it for Black Friday            The Joule White is actually a new model of the Joule, swapping the original’s stainless steel top and base with white plastic to match the rest of the unit. Otherwise, it’s exactly the same as the Joule White/Stainless, and usually retails for $20 less at $179. Today’s Black Friday sale though is a great chance to save a bit more.      The steel version is also $30 off, but at $169, there’s really no reason to buy it over the white model, unless the white sells out.      The Anova circulator is on sale for $119, and it might be the right choice for you. I’d encourage you to read the Lifehacker showdown post to help decide.      If you don’t have any idea what I’m talking about or why you might want to buy this, Lifehacker has a great sous-vide explainer here. Spoiler alert: It’s incredibly simple, and the results are fantastic.      If you’ve consumed so much coffee in your life that you’re now desensitized to the caffeine (hi), Insomnia Coffee might be the solution best option other than getting more sleep.            Advertisement      Advertisement      Insomnia claims to be the world’s strongest coffee blend, boasting 702mg of caffeine per 12 ounce cup. For comparison, a 12 ounce Red Bull has about 115mg, so...yeah, Insomnia probably isn’t super healthy. But hey, I’m not here to judge. You can get a pound of ground for $15, or whole bean for $14 right now on Amazon, the best prices we’ve ever seen.      WeMo products have long been the simplest way to get started with home automation, and both the light switch and mini smart plug are on sale for all-time low prices today. These are dead simple to use, and allow you to control any light fixture or power outlet with your phone, IFTTT recipes, or even Alexa.            It’s never been easier to outsource vacuuming to a robot, and with today’s Amazon Gold Box, it’s basically never been cheaper, either.            Advertisement      Advertisement      While they lack the brand recognition of Roombas, and we can’t personally vouch for them like we can for the Eufy RoboVac 11, these ECOVACS vacuums have solid reviews, and are insanely affordable.      The $140 Slim model is just over 2" tall, so it can fit under most furniture that you probably only move to clean under a couple of times per year. It also has Wi-Fi control, which is insane at that price.      For $10 more, you can get the M79, which is slightly bigger, slightly more powerful, and includes an extra cleaning mode.      For just $170, the DEEBOT M80 adds an optional wet mopping system for your hard floors, in addition to pulling standard vacuum duties.      This sale also comes with a special surprise: A window cleaning robot! Its utility will obviously vary depending on how your windows are set up in your house (generally speaking, these become more useful as your window panes get bigger, obviously), but it could be a worthwhile splurge.      Dremels make great gifts, because they can be many different things to many different people, and a whole bunch are on sale for Black Friday today. That includes everything from the Dremel pet nail grooming kit to a 30-piece variable speed starter kit to a damn butane torch, and everything in between.

A whole bunch of boozy OXO gear is on sale for Black Friday, including the innovative Press & Pour shaker.            Worx Landroid Robotic Lawnmower | $649 | Amazon      Robotic vacuums have finally started to catch on in the mainstream, but mowing the lawn might actually be the more odious chore, especially when it’s hot out. Luckily, the Roomba for your yard exists, and it’s on sale right now for $649, an all-time low by about $100.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The Worx Landroid runs seven days per week to keep your lawn perfectly manicured at all times, and like a robotic vacuum, it can park itself back on its charging base whenever its battery runs low, or if it starts to rain. The biggest catch is that you’ll have to peg down or bury a guide wire along the perimeter of your lawn, which prevents Landroid from escaping into the wilderness of Ms. Jenkins’ backyard herb garden.      $649's still a lot of money, but it’s a small price to pay to reclaim your Saturday afternoons.

Everyone has fond memories of smelling the Yankee Candle store from halfway down the shopping mall’s hallways. It’s a rite of passage to attempt to walk by without getting a headache. But their candles really are great, and with this sale from Amazon, you can have those scents in your home for even less. Choose holiday or classic candle smells, including the bestselling Cedar & Balsam scent for just $12.      See all the candles included in the sale in this post.      In case you didn’t notice, we really like Chase’s Ultimate Rewards program. Back in 2015, Chase offered an incredible 10% back on Amazon purchases over the holidays- a promotion we’ve been longing for ever since that’s finally returned, with Best Buy and Walmart as the partner retailers this time.      Of course, you’ll need a Chase card to take advantage of this offer, but it doesn’t need to be a premium one. The high-end Chase Sapphire Reserve and the no-fee Freedom and Freedom Unlimited are all eligible. These are all must-own cards anyway, so if you don’t already have one, this deal is a great pot sweetener to stack with both your Black Friday/Cyber Monday savings and your sign-up bonuses.      Walmart’s half of the promotion runs through Dec. 14, with a max applicable spend of $325, while Best Buy’s goes all the way to Christmas Eve with a ceiling of $400. You can use Chase Pay to check out online to take advantage of the Walmart offer, but with Best Buy you’ll have to... go to a store.      You don’t need a yard, or even any gardening skills to grow your own food at home; you just need one of these countertop gardens. These fully-integrated, soil-free indoor gardens can grow herbs, vegetables, and salad greens up to five times faster than regular soil, and they’re all on sale for Black Friday.      Advertisement      Advertisement      First up, Click and Grow makes beautifully-design gardens that create the perfect environment that your plants need to thrive. With sensors that tell the Click and Grow when to turn the LED lights on, you simply fill the container with water once a month and the Click and Grow (and the plants themselves) does the rest of the work. They have two options on sale today, a 3-plant size garden for 40%, or $60, and a 9-plant size garden at 30% off or $140.      Amazon also has a countertop garden on sale, the AeroGarden Harvest. Very similar to the Click and Grows, you simply pop in the seed pods, some water, occasionally add nutrients, and it does the rest. This AeroGarden has accommodations for six plants so its a good middle ground between the two Click and Grows. It normally sells for $140 and is down to only $100 today.      The Click and Grow sale only lasts through the weekend and the AeroGarden can change in price at all time, so harvest these deals now. They make great gifts.      It’s FINALLY that time of year where it’s socially acceptable to have a Christmas tree up in your house. If you’re in the market for a new artificial one, Amazon is discounting a bunch of trees made by National Tree. These are top-of-the-line trees that look convincingly real and come in a variety of tree species. Most of these are at or very near their all-time low prices so get yourself one of these and go ahead and blast that Christmas music.      Alexa, ask Garmin to get me directions to a good deal.            The Garmin Speak lets you bring Alexa along for the ride in your car, and works as a unique, unobtrusive GPS device to boot. If you’ve been waiting on a deal to pick one up, it’s down to $100 for Black Friday, or $50 less than usual.      Black Friday’s here to brighten your day with an array of Philips Hue smart lighting deals.            Advertisement      Advertisement      In my opinion, the Hue White starter kit for $60 is a better way to get started than the more popular color bulbs. Most people won’t turn their living room various shades of blue, but everyone can benefit from regular light bulbs that you can control with your phone or your voice. This kit gets you four bulbs and a Bridge, which can support up to 50 Hue products.      If you really do want the classic Hue colorful bulbs, they’re on sale for $32 each, which is about as cheap as they ever get.      Hue can also accent your molding, or go under your kitchen cabinets with the Hue LightStrip Plus, which has never been this cheap before.      Keurigs and drip coffee makers are convenient, sure, but the coffee they produce can’t hold a candle to what you’ll get from these discounted gadgets.

Just add coffee, add water, and walk away. You can read Shane’s review of it on Gear, and also see a video of how it works.      Cooking eggs isn’t exactly rocket science, but I’d say the ability to make soft, medium, and hard boiled eggs, plus omelettes and poached eggs at the touch of a button is worth $16. The Dash is Amazon’s top-selling egg cooker, and carries a stellar 4.5 star review average from nearly 4,500 customers, so get it while it’s on sale.

You may be thinking that $201 is still a big chunk of change for a rice cooker, but it’s not when you learn about how this machine uses fuzzy logic to cook your rice precisely and perfectly every time.      “Fuzzy logic” is a way of describing situations that cannot be described in absolutes: yes or no, true or false, white rice or brown. Fuzzy logic is used in automated technology that must sense and adjust for various factors, like mixing cement (depends on humidity) and changing traffic lights (depends on traffic). In rice cookers, fuzzy logic can take into account the type of grain, its age and hardness and its desired consistency. Frequent rice cooks who work with a variety of grains and have room on the countertop will not be disappointed by the performance of these machines.      This is a larger model that can cook up to 1 liter of rice at a time, has a killer 4.4-star rating, and has extended keep warm features to keep your rice perfect for hours.      Irwin’s GrooveLock pliers are exceptionally popular, and at $16 less than its usual $80, this 8-piece set would make a great gift.            Grabbing breakfast or lunch with coworkers can be a great way to break up the day, but more often than not you’ll just wallow in your own indecision before ordering a bad $17 sandwich.

So you want to try a standing desk, but you’re not ready to commit to it for eight hours a day...what do you do? You buy this Lorell monitor riser for as little as $136, an all-time low.            This riser arrives fully assembled, and just sits on top of your existing desk. Put your monitor(s) on the top shelf, your keyboard and mouse on the bottom, and use its integrated spring system to raise the entire setup from a sitting to standing position within seconds. You can also opt for the larger deluxe model for $227, which is also an all-time low. I own a very similar product from Varidesk (which was much more expensive, by the way), and I absolutely love it.      When compared to traditional blenders, stick blenders are 1,000x easier to clean. You can skip the blender work bowl and just place this stick blender in whatever container you were already using to make your sauce, smoothie, or whatever else needs to be pureed. That means less dishes, and more time to do whatever else you need to do.      Advertisement      Advertisement      This Cuisinart Smart Stick Blender is just $25 today, which is the lowest price its been since July.      Spend $50 on the stuff everyone needs, like laundry detergent, paper towels, and body wash, and Amazon will give you a $10 gift card. Free money.      Remember to add the gift card to your cart before you check out.      While not nearly as ubiquitous as Nest’s Learning Thermostats, Ecobee’s smart thermostats one-up the competition by pairing with wireless remote sensors that you can place elsewhere in your house, giving the thermostat a more accurate picture of your home’s overall temperature.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The new Ecobee4 is especially notable in that it doesn’t just work with Google Assistant and Alexa...it actually is a fully-featured Alexa device, just like an Echo Dot that lives on your wall. It’s rarely been discounted from its usual $250 since it launched earlier this year, but today on Amazon, you can get it (plus a remote sensor) for an all-time low $199.      Eight Sleep Black Friday Sale      There are seemingly dozens of internet mattress companies these days, but Eight Sleep sets itself apart by piling on smart features, and you can try out most of their mattresses for $100 off, plus a $100 bonus Amazon gift card.      Advertisement      Advertisement      The mattresses themselves are basically what you’ve come to expect from internet mattresses these days: They’re blocks built from multiple layers of different types of foam. With Eight Sleep though, you do get to pick from three different tiers, including one with innersprings that should be more breathable. Whichever mattress you choose, you’ll probably like it just fine, and if you don’t like it, Eight Sleep offers the industry standard 100 night trial period, so you can return it for any reason.      Eight Sleep’s real magic comes from its unique mattress cover, which has smart features built in that you’ll actually want to use. It can track your restfulness, heart rate, and other sleep stats independently for each side of the bed, wake you up with a smart alarm when you’re not deep in a REM cycle, and even integrate with other smart home appliances. So you could conceivably change your thermostat temperature automatically when you get into bed, and start brewing coffee whenever you’re about to wake up.      The best feature though, without question, is dual zone temperature control. Yes, the mattress pad doubles as a smartphone-connected electric blanket to warm each side of the bed independently, which may not seem appealing right now, but you’ll thank the stars for it come winter.      Spend your money where you spend your time: in bed. We’ve been sleeping through the gauntlet of Internet mattresses, and not only is Leesa’s three-layer mattress our reigning champ, but the free pillow you get as part of this deal is our new favorite pillow.      The discounted mattress and pillow bundle starts at $665 for a full with code BFCM2017. The pillow is normally $75. Note the split date range this is valid for: 11.18-11.24 and 11.27. 100-night trial as always.      Advertisement      Advertisement      This deal is even bigger if you’re in the market for Leesa’s hybrid (foam + springs) Sapira mattress: $250 off with the same code.      Dyson dominates the list of our readers’ favorite vacuums, and two of their most popular uprights are on sale on Amazon.            First up, the Ball Multi Floor 2 features a smart cleaning head that automatically raises and lowers itself based on the kind of floor you’re on, ensuring that the vacuum always maintains tight suction for optimum cleaning. $250 is by far the best price Amazon’s ever offered on it.      If you have pets, you should probably spend $50 more to get the Animal version.      The Dyson Cinetic features the same cleaning head, but doesn’t require any filter maintenance, instead relying on oscillating tips inside the motor to separate dust, making it perfect for homes with pets. $450 is actually $50 less than we’ve seen it in Black Friday ads, so you can buy with confidence.      If you’re looking for a lightweight cord-free option, they have Dyson V6 Animal for $249, which is $120 off its usual price.      Black Friday’s $275 deal on the Roomba 690 is an all-time low, and a great deal considering it has Wi-Fi to enable app and Alexa control from anywhere. That means once you leave the house, you can use your phone to start your Roomba, and come home to clean floors.            The high-end Roomba 980 and 960 has also dropped to its Black Friday price of $800 and $600, respectively. Needless to say, those aren’t cheap, but they both include a suite of sensors that can map your house, and even show you on an app which rooms it’s cleaned, and which it still needs to get to. The main difference is that the 980 has more powerful suction, but honestly, the 960 will be good enough for most people.

Zappos is basically a one-stop shoe destination already, but right now, they’re having an actual sale, something they haven’t done in years.

If you’ve been putting off replacing the one you’ve been using for far too long, Amazon’s handbag Gold Box has more than a handful of options from both Rebecca Minkoff and Kate Spade, all from Shopbop’s Amazon storefront.

Their Black Friday Sale is basically a free-for-all. Use the code FRIDAY40 and take 40% off everything on the site, including sale styles. I mean, you can grab pairs for as low as $2, so you really have no excuse not to get a backup.      Anthropologie will always be a good destination to start looking for something unique. Right now, they’re taking 30% off everything in the store, including sale items and their insane home section. No code is needed to get the discount, just add all your stuff to your cart and checkout.      Sephora isn’t known for their discounts and deals like other retailers, but for Black Friday, they launched over 20 exclusive deals and sets, all for under $15. It’s not just single items either, it’s kits and sets that are perfect for de-stressing for the holidays, or the answer to your stocking stuffer inquiries. My recommendation is picking up the Bite Beauty Mini Multistick Duo or the Becca Wake Up Call set.      For as ridiculously cheap as e.l.f. Cosmetics is, they have some outstanding products. Right now, they’re even cheaper because the code CELEBRATE gets you half off orders of $30+ (excluding new and sale items), plus there’s automatically free shipping on orders of $25 or more. I highly recommend the Hydrating Bubble Mask and the Liquid Highlighter, and even though it’s not part of the sale, the Beauty Shield Magnetic Mask Kit is too cool to pass up.      For me, the most common answer to “Where did you get that?” is H&M. The stores are mad houses and the clearance sections are disorganized, but digging through them is so worth it. Right now, they’re having three sales in one. First, they have a massive, up to 70% off section, starting at $3. Second, they’re taking an extra 20% off, plus free shipping, with the code 1662. And third, they have an entire Black Friday Collection, which means limited edition items and prices.      In a twist of fate, Nordstrom Rack is having a clearance sale for Black Friday that’s even better than Clear the Rack. Starting today and going through Monday, you can get an additional 30% off Nordstrom Rack’s entire sale section, which is chock full of designer clothing in all styles.      You probably already got your Bean boots from last year and are ready for whatever 2017 throws at you (weather-wise, at least). But if you need to replace them, or if you somehow haven’t gotten a pair, they’re 25% off right now with the code FRIDAY25. Or, if you don’t need new boots, you can grab 20% off everything else with the code THANKS20, plus get a $10 gift card when you spend $50+.      LifeStraws are great backpack staples for hiking, or nice gifts for the outdoorsmen in your life. And right now, they’re just $14, which is about as cheap as you’re likely to see them.

With up to 40% off a ton of stuff, plus use the code ARC30 on any one single Arc’teryx item (which is great seeing as they’re always way too expensive) and get 30% off. Outerwear, boots, bags, and more are discounted, so maybe it’s time to think about going for a winter camping trip      Every person should have a good pair of sneakers and workout clothes in their closet that can actually function during athletic activities. If you haven’t gotten around to getting an actual pair of athletic shoes or need to layer up for your runs, Amazon is marking down New Balance gear today only, with everything coming in under $50.      Uniqlo’s affordability is sometimes thwarted by the shipping costs, so when there’s free shipping, you know it’s a big deal. But with Black Friday sales upon us, they’re marking down outwear, denim, HEATTECH, socks, sweaters, basically everything for the fall, and there’s free shipping. Is there such thing as a Thanksgiving miracle?      Nordstrom may not have all the deals that Nordstrom Rack does, but an extra 25% off isn’t something to scoff at. This early Black Friday discount spans every category, from men’s shoes, to beauty deals, to home goods. No code is needed to get the discount, but you’ll need to take some time to dig through because there are hundreds of deals.      The Philips Norelco OneBlade is the shaver of choice for every guy on our staff, and Amazon’s offering an unprecedented 50% discount on it for Black Friday.            If you aren’t familiar with this thing yet, Shane shared his thoughts about it on Lifehacker Gear:      I’m pretty blown away by the Philips OneBlade. I was expecting a deconstructed electric razor or a souped up Gillette Power-style situation, but the OneBlade is more like the next evolution of beard trimmers. The OneBlade can be used to get a close shave, edge, or trim down to your preferred length. It’s also washable and rechargeable, and the replaceable blades that last an estimated four months are already available on Subscribe and Save. The OneBlade can be used in the shower or over the sink, with or without shaving cream or oil. To be clear, this is not going to give you a straight razor-close shave, but it’s going to get you 99.5% of the way there in no time and with no irritation.      The OneBlade usually sells for $35, and occasionally sees modest discounts to $25-$35, but $17 blows away every previous promotion. I paid full price for it back in March of this year (I’m still on my original blade, for the record), and have zero regrets.

Then, you plug your phone into the USB port on the side of the stove, which is connected to a battery that is recharged by the flames. It’s completely bonkers, and yet it works.            Of course, this also works as a regular old camp stove, and at full power it can boil a liter of water in under five minutes. It’s also super light, and is about the size of a large water bottle, so it won’t take up too much space in your camping bag.

Philips Sonicare DiamondClean 9300 [White] $133 | Amazon | After $30 coupon      The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean attempts to fix the biggest problem with every other electric toothbrush: The person operating it.      I know people are skeptical about Bluetooth-connected apps for devices that have existed without them for decades, but the Sonicare app is actually really cool. From Shane’s Gear review:      It’s good then the app is amazing, and changes the toothbrushing game if you actually use it. The Connected app tracks where you’re brushing (and not brushing), how long you brush for, where you’re using too much force, and more. The app will also keep track of when you need to replace brush heads, and your dentist can even use the app to view your brushing data and make notes of where you need to make changes.      In terms of the brush itself, you get basically every feature under the sun—this is the top-of-the-line in the Sonicare family, after all—including that awesome wireless charging cup.

At the start of the holiday season consumer spending rose 16.8 percent year-over-year until 5 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracked 80 percent of online transactions at the top 100 U.S. retailers.      Surging online sales and a shift away from store shopping have thinned the crowds typically seen at stores on Thanksgiving evening and the day after, Black Friday, for the past two years. But a strong labor market, rising home prices and stock markets at record highs have improved shopper appetite this year.      Crowds at stores in many locations around the country were reported to be strong, according to analysts and retail consultants monitoring shopper traffic across the U.S.      "The turnout is clearly better than the last couple of years," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. "The parking lots are full and the outlet malls are busy."      The retail consultancy has 20 members studying customer traffic in different parts of the country.      Moody's retail analyst Charlie O' Shea, who was in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, reported healthy traffic at local stores including consumer electronics chain Best Buy, clothing store Old Navy and retailer Kohl's Corp.      "The weather is cooperating and people here are out," he said.      The National Retail Federation is projecting that sales for November and December will rise 3.6 percent to 4 percent this year, versus a 4 percent increase last year. Non-store sales, which include online sales and those from kiosks, are expected to rise 11 percent-15 percent to about $140 billion.      In New Jersey, around 50 people lined up a Macy's at the Westfield Garden State Plaza mall before it opened and around 200 people stood outside the Best Buy store, many to pick up their online orders.      An employee check computer inventory that is part of a 'Black Friday' sale at a Best Buy on November 24, 2016 in Orem, Utah. George Frey/Getty      "Me and my husband have a bigger place and we need a bigger TV for the living room," said Jenipher Gomes, who bought a 50-inch Samsung TV at Best Buy for $399.99. Shopper Hammad Farooq said he waited at the store for an hour to shop for laptops and monitors.      In Chicago, shoppers appeared to be slightly less enthusiastic to emerge from their turkey slumber and crowds were thin along the city's popular shopping destination, State Street.      "There's a few more people than normal but I wouldn't call this crowded at all," Deloitte auditor Eugenia Liew said as she shopped at discount retailer Target. "I expected a lot more people."      The holiday season spanning November and December is crucial for retailers because it can account for as much as 40 percent of annual sales. Retailers try to attract shoppers with deep discounts.      Average discounts ranged between 10 and 16 percent with the best deals online on Thanksgiving evening available for computers, sporting goods, apparel and video games, according to date from Adobe.      The number of customers shopping on their smartphones surged, accounting for 46 percent of the traffic on retail websites, while traffic from desktop and laptop computers declined 11 percent and nearly 6 percent respectively, according to the data. |||||	– Black Friday is here, and 2017's version looks like it might be the strongest one in recent years, reports Business Insider. Generally speaking, crowds are looking larger, perhaps thanks to metrics such as low unemployment and a rising stock market. "The turnout is clearly better than the last couple of years," says an analyst at Customer Growth Partners. Still, the frenzied madness of the day itself appears to be on the wane, as stores spread out sales to "Super Saturday" and, of course, online. During Thanksgiving week, 35% of holiday shoppers planned to get most of their shopping done on Black Friday, down from 59% in 2015, reports USA Today, citing a survey from PwC. Best online deals: Kinja is among the sites rounding up the best online deals for Black Friday, including Amazon tablets: the Fire 7 is $30, the Fire HD 8 is $50, and the Fire HD 10 is $100. Brick-and-mortar deals: Fortune has a guide to some of the best deals at the likes of Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. Target, for instance, is selling the Xbox One S 500GB for $189.99, a discount of $90. Thrillist looks specifically at Walmart. TVs: The New York Times thinks the best deals awaiting customers might be on high-end TV sets that typically run $2,000 or more. Discounts of 15% to 30% can save big money, and the Times has a guide on what to look for here.

He should resign. ||||| Story highlights Sen. Al Franken is under investigation from the Senate Ethics Committee      Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer weighed in Tuesday afternoon      (CNN) Embattled Sen. Al Franken will make an announcement Thursday, his office told reporters, as calls for the Minnesota Democrat's resignation -- led by female senators and later including party leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- rapidly gained momentum Wednesday.      Thirty-two Democratic senators -- 13 female and 19 male -- called on Franken to resign as allegations of sexual harassment against him continue to mount. Republican Sen. Susan Collins also called on Franken to quit.      In a statement on Facebook, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand wrote: "While Senator Franken is entitled to have the Ethics Committee conclude its review, I believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn't acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve."      Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Patty Murray of Washington, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Kamala Harris of California, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Dianne Feinstein of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii also joined in the call for Franken to resign.      Read More ||||| A majority of Senate Democrats on Wednesday called for the resignation of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) after determining that they could no longer tolerate his presence in their midst as a growing number of women accused him of sexual harassment.      They turned on one of their party's most popular figures with stunning swiftness, led by the Senate's Democratic women, who were joined in short order by more than half of the Democratic caucus.      "Enough is enough," Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said at a news conference. "We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is okay, none of it is acceptable. We as elected leaders should absolutely be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard, and we should fundamentally be valuing women. That is where this debate has to go."      Franken's office said he would make an announcement about his future on Thursday. Minnesota Public Radio reported Wednesday afternoon that Franken planned to resign, but Franken's office quickly denied it on Twitter. "Not accurate," the tweet stated. "No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family."      If he steps down soon, a replacement would be appointed by Minnesota's Democratic governor to serve until the 2018 election.      The drive to purge Franken, coming a day after Rep. John Con­yers Jr. (D-Mich.) resigned under pressure in the House, was a dramatic indication of the political toxicity that has grown around the issue of sexual harassment in recent months.      It also stood as a stark — and deliberate — contrast with how the Republicans are handling a parallel situation in Alabama, where Roy Moore, their candidate for U.S. Senate in next week's special election, is accused by women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.      Although most of the alleged actions took place before he was a senator, Franken was becoming a growing liability to his party, and Republicans had seized upon the allegations against him.      At Moore's Tuesday night rally, conservative pundit Gina Loudon declared that Republicans did not need lectures on morality from Democrats who had struggled with their own sex scandals, and cited both Conyers and Franken.      President Trump, himself the target of multiple allegations of sexual assault, has enthusiastically endorsed Moore, and the Republican Party is once again pouring money into the race after pulling back. Leading Senate Republicans have also toned down their negative comments about Moore, saying his fate should be up to the voters of Alabama and — if he is elected — the Senate Ethics Committee.      "I'm looking for where are the Republican voices? Where is their outrage?" Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said on CNN.      Republican leaders remained quiet amid the developments.      Asked about Franken, Senate GOP Whip John Cornyn (Tex.) said he would "leave it up to [Democrats] to deal with members of their own party."      The move by Senate Democrats to oust Franken marked a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the onetime "Saturday Night Live" star. The senator from Minnesota had emerged as one of the Trump administration's sharpest foils on Capitol Hill — and as a potential 2020 presidential contender.            Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) stood in front of journalists outside his Capitol Hill office on Nov. 27 to comment on the sexual harassment allegations against him. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)      Over the past three weeks, more than a half-dozen women have accused Franken of unwanted advances and touching. He apologized, saying in some cases that he had not intended to give offense and in others that he did not recall events as the women did.      The latest allegation against Franken came in a report published Wednesday by Politico. A former congressional aide whose name was withheld by the publication claimed that Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006, two years before his election to the Senate.      The woman claimed that Franken had told her, "It's my right as an entertainer."      Franken's alleged offenses were arguably less serious than those attributed to Moore, or to Conyers, the longest-serving member of Congress, who was accused of demanding sexual favors from the women who worked for him. Until late last week, it appeared that Franken's fellow Democrats would allow his case to work its way through the Senate Ethics Committee, a process that would take months and perhaps years to reach a resolution.      As recently as Nov. 26, Sen Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, had argued on CNN: "Al Franken has acknowledged what he did was wrong, and it was wrong. He has also submitted his whole case to the Senate Ethics Committee. I think that was the right thing to do. Let's have a hearing, an investigation. Let's let this really reach whatever conclusion it is going to reach, but through a due process."      But on Wednesday, Durbin expressed no such forbearance. "Senator Franken's conduct was wrong. He has admitted to it. And he should resign from the Senate."      Even as Senate Democrats expressed support publicly for leaving Franken's fate in the hands of the Ethics Committee, his female colleagues were increasingly unsettled as new accusers went public.      "People were at the edge of their patience with this. They'd had enough. One more allegation was going to be it," said one senior aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.      Another said female Democratic senators had been discussing it among themselves "on the Senate floor, even in the ladies' room."      "Many people have been talking about this for some time," Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said. "It wasn't coordinated. It just happened."      Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has served in the Senate longer than most of her female colleagues, said it was "significant that the women on his side of the aisle led the way" and added that she believed the latest allegation was "in some ways the final straw for people."

Scott Applewhite/AP)      Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who had stood by his friend in the wake of the allegations, called Franken after the Politico story broke early Wednesday and told him directly he had to resign, according to a person familiar with the call, who added that this came before other senators began calling for him to step down.      Schumer also met with Franken and his wife at the leader's apartment early afternoon to discuss resigning. The session ended without a firm commitment from Franken to do so, said the source, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the private exchange.      In recent days — before Wednesday's report — Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has known Franken for nearly two decades, had also told Franken he needed to step down, aides familiar with their discussions said. On Wednesday, Warren issued a short public statement, saying, "I think he should resign."      Franken had staved off public calls for his ouster last week, according to a person who has been in touch with the senator and his staff in recent days.      There was a "mad rush" last week to call on Franken to resign when more allegations surfaced, said the person, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about private discussions. "I think that people were talked off the ledge at that point and wanted to recollect and figure out if the Senate Ethics investigation should just move forward."      But, "I'm pretty sure that Al should have known that if there was another story that came out that there'd be a mass exodus away from him."      Outside the chamber, growing numbers of Democrats had been making the case that it was untenable for Franken to remain in the Senate if their party hoped to maintain the high ground on the issue.      Among those calling for Franken to step down was Doug Jones, Moore's Democratic opponent in Alabama.      And though she did not mention Franken by name, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had declared a policy of "zero tolerance" when she called last week for Conyers to leave the House. On Wednesday, Pelosi declared that she was "very proud of the fact that people are taking this matter head on and are trusting women who come forward, what they have to say."      More and more lawmakers are saying their concern over sexual harassment allegations should not be overridden by politics, or by the respect they have for each other's records and their shared positions on important policy matters.      Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) noted on Tuesday that her own efforts as a civil rights and immigration rights activist could not have succeeded without the early work of Conyers.      Despite that legacy, "I also hope that we can be clear about what our standard is for sexual harassment and make it very, very clear to every woman who is out there that you do not have to put up with this. It is not right, and most of us as women — I can tell you — know exactly what this has all been about," she said. "We've all been through various forms of this and I think it's essential that if people come to work in this body that they know that they have a safe environment. We have to be clear about that, whether it's a Republican, a Democrat, someone we love or someone we find distasteful."      Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), seen as a future caucus leader in the House, said this week's actions should serve as a warning to those who have been or may be accused of sexual wrongdoing.      "If you are a sexual harasser, go away. We don't want you, we don't want you as our colleague," she said Wednesday. "Our interns don't deserve that, our staff doesn't deserve it. The women members of Congress don't deserve it."      "Everybody's got to speak for themselves," she added later, "but this is not a place to be a sexual harasser."      David Weigel in Mobile, Ala., and Sean Sullivan in Washington contributed to this article.

After another woman, the seventh, came forward with allegations, Kirsten Gillibrand and other female Democratic senators called on him to resign Tuesday, reports the Washington Post. "While Senator Franken is entitled to have the Ethics Committee conclude its review, I believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn't acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve," Gillibrand wrote in a statement on Facebook. Senators including Mazie Hirono, Claire McCaskill, and Maggie Hassan quickly followed suit. Here's what else you need to know: As of this writing, 16 Democratic senators—10 women and six men—have called on Franken to resign, including Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the Senate's highest ranking woman, CNN reports. As calls for his resignation swelled, Franken's office announced the senator will make a statement on Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reports.
summarize: Government documents show the PayPal mogul has not met the residency requirements – but he has donated $1m to Christchurch earthquake relief      Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of Paypal, was granted New Zealand citizenship despite not meeting the usual requirements, new documents have revealed.      Details of Thiel’s application have been released which show that he was granted citizenship due to his “exceptional circumstances” and because it was believed to be in the public interest.      Thiel, who was one of the first investors in Facebook and is now an adviser to Donald Trump, was revealed last week to have been granted New Zealand citizenship. It also emerged that he has multiple million-dollar properties in New Zealand.      Donald Trump, Peter Thiel and the death of democracy Read more      The revelation came as a surprise to New Zealanders and public pressure has forced the release of 145 pages of documents by the country’s internal affairs department.      They show that Thiel, who was born in Germany, was granted citizenship despite not residing in the country for the prescribed 1,350 days, or having any intention to live in New Zealand on a permanent basis in the future. The formal citizenship process took place in a private ceremony in Santa Monica in 2011.      The documents said Thiel’s “exceptional circumstances” related to “his skills as an entrepreneur and his philanthropy”, which were deemed to be of potential benefit to New Zealanders and the country.            As part of his application, Thiel wrote: “I have studied extensively New Zealand’s entrepreneurial environment, the current venture capital market and the prerequisites for, and economic advantages of, developing successful technology companies in a New Zealand context … I have concluded that the New Zealand government supports capital expansion, scientific research and international investment.      “All of these traits make New Zealand a great place to a start a business. It is a stable country with one of the highest ratings in the world for honesty and a non-corrupt culture, and it offers long term entrepreneurial opportunities in technology development.      “As part of my study into how I could contribute to the existing entrepreneurial environment and further development of the venture capital market in New Zealand I have consulted with a variety of New Zealand political leaders, including meeting prime minister John Key, deputy prime minister Bill English and minister of economic development Gerry Brownlee.”      His business investments in New Zealand were also noted, including those in the companies Xero and Pacific Fibre Limited, as well as his intention to start a “technology incubator” in Auckland and use his San Francisco connections to provide US introductions for New Zealand businesses.            Sam Morgan (@samfromwgtn) Don’t think there is any debate about whether Peter has added value to New Zealand.      Sam Morgan (@samfromwgtn) Xero employs over 1500 people. Without Peter Thiel’s investment, that might never have happened, for example.      He added that although he did not live in his Auckland home or have any immediate plans to, it was almost permanently inhabited by his staff.      The documents said that Thiel demonstrated his philanthropic side by donating NZ$1m to the Christchurch earthquake relief fund.      According to Forbes magazine Thiel is worth $3.7bn and it was believed that his becoming a New Zealand citizen would help New Zealand entrepreneurs and enterprises be promoted on the world stage.            One of the requirements for New Zealand citizenship is that that applicant should be resident in the country for a majority of the time over a five-year period, and plan to reside in the country after citizenship, or work for a New Zealand company overseas.            Thiel did not meet either of these requirements as he had only visited the country on half a dozen occasions, and had no plans to permanently reside there, despite owning properties in Parnell and Queenstown.            Thiel’s application was supported by letters from a number of prominent New Zealand businessman, including Xero founder Rod Drury and Trade Me founder Sam Morgan.      Iain Lees-Galloway, Labour immigration spokesperson, queried Thiel’s citizenship process.      “The Government chose the day it announced the General Election date to finally release detail on theThiel decision, but it simply raises even more serious questions as to why a New Zealand passport needed to be granted to a wealthy foreign businessman who does not live here.            “Peter Thiel now has a New Zealand passport and still has not lived here. He didn’t even attend his New Zealand citizenship ceremony in this country, but stayed in the United States.      “It’s not clear what value New Zealand is getting from granting Mr Thiel citizenship over residency.” ||||| FILE - In this July 21, 2016, file photo, entrepreneur Peter Thiel speaks during the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel was able to gain New Zealand citizenship in 2011... (Associated Press)      WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Silicon Valley billionaire and President Donald Trump adviser Peter Thiel was able to gain New Zealand citizenship in 2011 despite never having lived in the country, because a top lawmaker decided his entrepreneurial skills and philanthropy were valuable to the nation, documents reveal.      Thiel didn't even have to leave California to become a new member of the South Pacific nation. He was granted citizenship during a private ceremony held at the New Zealand Consulate in Santa Monica.      The New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs on Wednesday released 145 pages of partially redacted documents detailing how Thiel became a citizen.      His status was first reported by The New Zealand Herald newspaper last month and raised questions because Thiel didn't fulfil the usual criteria requiring people to live in the country.      In his application, Thiel wrote that he owned a home in New Zealand but if he was granted citizenship, he would need to continue residing in the U.S. to manage his California-based companies.      He said he realized his circumstances wouldn't usually qualify him for citizenship, but that he believed he was an exception.      "In the course of pursing my international business opportunities, my travel, personal philosophical commitments and benefaction, I am happy to say categorically that I have found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future than New Zealand," he wrote.      He said that as part of his study into how he could contribute to the local entrepreneurial environment, he had consulted with John Key, who was New Zealand's prime minister at the time.      Thiel wrote that "it would give me great pride to let it be known that I am a New Zealand citizen."      Thiel didn't immediately respond to requests made Wednesday for additional comment.      However, Thiel's citizenship status only became publicly known following last month's newspaper report. The 2011 documents show that Thiel also remained a citizen of Germany, where he was born.      Thiel, 49, co-founded PayPal and was the first professional investor in Facebook. He secretly bankrolled a lawsuit against the news and gossip site Gawker which led to its bankruptcy and closure. Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.7 billion, which makes him one of New Zealand's wealthiest citizens.      He has been an important adviser to Trump, who has vowed to put "America first."      When considering Thiel's application, New Zealand officials noted that he had established a venture capital fund in New Zealand which had invested in a Wellington-based online accounting business, Xero.      "Mr. Thiel has demonstrated his philanthropy through making a million-dollar donation to the Christchurch earthquake relief fund," officials wrote as part of a letter recommending his application be approved.      His citizenship was granted through a special approval by lawmaker Nathan Guy, who at the time was the Internal Affairs minister.      Opposition lawmaker Iain Lees-Galloway tweeted Wednesday that the decision was "entirely about money" and that citizenship shouldn't be for sale.      Government figures show that over the past five years, New Zealand has received about 150,000 citizenship applications, with 92 receiving special approval by the minister after taking into account exceptional circumstances. |||||	– Trump adviser. Tech billionaire. Gawker killer. Lord of the Rings fan? The New York Times reports Peter Thiel was granted New Zealand citizenship back in 2011 despite not meeting any of the requirements for citizenship. Now at least one New Zealand politician is accusing Thiel of buying his citizenship. In his citizenship application—made public by the New Zealand government under pressure Tuesday—Thiel said "it would give me great pride" to let the world know he's a New Zealand citizen, according to the AP. Yet Thiel's New Zealand citizenship wasn't revealed until last week, and he's declining to comment on it. Thiel, who also has citizenship in Germany and the US, was the only major tech figure to support President Trump's executive order on immigration. In order to become a New Zealand citizen, applicants are required to live in the country for most of five-year period, plan on living there after gaining citizenship, or work for a New Zealand company abroad, the Guardian reports. Thiel didn't satisfy any of those requirements, having only visited the country a few times and receiving his citizenship at a ceremony in California. He did however invest in a number of New Zealand companies and tout the country as a "great place to start a business." His application was granted by the former minister of Internal Affairs under "exceptional circumstances," which included Thiel's "skills as an entrepreneur." But one New Zealand politician says citizenship was granted "entirely based on money." (Tech billionaires are buying land in New Zealand in preparation for the apocalypse.)
summarize: Batman's done it. Spider-Man too. Superman is about to try. As studios attempt to inject new life into overly familiar comic-book franchises, reboots — with changes in tone, directors and stars — are all the rage. But "Iron Man 3" proves there is more than one way to skin this particular cat.      The story of "Iron Man 3" is a continuation of the previous two films, and its key cast is the same. But like a stunt driver taking over the wheel while the car is moving at 100 mph, new director (and co-writer) Shane Black has managed to change this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. Call it a spiritual reboot.      That nifty maneuver was a bit easier than it sounds because Black has a history with star Robert Downey Jr. The two worked together on 2005's cult favorite private-eye film "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," with the actor clearly enjoying himself back then with Black's unmistakable style of oddball, hyper-verbal dialogue that has since become something of a trademark for the actor.      PHOTOS: 'Iron Man 3' premiere      There is quite a bit of Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic "Westworld" and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated.      The most interesting thing about this new "Iron Man" is that, far from being slicker than the first two versions, it is unexpectedly — and successfully — darker and more serious than its predecessors, with a cast including top actors like Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall.      With former director Jon Favreau reduced to his acting role as Happy Hogan, now the obsessive head of security for Stark Industries, this latest "Iron Man" (co-written by Drew Pearce) has thankfully done away with most of the previous installments' tone-deaf repartee between Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's indispensable (to him at least) Pepper Potts.      Pepper, now in charge of Stark Industries, is in residence at Stark's Malibu compound and sharing his life, though the man himself is far from his former carefree self. Skittish, uneasy, unable to sleep and given to compulsively building one high-maintenance Iron Man suit after another, Stark is still dealing with the anxiety attack aftereffects of fighting off all those aliens in last summer's "The Avengers," a movie which "Iron Man" blithely assumes everyone on the planet has seen (which may in fact be true).      PHOTOS: Shane Black: From ‘Lethal Weapon’ to ‘Iron Man 3′      Looking older and unsettled and lacking his usual self-confidence, Downey's still winningly charismatic Stark starts things off by taking us back in time to a scientific conference he attended in Switzerland in 1999, where his cocky, pre-anxiety self needlessly created enemies and alienated potential friends.      Stark was immediately attracted to scientist Maya Hanson (the always effective Hall), whom he snarkily describes as "the most gifted woman I've ever met … in Switzerland." Maya has found a way to get plants to regenerate themselves, though their tendency to explode in the process is admittedly worrisome.      The billionaire philanthropist isn't quite so enamored of Aldrich Killian (Pearce), another (albeit geekier) scientist. He blows off the young man, which turns out not to be the best idea he ever had.      These flashback introductions taken care of, Stark returns to the present, where his manic state is intensified by the televised manifestoes of the Mandarin, a ruthless international terrorist convincingly played by Kingsley, complete with Asian topknot and untraceable accent, a role that takes full advantage of the dark side credentials the actor established in "Sexy Beast." The film also raises some intriguing questions about how we as a society have a hand in creating our own enemies, our own demons.      PHOTOS: Summer Movie Sneaks      It's not just Kingsley who is effectively villainous. The film has given him a pair of expertly evil confederates in Eric Savin (James Badge Dale, the gaunt cancer patient in "Flight") and Brandt (Stephanie Szostak). On the other side, Stark ally Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) has been rebranded from "War Machine" to "Iron Patriot" by an image-conscious focus group.      Meanwhile, Killian, geeky no more, presents himself to Pepper as the head of an organization called Advanced Idea Mechanics that is seeking funding for a technology he calls Extremis, which will in effect create invulnerability by allowing the body to heal itself. Pepper, always a worrier, is concerned what would happen if this kind of revolutionary technology fell into the wrong hands, but Killian tells her not to be concerned.      As if all this weren't head-spinning enough, Stark manages to focus the Mandarin's omni-directional hostility toward himself personally, with catastrophic results. Which leads to the question, is Iron Man still Iron Man if he has to fight evil without the help of his suits?      Because it is, finally, a comic-book superhero movie, "Iron Man 3" does tend to fall back on massive explosions and action set pieces as the conclusion nears. But by even posing questions of identity, the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in, and for a superhero movie, that is an accomplishment in and of itself.      kenneth.turan@latimes.com      -------------      'Iron Man 3'      MPAA rating: PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout, and brief suggestive content      Running time: 2 hours, 10 minutes      Playing: In general release             ||||| At one point, in “Iron Man 3,” a bomb goes off. To reveal this is hardly to give away the plot. Another bang, here or there, is unlikely to make much difference, given that the movie, like most of the films that are culled from Marvel comics, is an oratorio of aggressive sound. Wherever you sit, the aisles are full of noises. I saw “Iron Man 3” in a barnlike cinema, with almost seventeen hundred seats, few of them untaken, and, as the smoke of the explosion cleared, an awkward silence drifted over the audience. Two days before, there had been a real bomb, in a real city, that had caused real deaths and injuries, and now, for a moment, the whole diverting fakery of a movie franchise—the machinery of the Marvellous—had brushed against the live wire of unfeigned pain. There was a jolt. It wasn’t just a matter of bad timing; it was a power surge of mass embarrassment, verging on shame. Had we really congregated in this place to savor the spectacle of bodies being flung around by the machinations of an evil plan?      If some of that disquiet persists, it’s because “Iron Man 3” is itself goaded by unease. The first thing we hear is a mumbling voice-over from Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), which tells us nothing and dribbles to a halt. Stark came out as Iron Man at the end of the first film, and his pride has grown petulant and vain—“You know who I am,” he declares in the new movie. The same line is used by his nemesis, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a bearded, untraceable figure who is busy disturbing the peace around the world and promising total apocalypse. For a smoother brand of badness, try Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who thinks that he can mess with our DNA and engender “a new iteration of human evolution.” Take away the toys, in all three cases, and what are you left with? Boys. . . . ||||| An Avenger coasts out West      By Ann Hornaday      Friday, May 3, 2013      In his recent keynote address at the San Francisco International Film Festival, during which he consigned most of modern filmmaking to a dust--heap of once--shiny detritus and disposable trash, Steven Soderbergh made a keenly observed distinction between movies and cinema, noting that “a movie is something you see, and cinema is something that’s made.”      It’s difficult to see how that pithily elegant rubric might accommodate “Iron Man 3,” which seems designed less as an artisanal object or visual entertainment than a full--body assault on the senses.      A frantic, occasionally funny, finally enervating bricolage of special effects, explosive set pieces, sardonic one--liners and notional human emotions, this branch of the Marvel franchise tree feels brittle and over--extended enough to snap off entirely. From its anxious protagonist and the battered metal sheaths he dons to save the world to the clattering, fiery mayhem that ensues with metronomic predictability, “Iron Man 3” is less a movie than a final war whoop let loose before utter exhaustion sets in.      Which isn’t to say that this installment doesn’t have its moments. Taking the reins from series director Jon Favreau, Shane Black has enlisted a fine ensemble to bring a beloved chapter of Tony Stark’s saga to life, including a crafty Ben Kingsley as villain--du--jour the Mandarin. After a prologue in which Tony meets scientists Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) in Switzerland, the story catches up with our playboy--inventor--superhero in the present day, shortly after he has lit up New York with the rest of his Marvel brothers in “The Avengers.” Plagued by his brush with death, Tony can’t sleep, and nearly every encounter with a fan or mention of “New York” sends him into paroxysms of anxiety. Having met Norse gods and touched the Big Nothing, he worries, “I’m just a man in a can.”      Robert Downey Jr. plays the existential angst the way he plays all of Tony’s feelings in “Iron Man 3,” with a glib, whip--crack off--handedness that would have been at home in a 1940s screwball comedy, and that has helped levitate the “Iron Man” series from being a mere exercise in CGI bombast and macho over--compensation. His banter with computer--valet Jarvis (delightfully voiced by Paul Bettany), as well as with body man Happy Hogan (Favreau), love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the various fans he encounters on his travels accounts for most of the laughs in “Iron Man 3,” which will take Tony from his post--modern Malibu aerie to Tennessee and Florida.      Some of the picture’s best moments transpire between Tony and a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins), who helps his hero with a digital Dora watch and some spare parts from his potato gun.      One of the big draws of "Iron Man 3" is seeing how Tony will deploy the band of "brobots" he has been building in his workshop in Malibu. He and his cohorts -- including Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) -- slip in and out of so many aerodynamic sarcophagi that "Iron Man 3" begins to take on the contours of "Attack of the Clones" (with all the unfortunate associations such a comparison suggests).      After a frenetic attack on Tony’s Malibu dream house, the decimation of downtown Los Angeles by a pack of molten--skinned bad guys and a daring mid--air rescue, there’s nowhere to go but bigger and louder. The great danger of “Iron Man” has always been that it winds up looking and sounding like “Transformers,” as those metallic body--pods hurl themselves at Tony with punishing ballistic force. This iteration is no different, even though it’s not just Tony who turns into a knight in clanking, occasionally malfunctioning, armor.      The occasional twists notwithstanding, “Iron Man 3” doesn’t pack much by way of surprise or invention. Presumably it will still satisfy what the audience has come to expect from the series (“Iron Man 3” already has cleared $240 million overseas). But, especially after the bright, lively “Avengers” last summer, it feels murky and draggy, all the more so for 3--D photography that saps its crowded, busy images of dynamic range.      At one point, Tony presents Pepper with a Christmas gift of a huge, goofy, overstuffed rabbit ---- a seemingly obvious Trojan Bunny that winds up having no narrative function whatsoever. Sometimes a huge, goofy, overstuffed rabbit is just a huge, goofy, overstuffed rabbit ---- and even a huge, goofy, overstuffed rabbit can get a little threadbare.      “Iron Man 3” ends with a tone of finality which, even if it’s ersatz, feels like a well--earned respite. It seems only fair to let the man in the can rest in peace, at least for now.      Contains sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout, and for brief suggestive content. |||||	– The latest installment in the Iron Man franchise follows up on the Avengers—and, with its terrorist themes, arrives at an uncomfortable time, critics note. Wonders Anthony Lane in the New Yorker: "Had we really congregated in this place to savor the spectacle of bodies being flung around by the machinations of an evil plan?" As for the film itself: It's got "an uncommon zest and zip," writes Lane, along with a twist that "signals both the making of Iron Man 3 and, with any luck, the possible unmaking of the genre. From here on, the dumb-ass grandeur around which superhero plots revolve can no longer be taken on trust." In the New York Times, Manohla Dargis isn't particularly impressed. The movie, "despite the needless addition of 3D and negligible differences in quips, gadgets, villains, and the type of stuff blown up, plays out much like the first two movies." As for Robert Downey Jr., "the role has gradually, maybe inexorably, swallowed him. He no longer necessarily does—and probably isn't asked to do—the hard work of a real performance." Kenneth Turan calls the movie a "spiritual reboot" of the franchise in the Los Angeles Times. It "does tend to fall back on massive explosions and action set pieces as the conclusion nears. But by even posing questions of identity, the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in, and for a superhero movie, that is an accomplishment in and of itself." In the Washington Post, Ann Hornaday writes that the film "seems designed less as an artisanal object or visual entertainment than a full-body assault on the senses," she writes. It's "a frantic, occasionally funny, finally enervating bricolage of special effects, explosive set pieces, sardonic one-liners and notional human emotions."
summarize: Sorry, the old Nutella can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh ... because it's slightly different now.      Ferrero has quietly changed the recipe for its beloved hazelnut spread, a move that was first noticed by the Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre, a German consumer group.      SEE ALSO: YouTubers put a gigantic DIY spin on a beloved chocolate bar      According to a Facebook post from the group, Nutella's sugar content increased from 55.9 percent to 56.3 percent. The presence of skim milk powder (yum) increased from 7.5 percent to 8.7 percent — likely sacrificing some cocoa in the process. The spread's fat content, however, decreased from 31.0 percent to 30.9 percent.      The result? A Nutella that's a little more sugary and a little bit lighter in hue.      For many Nutella fans, this was not good news. A surprising number of people were incensed that Ferrero dared mess with something so adored.      You know the old adage: if it ain't broke, don't add more milk powder to it!      How dare they tamper with Nutella's recipe.

Per the Guardian, it maintained that "the quality ... and all other aspects of Nutella remain the same."      Goodbye, old Nutella. We'll miss eating entire jars of you over the course of a single weekend, then feeling terrible for a full 24 hours afterward. Rest in peace. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Something new and unbelievable is making headlines today. No, not Trump's Twitter page. The other thing. No, not the new iOS update. The other, other thing. It's Nutella. Before you go into panic-mode, the famous hazelnut spread isn't going anywhere; but it has gotten a little update. For reasons unbeknownst to us, Nutella changed their recipe, leaving the people of the internet shocked and dismayed.      What's not to like about Nutella? Its creaminess. Its smooth texture. Its insanely sweet taste that makes your teeth ache due to the high sugar content. The list goes on and on. For years, it's been a dietary staple for millions. Thanks to Ferrero, Nutella has warmed the hearts of many not only due to its taste but also its versatility. Spread it on some toast for a sweet breakfy. Scoop some into your cookie batter for a delicious baked surprise. Eat it straight out of the jar with a spoon when nobody is looking and pin the blame on someone else. Nutella has been there for us through thick and thin; so fans were surprised to hear whispers that Ferrero had adjusted the recipe, because... why? Why change something that’s already so magical?      It was first caught by the German consumer group Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre. They explained on their Facebook page the differences between the old and new Nutella: because there wasn't enough sugar in it already, it went up from 55.9 percent to 56.3 percent. Skim milk powder increased from 7.5 percent to 8.7 percent. And in an unlikely twist of events, fat went from 31 percent... down to 30.9 percent.      The final result? A sweeter Nutella that's a slightly lighter shade of brown.      To some, it may not seem like a huge deal. It's not like they completely revamped the famous and beloved hazelnut spread; regardless, Twitter erupted with disgruntled fans flabbergasted that Ferrero changed the recipe at all, since you can't make something better when it's already perfect. You know what they say: if it ain't broke...      The Nutella recipe has come under fire before but for a slightly different reason: its use of palm oil — an ingredient that apparently remains unchanged after this most recent recipe update. After the European Food Safety Authority deemed palm oil a "potential health concern," consumers began expressing concern over its use in Nutella — something, the company says, that helps make it so spreadable. Nutella's not the only one who uses it, either; you might be surprised to find palm oil in all kinds of candies and baked goods, and even in toothpaste, makeup, shampoo, and soap. While some brands have removed it from their products, Nutella has maintained that the almighty spread is safe to consume, palm oil and all.      Whether it's because they want to avoid palm oil or they're just looking to make a healthier version all together, some people have taken matters into their own hands and come up with their own Nutella recipes. You'll find that many recipes call for the same handful of ingredients — hazelnuts (obvi), milk chocolate, vegetable oil, confectioners' sugar, and cocoa powder. The possibilities with Nutella — whether that be store-bought or homemade — are truly endless. People come up with all sorts of creative (and tasty) ideas. Behold, and salivate.      The sky is the limit. The chocolatey, smooth, delicious, creamy limit.      While the new recipe may look a little different and #NutellaGate may have broken the internet a little, we're confident this is the same tastebud-tingling Nutella that we fell in love with years ago. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Learn more ||||| This article is over 1 year old      Company admits it has ‘fine-tuned’ the chocolate spread to include more fat, more sugar and fewer hazelnuts      It’s the gloopy chocolate and hazelnut spread that has become a worldwide food phenomenon, whether slathered on toast or eaten straight from the jar by the spoonful.      But aficionados of Nutella are up in arms after discovering that the recipe has been secretly changed, with more sugar and fat – but fewer hazelnuts.      Ferrero, Nutella’s Italian manufacturer, admitted it had carried out “fine-tuning” but insisted the nutritional value of the new version was similar to its predecessor.      The recipe tweaks had been spotted by the eagle-eyed German consumer group Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre and revealed on its Facebook page. It claimed the new recipe has increased the content of powdered skimmed milk from 7.5% to 8.7%, and sugar from 55.9% to 56.3%.      Furious Nutella fans took to Twitter to criticise the changes, using the hashtag #boycottNutella.      @RoshhNosh said:            roshy ✖️ (@RoshhNosh) How dare they tamper with Nutella's recipe. Leave the chocolatey goodness alone      @AllesParr tweeted: Not a good idea to mess with #Nutella lovers!      Another wrote: “If the rumours of #Nutella changing their recipe are true, I am boycotting them.”      And another fan said Ferrero “should be reducing sugar content in this day and age”.      In a statement Ferrero confirmed the changes had been made but insisted that “the quality ... and all other aspects of Nutella remain the same”.            The nutritional content of Nutella has not been without controversy. Earlier this year fans were shocked by a “deconstructed” photo of its raw ingredients – shown in layers of a jar – that revealed the high sugar content.      “We are shocked to see Nutella has ramped up the amount of sugar in its already sweet product,” said Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar.      “Based on their original formulation which has less sugar than the new formula, just two slices of bread with Nutella (24g sugar) contains the entire maximum daily intake of 7 to 10-year-olds. Eaten over the duration of a week that’s 168g of sugar – the equivalent amount found in two and a half boxes of Maltesers (120g box). Nutella is high in sugar and should not be eaten every day.”            Nutella also contains palm oil, which causes concern because of possible links to cancer as well as its damaging environmental impact. But Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year.            Chocolate fans can be unsettled by tweaks to their favourite products. In November last year the confectionery giant Mondelēz sparked uproar by changing the shape of the popular Toblerone bar, a move fans described as “stupid”, “ridiculous” and “just plain dumb”.      And in 2015 consumers of Cadbury’s Fruit & Nut chocolate bars reacted with fury after the company changed the recipe for the first time in 90 years to include sultanas. Other recent changes to Jaffa Cakes and Walnut Whips have also irked devotees.            • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.             ||||| See more of Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg on Facebook ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||	– Does your Nutella taste different lately? That's because Ferrero, the maker of the hazelnut cocoa spread, has changed the recipe—without announcing the move. Rather, the Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre, a German consumer group, noticed the difference and posted about it on Facebook; it says Ferrero is "the first to change the recipe of Nutella for many years." The sugar content went from 55.9% to 56.3%, while skim milk powder went from 7.5% to 8.7%. (Mashable reports that probably caused some cocoa to be lost in the new recipe, which would explain why the new version is slightly lighter in color.) Meanwhile, the fat content went from 31% to 30.9%. Ferrero confirms changes have been made to the recipe, but says in a statement to the Guardian, "the quality ... and all other aspects of Nutella remain the same." (The Guardian claims there are also fewer hazelnuts in the new recipe.) The news led to calls on Twitter to #boycottNutella. "Don’t experiment with my brown jar of happiness," one unhappy consumer tweeted. Added another, "I mean.... should I even get out of bed today?" As Bustle notes, Nutella has previously come under fire for its use of the controversial ingredient palm oil.
summarize: August 20, 2011      Toronto, Ontario      Dear Friends,      Tens of thousands of Canadians have written to me in recent weeks to wish me well. I want to thank each and every one of you for your thoughtful, inspiring and often beautiful notes, cards and gifts. Your spirit and love have lit up my home, my spirit, and my determination.      Unfortunately my treatment has not worked out as I hoped. So I am giving this letter to my partner Olivia to share with you in the circumstance in which I cannot continue.      I recommend that Hull-Aylmer MP Nycole Turmel continue her work as our interim leader until a permanent successor is elected.      I recommend the party hold a leadership vote as early as possible in the New Year, on approximately the same timelines as in 2003, so that our new leader has ample time to reconsolidate our team, renew our party and our program, and move forward towards the next election.      A few additional thoughts:      To other Canadians who are on journeys to defeat cancer and to live their lives, I say this: please don’t be discouraged that my own journey hasn’t gone as well as I had hoped. You must not lose your own hope. Treatments and therapies have never been better in the face of this disease. You have every reason to be optimistic, determined, and focused on the future. My only other advice is to cherish every moment with those you love at every stage of your journey, as I have done this summer.      To the members of my party: we’ve done remarkable things together in the past eight years. It has been a privilege to lead the New Democratic Party and I am most grateful for your confidence, your support, and the endless hours of volunteer commitment you have devoted to our cause. There will be those who will try to persuade you to give up our cause. But that cause is much bigger than any one leader. Answer them by recommitting with energy and determination to our work. Remember our proud history of social justice, universal health care, public pensions and making sure no one is left behind. Let’s continue to move forward. Let’s demonstrate in everything we do in the four years before us that we are ready to serve our beloved Canada as its next government.      To the members of our parliamentary caucus: I have been privileged to work with each and every one of you. Our caucus meetings were always the highlight of my week. It has been my role to ask a great deal from you. And now I am going to do so again. Canadians will be closely watching you in the months to come. Colleagues, I know you will make the tens of thousands of members of our party proud of you by demonstrating the same seamless teamwork and solidarity that has earned us the confidence of millions of Canadians in the recent election.      To my fellow Quebecers: On May 2nd, you made an historic decision. You decided that the way to replace Canada’s Conservative federal government with something better was by working together in partnership with progressive-minded Canadians across the country. You made the right decision then; it is still the right decision today; and it will be the right decision right through to the next election, when we will succeed, together. You have elected a superb team of New Democrats to Parliament. They are going to be doing remarkable things in the years to come to make this country better for us all.      To young Canadians: All my life I have worked to make things better. Hope and optimism have defined my political career, and I continue to be hopeful and optimistic about Canada. Young people have been a great source of inspiration for me. I have met and talked with so many of you about your dreams, your frustrations, and your ideas for change. More and more, you are engaging in politics because you want to change things for the better. Many of you have placed your trust in our party. As my time in political life draws to a close I want to share with you my belief in your power to change this country and this world. There are great challenges before you, from the overwhelming nature of climate change to the unfairness of an economy that excludes so many from our collective wealth, and the changes necessary to build a more inclusive and generous Canada. I believe in you. Your energy, your vision, your passion for justice are exactly what this country needs today. You need to be at the heart of our economy, our political life, and our plans for the present and the future.      And finally, to all Canadians: Canada is a great country, one of the hopes of the world. We can be a better one – a country of greater equality, justice, and opportunity. We can build a prosperous economy and a society that shares its benefits more fairly. We can look after our seniors. We can offer better futures for our children. We can do our part to save the world’s environment. We can restore our good name in the world. We can do all of these things because we finally have a party system at the national level where there are real choices; where your vote matters; where working for change can actually bring about change. In the months and years to come, New Democrats will put a compelling new alternative to you. My colleagues in our party are an impressive, committed team. Give them a careful hearing; consider the alternatives; and consider that we can be a better, fairer, more equal country by working together. Don’t let them tell you it can’t be done.      My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world.      All my very best,      Jack Layton ||||| Family, friends and colleagues are remembering NDP Leader Jack Layton as news starts to sink in that the politician known for his warmth and personality has died.      Friends and political foes alike praised Layton on Monday for his warmth, optimism and respect for opponents.      People who squared off politically against Layton, including former prime ministers Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, as well as Prime Minister Stephen Harper and interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae, all spoke warmly about the NDP leader's commitment to Canadians.      Layton, who led Canada's Official Opposition, died early Monday morning at his Toronto home after a battle with cancer. He was 61.      Layton's wife, Olivia Chow, and his children, Sarah and Michael Layton, issued a statement announcing his death.      "We deeply regret to inform you that the Honourable Jack Layton, leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, passed away at 4:45 am today, Monday August 22. He passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by family and loved ones," the statement read.      State funeral Saturday      Layton will be honoured with a state funeral Saturday in Toronto, senior NDP officials have told CBC News.      The government protocol office is working with the NDP and family of the NDP leader on exactly what the funeral will be.      Condolence books will be set up in Ottawa on Parliament Hill and in Toronto at city hall. Others will be located in NDP constituency offices across the country.      On Monday, mourners, many bearing flowers and other tributes, arrived at Layton's Toronto constituency office. Friends and areas residents also arrived at his home on the quiet side street where he lived with Chow.      Social media was used to quickly organize public tributes, including gatherings on Parliament Hill, and a rally in Toronto. Later Monday evening, several hundred people came together for a vigil outside the Vancouver Art Gallery.      On Monday evening, hundreds of people were near the Centennial Flame at Parliament Hill, many leaving flowers, cans of Orange Crush that symbolize the NDP's official colour, and notes. The crowd, many bearing candles, sang O Canada as the sun set.      The family released a letter from Layton to Canadians just after noon.      Layton had been battling new cancer      Layton's death comes less than a month after he announced to the country that he was fighting a new form of cancer and was taking time off for treatment. Layton had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in late 2009 and underwent treatment for it. He continued working throughout that time and also battled a broken hip earlier this year. Layton used a cane for much of his time on the campaign trail this spring as he led the NDP to a historic victory on May 2.      His party claimed 103 seats, and was propelled to official Opposition status. Layton and his party were getting used to their new roles in Parliament but he did not appear to be in good health near the end of June. He said he felt pain and stiffness, he underwent tests and they confirmed he had a new form of cancer. He did not disclose what kind of cancer.      Layton's chief of staff, Anne McGrath, said Monday that Layton's condition took a quick turn for the worse Sunday night.      She spent a few hours with him Saturday and had a sense that he was losing a battle, but says his campaign slogan – don't let them tell you it can't be done – was also a personal slogan.      "It is a huge loss. It is a huge loss for me personally, but it's a huge loss also for our party and our country," she said.      McGrath worked with Layton for nearly a decade.      "There's no question that my heart is broken," she said.      McGrath said Layton was thinking about what it would mean for the party if he died. When they spoke on Saturday, they talked about upcoming events like the party's annual caucus retreat in September and what Parliament would be like if he weren't there.      Layton always liked to be presented with options, McGrath told Evan Solomon on CBC's Power & Politics, including a plan for what would happen if he died.      "He was very, very practical and he was very much wanting to know that we were going to be able to continue and we were going to be strong," she said.      After the news of Layton's death emerged shortly after 8 a.m. ET, friends, colleagues and Canadians reacted quickly and with shock, sadness and tears. The flag on the Peace Tower was lowered to half-mast.      Harper saddened by news      Layton's last letter "My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we'll change the world," Jack Layton writes just days before his death. Read more      Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Layton will be remembered for the force of his personality and his dedication to public life.      Speaking from the foyer of the House of Commons, Harper said the two leaders had always talked about getting together to jam.      "I will always regret the jam session that never was. That is a reminder, I think, that we must always make time for friends, family and loved ones, while we still can," he said.      In a statement earlier Monday, Harper saluted Layton's contribution to public life and said it would be sorely missed.      "I know one thing: Jack gave his fight against cancer everything he had. Indeed, Jack never backed down from any fight," he said.      Tributes to Layton poured in from across party lines. Rae said the news took his breath away and that Layton's death is not just a loss for the NDP, but for all Canadians.      "It's a loss for the country because he was a political guy who believed strongly in politics and who had a lot of resilience and a lot of guts," Rae told CBC News.      NDP colleagues shocked      Longtime NDP leader and MP Ed Broadbent told CBC News he sensed the end was coming, but was still shocked when he got the call Monday morning.      "In each and every election, he moved us forward ... he wanted a reason in politics," Broadbent said.      "Canada has lost a great politician. A man who believed in working for the public good. And I've lost a personal friend."      Interim NDP Leader Nycole Turmel spoke of one of Layton's favourite quotes from Tommy Douglas, the founder of the CCF, the NDP's forerunner. Layton included the quote in every email he sent: “Courage my friends, ‘tis never too late to build a better world.”      "Jack was a courageous man. It was his leadership that inspired me, and so many others, to run for office," Turmel said in her statement.      "We – members of Parliament, New Democrats and Canadians – need to pull together now and carry on his fight to make this country a better place."      NDP deputy leader Libby Davies, fighting back tears, said Layton's death is "an incredible loss."      "Jack was not only a great leader of the NDP, he's someone that Canadians across the country came to love. We feel a tremendous sense of loss and grief," she said.      Davies said Layton brought a sense of humanity to Canadian politics and in his career and his life, especially his battle with cancer, "he gave it his all."      "We have only love and respect for everything that he did and he leaves some really important legacies in Canadian politics," she said.      The NDP appointed Turmel to take over for Layton temporarily. Layton wanted to be back at work in time for Parliament's fall session in mid-September.      Jack Layton, speaking at the NDP's 50th anniversary convention in June, led his party past the Liberals to become the Official Opposition during the spring election. Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press Douglas' daughter, Shirley, says Layton was the same whether he was in a crowded room or meeting people one-on-one.      "Everywhere I've gone, people said 'You know, we've got a leader who cared'," she told CBC News.      Douglas says she's worried about Chow.      "That's the one person I keep thinking about all morning," she said. "They were so close and when a marriage that is as close as that one ... it's a terrible thing to see that marriage broken apart by this. I just couldn't say enough to her. She's a tremendous woman on her own."      The leader of the Official Opposition announced on July 25 he was stepping away from the job to concentrate on his cancer treatment. He told Canadians he had recently been diagnosed with a new form of cancer, in addition to the prostate cancer he had earlier battled. |||||	– Jack Layton has died of cancer barely three months after leading the New Democratic Party to its strongest-ever result in Canada. The 61-year-old, who shocked the country only a few weeks ago when he announced he was stepping aside as the official opposition leader because of health issues, died yesterday of an undisclosed form of cancer and will receive a state funeral, the CBC reports. Tributes to Layton, who led the social democratic party for nine years, have poured in from across the political spectrum. After his death, Layton's family released a final letter to Canadians in which he addressed his battle with cancer and his vision for a better Canada. "To other Canadians who are on journeys to defeat cancer and to live their lives, I say this: please don’t be discouraged that my own journey hasn’t gone as well as I had hoped. You must not lose your own hope," he wrote. "Treatments and therapies have never been better in the face of this disease. You have every reason to be optimistic, determined, and focused on the future. My only other advice is to cherish every moment with those you love at every stage of your journey, as I have done this summer."
summarize: The driver of the first of two San Francisco Fire Department rigs that struck a 16-year-old survivor of the Asiana Airlines plane crash in July was alerted less than 15 minutes earlier to avoid the girl as she lay on the ground, newly obtained camera footage shows.      The footage, taken by a dashboard camera aboard the rig and reviewed Thursday by The Chronicle, sheds new light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Ye Meng Yuan. She survived the crash at San Francisco International Airport, but died after being hit by the fire rigs, according to the San Mateo County coroner.      Several firefighters who responded to the July 6 crash have told investigators they believed Ye was dead and that they had concentrated on rescuing passengers and crew members who were still aboard the burning Boeing 777. No one has reported checking her vital signs, however.      The rig camera's footage shows that although the plane had crashed just a few minutes earlier, passengers were gone from the area where Ye lay crumpled, and at one point a firefighter walked past her without looking down.      Sprayed with foam      It also shows that the first rig that ran over Ye sprayed much of the flame-retardant foam that came to obscure her from firefighter drivers. When the rig initially pulled up to the plane, the girl was lying on bare ground, the footage shows.      The Chronicle reviewed a copy of the footage supplied by a source, who stipulated that it not be posted online because of its graphic nature.      The recording shows the rig, driven by firefighter Jimmy Yee, approaching the scene within minutes after the 11:27 a.m. crash, black smoke curling above the wrecked airliner. The rig was forced to stop repeatedly to allow passengers to flee the area.      About five minutes after arriving, the rig was positioned at the front of the left wing, where Ye was on the ground.      At 11:36 a.m., the dashboard camera's footage showed a man identified by investigators as firefighter Roger Phillips waving his arms to direct Yee around the girl. The rig waited for a moment to allow another firefighter to walk between the vehicle and the girl. That firefighter didn't pause or look at Ye and continued toward the plane.      Looked dead      Phillips later told investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board that the girl was in the fetal position, her eyes rolled up, her face waxen and wearing a grimace.      He described her as resembling a CPR training mannequin and said she appeared to be dead. Yee has told Fire Department investigators that as he drove by, he saw what he took to be a dead victim.      Phillips said he told a higher-ranking firefighter, Lt. Christine Emmons, about the girl and that she replied: "Yes, yes, OK, OK. We've gotta get a line inside," referring to the need to get a hose into the burning craft as part of an effort to rescue victims.      '3-second' check      Emmons told the federal investigators she had done a "three-second" visual assessment of the girl and considered her to be "our first casualty."      She said she had tried to make sure that the numerous fire rigs driving around the plane did not run her over, but she does not appear in the dashboard footage reviewed Thursday. The footage shows no firefighter attempting to move Ye or mark her with a casualty flag, as first responders commonly do at disaster scenes.      After Yee drove around the girl, he sprayed foam at the fuel leak on the plane's left wing, then maneuvered to aim his front-mounted nozzle at the burning fuselage at 11:46 a.m.      By then, the footage shows, Phillips had left the scene - the federal investigation found that he went onto the plane - and no firefighters were near Ye. The rig's foam gradually covered the girl, and Yee, working without a spotter, advanced on the plane.      At 11:50 a.m., the rig ran over the girl, the footage shows. Yee drove away from the spot three minutes later. Yee did not say in his accounts to the department or federal investigators whether he realized he had driven over anything.      Less than 11 minutes after Ye was hit the first time, a second rig ran over the girl, who was now completely covered in foam, according to footage shot by another firefighter's helmet camera. Like Yee, the driver of the second rig, firefighter Elyse Duckett, was working without a spotter.      It has never been clear how Ye ended up where she was struck. Her parents, Gan Ye and Xiao Yun Zheng of China, filed a legal claim against the city this week, accusing firefighters of "deliberately and knowingly abandoning" the girl in a spot where "they knew she would be in harm's way."      'Inexplicable'      Their attorney, Anthony Tarricone, said Thursday that firefighters' handling of the incident was "inexplicable."      "This makes it clear that several members of the Fire Department responding team knew she was there, did nothing to help her, never examined her and then abandoned her in a position where she was in peril," Tarricone said. "They left her in a perilous position, covered her with foam and then ran her over."      The city attorney's office has not responded to the claim, the likely precursor to a lawsuit.      Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White has called Ye's death a "tragic accident" and has not moved to file disciplinary charges against any of the firefighters for their actions. She has declined to comment further in recent weeks, citing the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation into the crash.      Assistant Deputy Chief Dale Carnes, who commands firefighters based at the airport, told the federal safety board last month that the department regretted the "insult to the deceased."      "This is not a matter of us being careless or callous," Carnes said. "It was the fact we were dealing with a very complex environment." ||||| CBS News has obtained video never seen publicly before that shows the chaotic scene of the Asiana Airlines crash landing in San Francisco last summer, where a 16-year-old who survived was later killed by a fire truck.      The video is important because it may answer a key question: How was Ye Meng Yuan later run over by the truck?      The teenager was one of three people from the plane to die; 304 others survived.            Close CBS News      Her parents are suing the city of San Francisco, claiming that the rescuers were reckless and poorly trained.      Video from a camera mounted on a firefighter's helmet was provided to CBS News by a source close to the family of Ye Meng Yuan. Other video comes from the fire truck.            "They say everybody is off," says a firefighter. "Just don't go in there. Anybody's in there right now, they're dead."            Close CBS News      At first officials said the girl was accidentally run over because she may have been hidden in foam sprayed next to the plane. But 50 minutes of helmet footage, and video from the fire truck, reveal a number of emergency workers warning others that a victim was on the ground near the jet.      "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop," a firefighter says to the driver of a fire truck. "There's a body right there, right in front of you."      Earlier a camera aboard "Rescue Truck 10" shows a firefighter directing the truck around a victim on the ground. Investigators agree that was 16-year-old Ye. A coroner ruled at that point she was alive.      One lieutenant told crash investigators she "made a "three-second" visual assessment and thought, "That's our first casualty" -- but did not check the girl's vital signs.      Ye did become partially covered by the foam sprayed toward the plane.            Close CBS News      Some 15 minutes after the driver was first alerted about the victim on the ground, he ran Ye over.      The helmet camera shows another truck also drove over Ye's body minutes later.      Justin Green is one of the attorneys representing her family.      "What the family wants is accountability," he said. "They want to know why weren't the firefighters trained, why weren't the supervisors certified and why hasn't the fire department come clean about what happened?"      The San Francisco Fire Department told us they can't comment on pending litigation. Last month Chief Joanne Hayes-White told our San Francisco station KPIX this:      "Our members that day had difficult decisions to make. One was visualizing someone that appeared to be dead versus going onto the burning plane with reports of people that still needed to be rescued."      The firefighter wearing the helmet-cam told National Transportation Safety Board investigators he was wearing it because at a previous fire where two firefighters were killed, a lot of questions went unanswered. He told the investigators that from that experience he learned the value of the cameras.      And the investigation is pointing toward pilot error as the cause of the crash.       |||||	– Video obtained this week by CBS News and released for the first time shows that Ye Meng Yuan, the 16-year-old who survived the Asiana Airlines crash landing in San Francisco only to be run over and killed by a fire truck, was in fact spotted by rescuers before she was run over. The video, some of which comes from a firefighter's helmet and some of which comes from the fire truck, shows that multiple emergency workers saw the teen's body. A firetruck driver was heard being warned, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop. There's a body right there, right in front of you." Fifteen minutes later, he ran her over, with video showing a second truck did the same soon after. Her parents are suing the city over her death, and "this makes it clear that several members of the Fire Department responding team knew she was there, did nothing to help her, never examined her, and then abandoned her in a position where she was in peril," their attorney tells the San Francisco Chronicle. "They left her in a perilous position, covered her with foam and then ran her over." It's still unknown how Yuan got off the plane.

The Robinson R44II-type helicopter, which is registered to a company in White Plains, was en route to Westhampton when it went down around 10:30 a.m. after taking off from Westchester County Airport.      The chopper issued a Mayday call prior to going down. A commercial flight headed to John F. Kennedy Airport heard the call and relayed it to controllers.      “Everything happened so quickly, you don’t have much time to react,” McMahon told 1010 WINS’ Al Jones. “It was very unnerving.”      McMahon said he heard a bang and then his pilot told him they were going to land in the water.      As CBS2’s Emily Smith reported, as the helicopter lost power, they inflated the pontoons and made a hard landing on the ocean.      “It is very unsettling when all of a sudden you have something happen. You hear a bang and saying you are going to do an emergency landing in the water, so yes very unnerving,” he said.      As CBS2’s Jennifer McLogan reported, McMahon congratulated the pilot he had hired to chopper him from Manhattan to Westhampton — for skill and calm under duress, calling a mayday above ocean waters off Gilgo beach as they lost power, before banking down into a hard landing.      “[He] was super calm, which made me super calm and we landed perfectly,” McMahon said.      The fortunate outcome was unexpected.      “We heard some noise, and it became very clear to me that I could no longer continue to fly the helicopter, so I decided to make an auto-rotational landing on the water,” Mario Regtien said.      The helicopter went down about 2,000 feet from a lifeguard stand, where two lifeguards jumped into kayaks to help before the U.S. Coast Guard arrived.      “We ran up and got kayaks and we paddled out, a short trip out there. Those guys actually handled it really well, the two gentlemen in the helicopter, actually really calm and collected,” lifeguard Zach Viverito told CBS2’s Jennifer McLogan. “We put them on the kayaks and just swam along with them until the Coast Guard met us about halfway in.”      “We were just getting to work and we saw a helicopter go down pretty hard, saw a big splash,” lifeguard Don Dobbi said. “We ran up and grabbed the kayaks and paddled out to see what was going on, we knew it was out of the ordinary.”      I'd like to thank the man upstairs for looking out this morning & thanks to pilot Mario, Suffolk Co. Marine Bureau & Fire Island Coast Guard — Shane McMahon (@shanemcmahon) July 19, 2017      McMahon gave a “big kudos” to the lifeguards.      “Everybody chipped in, it was great,” he said.      The helicopter could be seen floating on pontoons on the water following the emergency landing. Suffolk County police said the two men were wearing life jackets and were uninjured. They were then picked up and brought to shore by a police department Marine Bureau vessel.      When asked if they were the heroes of the day, Viverito said, “I don’t know about that.”      “That is what we are here for,” he said. “So just kind of training, get on the equipment and go right out there.”      The Coast Guard responded to remove the aircraft, police said.

summarize: The eighth season of Game of Thrones will definitely be its last, an HBO executive has confirmed. Casey Bloys, the premium cable network’s new president of programming, confirmed to journalists at the Television Critics Association’s summer press tour in Los Angeles on Saturday that the world’s favourite tits-and-dragons-themed TV fantasy drama would come to an end after two more seasons.      GoT Showrunners DB Weiss and David Benioff “have a very specific plan about the number of seasons they want to do,” Bloys said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “If I could get them to do more, I would take 10 seasons, but we want to take their lead with what they could do and what the best version of the show is.”      In memoriam: Every major character who died in Game of Thrones season 6                        34 show all In memoriam: Every major character who died in Game of Thrones season 6                                                                                                                                                                                                      1/34 Ramsay Bolton Fed to the hounds by his ex-wife      2/34 Tommen Baratheon Jumped out of a window      3/34 Rickon Stark Shot by Ramsay with an arrow      4/34 Grand Maester Pycelle Stabbed by little birds      5/34 Loras Tyrell Wildfire      6/34 Alliser Thorne Hung      7/34 Olly Hung #F*ckOlly      8/34 Walder Frey Ticked off the list      9/34 Shaggydog Head cut off      10/34 Summer Ripped apart by White Walkers      11/34 High Sparrow Wildfire      12/34 The Blackfish Killed off-screen…      13/34 Hodor Hold the door…      14/34 Trystane Martell Stabbed through the face by those damned Sand Snakes      15/34 Leaf Blown up saving Bran      16/34 Walda Frey and her little boy Fed to the hounds      17/34 Balon Greyjoy Thrown off a bridge by his brother      18/34 Lady Crane Fell off a chair      19/34 Mace Tyrell Wildfire      20/34 The Waif Killed in the dark by Arya Stark      21/34 Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers Fray pie      22/34 Brother Lancel Lannister Stabbed once then blown up by Wildfire      23/34 Lem Lemoncloak Hung by the Brotherhood Without Banners plus The Hound      24/34 Brother Ray Hung by Leomoncloak and his gang      25/34 Three-Eyed Raven Killed by the Night’s King      26/34 Margaery Tyrell Wildfire      27/34 Khal Rhalko, Khal Brozho, Khal Qorro, Khal Forzho, Khal Moro Burnt by the Mother of Dragons      28/34 Roose Bolton Stabbed in the chest by his own son      29/34 Kevan Lannister Wildfire      30/34 Smalljon Umber Beaten by Tormund      31/34 Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun That Goddamn Ramsay again      32/34 Osha Throat slit by Ramsay      33/34 Doran Martell Stabbed in the hearth by Ellaria Sand      34/34 Areo Hotah Stabbed in the spine by Tyene Sand      The show was recently renewed for a seventh season of just seven episodes. Its producers have said previously that they imagine a total of 75 episodes, of which the first six seasons comprised 60. That would leave eight more episodes for the eighth and final season, though Benioff and Weiss have also talked about season eight consisting of a mere six episodes.      With Winter having come to Westeros, production has been delayed until the weather back in the real world is sufficiently frosty, meaning the seventh season won’t reach screens until next summer. Previous seasons have premiered in the Spring.      There have also been early conversations about the prospect of a spin-off series, Bloys said. “It’s not something I'm opposed to but it has to make sense creatively,” he explained. “I’m not sure the guys can wrap their heads around it when they are about to start production. We're open to it; the guys arent opposed to it but there's no concrete plans right now.” ||||| HBO has just answered a huge lingering question about Game of Thrones.      EW asked the network’s new programming president Casey Bloys if he plans to go along with showrunners’ David Benioff and Dan Weiss’ oft-stated desire to end their fantasy hit with season 8.      Bloys said yes, that is the current plan – the first time somebody at HBO has confirmed this.      “Yes, they have a very specific plan about the number of seasons they want to do,” Bloys said at the Television Critics Association’s press tour in Beverly Hills on Saturday. “Believe me, as the new [programming executive] coming in, if I could get them to do more. I would take 10 more seasons. But we take their lead on what they think they can do the best version of the show.”      The showrunners have also planned for the eighth season to consist of merely six episodes. On that front, however, Bloys said the exact number of season eight episodes is not yet final.      RELATED: Game of Thrones: 10 Predictions for Season 7      We then asked if the team is considering a Thrones spin-off to continue the valuable franchise. Thrones is one of TV’s most watched shows with 25 million total viewers this year across all platforms.      “We’ve talked about it,” he said. “It’s something I’m not opposed to, but of course it has to make sense creatively. I’m not sure that [Benioff and Weiss] could really wrap their heads around it when they’re just about to start production [on season 7]. It’s a pretty intense production, they’re about to start production soon. I’m open to it. The guys weren’t opposed to it, but there’s no concrete plans for it at this point.”      Also, with the production delay of season seven – which will debut its seven episodes next summer – the executive confirmed the plan will take Thrones out of the running for the Emmys next year. Thrones received 23 prime-time 2016 Emmy nominations, more than any other show, but requires a heavy amount of winter location shooting for the next season (locations include a production unit filming in Iceland).      Still, Bloys pointed out, “Even if we took Thrones Emmys away this year, we’d still have more than anyone else.”      The executive was also asked about the fate of True Detective, and had this to say.

HBO finally made that official during Saturday's Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles. “Believe me...if I could get them to do more, I would take 10 more seasons," HBO executive Casey Bloys tells Entertainment Weekly. "But we take their lead on what they think they can do the best version of the show.” That means season eight is officially the end of Game of Thrones. Maybe. The Independent reports Bloys said Saturday that they are discussing a Game of Thrones spin-off series, though nothing concrete at the moment. Also not concrete: the number of episodes in season eight. Weiss and Benioff have said anywhere between six and eight—fewer than the typical 10—but Bloys says that hasn't been worked out yet. Season seven has already been confirmed to have only seven episodes.
summarize: Ugandan anti-gay activist Pastor Martin Ssempa posts up a public notice offering "rehabilitation" for homosexuals at Uganda’s National Theatre in Kampala, Uganda Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2014. U.S. Secretary... (Associated Press)      KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A Ugandan newspaper published a list Tuesday of what it called the country's "200 top" homosexuals, outing some Ugandans who previously had not identified themselves as gay one day after the president enacted a harsh anti-gay law.      U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday's signing of the bill by President Yoweri Museveni marked "a tragic day for Uganda and for all who care about the cause of human rights" and warned that Washington could cut aid to the government of the East African nation.      "Now that this law has been enacted, we are beginning an internal review of our relationship with the Government of Uganda to ensure that all dimensions of our engagement, including assistance programs, uphold our anti-discrimination policies and principles and reflect our values," Kerry said in a statement.      The Red Pepper tabloid published the names — and some pictures — of alleged homosexuals in a front-page story under the headline: "EXPOSED!"      The list included prominent Ugandan gay activists such as Pepe Julian Onziema, who has repeatedly warned that Uganda's new anti-gay law could spark violence against homosexuals. A popular Ugandan hip-hop star and a Catholic priest are also on the list.      Ben Byarabaha, news editor of the Red Pepper, said they published the full names of only the well-known activists and had tried to use nicknames for those not publicly gay. Others, such as a retired Anglican cleric who supports gay rights, are listed as sympathizers. Byarabaha offered no details about how the full list was compiled.      Few Ugandans identify themselves publicly as gay, and the tabloid's publication of alleged homosexuals recalled a similar list published in 2011 by a now-defunct tabloid that called for the execution of gays. A Ugandan judge later condemned the outing of homosexuals in a country where gays face severe discrimination, saying it amounted to an invasion of privacy. A prominent Ugandan gay activist, David Kato, was killed after that list came out, and activists said at the time that they believed he was targeted because of his work promoting gay rights in Uganda.      "The media witch hunt is back," tweeted Jacqueline Kasha, a well-known Ugandan lesbian activist who is among those listed in the Red Pepper story.      Uganda's new-anti-gay law punishes gay sex with up to life in jail. The bill originally proposed the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality," defined as repeated gay sex between consenting adults and acts involving a minor, a disabled person or where one partner is infected with HIV. First-time offenders also face life in jail, contrary to an earlier version of the bill that mentioned a 14-year jail term.      The new law also creates the offenses of "conspiracy to commit homosexuality" as well as "aiding and abetting homosexuality," both of which are punishable with a seven-year jail term. Those convicted of "promoting homosexuality" face similar punishment.      In signing the bill, Museveni said the measure is needed because the West is promoting homosexuality in Africa, rejecting international criticism of the law as interference in Uganda's internal affairs. Museveni accused "arrogant and careless Western groups" of trying to recruit Ugandan children into homosexuality, but he did not name these purported groups.      Ugandan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said on Tuesday that no homosexuals have been arrested since Museveni signed the bill but that at least two had been taken into custody since lawmakers passed the bill last December.      Onziema, the gay activist, said he had counted up to six arrests and said that more than a dozen Ugandan homosexuals had fled the country since December over safety concerns.      Homosexuality has long been criminalized in Uganda under a colonial-era law that outlawed sex acts "against the order of nature."      Some Ugandan lawyers and activists have said they will challenge the law in court as unconstitutional and impossible to implement.      Nicholas Opiyo, a Ugandan lawyer who runs a rights watchdog group called Chapter Four, predicted Tuesday that the new law would make life worse for Ugandan gays.      "The enactment of the anti-homosexuality bill has only emboldened the ... population in their rejection of anybody perceived to be gay or even friendly to gays," he said. "These things are going to continue. They are going to get more frequent."      The Ugandan law — which came just over a month after Nigeria passed a similar measure against gays — has been condemned around the world, although it is widely popular among Ugandans.      U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the law would institutionalize discrimination and could encourage harassment and violence against gays. ||||| Story highlights Musevini: "They are disgusting. What sort of people are they?"      In 2010, another tabloid published similar lists      After that, the high court banned all media from publishing such lists      A day after Uganda passed harsh anti-gay laws, a tabloid newspaper came out with a list of what it called the country's top homosexuals.      The cover of the Red Pepper newspaper read, "EXPOSED! Uganda's 200 Top Homos Named," with several photographs next to the headline.      The story was not available on their online edition.      On Monday, President Yoweri Museveni signed into law a bill that made some homosexual acts punishable by life in prison.      "They're disgusting. What sort of people are they?" he told CNN's Zain Verjee afterward. "I never knew what they were doing. I've been told recently that what they do is terrible. Disgusting. But I was ready to ignore that if there was proof that that's how he is born, abnormal. But now the proof is not there."      JUST WATCHED How U.S. evangelicals influenced Uganda Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How U.S. evangelicals influenced Uganda 05:43      This isn't the first time that a Ugandan newspaper have identified people it claimed were gay.      In November 2010, Rolling Stone -- a local tabloid which has no relation to the iconic U.S. music magazine -- listed 100 of what it called the country's top gays and lesbians, with photos and addresses alongside a yellow banner reading, "hang them."      The next month, the paper listed 10 more people it claimed were gay. The list included addresses and alleged intimate details about them.      Advocacy groups filed a lawsuit. And the Ugandan high court banned all media outlets in the country from publishing such lists.      Museveni: It's an 'inborn problem'      Museveni had commissioned a group of Ugandan government scientists to study whether homosexuality is "learned," concluding that it is a matter of choice.      "I was regarding it as an inborn problem," he said. "Genetic distortion -- that was my argument. But now our scientists have knocked this one out."      The bill was introduced in 2009 and originally included a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts.      The nation's Parliament passed the bill in December, replacing the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for "aggravated homosexuality." This includes acts in which one person is infected with HIV, "serial offenders" and sex with minors, according to Amnesty International.      Prison terms for gay outreach      The new law also includes punishment -- up to seven years in prison -- for people and institutions who perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, language that was not in the 2009 version.      Lawmakers in the conservative nation said the influence of Western lifestyles risked destroying family units.      The bill also proposed prison terms for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians, a provision that could ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.      The White House issued a statement Monday: "Instead of standing on the side of freedom, justice, and equal rights for its people, today, regrettably, Ugandan President Museveni took Uganda a step backward by signing into law legislation criminalizing homosexuality."      Prevalent attitudes      Attitudes against homosexuality are prevalent in Uganda. A 2013 report from Pew Research found that 96% of Ugandans believe society should not accept homosexuality.      Thirty-eight African countries have made homosexuality illegal. Most sodomy laws there were introduced during colonialism.      Even before Museveni signed the bill into law, homosexual acts were punishable by 14 years to life in prison.      Ugandan gay rights activist Pepe Julian Onziema told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that some gay people in Uganda would rather kill themselves than live under the new law.      "Prior to the bill becoming law today, people attempted suicide because they are like, 'I'm not going to live to see this country kill me -- so I would rather take my life.'

summarize: Iran's support is crucial for finding a resolution to the civil war in Syria, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi said in his first interview with state television since taking office.      Morsi, who spoke bluntly in support of the Syrian revolution in Tehran three weeks ago, said on Saturday that Iran was "a main player in the region that could have an active and supportive role in solving the Syrian problem".      Despite Morsi's remarks at the Non-Aligned Movement summit last month, which were viewed as a stark challenge to Iran's policy of support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Egypt then invited Iran to join its Syria "contact group" of nations aiming to negotiate a solution to the Syrian crisis.      Turkey and Saudi Arabia - like Egypt - both support the Syrian rebels, and are the two other members of the quartet.      "I don't see the presence of Iran in this quartet as a problem, but is a part of solving the problem," Morsi said, explaining that Iran's close proximity to Syria and its strong ties with the government make it "vital" in resolving the crisis. "And we do not have a significant problem with Iran. It is normal like with the rest of the world's states."      The Syrian revolt erupted in March of last year, one month after the Egyptian uprising ended - over similar demands for      democracy and freedom. But unlike Mubarak, who quit after only 18 days of protest, Assad sent his military to crush the revolt, leading the rebels to take arms against him and prompting violent battles that have been going on for 18 months.      On Sunday, Syrian aircraft carried out strikes on rebel bastions across the country, especially in central Homs province and Deir Ezzor in the east, a watchdog said, as 31 people were killed nationwide.      The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said apartment blocks in Abu Kamal were targeted as rebels and soldiers battled on the ground in several districts of the town on the Iraqi border.      "The insurgents are trying to wrest control of this strategic town" in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor as well as the nearby Hamdan military airport, said the group's head, Rami Abdel Rahman.      Later on Sunday, a blast reportedly occurred on Victoria Bridge in between the National Museum and the Four Seasons Hotel in central Damascus, injuring two people.      The United Nations says nearly 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict and more than 235,000 Syrian refugees      have registered in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, while about 1.2 million people have been displaced within Syria.      Turkey deploys heavy weapons            Rebels and non-government groups of various stripes control much of the Syrian countryside, especially along the porous Turkish border in the north.      Though they have failed to wrest control of Damascus from Assad's forces and are locked in a tough battle for Aleppo, the country's largest city, they move freely outside urban areas.      The rebels have grown confident enough in their autonomy that Riad al-Asad, the self-proclaimed commander of the Free Syrian Army - a loose term for various rebel groups - announced on Saturday that he had moved the FSA headquarters into Syria.      Iran's foreign minister visited Assad earlier this month, and acknowledged sending military advisers [Reuters]      Aerial superiority is the only force keeping Assad's government afloat, a rebel colonel claimed to the AFP news agency.      "With or without outside help, the fall of the regime is a question of months, not years," said Colonel Ahmed Abdel Wahab, who said that he commanded a brigade of 850 fighters.      "If we had anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, we could quickly gain the advantage," he said, speaking in the village of Atma near the Syrian border with Turkey.      "But if foreign countries don't give us these, we will still win. It will take longer, that's all. We control most of the country. In most regions, the soldiers are prisoners of their barracks. They go out very little and we can move freely everywhere, except Damascus."      But small-arms battles and government shelling continue in pockets of fighting in the north, and Turkey's military deployed armoured vehicles and heavy weaponary to the border on Saturday, near a crossing that has seen intense clashes, local media said.      The deployment is reportedly in an area where earlier this week Turkish civilians were wounded when stray bullets and      shelling crossed the border from the Syrian province of al-Raqqa.      CNN Turk television said artillery fire had landed close to the Turkish border overnight, causing panic among local residents.      The Turkish army moved three Howitzers and one anti-aircraft weapon to the border, the channel said.      Nearly 80 per cent of towns and villages along the Turkish border are outside the control of Damascus, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.      'Securing liberated areas'      Asad announced the FSA's headquarters move in a video message from Syria, the first since the group founded its command centre in Turkey at the beginning of the conflict.      "To the Syrian people, its freedom fighters and all the armed factions, we are glad to let you know that the leadership of the FSA has moved into Syria following arrangements made with other brigades that included securing liberated areas with the hope of launching the offensive on Damascus," Asad said.      He said the FSA has felt pressure by the international community to take a leading role in post-war Syria. Asad said the FSA rejected those offers, reiterating that the people of Syria should decide the future of the country.      "Since we left our country, we suffered all sorts of regional and international interference and political pressure. We were isolated. Their goal was to have the FSA replace Assad once he is gone, but we categorically made it clear that we would never betray our people reiterating that only the Syrians should decide their future institutions."      Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Akcakale on the Turkey-Syria border, said the rebels had been cautiously edging forward, taking territory 5km inside Syria.      "The move of the command centre is not necessarily a massive breakthrough because the FSA is still very much dependent on Turkey for its supply lines," he said. ||||| CAIRO — On the eve of his first trip to the United States as Egypt ’s new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi said the United States needed to fundamentally change its approach to the Arab world, showing greater respect for its values and helping build a Palestinian state, if it hoped to overcome decades of pent-up anger.      A former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mr. Morsi sought in a 90-minute interview with The New York Times to introduce himself to the American public and to revise the terms of relations between his country and the United States after the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, an autocratic but reliable ally.      He said it was up to Washington to repair relations with the Arab world and to revitalize the alliance with Egypt, long a cornerstone of regional stability.      If Washington is asking Egypt to honor its treaty with Israel, he said, Washington should also live up to its own Camp David commitment to Palestinian self-rule. He said the United States must respect the Arab world’s history and culture, even when that conflicts with Western values.      And he dismissed criticism from the White House that he did not move fast enough to condemn protesters who recently climbed over the United States Embassy wall and burned the American flag in anger over a video that mocked the Prophet Muhammad.      “We took our time” in responding to avoid an explosive backlash, he said, but then dealt “decisively” with the small, violent element among the demonstrators.      “We can never condone this kind of violence, but we need to deal with the situation wisely,” he said, noting that the embassy employees were never in danger.      Mr. Morsi, who will travel to New York on Sunday for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, arrives at a delicate moment. He faces political pressure at home to prove his independence, but demands from the West for reassurance that Egypt under Islamist rule will remain a stable partner.      Mr. Morsi, 61, whose office was still adorned with nautical paintings that Mr. Mubarak left behind, said the United States should not expect Egypt to live by its rules.      “If you want to judge the performance of the Egyptian people by the standards of German or Chinese or American culture, then there is no room for judgment,” he said. “When the Egyptians decide something, probably it is not appropriate for the U.S. When the Americans decide something, this, of course, is not appropriate for Egypt.”      He suggested that Egypt would not be hostile to the West, but would not be as compliant as Mr. Mubarak either.      “Successive American administrations essentially purchased with American taxpayer money the dislike, if not the hatred, of the peoples of the region,” he said, by backing dictatorial governments over popular opposition and supporting Israel over the Palestinians.      He initially sought to meet with President Obama at the White House during his visit this week, but he received a cool reception, aides to both presidents said. Mindful of the complicated election-year politics of a visit with Egypt’s Islamist leader, Mr. Morsi dropped his request.      His silence in the immediate aftermath of the embassy protest elicited a tense telephone call from Mr. Obama, who also told a television interviewer that at that moment he did not consider Egypt an ally, if not an enemy either. When asked if he considered the United States an ally, Mr. Morsi answered in English, “That depends on your definition of ally,” smiling at his deliberate echo of Mr. Obama. But he said he envisioned the two nations as “real friends.”      Mr. Morsi spoke in an ornate palace that Mr. Mubarak inaugurated three decades ago, a world away from the Nile Delta farm where the new president grew up, or the prison cells where he had been confined by Mr. Mubarak for his role in the Brotherhood. Three months after his swearing-in, the most noticeable change to the presidential office was a plaque on his desk bearing the Koranic admonition, “Be conscious of a day on which you will return to God.”      A stocky figure with a trim beard and wire-rim glasses, he earned a doctorate in materials science at the University of Southern California in the early 1980s. He spoke with an easy confidence in his new authority, reveling in an approval rating he said was at 70 percent. When he grew animated, he slipped from Arabic into crisp English.      Little known at home or abroad until just a few months ago, he was the Brotherhood’s second choice as a presidential nominee after the first choice was disqualified. On the night of the election, the generals who had ruled since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster issued a decree keeping most presidential powers for themselves.      But last month Mr. Morsi confounded all expectations by prying full executive authority back from the generals. In the interview, when an interpreter suggested that the generals had “decided” to exit politics, Mr. Morsi quickly corrected him. |||||	– Egypt's first democratically elected leader is headed to New York for his first official visit to the United States, and Mohammed Morsi tells the New York Times that he envisions his nation and Washington could be "real friends," though he tacitly acknowledges real tensions exist at the moment. “Successive American administrations essentially purchased with American taxpayer money the dislike, if not the hatred, of the peoples of the region,” by propping up friendly regimes like that of predecessor Hosni Mubarak, he says, adding that the ball is in America's court to repair regional relations. Morsi will be in town to attend the UN General Assembly, but he won't be stopping by the White House, which the Times notes had a chilly response to his request for a meeting with President Obama. Morsi earlier took heat from Obama for being slow to condemn attacks on the US embassy in Egypt, which he said he "could never condone, but we need to deal with the situation wisely." In a separate interview with state media picked up by al-Jazeera, Morsi addressed the Syria unrest, calling Iran "a main player in the region that could have an active and supportive role in solving the Syrian problem."

While most of the city’s websites are working normally, a number of web pages that customers use to pay bills began to be affected Thursday morning. Access to court information was also affected.      Whoever is behind the attack is asking for a $50,000 ransom.      As the city struggled to contain the spread of the attack, city officials have been forced to take down web pages in other departments and literally unplug city computers. Some city workers aren’t even receiving email.      Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that her office is working with the FBI.      “We are continuing to work with our federal partners and other stakeholders who continue to advise us on how best to navigate and approach this,” Bottoms said.      STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images      City leaders stress that there have been no impacts to police, water service, 911 and Atlanta’s Hartsfield International Airport. The city, they point out, was built before computers. As a protective measure, Wi-Fi at the airport has been turned off. Security wait time signs and flight information signs may not be accurate as a result, officials cautioned.      The greatest impacts appear to be at municipal court and the city detention center -- with computers down, many taken down protectively, city employees are having to manually admit inmates, handle tickets and warrants. The city court currently cannot validate warrants or process ticket payments online or in person.      Customers will not be penalized for late payments, the city said.      The city government isn’t getting specific about who the demands are from, what kind of data has been stolen and what’s being held hostage, but it’s clear that city’s systems have been severely compromised.      Bottoms did not say Friday whether the city planned to pay the $50,000 ransom, but already city council members are promising her millions if she needs to build a new secure system from the ground up. She referenced similar ransom attacks on corporations, and on other government agencies in Colorado and North Carolina.      “What we know is that someone is in our system, and that there is a weakness there,” Bottoms said.      “It is absolutely not what we wanted to have happened in the city of Atlanta. But to the extent that there are changes and upgrades that we need to make to our system, we need to do it now.”      She added: “This is a massive inconvenience to the city.” ||||| (Reuters) - Atlanta is still struggling with its ability to collect online payments of bills and fees, officials said on Monday, four days after a ransomware attack snarled the computer system of Georgia’s capital city.      Hackers caused outages of services offered through the city’s website and broader computer system while demanding a ransom of $51,000 paid in bitcoin to unlock the system.      “This is much bigger than a ransomware attack, this really is an attack on our government,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told a news conference. “We are dealing with a (cyber) hostage situation.”      She did not say whether Atlanta would pay the ransom. Atlanta officials said they have determined the hackers’ identity but declined to elaborate. City representatives were not immediately available for further comment.      Bottoms said only that the hackers entered the city’s digital system remotely as opposed having had internal access.      Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers or computer networks and then freezes them, with the attackers demanding a ransom in order to restore services. The initial assault often comes via a phishing link that someone within the network opens on their email.      As the disruption in Atlanta persists, the city is losing out financially, Bottoms told an earlier news conference on Friday. It was unclear how much it stands to lose or when the city expects to get its computer system fully operational again. ||||| Atlanta is the latest local government to have its computer system attacked by hackers. The criminals are demanding $51,000 in Bitcoin to remove their ransomware.      It’s been a quiet few months on the ransomware front. The last notable attack targeted a hospital in Indiana back in January, but now a new target has been hit. The city government of Atlanta, Georgia, reports that their computer system was targeted by hackers in a ransomware attack.      The City of Atlanta is currently experiencing outages on various customer facing applications, including some that customers may use to pay bills or access court-related information. We will post any updates as we receive them. pic.twitter.com/kc51rojhBl — City of Atlanta, GA (@Cityofatlanta) March 22, 2018      No Joy in Dixie      The attack hit the city’s computer system early Thursday morning. The systems that were targeted were those that people use to pay bills as well as access data from the court system.      City employees were handed printouts when they showed up for work, stating that they should not use their computers until the city’s IT department cleared them. City officials have warned employees and citizens who have used the computer system to monitor their bank accounts and to change their passwords.      Officials do not know who was behind the ransomware attack, but they have received a demand from the hacker(s). The city of Atlanta can pay $6,800 in Bitcoin per unit to unlock them or pay a grand total of $51,000 to unlock everything.      Working Hard to Fix      City officials have no plans to pay off the hackers over the ransomware attack and are working to resolve the issue. In a statement, the local government said:      At this time, our Atlanta Information Management team is working diligently with support from Microsoft to resolve the issue. We are confident that our team of technology professionals will be able to restore applications soon. Our city website, Atlantaga.gov, remains accessible and we will provide updates as we receive them.      The city of Atlanta is working with the Department of Homeland Security, Microsoft, Cisco, and the FBI to determine exactly which data has been compromised and to, hopefully, find a solution.      Atlanta is just the latest in a growing fraternity whose membership relies upon being the victim of a ransomware attack. As stated above, a hospital in the state of Indiana was hit by hackers early this year. The latter half of 2017 saw multiple ransomware attacks: credit agency Equifax targeted in September with a ransom demand for $2.3 million, the Sacramento Regional Transit system in November to the tune of a single bitcoin, and the county government of Mecklenburg, North Carolina, getting hit in December with hackers demanding a payment of two bitcoins.

"This is much bigger than a ransomware attack, this really is an attack on our government," Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a Monday presser about the e-attack, per Reuters, adding, "We are dealing with a [cyberhostage] situation." Bitcoinist reports the hack began Thursday morning, and it has taken down Atlanta's online bill payment system from some remote location, says Bottoms, who's staying mum over whether the ransom will be paid. (Bitcoinist notes, however, the city has "no plans" to pay up.) The FBI, Homeland Security, Cisco, and Microsoft are all teaming up to help the city figure out what data has been breached and what steps to take next in what Bottoms has deemed a "massive inconvenience," reports ABC News. Ransomware is a form of malware that brings individual computers or entire networks to a halt until money is paid to unfreeze them. The city's Twitter account posted Monday that "at this time, there is no evidence to show that customer or employee data has been compromised," though it did warn people to take standard precautions to protect their info. In Cobb County, that included instructions to county workers not to open any emails from the City of Atlanta, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Per Reuters, the hackers have already been IDed, though no names have yet been given. Over the weekend, 11Alive posted a list of non-impacted services, and WSBTV reports that customers won't be charged late fees if they're unable to pay bills online.
summarize: Obama administration officials unveiled rules on Wednesday that will allow many American citizens — perhaps hundreds of thousands — to avoid long separations from immediate family members who are illegal immigrants as they apply to become legal residents.      The rules, announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, create a waiver that bypasses an arcane Catch-22 in immigration law. It had presented Americans with the prospect of being separated for up to a decade from immigrant spouses, children or parents who were applying for the legal documents known as green cards.      Until now, the risks for those immigrants of leaving the United States to return to their native countries to pick up their visas, even ones that were already approved, had been so great that countless families decided not to apply, adding to the numbers of immigrants living illegally in this country.      The immigration authorities will begin accepting applications for the waivers on March 3. Administration officials first announced the policy change a year ago, but they have been receiving public comments and making revisions before publishing the final rules.      It is generally straightforward for American citizens to obtain green cards for foreign-born spouses or minor children, and in some cases for parents. But if the immigrants entered the United States illegally, they must return to their native countries to receive their visas from American consulates there. However, under a 1996 statute, once illegal immigrants leave this country, they are barred automatically from returning for at least three and as many as 10 years.      Even immigrants who did not incur any bars to re-entry were often stranded overseas for many months while consulates completed their applications.      With the new rules, Americans’ family members can apply in the United States for a waiver from the bars to re-entry, before they leave to pick up their visas. Officials estimated the time immigrants would have to spend out of the country would be reduced to “a matter of weeks.”      “One of the critical benefits is that the individual will not be separated from the United States citizen family member during the application process,” said Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that issues green cards.      For immigrants, officials said, having an approved waiver in hand before leaving the country would also eliminate many doubts about whether they would ultimately receive their visas.      “This rule is leaps and bounds better than what we have now,” said Laura Lichter, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “For families that were sitting on the fence, unwilling to subject their loved ones to the uncertainty, now they don’t have to wait.”      Ms. Lichter said many families would still face a hurdle in coming up with the $585 application fee for the waiver.      One American who was heartened by the new rule is Erika Torres, 30. She has been married for six years to a Mexican man who was brought illegally to the United States 24 years ago, when he was 8. Ms. Torres, speaking by telephone on Wednesday, said she and her husband, who have known each other since they were children, now own a home and a winemaking business in Cambria, Calif.      Like many Americans, Ms. Torres said she expected no difficulty gaining legal documents for her husband once they were married. But after learning about the convoluted visa process, she said, “We have waited because we were just terrified of the separation.”      Ms. Torres said her husband would probably have to collect his visa from the American Consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, a city racked by drug trafficking violence. “He would be a prime target for kidnappers,” she said.      “We are a team,” Ms. Torres said, adding that she feared she would not be able to sustain their business without her husband’s help. She said they would apply for a waiver as soon as they became available.      The rules do not give any legal status to illegal immigrants or shortcut the underlying application. In order to receive green cards, immigrants must still show that it would cause “extreme hardship” to an American citizen if they were deported.      “It is a limited change, but a definitely a good step forward in the right direction,” said Randall Emery, president of American Families United, an organization of thousands of Americans with family members who are illegal immigrants.      Ms. Lichter called on Congress to change the law to eliminate the snag created by the automatic bars. “This is a great solution to a problem that should never have existed in the first place,” she said. ||||| WASHINGTON -- Despite a bruising fiscal cliff battle that managed to set the stage for an even more heated showdown that will likely take place in a matter of months, President Barack Obama is planning to move full steam ahead with the rest of his domestic policy agenda.      An Obama administration official said the president plans to push for immigration reform this January. The official, who spoke about legislative plans only on condition of anonymity, said that coming standoffs over deficit reduction are unlikely to drain momentum from other priorities. The White House plans to push forward quickly, not just on immigration reform but gun control laws as well.      The timeframe is likely to be cheered by Democrats and immigration reform advocates alike, who have privately expressed fears that Obama's second term will be drowned out in seemingly unending showdowns between parties. The just-completed fiscal cliff deal is giving way to a two-month deadline to resolve delayed sequestration cuts, an expiring continuing resolution to fund the government and a debt ceiling that will soon be hit.      With those bitter battles ahead, the possibility of passing other complicated legislation would seem diminished.      "The negative effect of this fiscal cliff fiasco is that every time we become engaged in one of these fights, there's no oxygen for anything else," said a Senate Democratic aide, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. "It's not like you can be multi-tasking -- with something like this, Congress just comes to a complete standstill."      It remains unclear what type of immigration policies the White House plans to push in January, but turning them into law could be a long process. Aides expect it will take about two months to write a bipartisan bill, then another few months before it goes up for a vote, possibly in June. A bipartisan group of senators are already working on a deal, although they are still in the early stages. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) will likely lead on the Democratic side in the House. While many Republicans have expressed interest in piecemeal reform, it's still unclear which of them plan to join the push.      Lofgren expressed hope that immigration reform would be able to get past partisan gridlock, arguing that the election was seen as something of a mandate for fixing the immigration system and Republicans won't be able to forget their post-election promises to work on a bill. "In the end, immigration reform is going to depend very much on whether Speaker [John] Boehner wants to do it or not," Lofgren said.      Advocates have vowed to keep pushing for reform. As part of their efforts, they plan to remind Republican members of Congress about their presidential nominee's defeat among Latino and Asian voters, a majority of whom support a fix to the immigration system.      "They can procrastinate as long as they want, but they're going to have a serious day of reckoning next election cycle," said Angela Kelley, vice president for immigration policy and advocacy at the Center for American Progress. "We're going to have a lot of near-death experiences with this issue, but I'm pretty confident it's never going to go completely to a flatline."      Good news for immigration advocates may have come Tuesday night, when Boehner broke the so-called "Hastert Rule" and allowed the fiscal cliff bill to come for a vote without support from a majority of his Republican conference. Given opposition to immigration reform by many Tea Party Republicans, the proof that Boehner is willing to bypass them on major legislation is a good sign, the Democratic aide said.      "If something is of such importance that the GOP establishment [is] telling Boehner, 'You must do this. You need to get this off the table soon,'" the Democratic aide said, the speaker could break the Hastert Rule again.      "He already did it with this fiscal issue, so I would not be surprised if when it came down to it he puts up a bill that he just allows to go through with a combination of Democratic and Republican votes, without worrying about a majority of the majority," the aide continued.      Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration reform group America's Voice, also said he thinks the House could pass an immigration bill in the same way it did last night, relying on support from both parties. He's hopeful that the fiscal cliff fight could even make them happy to work out legislation in a more standard way.      "I never thought I'd say this, but after bruising battles over the future of the American and world economy, the chance to legislate through regular order on immigration reform might have leaders in both parties working together and singing 'Kumbaya,'" Sharry said. ||||| WASHINGTON — Illegal immigrants who are immediate relatives of American citizens will have an easier path to permanent residency under a new Obama administration rule that could affect as many as 1 million of the estimated 11 million people unlawfully in the United States.      The rule issued Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security aims to reduce the time illegal immigrants are separated from their U.S. families while seeking legal status, officials said.      Beginning March 4, illegal immigrants who can demonstrate that time apart from an American spouse, child or parent would create "extreme hardship" can apply for a visa without leaving the United States. Once approved, applicants would be required to leave briefly in order to return to their native country and pick up their visa.      Sources said that the administration might expand the changes to include relatives of lawful permanent residents.      The change, first proposed in April, is the latest move by the administration to use executive powers to revise immigration procedures without Congress passing a law. In August, the Obama administration began a program to halt the deportation of young people brought to the U.S. unlawfully as children.      "This is a continuation of usurping Congress' control over immigration," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington that supports tighter controls on immigration. "This waiver rule is a small piece of this broader effort to go around Congress."      The new procedures could reduce a family's time apart to one week in some cases, officials said. In recent years, a few relatives of U.S. citizens have been killed in violence in foreign countries while waiting for their applications to be resolved, a process that could take a year or longer.      "It's going to be a better future for me," said Analy Olivas, 21, of Claremont, who crossed the border illegally from Mexico with her family when she was 8 and eventually married a U.S. citizen. She didn't think she could bear to be separated from her 4-year-old son, Naythan, for an extended period, adding: "If I kept on going through the process, I was going to have to leave the country. I wasn't ready for it."      "The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon," said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wait times will be "drastically reduced," Mayorkas said.      The immigration agency does not provide applicants with a specific definition of "extreme hardship," despite requests from legal aid organizations to clarify the phrase. The agency "looks at the totality of the applicant's circumstances and any supporting evidence," according to the final rule posted in the Federal Register on Wednesday.      Immigration officials said they had no plans to add staff to process what could be a large number of new hardship-waiver applications. The agency received 24,780 such applications between September 2011 and October 2012.      Until now, officials said, many immigrants who might have sought legal status have not pursued a hardship waiver of strict U.S. immigration laws out of fear they would be rejected and stuck outside the country.      Someone who has overstayed a visa for more than six months is barred from reentering the U.S. for three years; those who overstay more than a year are barred for 10 years.      Many Mexicans applying for a visa must report to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, one of Mexico's most violent cities. Fearful applicants often spend weeks in hiding while waiting for appointments with consular officials. U.S.-born spouses also must travel to Juarez for interviews to determine whether marriages are valid.      The wait proved too long for Luis Luna, who was born in Mexico but crossed illegally into Southern California last year. He married his U.S.-born high school sweetheart, but became desperate as weeks in Juarez turned to months. He was bullied by thugs, harassed by cops and witnessed several fatal shootings.      "The days were so long," said Luna, who rented a $70-per-month room for several months while waiting for his visa to be processed. Luna, penniless and fearful, finally tried to reenter the U.S. by falsely claiming American citizenship with a Washington state driver's license. His application was eventually rejected. He is now back in California.      The possibility of having to leave the country for Juarez long kept Andrea from applying for U.S. residency, even though she is married to an American citizen and her 4-year-old daughter is also a citizen. The 30-year-old, who lives in Orange, asked not to be further identified because she is in the country illegally.      "I'd rather have a wife without papers than a dead wife," Andrea said her husband often told her.      Those whose hardship waiver applications were denied in the past will be eligible to apply again under the new rule, officials said. Family members who have been in deportation proceedings that were suspended will also qualify. But someone who has been deported before, or is facing a final deportation order, is not eligible.      Los Angeles immigration attorney Carl Shusterman hailed the end of what he called a "totally crazy system."      "It's going to keep families together who otherwise would have to go out of the country and sometimes wait over a year, separated," Shusterman said.      Jessica Dominguez, an immigration attorney whose clients are mostly from Mexico and Central America, said Latinos in Southern California were celebrating the change.      "This is going to affect thousands of families," Dominguez said.      brian.bennett@latimes.com      Times staff writers Cindy Carcamo in Santa Ana, Cindy Chang in Los Angeles and Richard Marosi in San Diego contributed to this report. |||||	– Despite continued hand-wringing over fiscal policy, President Obama remains on schedule to push for immigration reform this month, an insider tells the Huffington Post. The effort will likely be led by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who warns that "in the end, immigration reform is going to depend very much on whether Speaker Boehner wants to do it." Still, the fiscal cliff negotiations suggest the House Republican leadership could be open to compromise, say immigration reform advocates. Even without Congress, Obama is taking action on the issue: An executive order by the Homeland Security department yesterday offers illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the US while applying for permanent residence—if they can show that time away from close American citizen relatives would cause "extreme hardship," the Los Angeles Times reports. Some 1 million people could be affected by the new rules. Before the change, which takes effect in March, the application process could keep spouses, parents, or children away from family members for up to a decade, the New York Times notes.
summarize: An 8-year-old's cries for help after police say she was kidnapped from her bedroom probably saved her life and now authorities are asking the public's help to find the suspect.      "We believe there is a predator out there, and he needs to be stopped. He needs to be caught," Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said at a news conference Monday.      "A predator like this could go anywhere, and has no regard for jurisdictional boundaries," he added.      The girl, according to police, endured minor injuries, and authorities give her credit for screaming and putting up a struggle. The girl's cries for help alerted her father, who ran outside and found her in an alley.      "An important element is a lesson to all of us parents. This young girl immediately cried out, immediately put up a fuss and struggled. Who knows if that saved her life," Oates said.      A sketch of the suspect was released Monday night, and police said they're looking for a white man with short blond hair. He was wearing a heavy black winter jacket and had the distinct odor of cigarette smoke, investigators said.      The girl's grandmother, Beatrice Padilla, told The Denver Post the girl was doing her homework in her bunk bed sometime after midnight Monday. The suspect cut through and removed a screen before opening an unlocked window, according to police.      The man reached into the ground-floor window and grabbed the girl, pulling her out through the window, investigators said.      Police said the suspect headed toward the alleyway behind her home, but she began screaming for help and somehow managed to escape. Her father ran out of the house only to find his daughter running back from the alley. The father told police he saw a silver or gray car, possibly a BWM, speeding from the alley.      Police are offering a $10,000 reward for information aiding the investigation, and are treating it as a stranger kidnapping.      "There is nothing to indicate that this family was targeted in particular, which in some ways make it even more chilling," Oates said.      Investigators are now reviewing surveillance cameras in the area for clues and checking on registered sex offenders in the area.      "I've been in this business a long time. I've never seen anything like this. We really need your support, the media support and the public support. Tips and leads to catch this guy," Oates said.      The girl's parents returned home hours after the near abduction to collect the family dogs before leaving again. They declined to speak with reporters. ||||| The reward being offered to track down a man who tried to kidnap an 8-year-old girl from her bedroom in suburban Denver was doubled to $20,000 Tuesday as police tracked down leads.

(Associated Press)      Investigators say the man got in through an unlocked window early Monday morning and grabbed the girl. She screamed for help and was able to get away from the abductor just as her father ran outside to help her.      The father told police he saw the suspect speed away in a silver or grey BMW sedan in the alley that runs behind their house. Police Chief Dan Oates said the girl's loud struggle to escape may have saved her life.      Oates said there is no indication the family was targeted and police are treating the case as an attempted stranger abduction, a rare crime. Investigators are studying surveillance videos of businesses, searching sex offender databases and also checking on whether there have been any other similar incidents elsewhere in the Denver area.      "We think there's a predator out there. And he has to be caught, and he has to be stopped," Oates said.      He said the girl talked to the man, but he wouldn't elaborate.      The girl's grandmother, Beatrice Padilla, told The Denver Post (http://bit.ly/1auOOiB ) the girl was doing her homework in her bunk bed in her first-floor bedroom just after midnight when the suspect entered and covered the girl's mouth with his hand. She said another child was in the room but asleep at the time.      Oates said it's likely the suspect saw the light on and had been watching the girl.      Police said they had received numerous leads by midday Tuesday and urged people to continue to call in any tips.      The girl's home is in a residential neighborhood just outside Denver made up of a mix of single-family dwellings and apartments. The alley behind the house is near three apartment complexes and used by residents to access parking.      The suspect is described as a blond man, wearing a black winter jacket with a strong odor of cigarette smoke.      Neighbor Lawrence Chambers said the news was disturbing.      "I want to tell my neighbors: Protect your kids," he said. |||||	– Police in Aurora, Colorado, say an 8-year-old girl may have saved herself by not going along quietly with a man who abducted her from her home, reports the Denver Post. The girl screamed and escaped on her own after an apparent stranger cut through a screen of her bedroom window after midnight and forced her outside, say police. The girl's father heard the commotion, ran outside, and found his daughter running home to safety from a nearby alley. "This young girl immediately cried out, immediately put up a fuss and struggled," says the local police chief. "Who knows if that may have saved her life." Authorities released a sketch of a suspect and have offered a $20,000 reward, reports AP. "There is nothing to suggest that this family was targeted in particular, which in some ways make it even more chilling," says the chief.
summarize: Milo Yiannopoulos — a leader of the racist, misogynist far-right fringe movement known as the alt-right, who built his career on being hateful to people on the internet and has been described as a professional troll and the leader of an online hate mob — recently signed a book deal with Simon & Schuster imprint Threshold Editions for a reported $250,000 advance, says the Hollywood Reporter.      The response from progressives was immediate and outraged. What is Simon & Schuster — reputable, legitimate book publisher Simon & Schuster — doing giving money to the guy who declared his birthday World Patriarchy Day? (“If you have female employees, refer to them exclusively as ‘darling.’ All day.”) The guy who received a lifetime ban from Twitter for inciting a mob into sending racist, misogynistic, threatening, and generally hateful tweets to Leslie Jones? The guy whose publication history includes such gems as “Science Proves It: Fat-Shaming Works” and “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy”?      The Chicago Review of Books vowed not to review a single Simon & Schuster book in 2017. The Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Karen Hunter, who publishes with Simon & Schuster, tweeted that she was “rethinking” her relationship with the company. Prominent progressives like Washington Post journalist Wesley Lowery promised to boycott Simon & Schuster books.      In response to this disgusting validation of hate, we will not cover a single @simonschuster book in 2017. https://t.co/NAJhTgdeyX — Chicago Rev of Books (@bookschicago) December 29, 2016      The surprise and outrage that greeted the Yiannopoulos news reflects the fact that book deals like his are unusual — right now, anyway. But as the Republican Party and conservative thought evolve in the Age of Trump, such deals are likely to grow increasingly common.      Most of the so-called Big Five publishing houses who make up the core of American book publishing have at least one imprint devoted to publishing right-wing authors. Although its writers might not always receive the awards or accolades afforded to liberal writers and non-political novelists, the niche of conservative book publishing has become an enormous money-maker — one that's flourished in the last decade especially. And as alt-right discourse becomes increasingly normalized within the conservative political sphere, there is every reason to think that figures like Yiannopoulos will continue to get major book deals.      Publishing 101: The Big Five houses are made up of imprints      To understand publishing’s right-wing imprints, first you have to understand how modern American book publishing is organized.      American trade book publishing is dominated by five publishing houses, known as the Big Five: Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Hachette, Macmillan, and Simon & Schuster. Of these, Penguin Random House is the biggest, Macmillan is the smallest, and Simon & Schuster sits comfortably in the middle.      Together, these five publishing houses make up over 80 percent of the US trade publishing market share — meaning that they produce over 80 percent of the kinds of general-interest books that get sold in Barnes & Noble. The remainder is published by smaller independent presses, and those independent presses usually have specific areas of specialty. But the Big Five houses don’t need to specialize, because they can do that on an imprint level instead of a company level.      Each of the Big Five houses is made up of smaller imprints, each with its own distinct brand identity. Penguin Random House includes under its roof such imprints as Knopf, which publishes prestigious literary authors like Toni Morrison and Kazuo Ishiguro; Firebird, which publishes sci-fi and fantasy for young adults; and Clarkson Potter, which publishes cookbooks and self-help books.      Generally, the imprints of a particular publishing house will share certain parts of each other’s infrastructure — things like printing and distribution, maybe a sales force. They’ll sometimes be clumped together into “publishing groups,” which might share a marketing and publicity team. But no matter what, the editorial side of each imprint is independent. Toni Morrison’s editor and Ina Garten’s editor both work for Penguin Random House, but there’s no reason they would ever need to talk or come into contact with each other. They’re in totally different areas.      Imprints operate like independent fiefdoms      There are a lot of benefits for publishers in keeping these imprints editorially distinct. For one thing, it makes it easier to acquire an imprint. The Big Five houses often expand by buying up existing independent imprints or by merging — as Penguin and Random House, formerly independent entities, did in 2013 — and promising each imprint editorial freedom helps smooth over those transactions.      For another thing, it makes it easier for each book find its designated reader. The person buying Toni Morrison’s book is not necessarily in the market for Ina Garten’s book, so the publishing team for Toni Morrison has one set of skills and priorities, and the publishing team for Ina Garten has another. The stuff they have in common — for instance, both books need to be printed, warehoused, and distributed — they can share.      Having a diverse group of imprints is also good for company stability. If one imprint is having an off year, another can compensate. And ideally, if one imprint is having a very good year, everyone else can benefit as well. 50 Shades of Grey was published by the Penguin Random House imprint Vintage Books, but when it sold 60 million copies in 2012, everyone working at what was then just Random House (pre-Penguin merger) got a $5,000 Christmas bonus, not just Vintage employees.      But looking in from the outside, things get confusing. As you’ve probably gathered by now, publishing houses often share names with some of their groups and some of their imprints, which means that it gets complicated to distinguish between them. For instance, Penguin Random House is the home of the Penguin Publishing Group, which includes Penguin Books, Penguin Classics, and Penguin Press, each of which does different things. It’s also the home of the Random House publishing group (the official title is just Random House, which seems willfully confusing), which includes the Random House imprint, familiarly known as Little Random. These groups and imprints are just small parts of a much larger company, but the names obscure that fact.      So when we say that Milo Yiannopoulos has a book deal with Simon & Schuster, that’s technically true. But he doesn’t have a book deal with Simon & Schuster, the prestigious imprint that publishes people like Bret Easton Ellis, Dave Eggers, and Hillary Clinton. He has a book deal with Simon & Schuster, the publishing house that includes such imprints as Enliven (New Age books) and Jeter Publishing, the official publishing imprint of New York Yankee Derek Jeter.      Specifically, Yiannopoulos has a book deal with Threshold Editions, the designated right-wing imprint for Simon & Schuster.      Threshold Editions is a welcoming home for the pundits of Fox News      Threshold Editions wears its political affiliations on its sleeve. Currently wrapping up its 10-year anniversary celebrations, it has adopted the oddly bitter anniversary motto “10 Years of Being Right.” It counts among its authors Dick Cheney, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and President-elect Donald Trump. In its mission statement, it declares that it exists to “provide a forum for the creative people, bedrock principles, and innovative ideas of contemporary conservatism.”      And for the most part, that’s more or less what it does. Trump postures about his policy plans. Cheney explains why we should go back to his policies. Glenn Beck gets invective on his pet issues, like education (the federal government should get out of it), and so-called Islamic extremism (he thinks violence is inherent to Islamic teachings). Ben Shapiro explains how the media is controlled by a liberal conspiracy. The occasional lay historian gets sentimental about a dead president or two. None of it is particularly intellectually rigorous, but it’s not far away from what you’d hear on, say, Fox News — mostly because most of these authors are regular fixtures on Fox News.      Simon & Schuster isn’t alone in offering these authors a platform for their work. Threshold Editions is just one of the most recent Big Five imprints created specifically to give right-wing authors a platform.      Conservative imprints are a relatively new addition to trade publishing      The idea of specifically right-wing imprints in the Big Five houses is a relatively new one. For years, the only major player in the conservative publishing field was Regnery Books, a Washington-based press founded in 1947. Most of the big-league conservative authors have published at least one book with Regnery — Trump, Ann Coulter, Dinesh D’Souza, Newt Gingrich, and all the rest. It had some competition from The Free Press, the academic/trade crossover imprint that migrated from Macmillan to Simon & Schuster and specialized in scholarly conservative thought before it was absorbed into Simon & Schuster’s flagship imprint in 2012, but otherwise, the Big Five houses stayed away from conservative publishing.      But then, in the early ’00s, Fox News started churning out right-wing pundits with what publishers call built-in platforms: They had audiences who cared about their thoughts and opinions, and were willing to spend money to hear more of them. As those pundits’ books became reliable players on the New York Times bestseller list, the publishers who made up what was then the Big Six decided that it was time for them to join the game, the New York Times reported in 2010.      Random House, at the time independent from Penguin and the largest publisher in the Big Six, kicked off the trend with Crown Forum. Founded in 2002, the same year that Fox News became the top-rated cable news channel, it publishes Ann Coulter’s books alongside titles like Enhanced Interrogation. (Waterboarding: worth it if you do it right!)      Penguin quickly followed suit with Sentinel, founded in 2003, which publishes Mike Huckabee and books like Your Teacher Said What?!: Defending Our Kids from the Liberal Assault on Capitalism.      The smaller Simon & Schuster prudently waited a few years before diving into the burgeoning conservative-imprint field. But as it became clear that major New York trade publishing houses could make money from conservative voices just as well as niche political presses in Washington could, it jumped. It established Threshold Editions in 2006.      And from 2010 to 2013, HarperCollins had Broadside Books, which published books like Eco-Fascists: How Radical Conservationists Are Destroying Our Natural Heritage and Why ObamaCare is Wrong for America: How the New Health Care Law Drives Up Costs, Puts Government in Charge of Your Decisions, and Threatens Your Constitutional Rights. Broadside Books, which branded itself as the intellectual pinnacle of conservative publishing — the William F. Buckley to the other imprints’ Sean Hannity — is still listed on HarperCollins’s imprints page, but it has no homepage of its own, and its Twitter page hasn't been updated since 2013. HarperCollins did not reply to my questions about Broadside Books’ current status, but if it is now defunct (and all the evidence suggests that it is), then it was the only one of the Big Five conservative imprints to collapse.      The imprints that survived were all built specifically to appeal to conservative readers, but not out of any high-minded ideas about celebrating the great American belief in free speech for all, or out of deep commitment on the part of the publishing CEOs to conservative values. These imprints were established because conservative readers have demonstrated that they can put a book on the best-seller list, and the Big Five houses are in the business of trying to publish bestsellers. These imprints are cogs in a money-making machine.      And as conservatism evolves in the Age of Trump, these imprints are going to change with it in order to keep churning out books that sell.      Milo Yiannopoulos represents something new in conservative trade publishing      Milo Yiannopoulos is not a run-of-the-mill conservative thinker. His brand is ostensibly a winking, provocative, speaking-truth-to-power punk rock ethos — hence the title of his forthcoming book, Dangerous. But that image only rings true if you think that women, people of color, trans people, and other historically disenfranchised people have too much power over white cis men and need to be put in their place.      That is what Yiannopoulos believes deeply. And while many more mainstream conservative thinkers would agree with him that liberals have a stranglehold on the culture and bully those who disagree with them, Yiannopoulos’s tactics are extreme even by their standards.      He is scheduled to give a talk at Stanford on “female biological inferiority in science.” He has said that Saudi Arabia’s ban on women drivers is “the one thing” the country got right, because “behind every racist joke is a scientific fact.” He goes to a college campus and says “Feminism is cancer,” and then watches people melt down. His entire thing is to say something hyperbolically offensive that is designed to anger liberals, and then laugh at them when they take it seriously — and then he winks at his followers, so that you can’t quite tell how much he means what he says.      If, as Vox’s Aja Romano has argued, the alt-right knowingly masks sincerely felt ideals with ironic trolling, then Yiannopoulos is a master of the form. He spreads hatred and bigotry under the guise of hipper-than-thou trolling: Obviously he’s posting that swastika ironically, he’ll tell you. Can’t you take a joke? But the swastika is still there, no matter how much Yiannopoulos might posture about how hilarious it is, and it’s still spreading its intended message.      Ben Shapiro, a conservative in the more classic mold, cannot stand him. “If I can’t tell the difference between your ironic tweet and [Ku Klux Klan leader] David Duke’s, that’s your fault,” Shapiro told Bloomberg News. “He’s not making fun of racism. It’s clown nose on, clown nose off. It’s basic teenage bullshit by someone who is immature.”      Shapiro is an instructive figure because he is, in many ways, a more conventional mirror to Yiannopoulos. Like Yiannopoulos, Shapiro is published at Threshold Editions, where he wrote a book alleging that the left is strangling free speech — incidentally, the same general topic that Dangerous is slated to cover. He and Yiannopoulos briefly overlapped as writers for the right-wing website Breitbart before Shapiro left — in protest, Bloomberg News says, of its transition from far-right (more traditionally conservative) to alt-right (neo-Nazis). It’s a transition in which Yiannopoulos is considered to have been instrumental.      Now, Yiannopoulos is leading the same transition in conservative book publishing. Threshold Editions still thinks of itself as a place for the familiar Ben Shapiros of the world, but it’s also making room for the world’s Milo Yiannopouloses: for the people who perform their politics through trolling and hate speech.      “This book is the moment Milo goes mainstream”      Milo Yiannopoulos is a hateful person who has built a career on bigotry, but it is not hard to see why an editor at a right-wing publishing imprint might think it would be a good idea to sign him. He is loud, he has a loyal army of followers, and he knows how to get people’s attention. He has that all-important built-in platform.      All of that equals press attention — such as the flurry of articles the book deal prompted, including this one — and press attention usually means increased book sales. In Yiannopoulos’s case, it seems to have worked. Dangerous is currently a best-seller on Amazon.      And Yiannopoulos is a creature of the internet, which makes him attractive to an industry still trying to figure out how to survive in the digital era. In a time when YA publishers are encouraged to sign YouTube stars and see if their teen fans can be cajoled into buying books, an author who is fluent in the internet and its ways is a godsend.      But most importantly, he looks like a very possible future of the Republican party in the age of Trump. The white supremacists of the so-called alt right are ascendant right now, taking cushy White House appointments and featuring in swooning fashion profiles, and Yiannopoulos is part of their vanguard. It makes sense that an editor would make that kind of calculation and decide to bring him on.      But in identifying Yiannopoulos as a possible future of conservative thought, Threshold Editions is caught in a cycle. Because by giving him a book deal, they’re not looking at a figure who is already considered culturally legitimate and giving him another platform for his thoughts. They’re looking at a figure who is reviled in some corners of the culture and adored in others — a kind of threshold figure — and they are saying that they consider him to be legitimate. They are not just describing; they are prescribing. They have decided that Yiannopoulos seems like someone who is about to be mainstream, and so they have brought him into the mainstream themselves. When Yiannopoulos told the Hollywood Reporter that “this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream,” he was being entirely accurate.      And having brought in one Milo Yiannopoulos, it will be increasingly easy to bring in another, and then another, until all of the hatred and all of the rage of the white supremacists and misogynists and bigots on the alt-right is considered a valid part of the cultural discourse, and just another strain of thought, as legitimate as any other. It will become normal.      The imprint model means that boycotting Simon & Schuster is both difficult and ineffective      Normalizing the alt-right is incredibly dangerous, but that doesn’t mean that a boycott of Simon & Schuster is necessarily the best solution to this problem. It all goes back to that all-important imprint model.      Simon & Schuster is the home of Threshold Editions, and it is set to make a great deal of money by legitimizing and mainstreaming Milo Yiannopoulos and his hatred. But it is also the home of imprints like Salaam Reads, a Muslim-themed children’s imprint that was established with the laudable goal “to introduce readers of all faiths and backgrounds to a wide variety of Muslim children and families, and offer Muslim kids an opportunity to see themselves reflected positively in published works.” In its eponymous imprint, it publishes explicitly progressive authors like Rebecca Traister and E.J. Dionne.      That’s the basic business model of the Big Five: Publish as much as possible, as widely as possible, but keep different kinds of thinking and writing siloed off in different imprints to avoid diluting anyone’s brand. Simon & Schuster can found a new imprint dedicated to positive depictions of Muslim children in the same year that it publishes Glenn Beck’s book about how violence is inherent to Islamic teachings, and none of the people at the top will consider anything about that fact remotely contradictory. That’s just the way the business is set up, because conservative money spends just as well as progressive money.      And the imprint model makes a boycott difficult on two levels. For one thing, a would-be boycotter can’t just refuse to buy any book that has “Simon & Schuster” printed on its spine. He or she would have to keep track of which imprints Simon & Schuster owns, and any imprints they might acquire or establish in the near future.      For another thing, if progressives boycott Simon & Schuster, it’s not clear that the company will get any message from that action beyond the fact that their progressive books aren’t selling as well as they used to, but there seems to be real money in the conservative books. The imprint model’s built-in stability means that a boycott will probably not hurt the house as a whole, but it may well hurt the imprints designed to reach progressive audiences.      If progressives really want to undermine the increasing visibility of alt-right figures like Yiannopoulos, a blanket boycott of Simon & Schuster is most likely going to be counterproductive. A better response would be supporting progressive writers and writers of color and the imprints that promote them, to amplify voices that are too often undermined and ignored.      Update: This article has been updated to include the Free Press’s role in the history of conservative trade publishing, and to note that 50 Shades of Gray was published by Vintage Books, not Doubleday. ||||| Simon & Schuster UK will not join its US counterpart in publishing a book by controversial right-wing figure Milo Yiannopoulos.      Simon & Schuster UK will not join its US counterpart in publishing a book by controversial right-wing figure Milo Yiannopoulos.      A spokesperson told The Bookseller that the UK division of S&S has no plans to publish the autobiographical book, entitled Dangerous.      Yiannopoulos is an editor at Breitbart News, known as a publisher of “alt-right” articles, and was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump in the run-up to the presidential elections. He was banned from Twitter last year after allegedly encouraging people to abuse actress Leslie Jones on the social media platform.      According to the Hollywood Reporter, which broke the news of the deal, Yiannopoulos was paid $250,000 for the book, which will be published by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster in the US.      Yiannopoulos told the magazine: "I met with top execs at Simon & Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building — but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money.      "Every line of attack the forces of political correctness try on me fails pathetically. I'm more powerful, more influential and more fabulous than ever before, and this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream. Social justice warriors should be scared — very scared.”      The book is scheduled for release in March 2017 and is already number one in Amazon.com’s political commentary and opinion rankings.      S&S US’s decision has met with widespread criticism, including from Jones, who said the publisher is helping to spread hate.      However, S&S US has defended its decision to publish the book, saying it will be about free speech and adding that it does "not condone discrimination or hate speech".      “We have always published books by a wide range of authors with greatly varying, and frequently controversial opinions,” Simon & Schuster said, asking readers to “withhold judgment until they have had a chance to read the actual contents of the book”.      Last month the publisher’s c.e.o. Carolyn Reidy said it was S&S' "responsibility" both to "resist censorship" and "to stand unequivocally for freedom of speech"-"no matter how difficult that might be at times".      "As we head into 2017, we can expect that our civic and cultural life will remain turbulent," Reidy said in an end of year message to staff. "In these times it is especially important to remember that as publishers we will always endeavor to give voice to a wide range of opinions and divergent viewpoints. We publish for many different and frequently conflicting audiences, and must be fully cognizant of our responsibility to resist censorship and stand unequivocally for freedom of speech." ||||| Writers protesting at their publisher's $250,000 advance to outspoken “alt-right” figure Milo Yiannopoulos for his autobiography are threatening to find someone else to sell their work.      The publisher's Simon & Schuster's conservative imprint Threshold Editions offered the deal in December.      Earlier in the year, Mr Yiannopoulos, the tech editor of Breitbart News and a prominent supporter of Donald Trump, was banned from Twitter for allegedly encouraging a bombardment of abusive tweets towards Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones.      The book, entitled Dangerous, is due to be released in March and has already been propelled to number two on Amazon’s overall bestseller list.      Black American television writer and author Danielle Henderson, whose memoir is due out from Simon & Schuster next year, tweeted: “I’m looking at my @simonschuster contract, and unfortunately there’s no clause for ‘what if we decide to publish a white nationalist.’”      Karen Hunter, a black US radio talk show host and bestselling author, said that she was “rethinking” her relationship with the publisher.      I am rethinking my relationship with @simonschuster #Milo — Karen Hunter (@karenhunter) December 29, 2016      The Chicago Review of Books called the decision to publish his book “a disgusting validation of hate” and announced that it would not review any of Simon & Schuster’s titles this year.      The US branch of Simon & Schuster defended the controversial move with a statement on Twitter: “We do not and have never condoned discrimination or hate speech in any form.      “While we are cognizant that many may disagree vehemently with the books we publish we note that the opinions expressed therein belong to our authors, and do not reflect either a corporate viewpoint or the views of our employees.

It has not yet responded to the Standard's request for comment. |||||	– Milo Yiannopoulos was allegedly behind the racist and sexist harassment of Leslie Jones on Twitter, and now the controversial Breitbart editor has a book deal. Jones isn't letting that fact slip by quietly. After publisher Simon & Schster released a statement defending the deal from the backlash that ensued, insisting the company does not condone "discrimination or hate speech" but is committed to publishing "a wide range of authors," Jones tweeted, "Yea but you still help them spread their hate to even more people." Meanwhile, the uproar over Yiannopoulos' book deal continues elsewhere—the Evening Standard has rounded up authors who've spoken out against it, and a representative of Simon & Schuster UK tells the Bookseller that division won't be publishing the book. Over at Vox, Constance Grady attempts to explain the book deal: Yiannopoulos may be "a leader of the racist, misogynist far-right fringe movement known as the alt-right, who built his career on being hateful to people on the internet and has been described as a professional troll and the leader of an online hate mob," but there's money—increasing amounts of money—in the conservative book market.
summarize:      Yale University researchers say their new study shows how deeply ingrained our racial biases are.      Why are black preschoolers in America more than three times as likely to be suspended than their white classmates?      Perhaps because teachers are more likely to expect young black children — especially young black boys — to misbehave, according to a new Yale study.      The study, conducted by researchers at the Yale University Child Study Center, asked more than 130 preschool teachers to watch video clips of children in classrooms. The teachers were told to look for signs of “challenging behavior.”      The children in the videos were actors, and the clips did not actually show any challenging behaviors. But the teachers didn’t know that. They were anticipating trouble. And as they scanned the video clips, looking for signs of that trouble, they spent more time looking at black children than white children, according to equipment that tracked their gaze.      The teachers spent even longer looking at black boys.      That’s a sign that teachers expect problems from black children, and especially black boys, said lead researcher and Yale child psychology professor Walter S. Gilliam. It’s a finding that shows how deeply rooted racial biases are, he said, and how badly teachers need training to confront and unravel the knee-jerk perceptions of their students — perceptions they often don’t even realize they have.      “Implicit biases do not begin with black men and police. They begin with black preschoolers and their teachers, if not earlier,” he said, referring to the multiple fatal shootings of black men by police that have given rise to the Black Lives Matter movement and a national debate about law enforcement’s treatment of people of color. “Implicit bias is like the wind: You can’t see it, but you can sure see its effects.”      Black children accounted for 19 percent of all preschool students in 2013-2014, but they made up 47 percent of those who received suspensions, according to federal civil rights data.      [Five eye-opening figures from the U.S. Education Department’s latest civil rights data dump]      The study also asked teachers to complete a second task: Read a vignette about a student misbehaving in class, then rate the severity of misbehavior and decide whether the misbehavior warranted suspension, expulsion or neither.      Researchers told some of the teachers that the child’s name was DeShawn or Latoya, stereotypical black names; others heard that the child’s name was Jake or Emily, stereotypical white names. Again, researchers found that teachers’ responses differed by race: White teachers were more lenient on children they perceived as black, while black teachers were harsher.      Teachers weren’t asked to explain their ratings. But researchers said that the racial differences in their response are consistent with the theory that white teachers see black preschoolers as more likely to misbehave, so they don’t see a black child’s misbehavior as severe.      Some teachers received background information about the child’s difficult family life, to test whether such additional information might spur a more empathetic response. The empathy kicked in only when the teacher and the child shared the same race, the study found.      Linda K. Smith, who coordinates policy for Head Start in the Obama administration’s Department of Health and Human Services, said that the study offered a tough but important message for the field of early childhood education, given its roots in social justice and the notion that all children have great potential.      Only one of the 135 teachers involved in the study asked to withdraw her data after learning the real purpose of the research. Smith said that is a sign that early childhood educators are committed to the uncomfortable job of facing their own biases.      “It’s something probably we all didn’t want to hear, but we needed to know,” she said.      The study was funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and is expected to be released Wednesday at a meeting of state Head Start administrators. ||||| Bias Isn't Just A Police Problem, It's A Preschool Problem      Enlarge this image toggle caption LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR      First, a story:      Late one night, a man searches for something in a parking lot. On his hands and knees, he crawls around a bright circle of light created by a streetlamp overhead.      A woman passes, stops, takes in the scene.      "What are you looking for? Can I help?"      "My car keys. Any chance you've seen them?"      "You dropped them right around here?"      "Oh, no. I dropped them way over there," he says, gesturing vaguely to some faraway spot on the other side of the lot.      "Then why are you looking here?"      The man pauses to consider the question.      "Because this is where the light is."      New research from the Yale Child Study Center suggests that many preschool teachers look for disruptive behavior in much the same way: in just one place, waiting for it to appear.      The problem with this strategy (besides it being inefficient), is that, because of implicit bias, teachers are spending too much time watching black boys and expecting the worst.      The study      Lead researcher Walter Gilliam knew that to get an accurate measure of implicit bias among preschool teachers, he couldn't be fully transparent with his subjects about what, exactly, he was trying to study.      Implicit biases are just that — subtle, often subconscious stereotypes that guide our expectations and interactions with people.      "We all have them," Gilliam says. "Implicit biases are a natural process by which we take information, and we judge people on the basis of generalizations regarding that information. We all do it."      Even the most well-meaning teacher can harbor deep-seated biases, whether she knows it or not. So Gilliam and his team devised a remarkable — and remarkably deceptive — experiment.      At a big, annual conference for pre-K teachers, Gilliam and his team recruited 135 educators to watch a few short videos. Here's what they told them:      We are interested in learning about how teachers detect challenging      behavior in the classroom. Sometimes this involves seeing behavior before it becomes problematic. The video segments you are about to view are of preschoolers engaging in various activities. Some clips may or may not contain challenging behaviors. Your job is to press the enter key on the external keypad every time you see a behavior that could become a potential challenge.      Each video included four children: a black boy and girl and a white boy and girl.      Here's the deception: There was no challenging behavior.      While the teachers watched, eye-scan technology measured the trajectory of their gaze. Gilliam wanted to know: When teachers expected bad behavior, who did they watch?      "What we found was exactly what we expected based on the rates at which children are expelled from preschool programs," Gilliam says. "Teachers looked more at the black children than the white children, and they looked specifically more at the African-American boy."      Indeed, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Education, black children are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended from preschool than white children. Put another way, black children account for roughly 19 percent of all preschoolers, but nearly half of preschoolers who get suspended.      One reason that number is so high, Gilliam suggests, is that teachers spend more time focused on their black students, expecting bad behavior. "If you look for something in one place, that's the only place you can typically find it."      The Yale team also asked subjects to identify the child they felt required the most attention. Forty-two percent identified the black boy, 34 percent identified the white boy, while 13 percent and 10 percent identified the white and black girls respectively.      The vignette      The Yale study had two parts. And, as compelling as the eye-scan results were, Gilliam's most surprising takeaway came later.      He gave teachers a one-paragraph vignette to read, describing a child disrupting a class; there's hitting, scratching, even toy-throwing. The child in the vignette was randomly assigned what researchers considered a stereotypical name (DeShawn, Latoya, Jake, Emily), and subjects were asked to rate the severity of the behavior on a scale of one to five.      White teachers consistently held black students to a lower standard, rating their behavior as less severe than the same behavior of white students.      Gilliam says this tracks with previous research around how people may shift standards and expectations of others based on stereotypes and implicit bias. In other words, if white teachers believe that black boys are more likely to behave badly, they may be less surprised by that behavior and rate it less severely.      Black teachers, on the other hand, did the opposite, holding black students to a higher standard and rating their behavior as consistently more severe than that of white students.      Here's another key finding: Some teachers were also given information about the disruptive child's home life, to see if it made them more empathetic:      [CHILD] lives with his/her mother, his/her 8- and 6-year-old sisters,      and his/her 10-month-old baby brother. His/her home life is turbulent, between having a father who has never been a constant figure in his/her life, and a mother who struggles with depression but doesn't have the resources available to seek help. During the rare times when his/her parents are together, loud and sometimes violent disputes occur between them. In order to make ends meet, [CHILD's] mother has taken on three different jobs, and is in a constant state of exhaustion. [CHILD] and his/her siblings are left in the care of available relatives and neighbors while their mother is at work.      Guess what happened.      Teachers who received this background did react more empathetically, lowering their rating of a behavior's severity — but only if the teacher and student were of the same race.      As for white teachers rating black students or black teachers rating white students?      "If the race of the teacher and the child were different and [the teacher] received this background information, severity rates skyrocketed," Gilliam says. "And the teachers ended up feeling that the behavioral problems were hopeless and that very little could be done to actually improve the situation."      This result is consistent with previous research on empathy, Gilliam says. "When people feel some kind of shared connection to folks, when they hear more about their misfortunes, they feel more empathic to them. But if they feel that they are different from each other ... it may actually cause them to perceive that person in a more negative light."      It's impossible to separate these findings from today's broader, cultural context — of disproportionately high suspension rates for black boys and young men throughout the school years, of America's school-to-prison pipeline, and, most immediately, of the drumbeat of stories about black men being killed by police.      If implicit bias can play a role on our preschool reading rugs and in our classrooms' cozy corners, it no doubt haunts every corner of our society.      Biases are natural, as Gilliam says, but they must also be reckoned with.      The good news, if there is such a thing from work such as this, is that Gilliam and his team were ethically obligated to follow up with every one of the 135 teachers who participated in the study, to come clean about the deception.      Gilliam even gave them an out, letting them withdraw their data — for many of them, the lasting proof of their bias.      Only one did. |||||	– Are black children in preschool suspended more than three times as often as their white counterparts because they act out that much more, or because their teachers are expecting and watching for behavior problems from them more? A new study out of Yale suggests that there is an "implicit bias" among both black and white preschool teachers against boys in general and black boys especially, reports NPR. "If you look for something in one place, that's the only place you can typically find it," says lead researcher Walter Gilliam, citing the famous story of a person hunting for car keys under a street light instead of where he dropped them because that's what he can see. The Yale team used eye-scan tech to capture the gazes of 135 pre-K teachers as they watched a video of four children—a black girl, a black boy, a white girl, and a white boy. They asked the teachers to look for challenging behaviors, but the kids were all actors, reports the Washington Post, and the footage showed no challenging behaviors. Turns out the teachers all looked at the black kids more, and the boy especially, and when asked which kid needed the most attention, 42% said the black boy, 34% said the white boy, 13% said the white girl, and 10% said the black girl. "Implicit bias is like the wind: You can’t see it, but you can sure see its effects," Gilliam says. (See the shocking reason this black 3rd grader had to leave his charter school.)
summarize: MORENCI - Police in Michigan are working with law enforcement in Missoula, Montana to determine whether a box containing the remains of three children found at a home there in September could be connected to the Skelton brothers, who went missing in 2010.      Michigan State Police confirmed Thursday evening that a possible link was being explored, though a connection had yet to be made.      "There has been nothing previously reported to police linking the brothers to Montana, and it is not known at this time if the remains are from related siblings," state police said in a statement.      "Further forensic testing has been requested by police in Montana that may provide more answers. Until this testing is completed and additional investigation by law enforcement in Montana occurs, it cannot be determined if these remains belong to the missing Skelton brothers."      Montana TV news station KECI reports that a cleaning crew found a box containing the bones and teeth of three children in a shed at a Missoula home in September.      Testing of the remains determined the ages of the children were 2-4 years old, 5-8 years old and 6-10 years old, according to the report.      Their cause of death was not known.      The remains have been sent to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System for additional testing, according to the report from Montana.      Montana law enforcement officers were looking to interview a person of interest in the case earlier this week.      In 2010, three Michigan boys from Morenci, Mich. went missing after being last seen in their father's backyard on Thanksgiving Day.

John Skelton, who maintains he gave his sons to some unidentified group because he wanted to protect them from his now ex-wife, who had sole custody, told Lenawee Circuit Court Judge Margaret Noe that he has cried every day since he last saw them. He said he would have done things differently had the system not failed him.      If he was hoping for sympathy, he didn't get it from Noe, who called the state's recommended sentence of 4 to 12 years "grossly inadequate" and opted for a stricter penalty. She called Skelton's version of events "ridiculous," and admonished him for putting the boys' mother and the community through the agony of not knowing what befell them.      "For months I have asked you to return Andrew, Alexander and Tanner. You have refused to answer me truthfully," she said. "I have asked you to tell me where the children are located. You have refused, telling one conflicting story after another to explain their circumstances since they were last seen.      "Your explanations have been ridiculous, albeit more sad than anything else," Noe said.      Skelton was led out of the courtroom in shackles and was not made available to comment. His lawyer, John Glaser, objected to the severity of the sentence, telling Noe there was no cause for exceeding the guidelines because there was "nothing here to conclude a person was injured or killed."      "My client is not here on a murder charge," he said.      Skelton pleaded no contest to the unlawful imprisonment charge in July in exchange for prosecutors dropping a parental kidnapping charge. A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for sentencing purposes, and Skelton later said he made the deal because he hopes to one day spend time with his sons after he's freed.      Skelton hasn't been charged with murder, but police said early on they suspected he killed his children. After Thursday's hearing, Larry Weeks, the police chief in Skelton's hometown of Morenci, said after the hearing that he's pursuing murder charges.      "We want resolution now ... but it's a marathon, not a sprint. ... I believe that John Skelton murdered those boys," Weeks said.      Andrew, Alexander and Tanner Skelton were 9, 7, and 5 years old, respectively, when they went to spend Thanksgiving at their father's home in Morenci, about 70 miles southwest of Detroit near the Ohio state line. The boys' mother, Tanya Zuvers, had exclusive custody of them, but agreed to let them visit their father if he returned them the next day.      When Skelton didn't return them, Zuvers notified police, who arrested Skelton and launched what became a massive search effort over the next few weeks. Cell phone records indicated Skelton left home the day after Thanksgiving and drove at least as far as Holiday City, Ohio, about 20 miles southwest, before returning home. Despite the help of hundreds of volunteers, the search produced nothing.      Skelton has maintained that he gave the boys to an organization he refuses to identify, and that he doesn't know where the boys were taken. He had been embroiled in a bitter custody dispute with their mother, and he told investigators he was trying to protect the boys from her.      Zuvers pleaded guilty to fourth-degree misdemeanor criminal sexual conduct in 1998 after being accused of having sex with a 14-year-old boy she and her then-husband employed. She has denied ever mistreating her sons.      In a prepared statement she read in court Thursday, Zuvers accused her ex-husband of lying and said her sons' disappearance has been her "worst nightmare come true."      Zuvers said the start of the school year has been particularly painful for her. The boys loved playing soccer, but Andrew was going to switch to football this year.      "I see his friends going to practice and know that he should be here to enjoy this new experience."             ||||| Police in contact with Michigan...      MISSOULA, Mont. - Missoula police confirm that Michigan state police contacted them Thursday morning inquiring about the case of children’s remains found. We’re told Michigan state police are in contact with the lead investigator on the Missoula case.      NBC Montana is in touch with the NBC affiliate in Detroit, who told us about a case of three missing boys from seven years ago . There is no confirmed connection at this time.      Law enforcement officers in western Montana had a "person of interest" on Wednesday they wanted to interview after a box containing the bones and teeth of three children were found in the shed of a Missoula home in September.      A cleaning crew found the box when a tenant was evicted from the property.      Testing determined the ages of the children to be 2-4 years old, 5-8 years old and 6-10 years old. It was unclear when they died.      The State Crime Lab tells us the remains were sent to the University of North Texas for DNA testing. They will try to determine if the children were related and if they match any missing persons cases. The results will be sent back to the crime lab and uploaded to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, but that could take months.      A medical examiner with the crime lab tells us the bones were very small, meaning it may be impossible for scientists to extract DNA. |||||	– Three Michigan brothers went missing under odd circumstances in 2010, and now a box of remains in Montana may offer closure on their fate. Per MLive.com, Michigan State Police are exploring whether there's a tie between the disappearance of the Skelton brothers—9-year-old Andrew, 7-year-old Alexander, and 5-year-old Tanner—and a box found in September by cleaning staff in a Missoula home's shed. Inside the box: the teeth and bones of three children, NBC Montana reports. Testing determined the ages of the deceased children were 2 to 4 years old, 5 to 8 years old, and 6 to 10 years old, though it wasn't noted when they died. Montana's State Crime Lab has now sent the remains to the University of North Texas for DNA testing to see if they're related and to see if a link can be made with any children in a national database for missing persons. The last time anyone saw the Skelton boys was Thanksgiving Day in 2010, when they were in their father's backyard. At the time the boys vanished, John Skelton said he'd given the boys to an unnamed sanctuary group to protect them from his ex-wife. The cops believe he killed them, and in September 2011, Skelton was convicted of unlawful imprisonment and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Police say there's a "person of interest" in the case, which is being investigated as a possible homicide, per a search warrant shown on ABCFOX; the box was found by a cleaning crew after the home's tenant had been evicted. The one roadblock to the DNA testing: The bones are so tiny that it may be too difficult to draw the DNA out. "It may not be the answer we want, but it would just enable the family to have some closure," a friend of the boys' mother, Tanya Zuvers, tells the Detroit Free Press.
summarize: “Behind a steamy shower door is the indistinguishable but sexy silhouette of Jane showering.” So reads one introduction for a female character in a screenplay, according to a Hollywood producer who has begun sharing some tidbits of sexism from the scripts he reads every day.      Female writers, actors and directors have complained about gender discrimination in the industry, but producer Ross Putnam started the Twitter handle @femscriptintros Tuesday to highlight just how pervasive it is. The handle tweets out the ways that women characters are introduced in movie and television scripts, which are startlingly ageist, sexist and objectifying. In his tweets, Putnam changes all the character names to Jane.      Here are just a few examples:      Taken together, these descriptions demonstrate how difficult it must be for actresses to find robust roles — or at the very least roles where they’re treated as more than sexual objects — a problem highlighted with this year’s Oscar nominees. The movies up for best film were once again overwhelmingly male-led. Women seeking Oscar-worthy material can rarely dig up roles as brilliant politicians, scientists or adventurers; frequently, they must settle for supportive wife or ingenue. And even those roles apparently demand sex appeal.      Relegating women to sidekicks in heels is just part of the larger problem of sexism in the industry. A study released Tuesday revealed only 33% of speaking roles in films are given to women. Women directors and writers struggle for the same opportunities offered to men, and women in Hollywood are still paid far less than their male counterparts. ||||| Here’s your daily reminder that even though female representation in Hollywood may be improving incrementally, we’ve got a long way to go.

She’s attractive, but too much of a professional to care about her appearance. — Ross Putman (@femscriptintros) February 10, 2016      @femscriptintros is a reminder of Hollywood and society’s obsession with women’s looks–even the intro for a character “too professional to care about her appearance” (whatever that means) still rushes to assure the reader that she’s attractive. This is the result of male as default bias: many creators unconsciously assume that the objective audience member is a man, and as a result write female characters to appeal to the male gaze; women that are sex objects first, and characters second.      Representation isn’t just about having women characters, it’s about writing women aren’t just wish-fulfillment fantasies or valued solely for their looks. Like the Bechdel-Wallace test, it really shouldn’t be hard to write an intro for a woman without mentioning her appearance, her figure, how ‘good’ she looks for her age, or her sex drive, but apparently it is (for more proof of that, the Some Lady Parts blog has been compiling sexist character descriptions and casting calls for years).

The government of Australia's Queensland... (Associated Press)      The state-owned North Queensland Bulk Ports Corp., or NQBP, already has federal approval to dump dredged sediment in the marine park in order to expand the Abbot Point coal port near the town of Bowen, a decision that environmentalists say will endanger one of the world's most fragile ecosystems.      But Queensland Premier Campbell Newman announced Monday that his Cabinet ministers had approved a new disposal plan that would have the material reused on land.      "(It) will create a win-win situation. It will protect the unique values of the Great Barrier Reef and allow for the staged development of the important port of Abbot Point," Newman said in a statement.      The state government has asked federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt, who approved the Abbot Point expansion in 2013, to fast-track approval for the new plan.      The government hopes the new disposal plan will ensure the Abbot Point expansion can begin on schedule.      NQBP will carry out the dredging on behalf of proponents Adani and GVK Hancock. Adani wants the work to begin in June 2015.      Last week, NQBP said it was looking at alternative disposal options due to a legal challenge by an environmental group against dumping the material at sea.      Queensland's port authority said proponents feared the court case could hold up the expansion of the port by up to two years.      Outraged conservationists say the already fragile reef would be gravely threatened by the dredging, which was to occur over a 184-hectare (455-acre) area. Apart from the risk that the sediment would smother coral and sea grass, the increased shipping traffic would boost the risk of accidents, such as oil spills and collisions with delicate coral beds, environment groups argue.      In a 2012 report, the U.N.'s cultural agency, UNESCO — which includes the marine park among its World Heritage sites — expressed concern about development along the reef, including ports. It warned that the marine park was at risk of being included on a list of World Heritage sites that are in danger.      A decision to add the Great Barrier Reef to that list has been held off for a year, after UNESCO said in June that Australia had made progress in protecting it.      UNESCO's World Heritage Center has asked Australia to submit an updated report on the state of conservation of the site by February 2015. ||||| Image caption The Great Barrier Reef stretches for more than 2,600km (1,680 miles) along Australia's eastern coast.

The central government has already approved the reef dumping plan, which is linked to a major port expansion.      But the decision has proved hugely controversial, prompting stringent criticism from environmentalists.      The Queensland government said its plan to dispose of the sediment on land would "create a win-win situation".      "It will protect the unique values of the Great Barrier Reef and allow for the staged development of the important port of Abbot Point," State Premier Campbell Newman said in a statement.      Several companies want to use the Abbot Point port to export coal reserves from the Galilee Basin area in central Queensland. Late last year, the government approved an application for the coal terminal to be expanded.      Dredging is needed to allow bigger ships into the port, and earlier this year a plan to dump three million cubic metres of dredged sediment in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area was approved.      But scientists have warned the sediment could smother or poison coral, further damaging a reef already hit by climate change and other factors. The plan was also facing a legal challenge from a Queensland environmental group.      The Queensland government said that under its proposal, the dredged material could be dumped onshore at an existing site within the Abbot Point State Development Area.      The state government would now apply to the federal government for permission to dispose of the dredged material on land, it said.      "We will now ask Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt to fast-track approval of our strategy under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to ensure dredging for the expansion of Abbot Point can begin on schedule," Minister for State Development and Planning Jeff Seeney said.      Dredging is due to begin in 2015.      The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral structure, rich in marine life.      It is a Unesco-listed World Heritage Site, but in recent years the UN body has warned that it could be put on its World Heritage in Danger list because of its worsening condition.      In August, a five-yearly report by the marine park authority said that the outlook for the reef was poor despite conservation efforts, with further deterioration expected in coming years.      Climate change remained the biggest threat to the site, the report said, but poor water quality from land-based run-off, coastal development and fishing also posed challenges. |||||	– Environmental advocates were deeply concerned when officials at Australia's Great Barrier Reef approved the dumping of a vast quantity of sediment in the area. Now, a new plan aims to satisfy both those concerned about environmental impact and companies seeking to enlarge a coal terminal in the area, the BBC reports. The new idea: to dump 106 million cubic feet of dredged mud on land, the AP reports. It's "a win-win situation," says the premier of Queensland. "It will protect the unique values of the Great Barrier Reef and allow for the staged development of the important port of Abbot Point." The state has asked the federal government to OK the new plan, which would see the dredged sediment reused, the AP reports. But environmental concerns remain. The planned 455-acre dredging project could raise the danger of oil spills, for instance, environmentalists say, and the UN has warned that developing ports could threaten the park.
summarize: NASA Technologies Benefit Our Lives      Trace Space Back to You!      Have you ever wondered how space exploration impacts your daily life?      Space exploration has created new markets and new technologies that have spurred our economy and changed our lives in many ways. This year, NASA unveiled two new complementary interactive Web features, NASA City and NASA @ Home, available at www.nasa.gov/city. The new features highlight how space pervades our lives, invisible yet critical to so many aspects of our daily activities and well-being.            Health and Medicine      Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)      Red light-emitting diodes are growing plants in space and healing humans on Earth. The LED technology used in NASA space shuttle plant growth experiments has contributed to the development of medical devices such as award-winning WARP 10, a hand-held, high-intensity, LED unit developed by Quantum Devices Inc. The WARP 10 is intended for the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, arthritis, stiffness, and muscle spasms, and also promotes muscle relaxation and increases local blood circulation. The WARP 10 is being used by the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Navy as a noninvasive “soldier self-care” device that aids front-line forces with first aid for minor injuries and pain, thereby improving endurance in combat. The next-generation WARP 75 has been used to relieve pain in bone marrow transplant patients, and will be used to combat the symptoms of bone atrophy, multiple sclerosis, diabetic complications, Parkinson’s disease, and in a variety of ocular applications. (Spinoff 2005, 2008)      Infrared Ear Thermometers            Diatek Corporation and NASA developed an aural thermometer, which weighs only 8 ounces and uses infrared astronomy technology to measure the amount of energy emitted by the eardrum, the same way the temperature of stars and planets is measured. This method avoids contact with mucous membranes, virtually eliminating the possibility of cross infection, and permits rapid temperature measurement of newborn, critically-ill, or incapacitated patients. NASA supported the Diatek Corporation, a world leader in electronic thermometry, through the Technology Affiliates Program. (Spinoff 1991)      Artificial Limbs            NASA’s continued funding, coupled with its collective innovations in robotics and shock-absorption/comfort materials are inspiring and enabling the private sector to create new and better solutions for animal and human prostheses. Advancements such as Environmental Robots Inc.’s development of artificial muscle systems with robotic sensing and actuation capabilities for use in NASA space robotic and extravehicular activities are being adapted to create more functionally dynamic artificial limbs (Spinoff 2004). Additionally, other private-sector adaptations of NASA’s temper foam technology have brought about custom-moldable materials offering the natural look and feel of flesh, as well as preventing friction between the skin and the prosthesis, and heat/moisture buildup. (Spinoff 2005)      Ventricular Assist Device            Collaboration between NASA, Dr. Michael DeBakey, Dr. George Noon, and MicroMed Technology Inc. resulted in a lifesaving heart pump for patients awaiting heart transplants. The MicroMed DeBakey ventricular assist device (VAD) functions as a “bridge to heart transplant” by pumping blood throughout the body to keep critically ill patients alive until a donor heart is available. Weighing less than 4 ounces and measuring 1 by 3 inches, the pump is approximately one-tenth the size of other currently marketed pulsatile VADs. This makes it less invasive and ideal for smaller adults and children. Because of the pump’s small size, less than 5 percent of the patients implanted developed device-related infections. It can operate up to 8 hours on batteries, giving patients the mobility to do normal, everyday activities. (Spinoff 2002)            + Back to Top      Transportation      Anti-Icing Systems            NASA funding under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and work with NASA scientists advanced the development of the certification and integration of a thermoelectric deicing system called Thermawing, a DC-powered air conditioner for single-engine aircraft called Thermacool, and high-output alternators to run them both. Thermawing, a reliable anti-icing and deicing system, allows pilots to safely fly through ice encounters and provides pilots of single-engine aircraft the heated wing technology usually reserved for larger, jet-powered craft. Thermacool, an innovative electric air conditioning system, uses a new compressor whose rotary pump design runs off an energy-efficient, brushless DC motor and allows pilots to use the air conditioner before the engine even starts. (Spinoff 2007)      Highway Safety            Safety grooving, the cutting of grooves in concrete to increase traction and prevent injury, was first developed to reduce aircraft accidents on wet runways. Represented by the International Grooving and Grinding Association, the industry expanded into highway and pedestrian applications. The technique originated at Langley Research Center, which assisted in testing the grooving at airports and on highways. Skidding was reduced, stopping distance decreased, and a vehicle’s cornering ability on curves was increased. The process has been extended to animal holding pens, steps, parking lots, and other potentially slippery surfaces. (Spinoff 1985)      Improved Radial Tires            Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company developed a fibrous material, five times stronger than steel, for NASA to use in parachute shrouds to soft-land the Vikings on the Martian surface. The fiber’s chain-like molecular structure gave it incredible strength in proportion to its weight. Recognizing the increased strength and durability of the material, Goodyear expanded the technology and went on to produce a new radial tire with a tread life expected to be 10,000 miles greater than conventional radials. (Spinoff 1976)      Chemical Detection            NASA contracted with Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) to develop moisture- and pH-sensitive sensors to warn of potentially dangerous corrosive conditions in aircraft before significant structural damage occurs. This new type of sensor, using a specially manufactured optical fiber whose entire length is chemically sensitive, changes color in response to contact with its target. After completing the work with NASA, IOS was tasked by the U.S. Department of Defense to further develop the sensors for detecting chemical warfare agents and potential threats, such as toxic industrial compounds and nerve agents, for which they proved just as successful. IOS has additionally sold the chemically sensitive fiber optic cables to major automotive and aerospace companies, who are finding a variety of uses for the devices such as aiding experimentation with nontraditional power sources, and as an economical “alarm system” for detecting chemical release in large facilities. (Spinoff 2007)            + Back to Top            Public Safety      Video Enhancing and Analysis Systems            Intergraph Government Solutions developed its Video Analyst System (VAS) by building on Video Image Stabilization and Registration (VISAR) technology created by NASA to help FBI agents analyze video footage. Originally used for enhancing video images from nighttime videotapes made with hand-held camcorders, VAS is a state-of-the-art, simple, effective, and affordable tool for video enhancement and analysis offering benefits such as support of full-resolution digital video, stabilization, frame-by-frame analysis, conversion of analog video to digital storage formats, and increased visibility of filmed subjects without altering underlying footage. Aside from law enforcement and security applications, VAS has also been adapted to serve the military for reconnaissance, weapons deployment, damage assessment, training, and mission debriefing. (Spinoff 2001)      Land Mine Removal            Due to arrangements such as the one between Thiokol Propulsion and NASA that permits Thiokol to use NASA’s surplus rocket fuel to produce a flare that can safely destroy land mines, NASA is able to reduce propellant waste without negatively impacting the environment, and Thiokol is able to access the materials needed to develop the Demining Device flare. The Demining Device flare uses a battery-triggered electric match to ignite and neutralize land mines in the field without detonation. The flare uses solid rocket fuel to burn a hole in the mine’s case and burn away the explosive contents so the mine can be disarmed without hazard. (Spinoff 2000)      Fire-Resistant Reinforcement            Built and designed by Avco Corporation, the Apollo heat shield was coated with a material whose purpose was to burn and thus dissipate energy during reentry while charring, to form a protective coating to block heat penetration. NASA subsequently funded Avco’s development of other applications of the heat shield, such as fire-retardant paints and foams for aircraft, which led to the world’s first intumescent epoxy material, which expands in volume when exposed to heat or flames, acting as an insulating barrier and dissipating heat through burn-off. Further innovations based on this product include steel coatings devised to make high-rise buildings and public structures safer by swelling to provide a tough and stable insulating layer over the steel for up to 4 hours of fire protection, ultimately to slow building collapse and provide more time for escape. (Spinoff 2006)      Firefighter Gear            Firefighting equipment widely used throughout the United States is based on a NASA development that coupled Agency design expertise with lightweight materials developed for the U.S. Space Program. A project that linked NASA and the National Bureau of Standards resulted in a lightweight breathing system including face mask, frame, harness, and air bottle, using an aluminum composite material developed by NASA for use on rocket casings. Aerospace technology has been beneficially transferred to civil-use applications for years, but perhaps the broadest fire-related technology transfer is the breathing apparatus worn by firefighters for protection from smoke inhalation injury. Additionally, radio communications are essential during a fire to coordinate hose lines, rescue victims, and otherwise increase efficiency and safety. NASA’s inductorless electronic circuit technology contributed to the development of a lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than 3 ounces to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials—developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry—which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters. (Spinoff 1976)            + Back to Top      Consumer, Home, and Recreation      Temper Foam            As the result of a program designed to develop a padding concept to improve crash protection for airplane passengers, Ames Research Center developed a foam material with unusual properties. The material is widely used and commonly known as temper foam or “memory foam.” The material has been incorporated into a host of widely used and recognized products including mattresses, pillows, military and civilian aircraft, automobiles and motorcycles, sports safety equipment, amusement park rides and arenas, horseback saddles, archery targets, furniture, and human and animal prostheses. Its high-energy absorption and soft characteristics not only offer superior protection in the event of an accident or impact, but enhanced comfort and support for passengers on long flights or those seeking restful sleep. Today, temper foam is being employed by NASCAR to provide added safety in racecars. (Spinoff 1976, 1977, 1979, 1988, 1995, 2002, 2005)      Enriched Baby Food            Commercially available infant formulas now contain a nutritional enrichment ingredient that traces its existence to NASA-sponsored research that explored the potential of algae as a recycling agent for long-duration space travel. The substance, formulated into the products life’sDHA and life’sARA, can be found in over 90 percent of the infant formulas sold in the United States, and are added to the infant formulas sold in over 65 additional countries. The products were developed and are manufactured by Martek Biosciences Corporation, which has pioneered the commercial development of products based on microalgae; the company’s founders and principal scientists acquired their expertise in this area while working on the NASA program. (Spinoff 1996, 2008)      Portable Cordless Vacuums            Apollo and Gemini space mission technologies created by Black & Decker have helped change the way we clean around the house. For the Apollo space mission, NASA required a portable, self-contained drill capable of extracting core samples from below the lunar surface. Black & Decker was tasked with the job, and developed a computer program to optimize the design of the drill’s motor and insure minimal power consumption. That computer program led to the development of a cordless miniature vacuum cleaner called the Dustbuster. (Spinoff 1981)      Freeze Drying Technology            In planning for the long-duration Apollo missions, NASA conducted extensive research into space food. One of the techniques developed was freeze drying—Action Products commercialized this technique, concentrating on snack food. The foods are cooked, quickly frozen, and then slowly heated in a vacuum chamber to remove the ice crystals formed by the freezing process. The final product retains 98 percent of its nutrition and weighs only 20 percent of its original weight. Today, one of the benefits of this advancement in food preparation includes simple nutritious meals available to handicapped and otherwise homebound senior adults unable to take advantage of existing meal programs sponsored by government and private organizations. (Spinoff 1976, 1994)            + Back to Top      Environmental and Agricultural Resources      Harnessing Solar Energy            Homes across the country are now being outfitted with modern, high-performance, low-cost, single crystal silicon solar power cells that allow them to reduce their traditional energy expenditures and contribute to pollution reduction. The advanced technology behind these solar devices—which are competitively-priced and provide up to 50 percent more power than conventional solar cells—originated with the efforts of a NASA-sponsored 28-member coalition of companies, government groups, universities, and nonprofits forming the Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) Alliance. ERAST’s goal was to foster the development of remotely piloted aircraft intended to fly unmanned at high altitudes for days at a time, requiring advanced solar power sources that did not add weight. As a result, SunPower Corporation created the most advanced silicon-based cells available for terrestrial or airborne applications. (Spinoff 2005)      Pollution Remediation            A product using NASA’s microencapsulating technology is available to consumers and industry enabling them to safely and permanently clean petroleum-based pollutants from water. The microencapsulated wonder, Petroleum Remediation Product or “PRP,” has revolutionized the way oil spills are cleaned. The basic technology behind PRP is thousands of microcapsules—tiny balls of beeswax with hollow centers. Water cannot penetrate the microcapsule’s cell, but oil is absorbed right into the beeswax spheres as they float on the water’s surface. Contaminating chemical compounds that originally come from crude oil (such as fuels, motor oils, or petroleum hydrocarbons) are caught before they settle, limiting damage to ocean beds. (Spinoff 1994, 2006)      Water Purification            NASA engineers are collaborating with qualified companies to develop a complex system of devices intended to sustain the astronauts living on the International Space Station and, in the future, those who go on to explore the Moon. This system, tentatively scheduled for launch in 2008, will make use of available resources by turning wastewater from respiration, sweat, and urine into drinkable water. Commercially, this system is benefiting people all over the world who need affordable, clean water. By combining the benefits of chemical adsorption, ion exchange, and ultra-filtration processes, products using this technology yield safe, drinkable water from the most challenging sources, such as in underdeveloped regions where well water may be heavily contaminated. (Spinoff 1995, 2006)      + Back to Top      Computer Technology      Better Software            From real-time weather visualization and forecasting, high-resolution 3-D maps of the Moon and Mars, to real-time tracking of the International Space Station and the space shuttle, NASA is collaborating with Google Inc. to solve a variety of challenging technical problems ranging from large-scale data management and massively distributed computing, to human-computer interfaces—with the ultimate goal of making the vast, scattered ocean of data more accessible and usable. With companies like InterSense, NASA continues to fund and collaborate on other software advancement initiatives benefiting such areas as photo/video image enhancement, virtual-reality/design, simulation training, and medical applications. (Spinoff 2005)      Structural Analysis            NASA software engineers have created thousands of computer programs over the decades equipped to design, test, and analyze stress, vibration, and acoustical properties of a broad assortment of aerospace parts and structures (before prototyping even begins). The NASA Structural Analysis Program, or NASTRAN, is considered one of the most successful and widely-used NASA software programs. It has been used to design everything from Cadillacs to roller coaster rides. Originally created for spacecraft design, NASTRAN has been employed in a host of non-aerospace applications and is available to industry through NASA’s Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC). COSMIC maintains a library of computer programs from NASA and other government agencies and offers them for sale at a fraction of the cost of developing a new program, benefiting companies around the world seeking to solve the largest, most difficult engineering problems. (Spinoff 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1998)      Refrigerated Internet-Connected Wall Ovens            Embedded Web Technology (EWT) software—originally developed by NASA for use by astronauts operating experiments on available laptops from anywhere on the International Space Station—lets a user monitor and/or control a device remotely over the Internet. NASA supplied this technology and guidance to TMIO LLC, who went on to develop a low-cost, real-time remote control and monitoring of a new intelligent oven product named “ConnectIo.” With combined cooling and heating capabilities, ConnectIo provides the convenience of being able to store cold food where it will remain properly refrigerated until a customized pre-programmable cooking cycle begins. The menu allows the user to simply enter the dinner time, and the oven automatically switches from refrigeration to the cooking cycle, so that the meal will be ready as the family arrives home for dinner. (Spinoff 2005)      + Back to Top      Industrial Productivity      Powdered Lubricants            NASA’s scientists developed a solid lubricant coating material that is saving the manufacturing industry millions of dollars. Developed as a shaft coating to be deposited by thermal spraying to protect foil air bearings used in oil-free turbomachinery, like gas turbines, this advanced coating, PS300, was meant to be part of a larger project: an oil-free aircraft engine capable of operating at high temperatures with increased reliability, lowered weight, reduced maintenance, and increased power. PS300 improves efficiency, lowers friction, reduces emissions, and has been used by NASA in advanced aeropropulsion engines, refrigeration compressors, turbochargers, and hybrid electrical turbogenerators. ADMA Products has found widespread industrial applications for the material. (Spinoff 2005)      Improved Mine Safety            An ultrasonic bolt elongation monitor developed by a NASA scientist for testing tension and high-pressure loads on bolts and fasteners has continued to evolve over the past three decades. Today, the same scientist and Luna Innovations are using a digital adaptation of this same device for a plethora of different applications, including non-destructive evaluation of railroad ties, groundwater analysis, radiation dosimetry, and as a medical testing device to assess levels of internal swelling and pressure for patients suffering from intracranial pressure and compartment syndrome, a painful condition that results when pressure within muscles builds to dangerous levels. The applications for this device continue to expand. (Spinoff 1978, 2005, 2008)      Food Safety Systems            Faced with the problem of how and what to feed an astronaut in a sealed capsule under weightless conditions while planning for human space flight, NASA enlisted the aid of The Pillsbury Company to address two principal concerns: eliminating crumbs of food that might contaminate the spacecraft’s atmosphere and sensitive instruments, and assuring absolute freedom from potentially catastrophic disease-producing bacteria and toxins. Pillsbury developed the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept, potentially one of the most far-reaching space spinoffs, to address NASA’s second concern. HACCP is designed to prevent food safety problems rather than to catch them after they have occurred. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has applied HACCP guidelines for the handling of seafood, juice, and dairy products. (Spinoff 1991)            + Back to Top       ||||| A technology developed by NASA and the US Department of Homeland Security designed to save people trapped by debris in natural disasters has been used in the field for the first time. FINDER (Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response) lived up to its name, locating and saving four people trapped under rubble for days after the 7.8 earthquake in Nepal killed more than 7,000 people and injured countless others.      FINDER is a radar machine that sends a continuous microwave signal through the rubble, and can detect a human’s breathing or heartbeat (and distinguish it from the movement of an animal). It can locate people hidden behind 20 feet of solid concrete or buried beneath 30 feet of rubble, and the person doesn’t need to be conscious to be detected.      The technology is based on remote radar sensing that NASA originally developed to detect life on other planets. (Talk about versatility.) It was deployed with search and rescue teams to Nepal on April 29, four days after the earthquake struck. It had been tested many times before, but had yet to be implemented in a real-life emergency.      “NASA technology plays many roles: driving exploration, protecting the lives of our astronauts and improving—even saving—the lives of people on Earth,” David Miller, NASA’s chief technologist, said in a press statement. “FINDER exemplifies how technology designed for space exploration has profound impacts to life on Earth.”      Many other NASA technologies have been used to help life here on Earth, like land mine removal techniques, firefighting gear, and water purification devices.      NASA is working to commercialize the FINDER technology in order to get it into the hands of more first responders. No doubt more earthquake victims could have been saved if FINDER was deployed with more search and rescue teams. ||||| GIF      Building collapses are a tragic and overwhelmingly fatal occurrence in the developing world. But that could soon change once NASA and the DHS's revolutionary, handheld radar unit comes to fruition. It scans for and identifies buried building collapse victims based solely on their breathing patterns and heartbeats.      Dubbed the FINDER (Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response), this miniaturized radar system is based on a remote-sensing system originally developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to find extraterrestrial life on potentially habitable exo-planets. It is also routinely used in NASA's Deep Space Network to calculate the distances between spacecraft and analyze the internal structure of Saturn. It works by bouncing microwaves off of an object—a pile of debris, a planet, or what have you—and analyzing the echoed signal. Sophisticated algorithms developed at the JPL then isolate even the weakest pulse and shallowest breath from the cacophony of background noise.      Advertisement      "Detecting small motions from the victim's heartbeat and breathing from a distance uses the same kind of signal processing as detecting the small changes in motion of spacecraft like Cassini as it orbits Saturn," said James Lux, task manager for FINDER at JPL, said in a press statement. In fact, the system is so sensitive, it can track a heartbeat through 30 feet (9 meters) of crushed materials, 20 feet (6 meters) of solid concrete, or from 100 feet (30 meters) in open spaces.      The FINDER must still undergo rigorous testing before being adopted by FEMA for use in the field but those trials should be completed by the end of next year. "The ultimate goal of FINDER is to help emergency responders efficiently rescue victims of disasters," said John Price, program manager for the First Responders Group in Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, in a press statement. "The technology has the potential to quickly identify the presence of living victims, allowing rescue workers to more precisely deploy their limited resources."      Indeed, this technology easily lends itself to a huge number of search and rescue, law enforcement, conservation, and recreational uses. NASA even hopes to adapt it for future space missions as a means of wirelessly monitoring astronauts' vital signs. [NASA - Gifamization of RaoulIncorporated89's Aliens motion tracker radar by Michael Hession] ||||| A couple years ago, NASA and DHS unveiled a portable radar unit based on technology used to monitor spacecraft. This radar unit, though, would be used closer to home—to find people burried under rubble. In the first real-world demonstration of its use, the device helped save 4 men trapped under earthquake rubble in Nepal.            After the earthquake hit, rescuers in the village of Chautara got two prototype units of the device called FINDER, or Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response. The core of the device is a system that bounces microwaves around to “see.” Crucially, it can discern faint heartbeats and breaths in people buried under several feet of rubble.      Advertisement      In this case, FINDER was apparently able to detect the heartbeats of two men each in two different collapsed buildings. The men had been trapped for days, under as much as 10 feet of rubble.            The details of the rescues are otherwise scant, so it’s hard to say exactly what would have happened without FINDER. Still, it shows the FINDER works out in the field and not just in controlled test situations. We hear about the potential in new technologies all the time—with FINDER, some of that potential just became reality.

The village of Chautara received two prototype FINDER devices four days after the disaster struck, Gizmodo reports. The development of the handheld gadgets—whose name is an acronym for Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response—was actually spurred by technology intended for studying the possibility of alien life, the site notes. The devices fire out what Quartz describes as a "continuous microwave signal," using radar to detect heartbeats or breathing, and can discern the presence of a human from the movement of an animal. They've been shown to work through 30 feet of rubble or 20 feet of solid concrete, NASA reports. In this case, the four men in two separate buildings were found buried below up to 10 feet of debris. The rescue marked the first time FINDER has been used in a real-life situation, Gizmodo notes. "FINDER exemplifies how technology designed for space exploration has profound impacts to life on Earth," says NASA's chief technologist, Dr. David Miller. Now the agency is looking to go commercial with the technology so more rescue teams can access it, notes Quartz, which flags other ways NASA has helped save lives: Its technology has bolstered everything from firefighting gear to land mine removal methods. (Another incredible rescue story saw a 101-year-old saved in Nepal.)
summarize: Fort Bend County shooting that left three dead started with 'family meeting'      The Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office responded to more than a dozen calls for help, including three attempted suicides, in four years at the troubled Katy home where a family meeting Friday erupted into violence that ended with a mother and two daughters fatally wounded in the street.      But Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls said he didn't know if the mental health calls came from Christy Byrd Sheats, 42, a vocal Second Amendment proponent who shot her two daughters before being gunned down by police.      "She may be dealing with a mental crisis, but we cannot confirm that Christy suffered from mental issues; the only one who knows that is her husband," Nehls said.      "It just seems like an argument — a domestic disturbance in a family, that turns into a shooting where a mother went out and shot her two daughters — somebody would say she's got mental health issues because who in her right mind would do that," he said.      The girls' father, Jason Sheats, 45, was also targeted in the shooting but escaped unharmed down the cul-de-sac. He is cooperating fully with investigators, Nehls said.      "That will be our job here, that will be the investigators' focus now for the next coming days, to try and pinpoint the motive," he said. "And if she was suffering from some type of mental illness, what type of outreach, what type of help she was getting.      "I think you want to know, did the system fail her? Did we fail her? Did her family fail her? I would want to know. I would want to get to the bottom of it," he said.      READ MORE: Family argument caused mother to shoot, kill daughters      Investigators said Christy Sheats had called a family meeting on Friday, which also happened to be her husband's birthday. An argument ensued, and she lifted a five-shot, .38-caliber handgun and opened fire on Taylor Sheats, 22, and Madison Sheats, 17.      The father and both daughters managed to get out of the front door of their Katy-area home. Madison fell and died after leaving the house.      Taylor ran into the street, where her mother shot her again. A witness said Christy Sheats returned to the home to reload the gun, then came back outside and shot Taylor once more.      Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office officials arrived at the scene in time to see the final shot. They shot the mother after she refused to drop the gun, officials said.      Taylor Sheats was transported by helicopter to the Texas Medical Center, where she later died.      READ MORE: Police identify woman and two daughters she shot dead      Christy Sheats had posted several times on her Facebook page in support of the Second Amendment and in opposition to gun control efforts.      "It would be horribly tragic if my ability to protect myself or my family were to be taken away, but that's exactly what Democrats are determined to do by banning semi-automatic handguns," she said in a March Facebook post.      The shooting came just days before Taylor Sheats had planned to be married, according to another Facebook post.      The young woman was set to marry her boyfriend of four years, Juan Lugo, at a small wedding on Monday, followed later by a larger celebration, the girls' grandmother, Ann Sheats Wooten, posted on Facebook.      "They were to be married Monday and later again after graduation from college with a big wedding," Wooten posted Sunday evening.      The couple may have obtained a marriage license as late as Friday, the day of the shooting. Texas law requires a 72-hour waiting period after the issuance of a marriage license.      Taylor attended Lone Star College-CyFair and Seven Lakes High School in the Katy Independent School District. Her sister reportedly also attended the school.

"You're one of the strongest people I know, if not the strongest, and you have had to overcome so much in your life but you still manage to love us and put your everything into being a mom," Taylor said in the post.      Taylor had also stated in an April Facebook post that she supported the Second Amendment, but posted a meme that questioned the refusal of gun activists to accept any limitations.      "Don't punish me because SOME gun owners are nutjobs," the meme stated, with a photo of the Sandy Hook Elementary children escaping a gunman with their teachers.      Taylor had also tried to raise awareness of anxiety and depression among college students on her Facebook page.      "As someone who has dealt with anxiety for the overwhelming majority of my life, I want to create a space for students dealing with generalized anxiety, depression, panic attacks, test anxiety, etc.," she posted on Facebook in March.      The Harris County Medical Examiner's office has not yet completed autopsies of the three, but indicated that Taylor Sheats died at a hospital of gunshot wounds to the head and torso.      Madison Sheats died of a gunshot on the neck that went into her chest, according to the medical examiner.      Christy Sheats died from a gunshot wound to the chest. ||||| FULSHEAR, Texas -- A Texas mother accused of gunning down her two adult daughters opened fire in her home, then reloaded her gun before again shooting one of her daughters in the street, the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Monday.      Police say the shooting happened around 5 p.m. Friday in the family's home outside the Houston suburb of Fulshear. Just before, they say, 42-year-old Christy Sheats had convened a "family meeting" inside their home. Sheats' daughters, Taylor, 22, and Madison, 17, and her husband Jason, 45, had gathered in the living room. During the meeting, Sheats held up a gun and shot both of her daughers, police say.      Sheats had been arguing with her husband about marital issues before she began shooting, Maj. Chad Norvell of the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office tells Crimesider.      "The husband and wife weren't getting along," Norvell said.      According to a police press release, Jason Sheats and both daughters managed to flee through the front door. Madison Sheats, who was shot once, soon collapsed and died.      Taylor Sheats ran into the street and Christy Sheats followed, shooting Taylor again, police say. Jason Sheats ran to the end of a cul-de-sac and was uninjured.      A witness told police Christy Sheats went back inside the home to reload the gun, and then returned and shot Taylor Sheats once more. Taylor Sheats was shot three times, police tell Crimesider. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she died.      Police say a deputy with the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office and an officer from nearby Fulshear Police Department responded. The officers saw the woman shooting one of the girls in the street, police say. They say Christy Shears didn't obey the Fulshear officer's demand to drop the handgun and the officer fired once, killing her.      The sheriff's office has responded to 14 calls for service at the home since January of 2012, police say. Some of those calls were for accidental alarm trips, Norvell told Crimesider, but in five of those instances, someone at the home called for medical response. Norvell couldn't release details about why responders were called in those cases.      During one call, in November of 2015, a third party requested a welfare check and reported that the couple was arguing. Norvell said it was a verbal argument and police determined there hadn't been physical abuse. There were no charges filed.      Police haven't yet determined a motive for the shooting. Jason Sheats gave an initial interview to police, but Norvell said investigators "don't want to push him too much."      "He's in a difficult state right now," Norvell said.      Jezebel reports Christy Sheats had expressed support on Facebook for her right to carry a semi-automatic handgun recently, writing: "It would be horribly tragic if my ability to protect myself or my family were to be taken away, but that's exactly what Democrats are determined to do by banning semi-automatic handguns." ||||| Sorry, your browser doesn't support Flash , needs a Flash update , or has Flash disabled.

Authorities say Christy Sheats called a "family meeting" on Friday—her husband's birthday—and opened fire on daughters Madison, 17, and Taylor, 22, with a five-shot, .38-caliber handgun after the family gathered in the living room of their Katy-area home, NBC reports. The husband and both daughters fled, but Madison collapsed and died soon after leaving the house, investigators say. Sheats shot Taylor outside the home, went inside to reload, and returned to shoot her daughter again, witnesses say. Police officers saw the final shot and killed Sheats after she refused to drop the gun. The Houston Chronicle reports that Taylor had planned to marry her boyfriend on Monday, and may have obtained a marriage license the day she was killed. Maj. Chad Norvell of the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office tells CBS News that the husband and wife had been arguing before the shooting. Norvell says Jason Sheats has been interviewed by police, but they don't want to "push him too much" because "he is in a difficult state right now." Family friend Madison Davey tells KTRK that the sisters were "daddy's girls," and the father has told her Sheats killed them to make him suffer. "He told Christy, 'Just shoot yourself.

(AP Photo/Rob Carr, File) (Associated Press)      Republican Senate nominee Christine O'Donnell of Delaware said in a 2006 debate that China was plotting to take over America and claimed to have classified information about the country that she couldn't divulge.      O'Donnell's comments came as she and two other Republican candidates debated U.S. policy on China during Delaware's 2006 Senate primary, which O'Donnell ultimately lost.

summarize: Image copyright AFP Image caption Jabbari was put in solitary confinement for two months after her arrest and went on trial in 2008      Iran has gone ahead with an execution of a woman despite an international campaign urging a reprieve.      Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was hanged in a Tehran prison on Saturday morning. She had been convicted of killing a man she said was trying to sexually abuse her.      Jabbari was arrested in 2007 for the murder of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former intelligence ministry worker.      Human rights group Amnesty International said her execution was "deeply disappointing in the extreme".      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ms Jabbari's mother, Shole Pakravan, told the BBC she had visited her daughter just before the execution      Both the US State Department and British Foreign Office condemned the execution.      UK Foreign Minister Tobias Ellwood MP called on Iran to abolish the use of the death penalty.      "The UN noted that her conviction was allegedly based on confessions made while under threat. I urge Iran to put a moratorium on all executions," he said in a statement.      A campaign calling for a halt to the execution was launched on Facebook and Twitter last month and appeared to have brought a temporary stay in execution.      However, government news agency Tasnim said on Saturday that Jabbari had been executed after her relatives failed to gain consent from the victim's family for a reprieve.      It said her claims of self-defence had not been proved in court.      A Facebook page set up to campaign for a stay now says simply: "Rest in peace".      Image copyright Facebook      'True intentions'      After her arrest, Jabbari had been placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she reportedly did not have access to a lawyer or her family.      She was sentenced to death by a criminal court in Tehran in 2009.      Amnesty International said she was convicted after a deeply flawed investigation.      Image copyright AP Image caption Activists say that Reyhaneh Jabbari's confession was given under duress      Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Programme said: "This is another bloody stain on Iran's human rights record."      "Tragically, this case is far from uncommon. Once again Iran has insisted on applying the death penalty despite serious concerns over the fairness of the trial."      Amnesty said that although Jabbari admitted to stabbing Abdolali Sarbandi once in the back, she alleged that there was someone else in the house who actually killed him.      Jalal Sarbandi, the victim's eldest son, said Jabbari had refused to identify the man.      He told Iranian media in April: "Only when her true intentions are exposed and she tells the truth about her accomplice and what really went down will we be prepared to grant mercy,"      The United Nations says Iran has executed about 250 people this year.

Reyhaneh Jabbari was sentenced to death in 2009 after a deeply flawed investigation and trial which failed to examine all of the evidence.      “This abhorrent execution must not be allowed to take place, particularly when there are serious doubts about the circumstances of the killing,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director at Amnesty International.      “Instead of continuing to execute people, authorities in Iran should reform their judicial system, which dangerously relies on processes which fail to meet international law and standards for fair trial.”      “Under international human rights standards people charged with crimes punishable by death are entitled to the strictest observance of all fair trial guarantees.”      Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was arrested in 2007 for the murder of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence. She was placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she did not have access to a lawyer or her family. Reyhaneh Jabbari was sentenced to death under qesas (“retribution-in-kind”) by a criminal court in Tehran in 2009.      Amnesty International understands that although Reyhaneh Jabbari admitted to stabbing the man once from the back, she said another man who was also in the house killed Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi. Her claim is believed to have never been properly investigated.      “Authorities in Iran must immediately halt Reyhaneh Jabbari’s execution. It is unacceptable that she was not provided with a lawyer during questioning and the failure to investigate the presence of another man in the house leaves too many questions unanswered,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui.      Reyhaneh Jabbari’s mother said today in a Facebook post that authorities in Evin prison told her she would have to go to the facility to “collect the body” tomorrow.      Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution, because the death penalty violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.      Background Information      On 14 September 2014, the judicial authorities reportedly pressured Reyhaneh Jabbari to remove her lawyer Mohammad Ali Jedari Foroughi from her case and retain an inexperienced lawyer in his place. This was done in an apparent bid to disrupt the lawyer’s efforts to guarantee an investigation into the presence of another man in the house.      Amnesty International understands that before being removed from her case, Mohammad Ali Jedari Foroughi’s repeated requests to meet with his client, and access her court file had been denied. ||||| Activists say designer killed man in self defence after he tried to sexually assault her, and confession came under duress      Iran has ignored an international campaign to spare the life of a 26-year-old woman convicted of murder by hanging her at dawn on Saturday.      Reyhaneh Jabbari had spent five years on death row for stabbing a 47-year-old surgeon who had previously worked for the intelligence ministry, the official IRNA news agency reported.      The UN and bodies including the European Union and Amnesty International had said that the interior designer’s confession for killing Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi in 2007 was obtained under intense pressure and threats from Iranian prosecutors, and she should have had a retrial.      Ahmed Shaheed, the UN’s human rights rapporteur on Iran, said in April that the killing was an act of self defence. Sarbandi had offered to hire Jabbari to redesign his office and took her to an apartment where he tried to sexually abuse her.      Iranian actors and other prominent figures had also appealed for a stay of execution.      Efforts for clemency had intensified in recent weeks. Jabbari’s mother was allowed to visit her for one hour on Friday, Amnesty said - a custom that tends to precede executions in Iran.      However, Sarbandi’s family insisted the murder was premeditated and that Jabbari had confessed to buying a knife two days before the killing.      According to Jalal Sarbandi, the victim’s eldest son, Jabbari testified that a man was present in the apartment where his father was killed but she had refused to reveal his identity.      He said in April that his family “would not even contemplate mercy until truth is unearthed”.      “Only when her true intentions are exposed and she tells the truth about her accomplice and what really went down will we be prepared to grant mercy,” he said at the time.      Jabbari’s plea of self-defence failed to persuade judges at various stages of the appeal process up to Iran’s Supreme Court and she remained in prison throughout.      Her last chance of reprieve lay with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he failed to intervene.      After the execution was carried out, the Tehran state prosecutor’s office issued a statement that appeared aimed at countering sympathy for Jabbari. It said: “Jabbari had repeatedly confessed to premeditated murder, then tried to divert the case from its course by inventing the rape charge.      “But all her efforts to feign innocence were proven false in various phases of prosecution. Evidence was firm. She had informed a friend through text message of her intention to kill. It was ascertained that she had purchased the murder weapon, a kitchen knife, two days before committing murder.”      Amnesty said Jabbari had admitted stabbing the man once from behind, but she inisted another man killed him. The human rights group said her claim was never properly investigated.      According to the UN, more than 250 people have been executed in Iran this year.      Britain said it is “concerned and saddened” by the execution. Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood said there were “questions around due process” in the case, which he warned would not help Iran revive relations with the rest of the world.      The hanging comes at an inopportune time for President Hassan Rouhani, who was elected last year partly on promises of liberal reform. He has been treading a precarious path to rapprochement with the West after decades of mutual hostility largely rooted in Iran’s disputed nuclear programme and human rights practices.      Rouhani has come under fire from secular Iranians, his main political constituency, over a spate of acid attacks on young women deemed by their attackers to have insufficiently covered their hair in accordance with sharia law.      Many Iranians believe the attacks have been provoked by Islamist hardliners in a continuing campaign to thwart the political and social reforms pledged by the president during his electoral campaign.      However, many of Iran’s more secular voters have also voiced frustration that domestic reforms appear to have taken a back seat to foreign policy under Rouhani, in particular the tortuous negotiations with world powers to resolve the nuclear stand-off. |||||	– An international campaign to spare an Iranian woman from hanging seemed to be working over the last month, with authorities granting Reyhaneh Jabbari a temporary stay. Today, though, the message on the campaign's Facebook page reads, "rest in peace," reports the Guardian. Iran's official IRNA news agency says the 26-year-old was hanged at dawn today for the killing of an intelligence official. Jabarri, then 19, maintained that she stabbed Morteza Abdolali when he tried to sexually assault her inside an apartment. Groups including Amnesty International say that the investigation was a joke and that her confession was obtained under duress, reports the BBC. Jabbari had been an interior designer, and Abdolali hired her to redesign his office. Her supporters say that she stabbed her assailant once in the shoulder and fled and that a second man in the building was the true killer. Abdolali's family insists the killing was premeditated and refused to offer last-minute clemency, which is allowed in Iran with sometimes dramatic results.

The livestream continued to show RT for about 10 minutes, before switching back to C-SPAN.      The sudden cut to RT, an English-language network funded by the Russian government, happened at about 2:30 p.m., while Rep. Maxine Waters was speaking about SEC regulation.

A recent declassified intelligence report accused Russia of interfering in the election and said that RT “aimed at undermining viewers’ trust of U.S. democratic procedures.”      C-Span — a private company that, according to its website, is available in 100 million American homes — receives no government money but broadcasts all live congressional proceedings, providing a direct feed of the daily stuff of politics to Americans who find themselves interested in what their representatives are doing.      Howard Mortman, a network spokesman, said he could not provide numbers for C-Span’s online viewership at the time of the interruption.      C-Span’s newsroom monitors many other channels for breaking news, including domestic networks like CBS and CNN as well as various international networks. Its statement suggested that a routing error had caused the RT feed it regularly monitors to be broadcast accidentally.

Trump several times before she ended her turn on the floor.      In a phone interview Thursday, she was perplexed. She said no one had satisfactorily explained “how this happened or why it happened, or if it’s happened before.”      “I just think it’s strange,” Ms. Waters said. “At a time when our intelligence agencies are very confident and basically have confirmed that Russia hacked the D.N.C. and other political interests, and then we have, while I’m on the floor of the House, talking about Trump and Russia, I get interfered with and interrupted by Russia Today.”      “It’s strange.

The bizarre switcheroo happened around 2:30pm when Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters was speaking about the SEC and had mentioned Donald Trump and Russia repeatedly, Politico reports. In video of the switch, Waters is abruptly replaced by a live RT feed for about 10 minutes. C-SPAN says that since RT is one of the networks that it monitors, they believe this was nothing more sinister than "an internal routing issue." In a statement, C-SPAN said it does not believe it was hacked, but that it takes "network security very seriously and will continue with a deeper investigation, which may take some time."

(Associated Press)      Original documents from one of the biggest intelligence leaks in history — a who's who of Soviet spying — were released Monday after being held in secret for two decades.      The files smuggled out of Russia in 1992 by senior KGB official Vasili Mitrokhin describe sabotage plots, booby-trapped weapons caches and armies of agents under cover in the West — the real-life inspiration for the fictional Soviet moles in "The Americans" TV series.      In reality, top-quality spies could be hard to get. The papers reveal that some were given Communist honors and pensions by a grateful USSR, but others proved loose-lipped, drunk or unreliable.      Intelligence historian Christopher Andrew said the vast dossier, released by the Churchill Archives Centre at Cambridge University, was considered "the most important single intelligence source ever" by British and American authorities.      Mitrokhin was a senior archivist at the KGB's foreign intelligence headquarters — and a secret dissident. For more than a decade he secretly took files home, copied them in longhand and then typed and collated them into volumes. He hid the papers at his country cottage, or dacha, some stuffed into a milk churn and buried.      After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Mitrokhin traveled to a Baltic state — which one has never been confirmed — and took a sample of his files to the U.S. Embassy, only to be turned away. So he tried the British embassy, where a junior diplomat sat him down and asked, "Would you like a cup of tea?"      "That was the sentence that changed his life," said Andrew.      Smuggled out of Russia, Mitrokhin spent the rest of his life in Britain under a false name and police protection, dying in 2004 at 81.      The world did not learn of Mitrokhin until Andrew published a book based on his files in 1999. It caused a sensation by exposing the identities of KGB agents including 87-year-old Melita Norwood, the "great-granny spy," who had passed British atomic secrets to the Soviets for years.      Mitrokhin's files describe Norwood as a "loyal, trustworthy, disciplined agent" who was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour for her service.      She was more reliable than the famous "Cambridge Spies," the high-ranking British intelligence officials who worked secretly for the Soviets. The files describe Guy Burgess as "constantly under the influence of alcohol," while Donald Maclean was "not very good at keeping secrets."      The newly released papers include a list of KGB agents in America over several decades. It runs to 40 pages and about 1,000 names.      One of the most notorious was code-named "Dan." He was Robert Lipka, a National Security Agency employee who was paid $27,000 for handing secrets to Russia in the 1960s. After Mitrokhin's information was passed by Britain to U.S. intelligence services, Lipka was arrested and sentenced to 18 years in prison.      The volumes also reveal that Soviet agents stashed weapons and communications equipment in secret locations around NATO countries. Included is a map of Rome showing three caches, along with detailed instructions for finding them. It's unclear how many such weapons dumps have been tracked down by Western authorities.      While some agents targeted the West, many more were deployed inside the Soviet bloc. The files list undercover agents sent to then-Czechoslovakia to infiltrate the dissidents behind the 1968 Prague Spring pro-democracy uprising. Others targeted the entourage of Polish cleric Karol Wojtyla, who would later become Pope John Paul II. The KGB noted with disapproval the future pontiff's "extremely anticommunist views."      The Churchill Archive is giving researchers access to 19 boxes containing thousands of Russian-language files, typed by Mitrokhin from his original handwritten notes. The notes themselves remain classified.      There are glimpses of Mitrokhin's mindset in the titles he gave the volumes, including "The Accursed Regime" and "The Mousetrap."      Andrew said Mitrokhin took huge risks, knowing that "a single bullet in the back of the head" would be his fate if he was caught.      "The material mattered to him so desperately that he was prepared to put his life on the line for it," Andrew said.      ____      Follow Jill Lawless at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless ||||| They were two of Britain’s most notorious double agents, responsible for passing on some of this country’s most sensitive secrets to the Russians, but documents reveal that Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean were viewed in an unflattering light by their Soviet masters.      Among thousands of typed Russian documents in the Mitrokhin archive, open to public inspection for the first time this week, they describe how Burgess, who was “constantly drunk”, horrified his KGB controllers by staggering out of a pub one evening and dropping stolen Foreign Office documents on the pavement. Moscow was also kept informed about Donald Maclean’s alcoholic binges and loose tongue.      It emerges that the spy they valued most was the remarkable Melita Norwood, nicknamed “The Spy Who Came in From the Co-op”, who died in 2005 aged 93. She was never prosecuted and would never have been exposed but for the archive of Vasili Mitrokhin, a senior officer in the Soviet political police who brought the documents to Britain after he defected.

From 1937 to 1971, she passed to the Soviet Union information she picked up as the personal assistant to the head of the British Association for Non-Ferrous Metals Research, which was working on nuclear technology. For 11 years, the Soviets paid her £20 a month. They offered to reward her when she visited the USSR in 1979, but she declined.      Former Soviet spy Melita Norwood was exposed in 1999 (PA)      Another exceptionally valuable spy kept so well out of sight that his or her name is still unknown.      Russia possesses an amazing collection believed to contain every Foreign Office cable sent to or from any major British embassy between 1924 and 1936. The Mitrokhin archive reveals they were passed to Soviet intelligence by an unnamed cipher clerk working in the Rome embassy.      Video: Bush and Gorbachev final discussions      There is also a wealth of documents denouncing Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, as a dangerous anti-communist. Other documents reveal the immense number of agents the KGB put into the field to destabilise the Czechoslovak communist leadership in 1968 during the Prague Spring, when for the first time people living under communism enjoyed the right of free speech.      Other documents – which can be inspected at the Archive Centre at Churchill College, Cambridge – show evidence that Dick Clements, who worked for Labour leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, was in the pay of the Soviet secret service.      Dick Clements was editor of Tribune from 1961 until 1982, when Michael Foot invited him to move to Labour Party headquarters to run the leader’s private office. He was retained as executive officer when Neil Kinnock succeeded Foot, until 1987. The document says that “Dan” was Tribune’s “editor” (redaktor in Russian).      Clements admitted meeting Soviet officials but denied they had influenced Tribune’s editorial line. He laughed off the idea that he might have been “Agent Dan”.      But the most remarkable story relating to the documents is Vasili Mitrokhin’s own.      The former KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin as he looked the day he defected to the West      In 1972, the KGB decided to rehouse its vast archive and Mitrokhin was, for 12 years, the officer responsible for transferring the documents from the Lubyanka to their new location. As he catalogued them, he meticulously copied them out by hand into little green-lined school exercise books.      He retired in 1984, aged 62, wanting this vast treasure trove preserved, but not knowing how he could smuggle it out of the USSR. When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991 the Baltic states broke free of Russian control, but the usual tight border controls were not yet in place.      Mitrokhin travelled to one of the Baltic capitals – probably Riga – carrying a bag that contained documents hidden under dirty underwear. He deliberately looked shabby to avoid attracting the curiosity of border guards. Having failed to get anyone to listen to him at the US embassy, he visited the British embassy where member of staff offered him a cup of tea and took the documents to be examined by experts. British intelligence quickly discovered they had landed what the FBI later described as “the most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from any source”.      The documents belong to Mitrokhin’s family, who live in the UK, though no one but a select few know where or under what name. ||||| When the scruffy-looking KGB officer walked into the British embassy in Riga, the Latvian capital, one of his first demands – after being offered a cup of tea – was that his unique cache of files on Moscow's foreign intelligence operations he smuggled out of the Soviet Union must be published.      Twenty years later, Vasili Mitrokhin's wish is beginning to come true. the first batch of 2,000 closely typed pages of notes he made from the KGB archives is being opened to the public.      The documents, including more than a hundred pages devoted to KGB claims about its "agents, controllers and cultivations" in Britain during the cold war, have been made available, after vetting by Whitehall weeders, at the Churchill Archives Centre at Cambridge University.      They say that Melita Norwood, communist party member and secretary of a British research association working on nuclear reactor technology, was recruited in 1935 by a former correspondent for the Soviet news agency, TASS, named Rothstein.      Codenamed Hola, Norwood "passed on a lot of valuable materials for nuclear energy which he accessed by removing them from her boss's safe, photographing them and then placing them back", according to her KGB file. She was awarded the order of the Red Banner and, "for many years of excellent work", a lifetime pension of £20 a month.      An editor of the left-wing weekly, Tribune, codenamed Dan, is claimed during the 1960s, to have published articles "based on KGB propaganda" and was paid £200 as a reward. The files describe how Guy Burgess, of the notorious Cambridge Spy Ring, was "constantly under the influence of alcohol", yet managed to provide the KGB with 389 documents in the first half of 1945, and a further 168 in 1949. Donald Maclean, another member of the Cambridge ring, is also described as being "constantly drunk" and "not very good at keeping secrets", telling his lover and brother about his "work".      In 1992 Vasili Mitrokhin travelled to Riga with a sample of his documents. He went to the UK embassy after being put off by a long queue at the US embassy. Photograph: Family handout/PA      An appendix in the archives copied by Mitrokhin suggest that the KGB claimed it had contacts with 200 people in Britain.      Mitrokhin's files record in meticulous detail how the KGB in the 1970s spied on the sermons and meetings of the Polish cardinal Wojtyla, later Pope John Paul II. They include maps identifying the location of KGB booby traps and hidden arms caches in western Europe.      They claim that Philip Agee, the former CIA officer who publicly named a list of US agents, had used material offered to him by the KGB, and that Yuri Andropov, head of the KGB in the 1960s and 1970s, infiltrated Ramparts, the radical US magazine which consistently opposed the Vietnam war and also published Che Guevara's diaries. Andropov played a key role in crushing the Prague spring in 1968. Mitrokhin's documents include a long list of targets, mainly editors and student leaders, which 15 "experienced intelligence agents" were ordered by Andropov to pursue in an operation the KGB named Progress.      Mitrokhin's files were translated for journalists at the Churchill Archives Centre by Svetlana Lokhova, a colleague of Christopher Andrew, the Cambridge historian who pioneered the study of intelligence agencies and later appointed MI5's official historian.      The FBI described the Mitrokhin files as "the most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from any source". However, intelligence analysts and some Soviet defectors have warned that the KGB seriously exaggerated the significance and number of its contacts and operations to impress the Soviet leadership – and increase its budget.      With the help, behind the scenes, of MI5 and MI6, Norwood was exposed in a blaze of publicity in 1999 when Mitrokhin and Andrew published a book based on the files. However, after MI5 was stung by criticism over its handling of her case, it played down her significance, saying her "value as an atom spy to the scientists who constructed the Soviet bomb must have been, at most marginal". She died in 2005.      The late Dick Clements, editor of Tribune in the 1960s described the story of Dan, first appearing in the Sunday Times, as "complete nonsense" and that the Soviet official responsible for the claim might have made it simply to fiddle his expenses.      Mitrokhin copied the files between 1972 and 1984 when he supervised the transfer of the KGB's foreign intelligence archives from the Lubyanka to its new headquarters in Moscow. He smuggled out his notes, typed them up in his dacha, and hid them under the floorboards.      In 1992, he took the overnight train to Riga dressed as what was described a street pedlar, hiding a sample of his documents under old clothes and sausages. He went first to the US embassy but was put off by the long visa queue there.      He then went to the UK embassy where he was put in touch with a young member of the staff who asked him: "Would you like a cup of tea?", before getting in touch with MI6 who later exfiltrated him and his family. Mitrokhin died in Britain in 2004. Asked about what kind of man he was, Andrew described experiencing the former KGB's officer's feeling of relief – that of a someone who, in the Soviet Union, had not been able to confide in anybody but himself for as many as 30 years. |||||	– In 1992, senior KGB official Vasili Mitrokhin defected from Russia, and he didn't leave empty-handed. With him came documents that the AP calls "one of the biggest intelligence leaks in history—a who's who of Soviet spying." Two decades later, the first batch of them has been released, upon Mitrokhin's explicit wishes. Mitrokhin was a senior archivist at the KGB's foreign intelligence headquarters, and, between 1972 and 1984, smuggled files to his home, where he copied them by hand, then typed them up and hid them—some were squirreled away in a milk churn, others under floorboards. As the story goes, following the Soviet Union's 1991 fall he first tried to hand the files over at a US embassy: In the AP's telling, it was in an unnamed Baltic state and he was denied; the Guardian reports it was in Riga, and Mitrokhin gave up after seeing the long visa line. The Brits in Riga, however, offered him tea, and he ended up handing over his 2,000 pages—along with the demand they be published, reports the Guardian. The first wave of documents is now out, and includes: a 40-page, 1,000-name-strong list of KGB agents in America details on the "Cambridge Spies," upper-level British intelligence officials who worked for the Soviets—but who were described as "constantly under the influence of alcohol" (though Guy Burgess handed the KGB at least 550 documents) and "not very good at keeping secrets" (Donald Maclean told his lover about his work ... and was drunk all the time, too) the revelation that the Soviets hid weapons and booby traps outside its borders, including three spots in Rome the names of undercover agents who targeted the future Pope John Paul II the identity of the spy they "valued most," per the Independent: Melita Norwood, who as a personal assistant to the head of the British Association for Non-Ferrous Metals Research had access to British atomic secrets that she passed on Mitrokhin didn't live to see his files go public: He died in Britain, where he lived under a fake name, a decade ago at 81, though he did publish a book based on the files in 1999, in tandem with MI5's official historian.

The film, for which Mr. Robertson won the Academy Award for best actor, was released in 1968.      “Flowers for Algernon” went on to sell more than five million copies and to become a staple of English classes. It inspired television adaptations, one of which also starred Mr. Robertson, and stage productions, including a musical and a play in Korean.      The story was written as a series of first-person progress reports by Charlie Gordon, a 32-year-old bakery worker with an intellectual disability who is chosen for an experimental operation to increase his intelligence. A white mouse named Algernon had undergone the procedure and had become intelligent enough to solve mazes much faster than Charlie.      Photo      Charlie’s early “progris riports” are ungrammatical and filled with childish spelling. But they are hopeful.      “If the operashun werks good Ill show that mouse I can be as smart as he is even smarter,” Charlie writes. “Then Ill be abel to reed better and spell the werds good and know lots of things and be like other pepul.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The operation makes Charlie a genius but alienates him from others and embitters him. Algernon’s intelligence fades, then he dies, and Charlie realizes that he faces a similar fate. He undergoes a period of fraught self-discovery before his intelligence ebbs, leaving him unable to comprehend the books he relished. The novel ends with Charlie in a home for the mentally disabled, unaware of his former intellectual flights.      Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Eliot Fremont-Smith called the book’s format “a technician’s maze, a collection of nasty little challenges for a writer of fiction.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And affecting, too — how otherwise explain the tears that come to one’s eyes at the novel’s end?”      Daniel Keyes was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 9, 1927. He dreamed of becoming a writer as a child but briefly joined the premedical program at N.Y.U.      Mr. Keyes left N.Y.U. and served in the United States Maritime Service. He earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Brooklyn College in 1950.      Photo      He married Aurea Georgina Vazquez in 1952. She died in 2013. In addition to his daughter Leslie, he is survived by another daughter, Hillary Keyes; and a sister, Gail Marcus.      After graduating Mr. Keyes became an editor for pulp fiction magazines before teaching English in New York City public schools. He studied for his master’s in English literature from Brooklyn College at night and wrote on weekends.      He told the Japanese newspaper The Daily Yomiuri in 1999 that the character of Charlie occurred to him while he was teaching a special needs class; a student approached him at the end of the period and asked to be transferred out of the “dummy’s class” because he wanted to be smart.      In 1961 Mr. Keyes completed his master’s, then moved to Detroit to teach creative writing at Wayne State University. He became an English and creative writing professor at Ohio University in 1966. Mr. Keyes wrote four more novels, three of which centered on characters with psychological issues. He also wrote three books of nonfiction, including “The Minds of Billy Milligan” (1981), about a criminal with 24 distinct personalities.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In 1999, 40 years after Mr. Keyes wrote “Flowers for Algernon,” he completed his memoir. He was celebrating with breakfast at a restaurant when he stumbled on an article on the front page of The New York Times that made him drop his fork. The headline read, “Smarter Mouse Is Created in Hope of Helping People.”      Mr. Keyes wrote in an afterword that he contacted Joe Z. Tsien, the neurobiologist who conducted the study, to ask how long it might take before such technology could be applied to human beings.      “After a long pause, Dr. Tsien said, ‘I expect it to happen in the next 30 years,’ ” he wrote. |||||	– Daniel Keyes, the scribe best known for Flowers for Algernon, the tender story of a mentally retarded man who yearns to be smarter, has died at age 86 of complications from pneumonia. The idea for Algernon hit him as he awaited a train in Brooklyn in 1945, reports the New York Times. "I thought: 'My education is driving a wedge between me and the people I love,'" wrote Keyes in his memoirs. "And then I wondered: What would happen if it were possible to increase a person's intelligence?" Some 15 years later he wrote the story as a novella; he eventually expanded it into a novel, and it became the basis for the 1968 movie Charly. The book sold more than 5 million copies and has never gone out of print. "If the operashun werks good Ill show that mouse I can be as smart as he is even smarter," muses Keyes' main character, Charlie, a cleaner who achieves genius level after an operation that first made a mouse smarter. “Then Ill be abel to reed better and spell the werds good and know lots of things and be like other pepul." Some reactions to Keyes' death: "We were, of course, greatly saddened by the news but there's a comfort in Daniel Keyes having had a long life and that he left us with a great legacy; a wonderful, heartbreaking book," said a rep for Keyes' UK publisher. "In its pitilessly tight focus and tragic story arc, delivered in a first-person narrative whose very nature cuts to the core of what is gained and then lost, it is for me the most heartbreaking book in the genre." And, in Charlie's voice: "PS please if you get a chanse put some flowrs on Algernons grave in the bak yard." "It's one of those books which feels destined to have been written, somehow—the idea behind it is just so perfect, so horribly disturbing," muses Alison Flood in the Guardian. It is "heartbreaking, and utterly, completely brilliant." And from his US publisher, per NPR: "Flowers for Algernon was [a] key example of science fiction that tackled problems of depth and emotional consequence; Keyes made a giant contribution to the discussion of science fiction as a serious art form."
summarize: Ford is recalling another 2,900 Ranger pickup trucks including 190 in Canada because they have been linked to two deaths due to defective Takata airbag inflators.      The automaker urged in a release on Thursday for owners to stop driving the trucks immediately after becoming aware last month of a crash in West Virginia, that happened in July, involving a 2006 Ford Ranger. The driver in that accident was killed. It was the second such fatality linked the same model and year, following another accident in January 2016.      Both Rangers were equipped with Takata airbag inflators built on the same day. At least 21 deaths worldwide have been linked to the Takata inflators, which can rupture and send deadly metal fragments into the driver's body.      "Ford is saddened by these tragic losses and offers its sincere condolences to the drivers' families," the company said.      Ford had previously recalled some 391,000 Rangers from various model-years, but the vehicles in the new recall are all 2006 models built at the Twin Cities Assembly Plant in Minnesota from Aug. 10, 2005 to Dec. 15, 2005.      The recall involves approximately 2,902 vehicles located in North America, with 2,712 located in the United States and 190 in Canada.      The company has set up a website where drivers can check their vehicle identification numbers to see if their truck is included in the recall. If it is, their instructions are quite clear: Stop driving it, now.      "We take this matter very seriously and are advising owners of these specific 2006 Ford Rangers to stop driving their vehicles so dealers can make repairs immediately," Ford said. "Dealers are prepared to get vehicles directly from customers, make permanent repairs that will resolve the safety risk and provide a free interim loaner vehicle, if necessary."      Takata said last summer that it has recalled, or expected to recall, airbags in about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, and 19 different automakers worldwide are impacted.      The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June, but the company still faces multiple lawsuits. ||||| Who leaves ratings and reviews?
