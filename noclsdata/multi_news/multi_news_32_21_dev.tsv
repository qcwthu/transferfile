When D'Marié O'Connor heard “Boo’d Up” by Ella Mai blaring on North Avenue Beach on Memorial Day, he backflipped off a concrete breakwater into icy Lake Michigan.      At first, he was fine. He bobbed about as his friends recorded themselves on Snapchat.      But after a few minutes, O’Connor was ready to get out. He was tired from the shift he had worked earlier that morning as a certified nursing assistant and from drinking with his friends before coming to the beach.      So he swam back to the breakwater he had leaped from. His hands hit the slick wall that towered about 7 feet over him. That’s when he realized there was nothing to grab on to.      “My hands start slipping,” O’Connor, 24, said. “I started panicking.”      The water was 58 degrees off of the Chicago shore Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service and the Chicago Fire Department last week had warned swimmers about even going in the water when it’s that cold. But O’Connor couldn’t feel it.      Another thing O’Connor didn’t realize was that the people he had seen jumping in before him had climbed out of the water on ladders farther down the wall.      “I was watching them jump in, but I wasn't watching them get out,” he said.      O’Connor, who has been swimming since he was 4 years old, became frantic.      “I start trying to literally jump out of the water like a dolphin,” he said, “and I'm not reaching the wall.”      O’Connor screamed for help. But his friends didn’t hear him.      “I start sinking. I go completely under the water, and I'm like, ‘I'm going to die, and my friends are right here on Snapchat and they're going to turn around and I'm going to be gone.’”      Waves began to crash over O’Connor. His muscles grew tired. And his head began to go under.      “I was under the water. The sun was shining. It was scary,” O’Connor said. “I was going to die. I accepted that fact.”      He thought of his younger siblings who he helps support and his mom, and he knew this wasn’t how he wanted to go. So he stuck his head out of the water and yelled one last time.      “That took everything I had,” he said. “I was reaching my hand out aimlessly. I didn't even know if anybody was going to grab for it. Then I felt his hand. That was the most relief I've ever felt.”      The hand belonged to Max Canfield, who heard O’Connor’s shouts and helped hoist him up.      O’Connor lay on the breakwater and caught his breath as he recovered from nearly drowning. To him, Canfield was “like an angel.”      O’Connor was still in a daze, but he thanked Canfield. They took a photo together, and then they went their separate ways.      It wasn’t until the next morning, when O’Connor saw the photo again, that he thought to look for the man who had saved him. All O’Connor had was the picture and his rescuer’s first name. So he took what he had and posted it to Twitter on Tuesday.      “Hey Twitter,” O’Connor wrote. “This is Max.”      He explained he didn’t know what Canfield’s Twitter handle was, but asked if people could share the tweet until he found it so O’Connor could buy him a drink.      “I honestly didn't know if people would retweet it,” O’Connor said. “I thought it was a really slim chance.”      By the time he went to bed Tuesday night, the tweet had been liked 500 times. When he woke up, it had rocketed to 5,000.      A hashtag, “#FindMax” had been started. By Thursday, the tweet had over 7,500 retweets and over 11,500 likes and was still gaining more.      A friend of Canfield’s had tweeted out his Twitter handle, so O’Connor sent him a message Thursday morning.      Canfield told O’Connor he had been at the gym when he looked at his phone and saw the flurry of notifications.      “It was pretty cool that he responded,” O’Connor said.      Canfield wasn’t immediately available for an interview.      The two plan to get brunch in the next few weeks. It’s O’Connor’s way of saying thank you.      O’Connor said he learned his lesson from the ordeal. His mom scolded him when she found out, and he’ll be sticking to walking on the beach or swimming in water where he can at least see the bottom, he said.      And when he finally meets Canfield again, there’s one more thing he plans to do: take another picture. ||||| A man used Twitter to track down the stranger who saved him from drowning at North Avenue Beach on Memorial Day when he was overwhelmed by the frigid waters of Lake Michigan. Katie Kim reports. (Published Friday, June 1, 2018)      Man Finds Rescuer on Twitter After Nearly Drowning at North Avenue Beach      A man used Twitter to track down the stranger who saved him from drowning at North Avenue Beach on Memorial Day when he was overwhelmed by the frigid waters of Lake Michigan.      Until Thursday morning, D'Marié O'Connor only knew his rescuer's first name and had a photo they snapped together before parting ways. He decided to share the photo on Twitter in an attempt to track down the beachgoer who saved him for a more thorough thank you.      “I didn’t plan on looking for him,” D'Marié O'Connor tweeted Thursday. “Until I sobered up and realized I might have not been here without him.”      The 24-year-old was enjoying the warm weather Monday with his friends at the lake after working a shift as a certified nurse’s assistant. He was drinking with his buddies, like so many other Chicagoans during the long weekend. He heard his favorite song “Boo’d Up” by Ella Mai and got a little too excited, he said.      “I was feeling it too hard,” before he flipped off a concrete breakwater into the lake, he said.      He knows how to swim, he explained, and is even CPR certified. But he hadn’t been paying attention to where other people were getting out of the water—a ladder a ways down from where he jumped. The water was 58 degrees and O’Conner quickly realized he was in trouble.      “I started panicking,” he said.      The barrier wall he needed to scale was nearly 10 feet high from the water’s surface and he only slipped back into the lake with each attempt to get out. He could hear his friends laughing as they Snapchatted themselves by the water’s edge, oblivious to the danger he was in.      “I’m literally sinking and I can hear my friends just casually on the snap recording my death,” he said.      O’Connor mustered one last effort to scream for help before he went under again.      Enter Max.      “He leans over the edge and then grabs my hand so I can grab the edge,” O’Connor recalled. “He proceeds to shout to my friends that I’m drowning.”      The first-name-only hero pulled the breathless O’Connor from the water.      After catching his breath and regaining his composure, O’Connor asked his rescuer for a name and took a photo with him before the two parted ways.      But the next Day O’Connor decided he needed to reconnect with Max and tweeted the photo with a plea for help to find him.      “Retweet until I find Max’s twitter so I can buy him a drink,” O’Connor wrote on the social media site.      “I honestly didn't know if people would retweet it,” he told the Chicago Tribune. “I thought it was a really slim chance.”      A hashtag began circulating, #FindMax, and the tweet was shared thousands of times by Thursday morning.      A friend of Max Canfield's saw the photo and connected the two on Twitter.      Efforts to reach Canfield for comment were unsuccessful Thursday—but O’Connor says the two are planning to get brunch together soon.      The response on Twitter to O’Connor’s story seems overwhelmingly positive.      “Glad you’re ok. Max is dope for that,” one user tweeted.      “Wow...to see something positive on twitter! Amazing ...good on you guys!” another said.      O’Connor was pleased to share his story and heaped praise on Canfield for saving him.      “I feel like it’s a positive story,” he said. |||||	– "Hey Twitter This is Max, Max saved me from drowning yesterday." And so began D'Marie O'Connor's online quest Tuesday to find "Max," the man he said rescued him from 58-degree waters at Chicago's North Avenue Beach on Memorial Day. O'Connor tells the Chicago Tribune that he was hanging out with friends at the beach Monday when a song came on the radio that inspired him to do a backflip into Lake Michigan off a breakwater. O'Connor notes to NBC Chicago he knows how to swim and holds CPR certification, but he was tired after working, had been drinking, and failed to notice that others who were jumping into the water were doing so further down the breakwater, where there were ladders to climb out. He encountered a 7-foot-high "slick wall" with no grips. "My hands start slipping," the 24-year-old tells the Tribune. "I was under the water. … I was going to die. I accepted that fact." His Snapchatting friends didn't notice he was struggling, but the mysterious Max did, reaching his hand down and yanking O'Connor out of the water. The two took a pic together, and the next day, O'Connor decided he had to find him. He tweeted the photo out and the #FindMax hashtag began. By Thursday morning, success: "WE FOUND MAX!" he posted. A friend sent O'Connor the Twitter handle for a Max Canfield, and O'Connor reached out to him privately. The two plan to meet up for brunch soon, O'Connor's treat. One question some posed to O'Connor on Twitter, though: If he had a picture taken with Canfield on the beach, why didn't he just get his full name and contact info then? "I didn't plan on looking for him. Until i sobered up and realized I might have not been here without him," O'Connor noted. (A Pennsylvania man who couldn't swim jumped into a pool to save a drowning boy.)
summarize: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Putin announced the move at the Russian Hmeimim airbase in Syria      Russia has begun withdrawing some of its troops from Syria, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Monday.      President Vladimir Putin ordered the partial withdrawal during an unannounced visit to Syria on Monday.      Russian support has been crucial in turning the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of government forces, led by president Bashar al-Assad.      Mr Putin made a similar withdrawal announcement last year, but Russian military operations continued.      When asked how long it would take for Russia to withdraw its military contingent, Mr Shoigu said that this would "depend on the situation" in Syria.      The Russian president was met by Mr al-Assad at the Russian Hmeimim airbase near Latakia.      Mr Putin said: "I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff to start withdrawing the Russian group of troops to their permanent bases," according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.      "I have taken a decision: a significant part of the Russian troop contingent located in Syria is returning home to Russia," he added.      Syria campaign boosts Russian influence      By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent      Less than a week after announcing he will stand for re-election, Vladimir Putin flies to Syria and declares victory. Coincidence? Probably not.      Signalling the end of Russia's military operation in Syria will go down well with Russian voters.      Electoral concerns apart, Moscow views its two-year campaign in Syria as a success - and not only in terms of fighting international terrorism.      The Russians have succeeded in keeping a key ally, President Assad, in power. In the process, Russia has been guaranteed a long-term military presence in Syria, with its two bases Hmeimim and Tartus. Moscow has also raised its profile across the Middle East.      Then there's the global stage. The operation in Syria prevented Moscow's international isolation.      Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 had sparked Western sanctions and earned the country, in the eyes of some Western governments, the label "pariah state". The Syria operation forced Western leaders to sit down and negotiate with Russia's leadership.      Mr Putin said that if "terrorists raise their heads again", Russia would "carry out such strikes on them which they have never seen".      "We will never forget the victims and losses suffered in the fight against terror both here in Syria and also in Russia," he said.      He told President Assad that Russia wanted to work with Iran, the government's other key ally, and Turkey, which backs the opposition, to help bring peace to Syria.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September 2015      Last week, Mr Putin announced the "total rout" of jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) along the Euphrates river valley in eastern Syria.      Russia launched an air campaign in Syria in September 2015 with the aim of "stabilising" Mr Assad's government after a series of defeats.      Officials in Moscow stressed that it would target only "terrorists", but activists said its strikes mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians.      The campaign has allowed pro-government forces to break the deadlock on several key battlefronts, most notably in Aleppo.      The Syrian and Russian air forces carried out daily air strikes on the rebel-held east of the city before it fell in December 2016, killing hundreds of people and destroying hospitals, schools and markets, according to UN human rights investigators.      Moscow has consistently denied that its air strikes have caused any civilian deaths.      However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that Russian air strikes had killed 6,328 civilians, including 1,537 children.      The UK-based monitoring group has documented the deaths of 346,612 people in total since the start of the uprising against Mr Assad in 2011. ||||| Russian President Vladimir Putin exhibited his growing diplomatic clout with a lightning tour through the Middle East on Monday, surprising Russian troops with his first visit to a Russian air base in Syria before skipping across the region to discuss bilateral ties in Cairo and Ankara.      Along the way, he announced a withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria, presided over the signing of a $21 billion plan to build a nuclear power plant in Egypt, and called President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel "counterproductive" and "destabilizing," a criticism he leveled without mentioning Trump by name.      The decision could "provoke conflict," he said during a news conference following a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi.      Putin, who declared last week that he would run for a fourth term as president, has largely staked his legacy on Russia's revival as the dominant military power in its region and a counterweight to the West in the Middle East. His tour to shore up bilateral ties comes at a time when U.S. policy in the Middle East is in flux, amid Trump's decision on Jerusalem and apparent support for the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, as well as growing questions about the future role and mission of the U.S. military in Syria.      The trip began with a surprise visit to Russia's Khmeimim air base in Syria, where Putin announced an imminent drawdown of Russian forces in the wake of his declaration of victory in Moscow's intervention in the Syrian war. Russian warplanes secretly flew to Syria in late 2015. It was Putin's first known visit to Syria.      At the air base, Putin ordered his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, to begin the "withdrawal of Russian troop contingents" to their permanent bases.      But he left open the door to a continued Russian presence in Syria, saying that Russia's air base at Khmeimim and naval base at Tartus would keep operating. He promised further strikes "if terrorists raise their head again" — an apparent reference to forces in Syria's long civil war that sought to topple the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.      "We will deliver such strikes on them that they have not seen yet," he told military personnel at the air base in remarks carried by Russian news services.      Russia's military intervention in Syria bolstered Assad's government and gave Syrian forces a critical edge against rebel factions backed by the West and its Middle Eastern allies. Iran, another key supporter of Assad, provided military advisers and other aid.      [A Putin-Assad embrace launches Russia’s new peace bid for Syria]      U.S. defense officials cast doubt Monday on Putin's announcement of a troop withdrawal. Similar pronouncements in the past — including one in March 2016 and another in January — "don't often correspond with actual troop reductions," said Col. Rob Manning, a Defense Department spokesman.      The speech to the troops also had the whiff of a reelection campaign at times.      "You are victorious, and you are going home to your families, parents, wives, children and friends," Putin told pilots at the air base. "The fatherland is waiting for you, my friends. Have a safe trip home. I am grateful for your service."      The deployment of troops to Syria marked Moscow's first major overseas military campaign since the invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 under the Soviet Union. In July, Russia extended its lease of the Khmeimim air base for 49 years, giving Moscow a military foothold in the region for generations.      Putin met at the air base with Assad, whose regime appeared close to defeat in the summer of 2015 before the Russian intervention. At the time, it appeared that Assad would be forced to step down.      "I have come, as I promised," Putin told him. While hailing the fall of the Islamic State, Putin also noted the rebuke to Western plans in the region. "Syria has been preserved as a sovereign independent state," he said.      Putin has been eager to declare the intervention a victory, and his March 2016 drawdown announcement came as Syrian troops backed by Russian air power and special forces made a final push to recapture the ancient Roman city of Palmyra.      Western leaders were skeptical that Russia would pull back its troops, and Russian forces later played a key role in the race by pro-government forces to retake territory ahead of the Islamic State's eventual collapse.      The intervention has showcased much of Russia's military might: new warplanes, helicopters and warships, as well as cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea. It has come at the cost of more than 40 Russian soldiers killed, according to official statistics. The deaths of a similar number of military contractors have been reported by Russian journalists.      In Cairo, Putin met with Sissi and discussed the conflicts in Syria and Libya, a possible resumption of direct air travel after a 2015 terrorist attack aboard a Russian charter jet, and Trump's decision on Jerusalem. The contract signed during a meeting between Putin and the Egyptian president calls for the construction and a supply of nuclear fuel for Egypt's Dabaa power plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2026. Russia has also signed agreements to build nuclear plants in Turkey and Jordan. Russia finished construction on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power station — a project begun by a German firm under the shah — and opened it in 2011.      Putin arrived in Ankara, Turkey, on Monday evening for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The leaders discussed developments in Syria and elsewhere in the region as well as relations between their countries, Turkish officials said.

He was joined by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during his visit to the Khmeimim air base, which was Putin's first known trip to the country, reports the Washington Post. He said he had ordered the withdrawal of "troop contingents" to their home bases in Russia, though he added that the air base and Russia's naval base in Syria would remain. He also said there would be more strikes "if terrorists raise their head again." "You are victorious, and you are going home to your families, parents, wives, children, and friends," Putin told Russian pilots. "The fatherland is waiting for you, my friends. Have a safe trip home. I am grateful for your service." Later in the day, the Russian leader visited Cairo and Ankara for talks. Russia's 2015 intervention in the Syrian civil war probably preserved Assad's regime, and the BBC's Steve Rosenberg notes that it's probably no coincidence that Assad declared victory and ordered troop withdrawals just a week after announcing that he will stand for re-election.

(AFP/Getty Images) ||||| FILE - In this 1998 file photo, Ayman al-Zawahri, left, poses for a photograph with Osama bin Laden, right, taken in Khost, Afghanistan and made available Friday March 19, 2004. A person familiar with... (Associated Press)      The most intense manhunt in history finally caught up with Osama bin Laden, but his life's story will be told many different ways by different people. Reviled in the West as the personification of evil, bin Laden was admired and even revered by some fellow Muslims who embraced his vision of unending jihad against the United States and Arab governments he deemed as infidels.      Bin Laden's money and preaching inspired the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that killed just under 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, and forever ripped a hole in America's feeling of security in the world.      His actions set off a chain of events that led the United States into wars in Afghanistan, and then Iraq, and a clandestine war against extreme Islamic adherents that touched scores of countries on every continent but Antarctica. America's entire intelligence apparatus was overhauled to counter the threat of more terror attacks at home.      Bin Laden was killed in an operation led by the United States, President Barack Obama said Sunday. A small team of Americans carried out the attack and took custody of bin Laden's remains, Obama said.      Bin Laden's al-Qaida organization has also been blamed for the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 231 people and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 American sailors in Yemen, as well as countless other plots, some successful and some foiled      Perhaps as significant was his ability _ even from hiding _ to inspire a new generation of terrorists to murder in his name. Most of al-Qaida's top lieutenants have been killed or captured in the years since Sept. 11, 2001, and intelligence officials in Europe and Asia say they now see a greater threat from homegrown radical groups energized by bin Laden's cause.      Al-Qaida is not thought to have provided logistical or financial support to the group of North African Muslims who pulled off the March 11, 2004, bombings in Madrid, Spain _ which killed 191 people _ but they were certainly inspired by its dream of worldwide jihad. Likewise, no link has been established between al-Qaida and the four British Muslim suicide bombers who killed 52 people in London on July 7, 2005, but few believe the attack would have taken place had bin Laden not aroused the passions of young Muslim radicals the world over.      The war in Iraq _ justified in part by erroneous intelligence that suggested Saddam Hussein had both weapons of mass destruction and a link to al-Qaida _ has become the cauldron in which the world's next generation of terrorists are honing their skills.      While scant evidence has emerged of a link between Saddam and bin Laden's inner circle, there is no doubt that al-Qaida took advantage of the chaos of post-Saddam Iraq _ helping to drag the United States into a quagmire that led to the death of some 5,000 American troops, and many scores of thousands of Iraqis.      Indeed, bin Laden's legacy is a world still very much on edge.      Frightening terms like dirty bomb, anthrax and weapons of mass destruction have become staples of the global vocabulary; and others like Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and extraordinary rendition have fueled a burning anger in the Muslim world.      But long before bin Laden became the world's most hunted man, few believed fate would move him in that direction.      Bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia in 1954. He became known as the most pious of the sons among his wealthy father's 54 children. Bin Laden's path to militant Islam began as a teenager in the 1970s when he got caught up in the fundamentalist movement then sweeping Saudi Arabia. He was a voracious reader of Islamic literature and listened to weekly sermons in the holy city of Mecca.      Thin, bearded and over 6 feet tall, bin Laden joined the Afghans' war against invading Soviet troops in the 1980s and gained a reputation as a courageous and resourceful commander. Access to his family's considerable construction fortune certainly helped raise his profile among the mujahedeen fighters.      At the time, bin Laden's interests converged with those of the United States, which backed the "holy war" against Soviet occupation with money and arms.      When bin Laden returned home to Saudi Arabia, he was showered with praise and donations and was in demand as a speaker in mosques and homes. It did not take long for his aims to diverge from those of his former Western supporters.      "When we buy American goods, we are accomplices in the murder of Palestinians," he said in one of the cassettes made of his speeches from those days.      A seminal moment in bin Laden's life came in 1990, when U.S. troops landed on Saudi soil to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.      Bin Laden tried to dissuade the government from allowing non-Muslim armies into the land where the Prophet Muhammad gave birth to Islam, but the Saudi leadership turned to the United States to protect its vast oil reserves. When bin Laden continued criticizing Riyadh's close alliance with Washington, he was stripped of Saudi citizenship.      "I saw radical changes in his personality as he changed from a calm, peaceful and gentle man interested in helping Muslims into a person who believed that he would be able to amass and command an army to liberate Kuwait. It revealed his arrogance and his haughtiness," Prince Turki, the former Saudi intelligence chief, said in an interview with Arab News and MBC television in late 2001.      "His behavior at that time left no impression that he would become what he has become," the prince added.      The prince, who said he met bin Laden several times years ago in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, described him as "a gentle, enthusiastic young man of few words who didn't raise his voice while talking."      Abdel-Bari Atwan, editor of Al-Quds al-Arabi, London-based newspaper, spent 10 days with bin Laden in an Afghan cave in 1996. He said bin Laden "touched the root of the grievances of millions in the Arab world" when he presented himself as the alternative to Arab regimes that have been incapable of liberating Arab land from Israeli occupation and restoring pride to their people.      He said bin Laden and his followers never feared death.      "Those guys spoke about death the way young men talk about going to the disco," Atwan said. "They envied those who fell in battle because they died as martyrs in God's cause."      Still, bin Laden had a knack for staying alive.      After being kicked out of Saudi Arabia, bin Laden sought refuge in Sudan. The African country acceded to a U.S. request and offered to turn bin Laden over to Saudi Arabia in 1996, but his native country declined, afraid a trial would destabilize the country.      Back on familiar terrain in Afghanistan _ allowed in by the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani _ bin Laden and his al-Qaida network prepared for the holy war that turned him into Washington's No. 1 enemy.      When the Taliban _ who would eventually give him refuge _ first took control of Kabul in September 1996, bin Laden and his Arab followers kept a low profile, uncertain of their welcome under the new regime. The Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar called bin Laden to southern Kandahar from his headquarters in Tora Bora and eventually through large and continual financial contributions to the isolated Taliban, bin Laden became dependent on the religious militia for his survival.      In Afghanistan, he would wake before dawn for prayers, then eat a simple breakfast of cheese and bread. He closely monitored world affairs. Almost daily, he and his men _ Egyptians, Yemenis, Saudis, among others _ practiced attacks, hurling explosives at targets and shooting at imaginary enemies.      He also went horseback riding, his favorite hobby, and enjoyed playing traditional healer, often prescribing honey, his favorite food, and herbs to treat colds and other illnesses. In Afghanistan, bin Laden was often accompanied by his four wives _ the maximum Islam allows. Estimates on the number of his children range up to 23.      Al-Qaida's first major strike after bin Laden returned to Afghanistan was on Aug. 7, 1998, when twin explosions rocked U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Most of the victims were African passers-by, but the bombings also killed 12 Americans.      Days later, bin Laden escaped a cruise missile strike on one of his training camps in Afghanistan launched by the United States in retaliation. Bin Laden is believed to have been at the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr camp for a meeting with several of his top men, but left shortly before some 70 Tomahawk cruise missiles slammed into the dusty complex.      Since Sept. 11, bin Laden stayed a step ahead of the dragnet _ perhaps the largest in history for a single individual.      As the Taliban quickly fell under pressure of the U.S. bombardment, bin Laden fled into the inhospitable mountains in the seam that separates Pakistan and Afghanistan, keeping up a spotty stream of chatter _ first in video tapes and then in scratchy audio recordings _ to warn his Western pursuers of more bloodshed.      Just hours after the U.S. assault on Afghanistan began on Oct. 7, 2001, bin Laden appeared in a video delivered to Al-Jazeera, an Arab satellite television station, to issue a threat to America.      "I swear by God ... neither America nor the people who live in it will dream of security before we live it in Palestine, and not before all the infidel armies leave the land of Muhammad, peace be upon him," said bin Laden, dressed in fatigues.      He reappeared in a video appearance broadcast by Al-Jazeera on Dec. 27, 2001, shortly after U.S. forces apparently had him cornered in Tora Bora, a giant cave complex in eastern Afghanistan. Hundreds of al-Qaida suspects are believed to have escaped the massive U.S. bombing campaign there, and bin Laden is believed to have been among them.      During the past decade, bin Laden and al-Zawahri have appeared regularly in audio and video tapes to issue threats, and comment on a wide range of current events, although the appearances trailed off in recent years.      In November 2002, bin Laden threatened Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Germany and Australia for their support for the United States, saying: "It is time we get even. You will be killed just as you kill, and will be bombed just as you bomb." Later, he called on Muslims to rise up against leaders in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait he saw as Washington's stooges.      In 2004, he tried a new tack, offering a "truce" to European countries that don't attack Muslims, then later saying that the United States could avoid another Sept. 11 attack if it stopped threatening the security of Muslims.      After a long silence, bin Laden stepped up his messages in 2006, and the subjects he addressed became more political. In January 2006, he addressed his comments to the American people rather than U.S. President George W. Bush because, he said, polls showed "an overwhelming majority" of Americans wanted a withdrawal from Iraq. He even recommended Americans pick up a copy of the book "The Rogue State," which he said offered a path to peace.      At several points in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks, bin Laden's capture or death had appeared imminent. After the March 2003 arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, officials in Islamabad and Washington were paraded out to deny a consistent stream of rumors that bin Laden had been captured.      U.S. forces poured into the border region looking for him and former Taliban and Taliban in hiding said bin Laden had constantly been on the move, traveling through the mountains with a small entourage of security.      Through it all, bin Laden vowed repeatedly that he was willing to die in his fight to drive the Israelis from Jerusalem and Americans from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.      "America can't get me alive," bin Laden was quoted as saying in an interview with a Pakistani journalist conducted shortly after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. "I can be eliminated, but not my mission." |||||	– Long before Osama bin Laden was America's most reviled terrorist, he was the quiet boy of a rich Saudi family, "a gentle, enthusiastic young man of few words who didn't raise his voice while talking," according to a former Saudi intelligence chief. Born in 1954, bin Laden was one of 54 children and grew up in mansions littered with crystal chandeliers, gold statues, and Italian tapestries, reports the LA Times. As a 10-year-old, he reportedly inherited $300 million after his father died in a plane crash. Bin Laden was a tireless reader of Islamic literature whose path to militant Islam began as a teen in the 1970s, when he got caught up in the fundamentalist movement then sweeping Saudi Arabia, reports the AP. He began to grow more radical in the next decade, after joining the Afghan war against the Soviets, where he was able to use his family's money to help the mujahedeen fighters. But what AP calls the "seminal moment" happened in 1990, when US troops landed in Saudi Arabia to drive Iraqi forces out of the tiny, oil-rich country of Kuwait. When bin Laden criticized Riyadh's close alliance with Washington—bin Laden had offered to pull together an army of Afghan war vets to protect Saudi Arabia, an offer that was refused by the royal family—he was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994. The intelligence chief then describes "radical changes in his personality," from a "gentle man interested in helping Muslims into a person who believed that he would be able to amass and command an army to liberate Kuwait."

summarize: But Rucka is the first DC Comics writer to officially state that Wonder Woman is a queer character. And he says she has been in love and had relationships with other women, adding, "As (artist Nicola Scott) and I approach it, the answer is obviously yes. And it needs to be yes for a number of reasons." ||||| It should come as no surprise that reliance on canon creates an orthodoxy which harms and marginalizes perfectly valid queer readings. – Emma Houxbois, Comicosity (née The Rainbow Hub) The power of stories like these, whether it’s a deep and personal tale wrought with emotion, or some fun and flirty fan art, cannot be underestimated… Seeing characters portrayed as bisexual helped me get a better grasp on my own identity. – Kieran Shiach, ComicsAlliance      There is a tension that cannot be denied between the above two references to LGBT representation — and among dozens of other nuances of expectation — when it comes to seeing queer narratives validated on the comic book page.      On the one hand, there is an audience growing in size every year that is desperate to have the same benefit afforded them as their straight, white, cis male predecessors: the ability to see themselves explicitly mirrored on the page, not just with an occasional background character, but with book and series leads. This is not a desire exclusive to the queer reader, but one felt deeply by all manner of marginalized audiences, from female to Black, Asian to Latinx, Muslim, disabled, gender nonbinary, and every intersection you can imagine.      In fact, if you’ve followed me or my work for any appreciable amount of time, you’ll know I am a strong advocate for explicit representation for LGBT (or “queer”) individuals in comics media. I’ve cheered DC’s acknowledgment on the page and through interview of the queerness of Catwoman and the legitimization of Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy’s non-exclusive polyamorous relationship. I’ve swooned month after month as Midnighter has grown into an amazingly high-profile gay character, now returning with partner Apollo by his side. And I’ve glowered over Marvel’s editorial response to queerness in lead characters Angela and Hercules through outright public denials.      But those calls and jeers do carry with them questions of authority, assumptions of a monolithic understanding of queerness, and the privilege that comes in my own cis male understanding of what counts as representation for an increasingly diverse queer population whose experiences and self-image may not echo mine. Put frankly, I have an understanding and acceptance of out politics that can’t reflect every understanding of queer sexuality (or even the very meaning of the word “queer”).      Enter: Wonder Woman.      With DC Comics’ Rebirth of the Amazon Princess’s central title taking fan praise and critical acclaim to new heights, there’s a long list of reasons for me to celebrate her rise in this, of all, years. As the character’s 75th year in print, 2016 has delivered a demonstratively queer vision of Wonder Woman’s origins and homeland — first in books like the Wonder Woman: Earth One original graphic novel and the weekly DC Comics Bombshells digital-first series, and now in the twice-monthly ongoing by writer Greg Rucka and artists Nicola Scott and Liam Sharp.      That audience call for queer acknowledgment seems to have been substantially heeded.      Yet, there can be difficulties, from a queer audience perspective, with demanding explicitness in representation, particularly in the case of Diana of Themyscira. Said best by Robert Jones, Jr., the queer cultural critic also known as Son of Baldwin, “the heterosexist gaze that denies any queerness that isn’t spelled out by an oral declaration or visible sexual intercourse” is a dangerous trap for readers, queer and not queer alike. It sets terms that denies the possibility of any understanding of queerness not juxtaposed to heterosexual patriarchy.      And, as we’ve seen early on in Rucka’s return to the Amazon Princess in Wonder Woman #2, Paradise Island simply is, as it should be, paradise — a civilization so far removed from heterosexist constructs that it has even lost the words that describe it. What is queer about the Amazons and their shining ambassador could be nothing at all by their standards, while thoroughly looking like lesbian, bisexual, or polyamorous structures from our perspectives.      In that sense, Wonder Woman may well encapsulate that existing tension for her diverse queer audience more thoroughly than any character in the comic book stable. And her current creators know it.      With this exclusive interview, riding proudly under our Queer Visibility banner, Greg Rucka chats about the vision he and his collaborators have for their Wonder Woman series, the act of balancing representation with the craft of storytelling, and the question of what it even means to be queer in a culture absent of heteronormativity.      Matt Santori: I’m going to start off simple and to the point. The Wonder Woman that you and Nicola have introduced to us in “Year One” — is she queer?            Greg Rucka: How are we defining “queer?”      You’re applying a term specifically and talking to an ostensibly cis male (and white to boot), so “queer” to me may not be the same as it is to an out gay man. So, tell me what queer is.      MSG: Fair enough. For the purposes of this conversation, I would define “queer” as involving, although not necessarily exclusively, romantic and/or sexual interest toward persons of the same gender. It’s not the full definition, but it’s the part I’m narrowing in on here.      GR: Then, yes.      I think it’s more complicated though. This is inherently the problem with Diana: we’ve had a long history of people — for a variety of reasons, including sometimes pure titillation, which I think is the worst reason — say, “Ooo. Look. It’s the Amazons. They’re gay!”      And when you start to think about giving the concept of Themyscira its due, the answer is, “How can they not all be in same sex relationships?” Right? It makes no logical sense otherwise.      It’s supposed to be paradise. You’re supposed to be able to live happily. You’re supposed to be able — in a context where one can live happily, and part of what an individual needs for that happiness is to have a partner — to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women.      But an Amazon doesn’t look at another Amazon and say, “You’re gay.” They don’t. The concept doesn’t exist.      Now, are we saying Diana has been in love and had relationships with other women? As Nicola and I approach it, the answer is obviously yes.      And it needs to be yes for a number of reasons. But perhaps foremost among them is, if no, then she leaves paradise only because of a potential romantic relationship with Steve [Trevor]. And that diminishes her character. It would hurt the character and take away her heroism.      When we talk about agency of characters in 2016, Diana deciding to leave her home forever — which is what she believes she’s doing — if she does that because she’s fallen for a guy, I believe that diminishes her heroism.      She doesn’t leave because of Steve. She leaves because she wants to see the world and somebody must go and do this thing. And she has resolved it must be her to make this sacrifice.      So, it’s a thorny question. And I understand as best as I can the desire to see representation on the page. I don’t object to that at all. But my job first and foremost is always to serve the characters as best I can.      For me, all other questions aside — and there are many legitimate reasons to ask the question — the answer first and foremost must be yes, because otherwise it takes away from Diana’s heroism.      MSG: As you’ve alluded to, there definitely is a desire from a corner of readers for definitive proclamations of sexuality that can’t be whitewashed. Tell me a little about how you think about that as a writer in terms of crafting the story in Wonder Woman.      GR: Ah. We’re talking about the “Northstar Problem.” The character has to stand up and say, “I’M GAY!” in all bold caps for it to be evident.      For my purposes, that’s bad writing. That’s a character stating something that’s not impacting the story. I get nothing for my narrative out of that in almost any case. When a character is being asked point blank, if it’s germane to the story, then you get the answer. But for me, and I think for Nicola as well, for any story we tell — be it Black Magick, be it Wonder Woman, be it a Batman story — we want to show you these characters and their lives, and what they are doing.      We want to show, not tell.      Showing requires bringing in a situation only as it relates to what we’re trying to do overall with the story. And in part one of “Year One” in particular, one of the things we really needed to do in that issue is juxtapose her life and Steve’s. We wanted to establish that there is a connection between these characters long before they see each other. That they share certain things.      Very importantly to us, we wanted to make clear a vision of Themyscira that justified calling it “paradise.” That’s something I think has been oft-lost in many examinations of Diana. I suspect the reason is that a lot of people believe paradise is boring. That there’s no drama to it. There’s no conflict. As a result, it becomes paradise in name only.      We didn’t want that. We wanted to honor what we thought was the Marston vision of the Amazons, in that they live in a utopian society. Almost all of our choices were directed to that end. Obviously, when you start off with that premise, you spend a lot of time thinking about what that means. In terms of the society, what the individual’s role constitutes in that society, what counts as fulfillment and happiness in that society.      For instance, when Io finds Diana on the plain passed out, she and the other Amazons had just come back from a foraging mission to gather supplies. Supplies are not given to them. They can make everything they need, but they have to make it. How is that an element of paradise? Action, activity, and the reward of doing good work is an element of their paradise. As opposed to the Gods going, “Boom. You need wine? Here’s a vat.”      By the same token, going back to the question of sexuality on Themyscira, we spent a long time thinking about what this means. I did a talk at Fantastic Comics in Berkeley, California, where I said that no Amazon is going to look at another Amazon and say they are Amazoning wrong. Because that wouldn’t be paradise. The society accepts everyone in it. The requirement is, you’re here and you’re female.      Now, that opens up a separate question. For the purposes of Themyscira, as the Amazons experience it, and as we represent that experience, nobody looks at Io and says, “You’re too butch.” Nobody looks at Kasia and says, “You’re too femme.” Nobody says a dress is inappropriate. Nobody says, “Why are you wearing pants?” Nobody says you’re too heavy. Nobody says you’re too skinny, or not strong enough.      It has to be an inclusive and accepting society, for a number of reasons — paradise being one of them. But also because, Nicola, Liam, and I believe very strongly that Diana is beautifully and very actively inclusive.      That’s not to say Batman or Superman are not, but for Diana, it’s a very active inclusivity. That’s just part of what she is. Her arms are always open wide. There’s room for everybody. That’s an active part of her. I mean, Batman doesn’t have an issue, but he doesn’t spend his days thinking about how best can he understand his fellow man. [laughs]      MSG: So, yes, in terms of Themyscira, maybe “queer” isn’t even a thing in that environment. But what kind of tension does that produce when Diana leaves there for the outside world?      GR: Hold on. This is important to me, too. By our standards where I am standing of 2016, Themyscira is a queer culture. I’m not hedging that. And anyone who wants to prevaricate on that is being silly.      I’ve said elsewhere that I feel like this has been asked and answered. If Grant Morrison writes an Earth One book where Diana is calling Mala her lover, I don’t think one can get more definitive than that. Now, for those of us who are comics-savvy, we go, “Well, Earth One is not the New 52 or Rebirth.” But all the Earth One books thrive on a distillation of the fundamental truths of these characters.      For the Amazons, it’s just not a word that’s active in their vocabulary. It’s the same way that Diana has to search for the word “brother” to describe Steve’s relationship with his fellow sailors, and Hippolyta says, “The word is ‘brothers.’ We just don’t use it a lot. That’s probably why you don’t remember it.”      It’s not going to happen in “Year One,” but you know like ten minutes after that story is over, Lois Lane lands the interview with the Wonder Woman and asks her where she’s from. Diana will say she’s from Themyscira, an island of all women. Now, I’m not sure Lois would ask, “Does that mean you all sleep together?” because that doesn’t seem to me germane to Lois’s character.      But when someone does open up the question, Diana is like, “Of course we love each other. Some Amazons have been together for thousands of years. Some have been together for only a short time. And sometimes they’ve had several partners at once. Sometimes they break up. But we all have to live together and make it work.”      MSG: Right. I didn’t mean to imply a dodge in any sense. It’s that you’ve very effectively created this culture where heteronormativity has been removed from the narrative.      GR: Exactly. Matt, these are the things I think about.      And I really don’t like the idea that there are people out there who might think DC is being mealy-mouthed about this. They’re not. No one wants to be taken out of context by ignorant people, but nobody at DC has ever said, “She’s gotta be straight.” Nobody. Ever. They’ve never blinked at this.      And when they’ve had questions about how we represent this, it’s always been about representing what the story needs. I think every publisher can be lit up for moments of negligence and mistakes they made, but it matters a great deal to me that DC be given their due here.      They would, I think, like any business, prefer this not be an issue to anybody. But most of us human beings would also really rather this not be an issue for anybody anymore. It is what it is. This is how the Amazons live.      I spent a lot of time thinking about this and talking to a lot of people about this. I wonder what would happen if you are a trans woman transitioning, and you go to Themyscira? Since they’re not a heteronormative culture, I wonder if the concept of transgender life or gender confirmation process is one that they’ve ever even considered. These are the things I think about. I don’t have an answer to that. Yet.      But I know this: their society has to be the best possible paradise.      MSG: Looking over the narrative in Wonder Woman, the landscape of representation, and your role in both, any other thoughts on the big picture here?            GR: Our job — myself, Nicola, and Liam — is to serve the character. To tell the best stories that we can possibly tell for her, and to the best of our abilities. That is always the eye on the prize for us. If, on the way, we manage to step on bases that expand a larger understanding of Diana’s importance culturally and that answer questions people have, great! And I know this is going to frustrate some people, but that’s not my first order of business.      It can’t be. Because otherwise, I end up writing a polemic, not a story. A polemic is bad narrative.      That said, there was a piece of me that was taken aback when Wonder Woman #2 came out and saw that some people thought all this was still unclear. I don’t know how much clearer I can make it! [laughs]      So, I believe very firmly that the answer should be in the text. It really shouldn’t matter what I say to you. It only matters what you can read in the published work. What you can find in the text.      My personal politics are absolutely always going to influence how I write what I write. But at the end of the day, what I believe doesn’t matter. What matters is what you leave the book with.      It doesn’t matter if I say, “Yes, she’s queer.” Or “No, she’s not queer.” It matters what you get out of the book. Can you find it? Is it there? Is it on the page in action or in deed? Then, there’s your answer.      All images pencilled and inked by Nicola Scott and colored by Romulo Fajardo, Jr.      Haven’t caught up on Wonder Woman lately?

"It's supposed to be paradise," DC Comics writer Greg Rucka tells Comicosity in a lengthy interview about Wonder Woman's queerness. He's speaking of Princess Diana's all-woman homeland of Themyscira. For a place to be paradise, it has to include fulfilling romantic and sexual relationships, and "the only options are women," he points out. So "obviously" Wonder Woman has been in love and had relationships with women. New York Daily News reports Wonder Woman herself dropped a pretty major clue in a 2015 comic, when she told Superman: “My country is all women. To us, it’s not ‘gay’ marriage, it’s just marriage.”
summarize:            The knife springs open with a satisfying snap.      Matt Lauer, the co-host of the Today show, turns it over in his hand, marveling at the blade.      “Come to papa!” he says.      Sitting at his glass-topped desk on the morning-show set, Lauer, meticulously outfitted in a green-gray plaid suit and a burnt-­orange tie, has asked the crew for props for a segment on new TSA rules allowing small knives on commercial airliners. A crewman offered up this specimen from his belt holster.      “You know how long it is?” inquires a producer who sits alongside Lauer with a sheaf of notes.      “It’s long enough to get right to your heart, is what it is,” says Lauer.      I casually try snapping a picture with my phone.      “Whoa!” Lauer yells, suddenly serious, pulling back the knife with the reflexes of a practiced fighter. For a moment, he seems unsettled. “Here’s Matt with a switchblade,” says Lauer, imagining the caption. “Great.”      If Matt Lauer doesn’t want to be seen with sharp knives, it’s because last summer his co-host Ann Curry was discovered with one in her back. She was swiftly replaced by a younger, more genial woman, Savannah Guthrie. Ever since, Lauer has been the prime suspect in Curry’s virtual demise. Five million viewers, the majority of them women, would not soon forget how Curry, the intrepid female correspondent and emotionally vivid anchor, spent her last appearance on the Today show couch openly weeping, devastated at having to leave after only a year. The image of Matt Lauer trying to comfort her—and of Curry turning away from his attempted kiss—has become a kind of monument to the real Matt Lauer, forensic evidence of his guilt.      The truest truism of morning-TV shows is that they are like families, or aspire to be—it’s a matter of practiced artifice, faked from the first minute to the last. But reality can’t always be kept out of the picture.      On Curry’s final day, Lauer realized the scene was catastrophic even as cameras rolled. “I think we all knew it at that moment,” says Lauer during an interview with his current co-hosts, Al ­Roker, Natalie Morales, and Guthrie. “And it just seemed like something—there was nothing we could do as it was happening, and we all felt bad about it.”      What followed was the implosion of the most profitable franchise in network television. After sixteen years as the No. 1 morning show in America, Today was worth nearly half a billion dollars a year in advertising revenue to NBC, the bedrock of its business. In the aftermath of the Curry debacle, the show lost half a million viewers and ceded first place in the ratings war to ABC’s Good Morning America, losing millions of dollars overnight.      Blamed in the press for his co-host’s offing, Lauer has watched helplessly as his reputation gets battered week after week. When Chelsea Handler joked to him on Today earlier this month, “You have a worse reputation than I do,” Lauer’s smile sharpened into something that wouldn’t make it past airport security.      The producers of Today are employing every trick they know to rebuild the family’s chemistry, retooling the set, fiddling with the mix of stories, going for more uplift and smiles. But the show is still haunted by what happened, and is still happening, offscreen, the internal struggles and animosities casting strange shadows. Matt Lauer smiles for a living, but offstage he has been obsessed with the situation, brooding about his ratings and his enemies while trying to put forward his own version of events. If Lauer is guilty in the hosticide of Ann Curry (he’s certainly not innocent), he’s far from the only guilty party. For all the smiles, TV hosts often get offed, for all sorts of reasons. As Hyman Roth said in Godfather 2: This is the business they’ve chosen.      The Victim      What had separated Today from its competitors in its decades as the No. 1 morning show was a natural-seeming chemistry between its anchors. The cast of Matt Lauer, Katie Couric, Al Roker, and Ann Curry was once marketed as “America’s First Family,” a morning-news analog to NBC’s prime-time megahit Friends. As the sturdy straight man, Lauer bonded with women by showing he could bake a cake with the same ease with which he could grill a politician, then effortlessly josh with the avuncular Al Roker, the jovial weatherman, for comic relief. It looked real. For a while, it was.      NBC was highly protective of its No. 1 perch in the morning. The pressure was intense; the network fired producers over internal squabbling or when the ratings dipped. In 2005, Good Morning America nearly overtook Today under the direction of a fiercely competitive executive producer named Ben Sherwood, who came within 45,000 viewers of erasing Today’s winning streak. In the days before the ratings results, Lauer was nerve-racked about Today’s prospects. Sherwood viewed the rivalry as pure warfare. “They’ve got all their big guns out,” he said at the time. “They will fight most fiercely. We will fight most fiercely.” ||||| Embattled Today anchor Matt Lauer, already the focus of blistering criticism for the ouster of co-anchor Ann Curry and the ratings slide at NBC‘s morning show, has long been rumored to be on the chopping block — despite his $25 million contract and recent efforts aimed at rehabilitating his image. Here’s the latest wrinkle: I hear NBC toppers recently reached out to CNN’s Anderson Cooper to replace Lauer on the show before the end of the year. After their initial approach to Cooper, I hear NBC reached out to Lauer to get his blessing about the changeover. But I heard they got pushback from the Today veteran, who contacted Cooper to express his disapproval. I also hear that call caught Cooper by surprise, as he had assumed Lauer had been brought on board before NBC began making overtures. Cooper has been one of the leading faces at CNN, though I hear his contract has an out, and he previously was able to do his syndicated daytime talk show in addition to his CNN program.      Cooper’s is just the latest name to be rumored to replace Lauer, who inked a long-term contract last year. Ryan Seacrest, current Today co-host Willie Geist and Meet The Press host David Gregory have all been reportedly considered by NBC. Lauer, meanwhile, has been tied to rumors (along with Cooper, Brian Williams and Dan Patrick) to take over for Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek when the longtime game show host decides to retire.      TV Editor Nellie Andreeva - tip her here. |||||	– NBC must be kicking itself for giving Matt Lauer a $25 million-a-year contract. Top NBC executives recently approached Anderson Cooper about taking the embattled Today host's job this year, anonymous sources tell Deadline. Separately, they reached out to Lauer to get his blessing for the swap—but Lauer didn't grant it. Instead, he called Cooper to express his displeasure, shocking the CNN personality, who thought Lauer was open to the move. Or at least, that's Deadline's version. Sources close to Lauer tell TMZ he'd be fine with the move; the gossip site reports the switch would happen "not immediately but at some point." The story hits in the wake of a New York piece that breathed new life into the Lauer-Ann Curry controversy. The piece depicts Lauer as thoroughly "miserable" and "disgruntled" next to ex-co-host Curry. "He simply didn’t like her," and it showed. Lauer was flirting with bolting to ABC when network executives decided to replace Curry, the article explains, a decision they made in part because they knew Lauer was so sour on her.

summarize: Treatments      CT Scans Boost Cancer Risks For Kids      i itoggle caption Dayna Smith/The Washington Post/Getty Images Dayna Smith/The Washington Post/Getty Images      Children who get CT scans are at slightly increased risk for brain cancer and leukemia, according to a large international study released Tuesday.      CT scans create detailed images of the inside of the body. So they're great for diagnosing all sorts of medical problems — so great that their use has soared in recent years. More than 80 million are being done every year in the United States.      But the scans use a lot more radiation than standard X-rays, and evidence has been mounting that they may increase the risk for cancer. But no one could say for sure.      "This is the first study that's looked at patients that had CT scans and then looked at their subsequent cancer risk," said Amy Berrington de Gonzalez of the National Cancer Institute, who helped conduct the new study.      The study involved nearly 180,000 British patients who got CT scans between 1985 and 2002 before their 22nd birthdays. The researchers looked at kids because they are more sensitive to radiation than adults.      "We found that the radiation exposure from the CT scans was associated with a subsequent increased risk of both leukemia and brain tumors," she said.      Based on the findings, researchers calculated that the amount of radiation from two or three scans of the head before age 15 would increase the risk of brain cancer threefold. It would take five to 10 head scans to triple the risk of leukemia.      Now, the researchers stress that the overall risk for brain cancer and leukemia is very low, so the risk remains quite low even among those who get scans.      "During the follow-up period of our study, which was about 10 years, we estimated about one excess brain tumor and one leukemia per 10,000 head CT scans performed in young children," Berrington de Gonzalez said.      But scans of other parts of the body also look risky, and it's probably not just a matter of multiple CTs and leukemia and brain tumors among kids, she said. There's a good chance even one CT scan poses some risk to children — as well as adults — and possibly for all sorts of cancers.      "I think it's really a landmark paper," said Andrew Einstein of Columbia University Medical Center, who wrote an analysis of the study that's being published along with the paper in the journal The Lancet.      "It's the first paper that's convincingly established that radiation exposure at low doses — in this case from CT scans — is associated with an increased cancer risk to patients," he said.      Previous research has been based primarily on victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.      Now, Berrington de Gonzalez, Einstein and other experts stress that it's important to remember that CT scans save a lot of lives.      "There are clearly situations in which CT is indicated: major motor vehicle accidents where there's multiple potential organ injuries. In abdominal pain where surgery might be required for, say, a bowel obstruction or in some patients with apendicitis," said Donald Frush of Duke University, speaking on behalf of the American College of Radiology.      If we just focused on the negatives, there are lots of things in life we wouldn't do. "Just hearing the downsides of driving a car, or crossing a street or flying in an airplane," he said, "if you only discussed the risks of all of those things no one would drive a car or walk across the street or fly in an airplane."      Other experts agree. But many argue that a lot of CT scans — maybe as many as half — are unnecessary. So doctors have to be much more selective about how they use them, they say.      "It's absolutely fair if your physician suggests that you or your child has a CT scan to ask that physician, 'Why?' Ask, 'Are there good medical reasons why the CT scan is justified?' " said David Brenner, another Columbia University Medical Center researcher who has long studied the safety of CT scans.      Meanwhile, work is also under way to reduce the dose of radiation from each scan. ||||| Gina Baker carefully weighed the pros and cons of a CT scan for her 1-year-old son.      "His pediatrician said she wanted to do a scan to make sure everything was OK," said Baker, explaining concerns that "the little guy's" head was growing too quickly. "They told me the risks from the radiation were low, but you definitely struggle with those types of decisions as a parent."      The scan came back normal, giving Baker some peace of mind. But the 31-year-old nurse and blogger from Brigham City, Utah, said she still worries about the test's long term effects -- a fear bolstered by a new study linking childhood CT scans to cancer later in life.      "Radiation exposure from CT scans was associated with an increased risk of brain cancer and leukemia, and that risk increased with increasing levels of radiation exposure," said Amy Berrington de González, a radiation epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., and co-author of the study published today in The Lancet.      The study, of more than 355,000 children and teens in the U.K., found those exposed to 60 milligrays of radiation -- the cumulative dose of two brain CT scans -- were three times more likely to develop brain tumors. Those exposed to 50 milligrays of radiation were three times more likely to develop leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells produced in the bone marrow.      Berrington de González stressed that the absolute cancer risk is very small, accounting for one extra cancer case per 30,000 children scanned.      "Providing the scan is clinically justified and performed properly with a child size dose of radiation, the benefits should easily outweigh the risks," she said.      But for parents like Baker, forced to quickly weigh the immediate benefits with the long term risks, the decision is far from easy.      "You want to do what's best for your family," she said. "I did agonize over it."      Radiation has long been known to cause DNA damage that can lead to cancer. But the cancer-causing effects of doses doled out during CT scans were purely theoretical.      "Those estimates drew a lot of controversy because they were based on the cancer risk in atomic bomb survivors," said Dr. David Brenner, director of Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research and lead author of the 2001 study estimating the cancer risk from CT scans. "There was debate about whether the risks were real, and this study shows pretty unequivocally that they are."      But Brenner said the benefits of CT scans, namely their ability to quickly detect life-threatening problems and guide life-saving surgeries, indeed outweigh the risks.      "All medical procedures have risks and benefits," he said. "That said, there are situations where CT scans are being used too much."      Brenner estimates some 20 percent of the country's 80 million CT scans each year are either unnecessary or could be replaced by a radiation-free ultrasound or MRI.      "That's why we need basic guidelines; decision rules that determine when a CT scan is medically appropriate," he said, adding that such guidelines already exist but are not always used.      Dr. Andrew Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City and author of an editorial accompanying the study, said he hopes doctors to think twice before ordering CT scans in children and parents will ask about alternatives.      "I think we need to redouble our efforts to ensure patients are getting appropriate tests with the lowest radiation dose possible," he said. "There are good reasons to use CT scans; it's a lifesaving test for many people. But with every good thing in medicine, there's a potential downside. And for CT scans it's the radiation." ||||| Photo      CT scans in children can cause small but significant increases in the risk of leukemia and brain cancer, a new study finds.      Researchers say the results do not mean that CT scans should be avoided entirely — they can be vitally important in certain situations, like diagnosing severe head injuries — but that the test should be performed only when necessary, and with the lowest possible dose of radiation.      CT, or computed tomography, scans take X-rays from various angles and combine them to create cross-sectional images, and they involve much more radiation than traditional X-ray techniques. Concern about potential harm from the scans has grown as their use has climbed steeply; at least four million children a year receive scans in the United States, and researchers estimate that a third of the scans are unnecessary or could be replaced by safer tests like ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, which do not use radiation.      The new study, published online on Wednesday in The Lancet, a British medical journal, is based on the records of nearly 180,000 children who had scans from 1985 to 2002 in Britain. There were 74 cases of leukemia and 135 cases of brain cancer in the group. The authors estimated the radiation doses and found that the more scans the children had and the more radiation they received, the higher their risk.      Children under 15 who had two or three scans of the head had triple the risk of brain cancer compared with the general population, the researchers found, and 5 to 10 scans tripled the risk of leukemia. But the baseline risk is extremely low — 4.5 cases of leukemia per 100,000 people under 20, and 3.5 cases of cancer of the brain or central nervous system — so that even tripled, it remains small.      “The basic message for childhood cancers is that they are rare,” said Mark S. Pearce, the first author of the study, from Newcastle University and the Royal Victoria Infirmary.      In response, the American College of Radiology issued a statement urging parents not to refuse needed CT scans, especially for potentially life-threatening conditions like head and spine injuries, pneumonia complications and chest infections. But the organization also lists conditions for which CT should not be the first choice; one is suspected appendicitis in children, for which the group recommends that ultrasound be used first, followed by CT only if the ultrasound is equivocal.      The Lancet study has limitations: It is observational, meaning that the researchers just looked at what happened to patients without picking them at random to be treated or not, which provides more solid evidence but cannot be justified ethically in studies of radiation. In this case, all the children received scans; there is no unexposed control group. And the researchers say they do not know why the children had the scans, though they excluded those whose cancer diagnosis came so soon after the CT scan that it may have been present before the scan was performed.      An editorial in the same issue of the journal notes that Dr. Pearce’s findings, based on data from actual patients, support earlier risk estimates based on comparisons of the radiation dose from CT scans to the doses received by survivors of the atomic bombing of Japan, who had an increased risk of cancer. The editorial, by Dr. Andrew J. Einstein of Columbia University Medical Center, said that at least a dozen other research groups around the world were studying or planning to study CT effects on children.      A major study warning of CT risks to children, based on the Japanese exposure, was published in 2001; it predicted that of the 600,000 children under 15 who were having head and abdominal scans in the United States each year, 500 might ultimately die of cancer caused by the CT radiation.      The first author of that study, David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that young people were often given CT scans to diagnose kidney stones, appendicitis and dental problems, and that some of those scans could have been avoided by using other methods, like ultrasound or conventional X-rays.      “There’s been a lot of emphasis on reducing the dose” in the decade since, Dr. Brenner said. “That’s really good. Industry got on board.”      But, he emphasized, more work is needed to make sure doctors order the scans only when needed. |||||	– The radiation from CT scans can increase a child's risk of brain cancer and leukemia, a study finds, with risk increasing along with the amount of radiation. The radiation in two or three CT scans triples brain cancer risk for a kid under 15, while five to 10 scans is enough to triple the risk of leukemia, NPR reports. While those numbers sound big, however, they only amount to "one excess brain tumor and one leukemia per 10,000 head CT scans," a researcher says. "There was debate about whether the risks were real, and this study shows pretty unequivocally that they are," an expert tells ABC News. But CT scans can still be well worth it, researchers say. "Providing the scan is clinically justified and performed properly with a child size dose of radiation, the benefits should easily outweigh the risks." The scans are used increasingly often, with some 4 million kids a year receiving them, the New York Times notes. But a third of those may not be needed; radiation-free MRIs and ultrasounds could be a better bet.
summarize: Click here for a full recap of the Democratic National Convention's final day.      6:26 A.M. IDT / 11:26 P.M. EDT: Clinton calls on voters to 'stand up to bullies'      Hillary Clinton is calling on voters to "stand up to bullies."      She says her mother never let her back down from a challenge, and "literally blocked the door" when a young Hillary tried to hide from a neighborhood bully.      Clinton says she still hears her mother urging her "to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what."      She says that, "More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game."      Clinton is closing her speech at the Democratic National Convention by urging Americans to look to the future "with courage and confidence."      6:24 A.M. IDT / 11:24 P.M. EDT: Clinton says Trump is offering 'empty promises' and 'bigotry and bombast'      Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump is offering America "empty promises" and what she's calling "bigotry and bombast."      She says the choice is clear between the GOP nominee's rhetoric and what says she is the Democrats' "bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country."      Clinton says she didn't believe it at first that Trump meant "all the horrible things he says."      She's talking about the times Trump called women "pigs" and said a federal judge of Mexican heritage couldn't be fair to him and denigrated Sen. John McCain's military service in Vietnam because he was captured.      Clinton says it "was just too hard to fathom" that a candidate for president could say such things.      But she says she had to acknowledge "the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump."      6:22 A.M IDT / 11:22 P.M. EST: Clinton says Americans must stand up to 'mean and divisive rhetoric'      Hillary Clinton says Americans need to stand up against "mean and divisive rhetoric" and heal the divides in the fabric of American society.      The Democratic presidential nominee is using her acceptable speech at the party's convention to say Americans must unite to deal with gun violence, immigration and racial strife.      6:18 A.M. IDT / 11:18 P.M. EDT: Clinton questions whether Trump has temperament to be president      Hillary Clinton is questioning whether Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief.      She says Trump "can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign."      Clinton says Trump loses his cool at the "slightest provocation" — when he's gotten tough questions from reporters, when he's challenged in a debate or when he sees a protester at a rally.      Here's her take: "A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons."      6:16 A.M. IDT / 11:16 P.M. EDT: Clinton calls for limits on guns in America      Hillary Clinton is defending her view that there should be limits on guns in America.      But the Democratic presidential nominee says she's not seeking to repeal the Second Amendment.      The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has asserted that Clinton wants to do just that — and end the right to keep and bear arms.      Clinton says in her speech accepting the nomination that she doesn't want to see people shot by someone "who shouldn't have a gun in the first place."      Clinton wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, suspected terrorists and others who would do harm.      Clinton says she refuses to believe common ground on the issue of guns can't be found.      6:16 A.M. IDT / 11:16 P.M. EDT: Clinton vows to protect NATO allies, defeat ISIS      Hillary Clinton says the U.S. needs a leader who'll work with allies to keep America safe.      Clinton says the presidential election presents a stark choice on national security, with the U.S. facing what she says are "determined enemies that must be defeated."      She says people want "steady leadership."      Clinton says she'll stand by NATO allies against any Russian threats.      And she's pledging to defeat the Islamic States group with airstrikes and support for local ground forces, while authorizing a "surge" in intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks.      Clinton says: "We will prevail."      6:15 A.M IDT / 11:15 P.M EDT: Clinton: We must keep supporting Israel's security      "I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. now we have to enforce it and we must keep supporting Israel's security," Hillary Clinton said.      "A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons," she added.      6:10 A.M IDT / 11:10 P.M EDT: Clinton assails Trump's business record      Hillary Clinton is assailing Donald Trump's record as a businessman.      She points to Atlantic City, New Jersey — about 60 miles from Philadelphia, site of the Democratic convention. She says there are contractors and small businesses that lost everything because Trump refused to pay his bills for work they did in his casinos.      Clinton says Trump talks a "big game" about putting America first. But Trump's clothing line is made overseas, not in the United States. The same goes for other Trump products, such as furniture and picture frames, Clinton says.      "Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again," she says. "Well, he could start by actually making things in America again," she says.      6:08 A.M. IDT / 11:08 P.M. EDT: Clinton: I will appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics      Hillary Clinton is checking off one policy difference after another with Republican rival Donald Trump.      She's promising to appoint Supreme Court justices "who will get money out of politics" and expand voting rights, "not restrict them."      Clinton is calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn the high court's 2010 Citizens United ruling that's especially unpopular among Democrats.      The Democratic nominee says she'll fight to overhaul the immigration system.      She's voicing support for raising the minimum wage, expanding health insurance and ensuring women are paid the same as men.      Clinton is talking about issues on which she's moved closer to primary rival Bernie Sanders. They include support for companies sharing more profits with workers and opposition to what she calls "unfair trade deals."      6:06 A.M. IDT / 11:06 P.M. EDT: Clinton: Trump offered no solutions in his nominating speech      Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump didn't offer any solutions to problems when he gave his nominating speech last week.      The Democratic nominee is citing several goals for the first 100 days of a Clinton administration.      Topping her list is bipartisan support to pass what she says will be the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.      Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.      Clinton says she'll work with primary rival Bernie Sanders to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all. She also promises to "liberate" millions of people already with student debt.      6:04 A.M. IDT / 11:04 P.M. EDT: Clinton: 'When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit'      Hillary Clinton says her presidential nomination is a milestone on America's "march toward a more perfect union."      Clinton is the first woman nominee of a major party. She tells the Democratic convention that the achievement is special "for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between."      But she says the nation must keep going until all 161 million women and girls in the country have the opportunities they deserve.      Clinton says: "When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit."      She says she's happy for boys and men, too, because when a barrier fall, it clears the way for all.      6:02 A.M. IDT / 11:02 P.M. EDT: Clinton highlights the lessons taught by her mother      Hillary Clinton says her mother — who was abandoned by her parents as a young girl — taught her an important life lesson.      Clinton says Dorothy Rodham told her: "No one gets through life alone."      Clinton mentioned her late mother several times in her nomination speech at the Democratic National Convention.      She says her mom was saved by the kindness of others, including a first-grade teacher who brought extra food to share with the little schoolgirl.      She says her mother, who ended up on her own at age 14 and worked as a maid, told her daughter that people have to look out for one another and "lift each other up."      5:56 A.M IDT / 10:56 EDT: Clinton: I'd be president for all who vote for me and those who don't      Hillary Clinton says she'd be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents — "for all those who vote for me and those who don't."      She says she's met many people who motivate her to fight for change, including sick children and survivors of 9/11.      Clinton says "it's true, I sweat the details of policy.      She says details should be a "big deal" to the president.      5:55 A.M IDT / 10:55 EDT: Clinton: Democrats must show working families they understand      Hillary Clinton says Democrats haven't done a good enough job of showing working families that they understand what these families are going through.      Clinton says she agrees with families that have told her the economy just isn't working.      She says Americans are willing to work, and work hard.      But right now, she says, "an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do."      5:52 A.M IDT / 10:52 EDT: 'Hillary!' chants break out in attempt to drown out hecklers      Democratic Delegates have twice broken out in chants of "Hillary!" during their presidential nominee's acceptance speech in order to drown out isolated hecklers in the convention hall.      Some supporters of primary rival Bernie Sanders still object to Clinton's nomination and they were planning to express their displeasure.      Clinton hasn't acknowledged any of the jeers or yelling.      Some Washington state delegates left quietly — with tape over their mouths — as Clinton spoke.      5:51 A.M IDT / 10:51 EDT: Clinton: Don't believe anyone who says 'I alone can fix it'      Hillary Clinton is telling Democrats at the party's national convention not to believe anyone who says, "I alone can fix it."      That's a knock on her Republican rival, Donald Trump. He told GOP delegates a week ago that he's the only one who can fix "the system."      Clinton is accepting the Democratic nomination and warning that Trump's words should "set off alarm bells for all of us."      She accusing Trump of forgetting such people as America's troops, its police and firefighters, teachers and others.      Clinton says Americans don't say, "I alone can fix it" but "we'll fix it together."      She's emphasizing her point by saying the Founding Fathers designed the Constitution so America would be a nation where no one person has all the power.      5:48 A.M. IDT / 10:48 P.M. EDT: Hillary Clinton officially accepts Democratic nomination for president      Hillary Clinton says she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination with "humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise."      Clinton says the slogan "stronger together" that's been featured in her campaign is a guiding principle for the country.      She says it'll help define a future with a healthy economy "for everyone, not just those at the top."      Clinton says it also means good schools for rich and poor, and safe communities.      Clinton is recalling the book she wrote while she served as first lady. She says "It Takes a Village" envisions a country in which people work together to make "our nation better and stronger."      5:45 A.M. IDT / 10:45 P.M. EDT: Clinton: Don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak      Hillary Clinton says the United States has the most dynamic and diverse people in the world — and the most powerful military.      So, she says, don't let "anyone tell you that our country is weak."      Clinton is continuing a theme at the Democratic National Convention that seeks to counter Donald Trump's starker vision.      She also says the U.S. has the most innovative entrepreneurs and the most enduring values.      "Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes," Clinton says. "We do."      5:42 A.M. IDT / 10:42 P.M. EDT: Clinton: I won't build a wall or ban a religion      Hillary Clinton says she'd be an inclusive president.      She says she wouldn't build a wall or ban a religion.      The Democratic nominee says she'd try to build an economy that benefits everyone and she'd work toward a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants.      Clinton says she'd work with all Americans and the nation's allies to fight terrorism.      She says: "We are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid."      5:40 A.M. IDT / 10:40 P.M. EDT: Clinton: Trump has taken GOP from morning in America to midnight in America      Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump has brought the Republican Party a long way — from "Morning in America" to "Midnight in America."      The Democratic presidential candidate says the Trump "wants us to fear the future and fear each other."      "It's morning in America" was an optimistic line from a famous political ad aired by Ronald Reagan.      Clinton is asking whether Trump would stay true to the phrase on the country's seal — "E Pluribus Unum," or out of many, we are one.      And her take? "We heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us — from the rest of the world, and from each other."      She says President Franklin Roosevelt's famous words are the perfect rebuke: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."      5:38 A.M. IDT / 10:38 P.M. EDT: Clinton tells Bernie Sanders: Your cause is our cause      Hillary Clinton says she's heard the views of Bernie Sanders' steadfast supporters and says their cause is her cause.      She's giving her presidential acceptance speech at the Democratic convention after a hard-fought race with the Vermont senator.      She's praising Sanders for putting economic and social justice issues "front and center" — where she says they belong.      And she tells Sanders' supporters the country needs their "ideas, energy and passion."      She's asking them to move forward and turn their platform into "real change for America."      5:35 A.M. IDT / 10:35 P.M. EDT: Clinton opens by thanking Obamas, Tim Kaine      Hillary Clinton is returning the praise she has received all week from leading Democrats.      Clinton is delivering her acceptance speech for the Democratic presidential nomination.      She's thanking President Barack Obama and says she's a better person because of Obama's friendship.      She has kind words for first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and her running mate, Tim Kaine.      Clinton says people are "soon going to understand" why Kaine is so popular in Virginia, which he represents in the Senate.      She says Kaine will make the "whole country proud as our vice president."      5:25 A.M. IDT / 10:25 P.M. EDT: Chelsea Clinton offers daughter's view of mom's life work      Hillary Clinton may not be a typical grandma, but she's a doting one.      That's how daughter Chelsea Clinton is describing her mom as she introduces the presidential candidate at the Democratic convention.      Chelsea says her mother will drop everything to FaceTime her 2-year-old granddaughter Charlotte — even if she's about to walk on stage for a debate or campaign speech.      Chelsea says her mom will pause "for a few minutes of blowing kisses and reading 'Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo.'"      Chelsea tells the Democratic convention that her mother has always made her feel "valued and loved," and she says Hillary Clinton wants that for every child.      The younger Clinton calls that desire "the calling of her life."      She's introducing the former secretary of state, who's set to formally accept the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency on Thursday night.      Chelsea notes that her parents "expected me to have opinions" — and that they taught her "to back them up with facts."      The former first daughter says she's had a "front-row seat" to watch how Hillary serves. She's describing her mom as a diligent public servant who looks for solutions and dives into policy.      Chelsea tells the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Thursday that she's seen her mom surrounded by "stack of memos and reports" to review policy.      And she's seen her promise struggling mothers she'd do all she could to help them.      Chelsea says she's learned this from her mom: "Public service is about service."      4:55 A.M. IDT / 9:55 P.M. EDT: Marine general slams Trump, offers impassioned endorsement for Clinton      A retired Marine general has delivered an impassioned endorsement of Hillary Clinton. And he's blasting Donald Trump for saying suspected terrorists should be tortured and for offering conditional U.S. support of NATO allies.      John Allen tells Democratic delegates the election between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump will help determine the country's future.      As the crowd chants "USA! USA!" Allen says he trusts Clinton to be commander in chief.      Allen says that under Clinton, the military won't become what he calls an "instrument of torture." Allen says that with Clinton in the White House, U.S. international relations won't be reduced to a business transaction.      Allen most recently served as America's special envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State militants. He's also a former commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.      4:45 A.M. IDT / 9:45 P.M EDT: Khizr Khan to Trump: Have you even read the Constitution?      The father of an Army captain — a Muslim-American killed in Iraq — has lead a strong condemnation of Donald Trump's proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States.      Khizr Khan is a Muslim who came to the U.S. from the United Arab Emirates. He's accusing Trump of smearing the character of Muslims and other groups.      "Have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy," Khan said. "In this document, look for the words 'liberty' and 'equal protection of law.'"      "Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities."      "You have sacrificed nothing."      4:36 A.M. IDT / 9:36 P.M. EDT: Sanders campaign urges delegates to respect Clinton      The Bernie Sanders campaign is urging calm among its 1,900 delegates on the final night of the Democratic National Convention.      The campaign says in a text message to delegates it would be a "courtesy to Bernie" if the delegates show respect to Hillary Clinton when she gives her speech accepting the party's nomination for president.      The text tells the delegates the Clinton campaign asked her delegates on Monday to be respectful to Sanders when he spoke to the convention. The text asks delegates to "extend the same respect" to Clinton.      Some Sanders delegates are wearing high-visibility green T-shirts at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The delegates are expressing solidarity with the Vermont senator to the end of the convention.      3:50 A.M IDT / 8:50 P.M. EDT: Reagan speechwriter slams Trump, endorses Clinton      Doug Elmets is a Republican who Democrats can cheer for.      Elmets — who worked in the Reagan White House — earned a roar from the crowd at the Democratic convention Thursday night when he took the stage and said he was backing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.      Elmets says Clinton will be the first Democrat to get his vote — and he's blaming Donald Trump for driving him away from the Republican Party.      He's borrowing a line from the late Lloyd Bentsen — the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1988 — to tweak Trump for likening himself to Reagan.      Elmets says: "I knew Ronald Reagan. I worked for Ronald Reagan. Donald Trump, you are no Ronald Reagan!"      3:25 A.M. IDT / 8:25 P.M. EDT: This time, host governor attends party convention      They held a political convention and the governor of the host state actually came. And spoke.      That was Tom Wolf on the stage Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, and he was taking shots at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.      Wolf's presence in the convention hall is a reminder that Republicans couldn't feature a home-state governor at their convention in Cleveland last week.

That's according to excerpts of Clinton's nomination acceptance speech that her campaign has released ahead of her Thursday night address at the Democrat convention.      Clinton is set to tell Americans that she understands their worries about turmoil in the world.      She's says violent attacks in Iraq, France, Belgium and Florida have caused much unease and anxiety — and people are "looking for reassurance — looking for steady leadership." She says she offers just that.      2:50 A.M. IDT / 7:50 P.M. EDT: Clinton campaign previews her acceptance speech      Hillary Clinton's campaign is offering a preview of her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, where she'll say "America is once again at a moment of reckoning."      Clinton plans to tell the convention crowd later Thursday night that "powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart" and that Americans must "decide whether we're going to work together so we can all rise together."      Her campaign has released excerpts of her upcoming speech.      Clinton says her primary mission as president will be to "create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States."      She says she'll focus on places she says have been "left out and left behind." She says that includes inner cities and small towns, from "Indian Country to Coal Country" and "from the industrial Midwest to the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley."      2:12 A.M. IDT/ 7:12 P.M. EDT: Israeli ambassador to U.S. lauds Clinton’s hand in 2012 Gaza cease-fire      Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, credited Hillary Clinton with the leading role in achieving a cease-fire in Israel’s 2012 conflict with Hamas.      Clinton flew to the region and conducted shuttle diplomacy between Egypt and Israel to end hostilities between Israel and Hamas through indirect negotiations. Dermer said that because of the quick cease-fire, the eight-day conflict was the only one of Israel’s three rounds of fighting with Hamas to not include an Israeli ground operation in Gaza.      “She came in and had to get it right, and had, I think, basically one shot,” Dermer said at an event hosted by the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. “A lot of lives were saved.”      2:10 A.M. IDT / 7:10 P.M.

"Most of them are going to come around."      That's what John Podesta thinks.      Podesta says he knows there are some in the Sanders camp who are still "emotional" and wish Clinton didn't win more votes than the Vermont senator in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.      But Podesta says most of Sanders' supporters are looking at the election as a choice between Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.      Podesta spoke after some Sanders delegates at the party's convention wore neon yellow shirts to protest Clinton's nomination.      1:52 A.M IDT / 6:52 P.M. EDT: Debbie Wasserman Schultz: 'Sometimes you have to take one for the team'      Addressing her resignation as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee for the first time, Debbie Wasserman Schultz accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of treason.      On Thursday, referring to Trump’s request two days earlier that Russia uncover emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, Wasserman Schultz said the statement was “treasonous, it’s seditious, it’s unacceptable.”      Wasserman Schultz added: “This has been a difficult week, no question about it,” but that “sometimes you just have to take one for the team, and that’s OK. It’s OK.”      1:50 A.M. IDT / 6:50 P.M. EDT: Sanders supporters hope to send message with glow-in-the-dark shirts      Some Bernie Sanders supporters are wearing glow-in-the-dark shirts on the final night of Democrats convention in Philadelphia.      They say it's a way to remind presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that she hasn't brought them all on board yet.      For Clinton, the silent protest probably is preferable to the heckling and booing from that marked the early days of the convention.      Sanders delegate Davena Norris says her bright shirt is meant to send a message that more needs to be done to curb the influence of money in politics.      1:45 A.M. IDT / 6:45 P.M. EDT: Trump steers clear of Russia-Clinton talk in Iowa      Donald Trump is campaigning in Iowa and largely avoiding the topic that earned him lots of criticism this week.      Only a day ago Trump encouraged Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by his Democratic presidential opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.      Trump's comments raised the question of whether he was condoning foreign government hacking of U.S. computers and the public release of information stolen from political adversaries.      Trump was condemned by Clinton and even some of his fellow Republicans. Running mate Mike Pence warned of "serious consequences" if Russia interfered in the election.      Trump has since insisted he was being sarcastic.      At the Iowa rally, he did say he wanted better relations with Russia and joked that writing letters was more secure than "putting something on a computer."      1:22 A.M. IDT / 6:22 P.M. EDT: Minority delegates fed up with lingering ‘Bernie or Bust’ antics      As most Democrats rally around Hillary Clinton, the lingering "Bernie or Bust" movement is stirring frustration at the party's convention among delegates of color, who say they're upset at the refusal of the Vermont senator's most fervent backers to fall in line.      "I am so exhausted by it," said Danielle Adams, a black Clinton delegate from North Carolina. "I think there are undercuts of privilege that concern me."      Rep. Cheryl Brown, a California delegate from San Bernardino who is black, condemned what she called the "aggressive" behavior of some Sanders delegates, saying they jumped on tables and shoved people at the state's hotel the night that Sanders moved that the convention nominate Clinton by acclamation.      Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, an African-American and close ally of Clinton, was telling the story of his late father — a share-cropper in South Carolina — on the convention's first day when Sanders supporters started chanting "No TPP" and holding up signs opposing the trade pact.      1:13 A.M IDT / 6:13 P.M. EDT: Trump says Democrats telling 'lot of lies' about him      Donald Trump says "a lot of lies are being told" about him in the speeches at the Democratic National Convention this week.      The Republican presidential nominee is joking about it during a campaign rally in Davenport, Iowa.      "Boy, I'm getting hit" by Democrats — he says. "I guess they have to do their thing."      Trump is criticizing Democrats for not talking about terrorism or laying out a plan to aid the economy.      12:43 A.M. IDT / 5:43 P.M.

McBride noted that "today in America, LGBTQ people are still targeted by hate that lives in both lives and hearts" and called Donald Trump "an enemy of LGBTQ rights."      12:05 A.M IDT / 5:05 P.M. EDT: Some Sanders backers want DNC apology before Clinton's speech      Die-hard Bernie Sanders supporters from Oregon's delegation say they're demanding a nationally televised apology at the Democratic National Convention before Hillary Clinton takes the stage Thursday night to accept the presidential nomination.      The matter involves leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee that indicated party officials were biased against the Vermont senator.      The DNC has apologized and the party's leader, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is resigning her post.      But Melissa Pancurak tells The Associated Press that those steps don't go far enough. She says the Oregon delegates are part of a coalition of Sanders supporters working to get their demand to appropriate DNC officials before Clinton's speech.      11:20 P.M. IDT/4:20 P.M. EDT: Mike Pence: Donald Trump will be a 'pro-life president'      Donald Trump's stand on abortion has been inconsistent, but his running says Trump would be a "pro-life president."      Mike Pence is campaigning in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and he makes clear he opposes abortion. And the Indiana governor tells a town hall rally, "I don't apologize for it."      Pence drew the ire of abortion rights advocates in March after he signed a law banning abortions that were being sought because of fetal genetic defects. That law has since been blocked pending the outcome of a court challenge.      Pence says Trump would appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court who would send the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling to the "ash heap of history."      11:00 P.M. IDT / 4:00 P.M. EDT: Elijah Cummings slams protesters who interrupted his convention speech      "Disrespectful."      That's what Elijah Cummings thinks of liberal supporters of Bernie Sanders who chanted an anti-trade slogan during the Maryland congressman's speech at the Democratic National Convention.      But Cummings says he's not upset about it because he's a veteran of civil rights protests and understands the passion that drove the mostly young delegates to shout over his speech Monday.      Cummings says in an interview that most of those who were shouting probably didn't know he worked with Sanders to draft the Democratic platform and he's "never voted for a trade bill in 20 years in Congress."      He says more than 100 people have apologized to him for the outbursts.      9:37 P.M. IDT/2:37 P.M. EDT: 'Obama's mention of 'fascists' wasn't aimed at Trump'      U.S. President Barack Obama's mention of "fascists" and "homegrown demagogues" in his convention speech wasn't aimed at Donald Trump, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters the day after Obama argued for Democrat Hillary Clinton's election over Trump.      Obama said "anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end."      Obama criticized Trump several times before arriving at that particular line in the speech, including saying that American power "doesn't come from a self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way."      Trump said in his acceptance speech at last week's GOP convention that "I alone can fix" a political system he says is rigged.      9:19 P.M. IDT/2:19 P.M. EDT: Giuliani praises Clinton's work on behalf of 9/11 victims      Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gave Hillary Clinton credit for her work on behalf of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.      Giuliani was asked at a Republican Party briefing Thursday in Philadelphia whether he took issue with the Democratic convention speakers who'd been praising Clinton. Giuliani said she was "enormously supportive and helpful." Clinton was a U.S. senator from New York at the time.      He says Clinton "has a right to tell people that she worked hard on behalf of the 9/11 families." He adds that, "She did."      But Giuliani adds that "on all other aspects she fails the test." Clinton and Democrats, he says, have "not done anything to prevent another attack."      8:50 P.M. IDT/1:50 P.M. EDT This time, Bill Clinton will be the adoring spouse, rapt and smiling when the cameras cut away from the candidate in the spotlight.      He'll be the He in the VIP box watching as She accepts the presidential nomination at the Democratic convention on Thursday.      It's one small step in the role reversal Americans will need to get used to if Hillary Clinton wins the White House in November.      Already, satires and spoofs are circulating, taking note of Bill's fashion choices, accessories and hair style. How about that fetching pantsuit! And that nice head of hair! Whose shoes is he wearing?      After all, that's what political wives have come to expect.      Bill Clinton, utterly comfortable in his own skin, seems to be just fine with trading places with his wife, the former first lady. ||||| The Democratic convention made history on Thursday: Sarah McBride, a transgender woman, became the first openly trans person to address a national party convention.      “My name is Sarah McBride, and I am a proud transgender American,” she said. “Today in America, LGBTQ people are targeted by hate that lives in both laws and hearts. Many still struggle just to get by. But I believe tomorrow can be different. Tomorrow, we can be respected and protected.”      To some degree, her appearance at the Democratic convention may seem like the natural evolution of LGBTQ politics in America. Democrats have been very vocal on LGBTQ rights over the past few years — most recently standing against laws that ban trans people from using the bathroom for their gender identity.      But while this may seem obvious now, it’s a remarkable shift from just eight years ago — when LGBTQ people really didn’t have a party; they had a big compromise.      It’s true Democrats were always friendlier to LGBTQ people. Even “don’t ask, don’t tell” (DADT) — now widely reviled as an outdated anti-LGBTQ policy — was supposed to be a small nudge forward from a total ban on LGBTQ soldiers in the military. And Democrats like California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom were some of the first to speak out for marriage equality more than a decade ago.      But there were limits. President Barack Obama didn’t support same-sex marriage when he was elected in 2008, and he wouldn’t publicly support it until 2012. (Hillary Clinton would take until 2013.)      While many Democrats criticized DADT, it wasn’t clear whether they would really make repealing it a priority. And it was even less clear whether they would prioritize repealing the ban on openly serving trans service members — a ban separate from DADT — after that.      Similarly, while Democrats have long pushed for ending discrimination against LGBTQ people, it wasn’t obvious that they would actually make a serious push for a law doing that in the workplace — as they did (and failed) in 2013 — or that the Obama administration would risk legal battles with several states to stand up for trans people’s right to use the bathroom for their gender identity.      But Democrats ultimately did all of that.      There is still work to do, of course. Most states still allow discrimination against LGBTQ people in the workplace, housing, public accommodations, and education. Exactly how the military will implement the end of its ban on open trans people remains a work in progress. Whether the Supreme Court will rule to interpret federal civil rights laws to include LGBTQ people, as some advocates hope, remains an open question.      But there has been remarkable progress in the past eight years. Going forward, LGBTQ people also finally seem to have a major political party fully behind them.      Watch: How most states still allow discrimination against LGBTQ people ||||| Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images      The big “first” of this week’s Democratic National Convention is, of course, the nomination of a woman for the office of president of the United States. But a close runner-up took place on Thursday with the appearance of Sarah McBride on the Philadelphia stage. McBride is the national press secretary for the LGBTQ advocacy organization Human Rights Campaign, and, at 25, she’s already made a name for herself in Washington as a fighter for progressive causes. She’s also transgender, and her address marks the first time a trans American has addressed a national major party convention.      McBride, who was introduced by openly gay New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in an LGBTQ-focused segment of the program, began her speech with a declaration: "I am a proud transgender American." From there, she acknowleged the rapid change that has been achieved on certain queer issues in recent years, but reminded viewers that we're not done:      But despite our progress, so much work remains. Will we be a nation where there is only one way to love, only one way to look, and only one way to live? Or will we be a nation where everyone has the freedom to live live freely and openly? A nation that's stronger together? That is the question in this election.      Advertisement            McBride then made the stakes personal, recounting the story of her late husband Andrew, a transgender man and activist who passed away from terminal cancer shortly after their wedding. "Knowing Andy left me profoundly changed," she said. "But more than anything else, his passing taught me that every day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest. Hillary Clinton understand the urgency of our fight."      On the importance of making the speech, for which she received an invitation from the Democratic LGBT Caucus, McBride said in an HRC statement earlier this week that her goal was to promote understanding around queer issues: “People must understand that even as we face daily harassment, tragic violence, and an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ political attacks across the country, we are real people merely seeking to be treated with the dignity and respect every person deserves. I'm so proud to stand with the LGBT Caucus and speak out in support of Hillary Clinton, because we know she stands with us.”            McBride joins more than two dozen self-identifying transgender delegates at the DNC, marking it as presumably the most trans-inclusive official political event in American history. And her own firsts don’t stop with her address. A Time profile of McBride reveals that, after coming out as trans during college, she took an internship at the White House—a role that she believes made her the first openly trans woman to work there. She’s also been vocal in the fight against North Carolina’s transphobic HB2 “bathroom law”; her protest photo in an NC women’s room ably demonstrated the bigotry and illogic at the heart such measures and subsequently went viral. |||||	– A historic first just happened at the Democratic National Convention—and this time we're not talking about the nomination of Hillary Clinton. When Sarah McBride took the stage to speak Thursday she became the first openly transgender person to address a national party convention, Vox reports. Introducing herself as a "proud transgender American," McBride told the convention: “Today in America, LGBTQ people are targeted by hate that lives in both laws and hearts...But I believe tomorrow can be different. Tomorrow, we can be respected and protected.” According to Haaretz, McBride went on to criticize Donald Trump as "an enemy of LGBTQ rights." Firsts are nothing new for McBride, the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign. She was the first openly transgender White House intern, according to People. She says she agreed to speak Thursday so that "any young girl" will know "they can be respected as the equal humans that we all are." The 25-year-old McBride also talked about the death of her husband from cancer shortly after their wedding, Slate reports. "His passing taught me that every day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest," she said. With more than two-dozen openly transgender delegates, Slate says the convention is likely the "most trans-inclusive official political event in American history."

While her death was unexpected, Madelyn suffered from drug addiction, and for years we feared her addiction would claim her life. We are grateful that when she died, she was safe and she was with her family.      Maddie was born on March 31, 1988, in Burlington, Vt., where she grew up and lived on and off throughout her adult life; she also spent time in Sarasota, Fla.; Keene, N.H.; and Boulder, Colo.      Madelyn was a born performer and had a singing voice so beautiful it would stop people on the street. Whether she was onstage in a musical or around the kitchen table with her family, when she shared her voice, she shared her light. She was a member of FolKids of Vermont, a dance and musical troupe that toured the world. Maddie visited Russia and Thailand with the group and, as part of their exchange program, hosted kids from other countries at home in Vermont. She loved to ski and snowboard, and she swam on the YMCA swim team, winning medals at the New England regionals.      When she was 16, she moved with her parents from Vermont to Florida to attend a performing arts high school. Soon after she tried OxyContin for the first time at a high school party, and so began a relationship with opiates that would dominate the rest of her life.      It is impossible to capture a person in an obituary, and especially someone whose adult life was largely defined by drug addiction. To some, Maddie was just a junkie — when they saw her addiction, they stopped seeing her. And what a loss for them. Because Maddie was hilarious, and warm, and fearless, and resilient. She could and would talk to anyone, and when you were in her company you wanted to stay. In a system that seems to have hardened itself against addicts and is failing them every day, she befriended and delighted cops, social workers, public defenders and doctors, who advocated for and believed in her 'til the end. She was adored as a daughter, sister, niece, cousin, friend and mother, and being loved by Madelyn was a constantly astonishing gift.      Maddie loved her family and the world. But more than anyone else, she loved her son, Ayden, who was born in 2014. She transformed her life to mother him. Every afternoon in all kinds of weather, she would put him in a backpack and take him for a walk. She sang rather than spoke to him, filling his life with song. Like his mom, Ayden loves to swim; together they would spend hours in the lake or pool. And she so loved to snuggle him up, surrounding him with her love.      After having Ayden, Maddie tried harder and more relentlessly to stay sober than we have ever seen anyone try at anything. But she relapsed and ultimately lost custody of her son, a loss that was unbearable.      During the past two years especially, her disease brought her to places of incredible darkness, and this darkness compounded on itself, as each unspeakable thing that happened to her and each horrible thing she did in the name of her disease exponentially increased her pain and shame. For 12 days this summer, she was home, and for most of that time she was sober. For those 12 wonderful days, full of swimming and Disney movies and family dinners, we believed as we always did that she would overcome her disease and make the life for herself we knew she deserved. We believed this until the moment she took her last breath. But her addiction stalked her and stole her once again. Though we would have paid any ransom to have her back, any price in the world, this disease would not let her go until she was gone.      Maddie is survived by her son, Ayden; her parents, Maureen Linsenmeir and Mark Linsenmeir; her sister Kate O’Neill and Kate’s partner, Marshall Fong; her sister Maura O’Neill and Maura’s partner, Tim Painting; her aunts Beth Dow and Susan Dow and Beth’s partner, Charlie Allison; her beloved cousin Sloan Collins; and many other aunts, uncles and cousins, including the Conants, Cahills and Camisas. She is predeceased by her grandparents, Madelyn and Roland Keenan, Mary Ellen and Herman Dow, and Reginald Linsenmeir.      Please join us for a memorial service honoring Maddie’s life on Sunday, October 21, at 2 p.m., at the First Unitarian Universalist Society sanctuary at 152 Pearl Street in Burlington. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the Turning Point Center, a place where Maddie spent time and felt supported. Donations can be made via its website, turningpointcentervt.org.      If you yourself are struggling from addiction, know that every breath is a fresh start. Know that hundreds of thousands of families who have lost someone to this disease are praying and rooting for you. Know that we believe with all our hearts that you can and will make it. It is never too late.      If you are reading this with judgment, educate yourself about this disease, because that is what it is. It is not a choice or a weakness. And chances are very good that someone you know is struggling with it, and that person needs and deserves your empathy and support.      If you work in one of the many institutions through which addicts often pass — rehabs, hospitals, jails, courts — and treat them with the compassion and respect they deserve, thank you. If instead you see a junkie or thief or liar in front of you rather than a human being in need of help, consider a new profession.      We take comfort in knowing that Maddie is surrounded by light, free from the struggle that haunted her. We would have given anything for her to experience that freedom in this lifetime. Our grief over losing her is infinite. And now so is she. ||||| BURLINGTON, Vt.

The family of 30-year-old Madelyn Ellen Linsenmeir posted an obituary for her after she died Oct. 7 that appeared in several newspapers and has been widely shared.      Her relatives wrote that she first tried OxyContin at a high school party, starting a relationship with opioids that dominated her life. They wrote that drug addiction is not a choice or weakness and that people struggling with it need and deserve empathy and support.      Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo questioned on Facebook why it took "a grieving relative with a good literary sense to get people to pay attention" when nearly a quarter-million people have already died the same way. |||||	– "To some, Maddie was just a junkie," but to the family and friends grieving the 30-year-old's death, Madelyn Ellen Linsenmeir was "adored as a daughter, sister, niece, cousin, friend, and mother," according to a moving obituary that has caught the attention of the nation and beyond. Linsenmeir, who was from Vermont, died Oct. 7, the AP reports, adding that the obituary's call for contributions to a local recovery center has resulted, as of this writing, in more than 100 donations from around the US and as far away as Denmark. Gary De Carolis, executive director of the Turning Point Center, tells CNN that the "response to the obituary has been nothing less than profound," adding that the family's "courageous act helped change the face of addiction to one that is the face of a brother, sister, mom, dad, friend, and neighbor." Linsenmeir tried OxyContin for the first time at 16, during a high school party, according to her obituary, beginning "a relationship with opiates that would dominate the rest of her life." Her son was born in 2014. Despite her efforts to stay sober, she relapsed and lost custody—"a loss that was unbearable." But, the obituary says, her family always believed she'd overcome addiction. "We believed this until the moment she took her last breath." The obituary ends with a message of hope to people struggling with addiction ("Every breath is a fresh start") and a call for others to educate themselves about addiction ("It's not a choice or a weakness"). On Facebook, Brandon del Pozo, Burlington, Vt., police chief, wonders "why did it take a grieving relative with a good literary sense to get people to pay attention" to the opioid epidemic. "Maddie is gone," he writes. "But others are next." (These four obituaries also confronted addiction head-on.)
summarize: WASHINGTON (AP) — The parents of an Ohio teen who died from an overdose of caffeine powder are urging federal regulators to ban sales of the stimulant, saying that children must be protected from a highly potent substance.      Dennis and Katie Stiner, of LaGrange, Ohio, were in Washington on Tuesday on behalf of their 18-year-old son Logan, who died in May after ingesting about 23 times the amount of caffeine found in a typical coffee or soda drink.      "Before May 27, 2014, we had never heard of 'caffeine powder.' Now we think about it every day," the Stiners said in a meeting with lawmakers.      As little as a single teaspoon of the stimulant can be fatal.      The Stiners said the Food and Drug Administration must do more to keep teens and young adults away from pure powdered caffeine, which is marketed as a dietary supplement primarily on the Internet and largely unregulated, unlike caffeine added to soda.      In July, the FDA cautioned consumers to avoid caffeine powder as it considers possible regulatory action. The powder remains available for sale online even as the agency acknowledges it often lacks adequate warning labels and that people can easily take a lethal amount.      The Stiners met with Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and were joined by Jim and Julie Sweatt, the parents of Wade, a 24-year-old Georgia resident who also died after ingesting caffeine powder.      "We must do everything we can to get this product off the market and away from children," the Stiners said.      Brown and Blumenthal pledged to continue pressing the FDA to ban the product and said they will consider legislative action if necessary.      "While the dangers are not broadly understood, powdered caffeine is widely available online or in stores with little warning or guidance. That must stop," Brown said. "While it's too late to save Logan and Wade from this dangerous substance, we must act quickly before more lives are lost."      Blumenthal called the stimulant a poison. "There ought to be a great big 'skull and bones' on it, or it should be banned," he said.      In a statement Tuesday, the FDA said it was continuing its investigation and noted that since its July warning to consumers, some online retailers have discontinued selling caffeine powder. The agency did not indicate how long its review may take or what regulatory action it was considering.      Because caffeine powder is sold as a dietary supplement, it's not subject to the same federal regulations as certain caffeinated foods. Users add it to drinks for a pick-me-up before workouts or to control weight gain, but it is almost impossible to measure with common kitchen tools, according to the FDA.      A mere 1/16th of a teaspoon can contain about 200 milligrams of caffeine, roughly the equivalent of two large cups of coffee.      In the case of Logan Stiner, a wrestler, an autopsy found that he had more than 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood in his system, as much as 23 times the amount found in a typical coffee or soda drink, when he died at his home. Symptoms of caffeine overdose or toxicity include rapid or erratic heartbeat, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea and disorientation.      Stiner's parents described the teen, who died days before his high school graduation, as a bright kid who was looking forward to attending the University of Toledo to study chemical engineering.      "It was tragic," his mother told senators.

One teaspoon of powder caffeine is equal to 16 cups of coffee. Doctors say and Stiner's story proves it doesn't take much to kill.      It can be bought with the click of a mouse but with just a spoonful, powder caffeine can be lethal.      One mother's only wish is that she knew about the supplement that ended her teenage son's life.      Prom king, athlete and straight-A student Logan Stiner of Ohio was just 18 years old when his brother found him dead on his bedroom floor last year.      "He had no idea what he was doing. None. I do believe at the last minute he realized what happened and probably shook his head," the teen's mother, Katie Stiner, said.      Logan Stiner's s death remained mysterious until his mom found a bag of powder caffeine in his room.      Now, she is telling her cautionary tale to anyone who will listen including lawmakers, urging them to ban the supplement.      "It is straight caffeine in its pure form," said Dr. Jennifer Lowry, a toxicologist at Children's Mercy Hospital.?      Lowry says caffeine powder is the concentrated form of what one would drink in coffee or soda.      "In worst cases, you end up having seizures, heart attacks, strokes and can cause serious harm," Lowry said.      One teaspoon of powder caffeine is equal to 16 cups of coffee. Doctors say and Stiner's story proves it doesn't take much to kill.      "They're not regulated, so they don't need to tell me what's in it, how much is in it, and a lot of times there are different things in it that weren't suppose to be in it in the first place," Lowry said.      It's a Food and Drug Administration loophole for substances labeled supplement. It falls under no regulations.      KCTV5 News bought a bag on eBay for $11 and contacted the seller, a Chicago-based company named Phil-Outlet.      The owner, Eddie Chua, said he gets the powder from China.      "We sell to a lot of sports nutrition people who are mixing the product. Because if you buy sports drink, it's already mixed in. Some people like to mix their own," said Chua, who stands by the product.      His packaging is uniquely labeled compared to other brands found.      "We sell it with ample warning, and we provide a dosing spoon. I think a lot of people misuse it when they purchase it. There is no instruction on how to use it," he said.      While Kansas and Missouri poison control centers have only received one call on the powder in the last year, families like the Stiners say every parent needs to hear their story.      "We know if it can kill somebody like Logan, it has no borders and it will kill again," Katie Stiner said.      The Stiner family believes without a ban, powder caffeine will end more lives.      Since the so-called supplement has caused harm, the FDA is now working to build a legal case against companies that sell it.      Copyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) All rights reserved. |||||	– Prom king Logan Stiner died of a caffeine overdose just days before his high school graduation last May, and now his parents are suing. Kate and Dennis Stiner have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against companies that manufacture and distribute caffeine powder, including Amazon.com and Hard Rhino. "This is pharmaceutical-grade caffeine powder that is advertised, marketed, and delivered across the country, and just a small difference in dosage is the difference between life and death," their attorney, Brian Balser, tells WKYC. "We clearly believe they violated several" Ohio Food and Drug Act safety laws. Stiner, 18, had gone home for lunch on the day of his death; his brother found him on the floor. An autopsy showed more than 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood in his system, as much as 23 times the amount found in that of a typical coffee or soda drinker. Stiner, a wrestler, had once told his mom he took some sort of "pre-workout" substance, and a bag of caffeine powder was found in his room. "He had a busy week and he thought it wouldn't hurt," his mom told lawmakers in December, according to the AP. Last month, KCTV5 bought a bag of the powder on eBay for $11 and noted that it was "uniquely labeled [with warnings] compared to other brands found." The seller explained to the station that he gets the powder from China and said, "We sell it with ample warning, and we provide a dosing spoon. I think a lot of people misuse it when they purchase it. There is no instruction on how to use it." The Stiners have been working to get the FDA to ban the powder, which is currently unregulated since it's considered a supplement; a petition they created has more than 6,000 signatures.

summarize: The Associated Press announced Wednesday that it has ended its relationship with Narciso Contreras, a Pulitzer Prize-winning freelance photographer who altered a photo that he took last September in Syria.      The alteration in question: "The removal of a video camera seen in a corner of a frame showing a Syrian opposition fighter taking cover during a clash with government forces."

In the original image (top photo), a fellow journalist's video camera is visible on the ground in the left corner of the frame.      The Associated Press said Wednesday one of its photographers admitted to altering a photo taken last year during the war in Syria and pulled all of his images from its wires.      According to the news agency, Narciso Contreras recently told editors he had manipulated a photo of a Syrian rebel by "cloning" other pieces of the background and pasting them over a colleague's camera in the frame before sending it to an AP photo desk.      While the AP does allow photographers to use software to lighten or darken photos, only "minor adjustments in Photoshop are acceptable," its ethics policy states.      The freelance photographer, who shared a Pulitzer Prize for his images of the war, said the photo was the only one he had manipulated.      "I took the wrong decision when I removed the camera ... I feel ashamed about that," Contreras said. "You can go through my archives and you can find that this is a single case that happened probably at one very stressed moment, at one very difficult situation, but yeah, it happened to me, so I have to assume the consequences."      The AP said it severed ties with the photographer after learning of the manipulation and reexamined 494 other photos shot by Contreras but did not find any other alterations.      The news agency previously pulled a series of photos in 2011 after a photographer was caught altering an image to remove his shadow.      "AP's reputation is paramount and we react decisively and vigorously when it is tarnished by actions in violation of our ethics code," said Vice President and Director of Photography Santiago Lyon. "Deliberately removing elements from our photographs is completely unacceptable and we have severed all relations with the freelance photographer in question.

Vigil, former chief of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Agency, told The Times on Monday.      Vigil, who has been briefed on the investigation, says construction on the tunnel may have begun as early as a year ago, soon after Guzman was sent to Altiplano, a maximum-security prison about 50 miles west of Mexico City.      The secret passage was nearly a mile long and was about 5 feet, 6 inches high, just tall enough for Guzman, who is believed to be 5 feet 5 at most, to stand up.      “Guzman has hired some of the best individuals that deal with mining technology, and he provides them with the resources to buy the best equipment,” Vigil said. “They tailor-made the tunnel for him.”      Guzman escaped from a 20-inch-square opening inside his prison shower and descended about 30 feet to make his way to the mile-long tunnel, which led to a house under construction and surrounded by empty fields.      Photos show the tunnel was reinforced by a wooden frame and contained lights and a ventilation system made out of PVC pipes, Vigil said. Workers also used GPS technology to accurately route the entrance to his cell and a motorcycle-adapted rail system to move the large amounts of dirt being excavated, he said.      It would be difficult to build such an elaborate tunnel without someone finding out. More than 30 prison employees have been detained for questioning.      The second prison escape of the country's most famous drug lord has mortified and embarrassed people in Mexico. In Southern California, home to the largest Mexican community outside of Mexico City, the escape of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman had a certain saw-it-coming quality to it.

SEE MORE VIDEOS      "The tunnel had to cost maybe $5 million. But $5 million to El Chapo would be like $5 to you or I,” Vigil said.      Guzman has become particularly adept at using tunnels and secret passageways to evade authorities – and to run his estimated $1-billion drug cartel.      “Guzman has always utilized tunnels, primarily to funnel tons of drugs into the U.S. consumer market,” Vigil said. His Sinaloa cartel, Mexico’s largest and most lucrative trafficker of heroin, cocaine and marijuana, is believed to control a network of hundreds of miles of tunnels and drainage systems along the U.S.-Mexico border.      Last year, as officials closed in on Guzman, he slipped down a hydraulic-powered escape hatch in the bottom of a bathtub and fled through the vast sewer and drainage system underneath the city of Culiacan. He was on the lam for several more weeks before the Mexican marines captured him in Mazatlan.      “I’m sure that he had already surveyed the drainage system in the event that he had to make an escape,” Vigil said. “Chapo Guzman does not leave anything to chance.”      For more than two decades, federal authorities have been uncovering tunnels that have driven the transnational drug trade near the U.S. border. More than 150 such tunnels have been discovered along the United States’ southwestern border since the early 1990s, according to U.S. officials.      Since 2006, more than 80 sophisticated tunnels have been uncovered, including about 25 near San Diego.      One of the first tunnels was discovered in 1990 and was relatively small but sophisticated: a 270-foot passageway that began under a pool table in a Mexican luxury home and terminated near a border crossing in Douglas, Ariz.      A hidden switch in the home, owned by Mexican businessman Rafael Francisco Camarena, activated a hydraulic system that hoisted the pool table and a concrete slab high into the air, revealing a narrow shaft that extended 30 feet below the ground. The 5-foot-tall tunnel featured concrete reinforcement, side rooms, electrical outlets, lights and a pump to keep it free of water. It was lined with compartments that could store up to 5 tons of cocaine, and a trolley was used to move the drugs along the passage.      At the time, the tunnel was estimated to have cost $1.5 million.      In 2010, two underground passages were found within a block of each other in a San Diego warehouse district, leading authorities to seize a total of 45 tons of marijuana. The second passageway was lined with tongue-and-groove wooden boards that provided a level surface for a cart-and-rail system; its other end was in the kitchen of a Tijuana home.      In 2011, U.S. officials discovered a 600-yard tunnel, with an elevator, wooden flooring and an electric cart-and-rail system, terminating in a produce warehouse just north of the border in San Diego. They seized 32 tons of marijuana, one of the largest drug busts in U.S. history.      On the Mexican side, the tunnel opening was hidden in a building on the edge of the runway at the Tijuana International Airport, and the passageway ran directly under the runway where planes regularly took off.      Jose Sanchez-Villalobos, one of the top members of the Sinaloa cartel, was linked to that tunnel in 2012, in addition to a 2,200-foot tunnel discovered in 2010.      Last year, Glennys Rodriguez, a 73-year-old Chula Vista, Calif., woman, was arrested on suspicion of overseeing the construction of a 600-yard tunnel that ended in an industrial park in San Diego’s Otay Mesa area. It was secured with wooden trusses and equipped with lighting and a crude rail system, as well as a pulley system to help hoist packages from 70 feet below ground.      Later that week, authorities in Mexico discovered a second tunnel just around the corner from the first. It was larger and more sophisticated, with ventilation and a multi-tiered electrical rail system.      And this year, U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered a trafficking tunnel west of the San Ysidro border crossing after a sinkhole gave away its location. The tunnel, which was unfinished, started in Tijuana but never opened onto American soil.      Times staff writers Joseph Serna, Richard Marosi and Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this report.

(Associated Press)      As authorities hunted Monday for any sign of Mexico's most powerful drug lord, it was clear that Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman's escape must have involved inside help on a grand scale.      Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said as much Monday night. He announced that three prison officials had been fired, including Valentin Cardenas, director of the facility known as Altiplano, a maximum security prison 55 miles (90 kilometers) west of Mexico City.      "They had something or a lot to do with what happened, and that's why we made that decision," Osorio Chong said.      Still, he did not say who exactly is suspected of aiding the escape.      The prison has the same high-security standards as those in the U.S. and Canada, he said, and Guzman was given extra surveillance, including a tracking bracelet, although it worked only inside the prison.      Osorio Chong said the 1.5-kilometer (1-mile) tunnel had been dug 19 meters (about 62 feet) below the surface and called it a "high-tech" breach of the prison's extensive security measures, including 750 cameras and 26 security filters.      The Mexican government announced that it is offering a 60 million-peso ($3.8 million) reward for Guzman's recapture. An Interpol alert was sent to 10 countries and at least 49 people have been questioned by the government's organized crime unit, including 34 prison employees.      A tunnel of such sophistication — with lights, air venting, and a customized motorcycle rigged up on a rail line — would normally take 18 months to two years to complete, said Jim Dinkins, former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations.      "When it's for the boss, you probably put that on high speed," he said.      If anyone was capable of pulling off such a feat, it was Guzman, who is believed to have at least a quarter-century of experience in building large, sophisticated tunnels to smuggle drugs under the U.S.-Mexico border and to escape from hideouts as authorities closed in.      His Sinaloa Cartel also has been most successful in coopting officials, said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Colombia University.      "By far they are the most infiltrated in Mexico's government institutions," he said.      Experts expressed skepticism that such an engineering feat could go on undetected.      Joe Garcia, who retired this year as interim special agent in charge of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego, has extensive experience in tunnel investigations. He said the tunnel at Altiplano was longer than any passage ever found on the U.S.-Mexico border.      To pull off such a feat, rescuers likely had intelligence on the prison even before Guzman was arrested, Dinkins said.      Designers and workers would have needed access to sensitive information such as prison floor plans and alarm and camera systems. And just the noise alone as they bored the final 30-foot (10-meter) vertical shaft directly under the prison to reach Guzman's cell would have generated some attention.      "It's not just like someone took a couple tools, shovels and pickaxes. This is a very sophisticated operation," said Alonzo Pena, a former senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "How could they be there and not hear that construction was going on underneath? It's just impossible."      The area around the prison is a sprawling construction site, with giant water pipes, trenches and excavation crisscrossing the landscape, and that would have made it easy for the tunnel work to go unnoticed, Garcia said.      "It's the removal of dirt and debris that can cause attention," Dinkins said.      An Associated Press reporter who viewed the partially built house where the tunnel ended observed that the dirt level in the yard surrounding the house was 2 feet to 3 feet higher than the rest of the terrain, indicating workers may have just spread dirt around the property rather than haul it out.      Osorio Chong also said much of the excavated dirt, which he described as fine and thin, may simply have been scattered or compacted at the site.      By Monday afternoon, the search for Guzman in the area near the prison had died down dramatically. Road blocks were gone and Federal Police patrols had lightened. Reporters traveled the area unhampered. Flights at the nearby Toluca airport that had been suspended on Sunday were back to normal.      The prison break is the second for Guzman, who infamously fled a different maximum-security facility in 2001. He was on the loose for 13 years before being captured in February 2014 at a condominium overlooking the Pacific in Mazatlan.      He last was seen about 9 p.m. Saturday as he entered the shower area of his cell, where Osorio Chong said there are "blind spots" from the cameras in respect of human rights. After a time without seeing the prisoner, guards went to look for him and found something else entirely — a 20-by-20-inch (50-by-50 centimeter) leading into the tunnel.      ___      Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman reported this story in Almoloya, Mexico, and Elliot Spagat reported from San Diego, California.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| On a warm day in May, members of a blossoming Mexican narco syndicate went on the attack. They blocked more than 30 roads with smoldering tankers, boxing in the city of Guadalajara. In broad daylight, they lit ATMs and banks on fire. When the military came after them, cartel members shot down a helicopter with RPGs and then executed the soldiers inside. It was a brazen and terrifying display of power. “There was panic. No one knew what was going to happen next,” says Pedro Guerrero Haro, a forensics investigator who ended up sorting through the mess.      As authorities across North America embark on an epic manhunt for Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the kingpin better known as El Chapo, experts say an even more dangerous figure is on the loose — one who hasn’t been arrested but who is believed to have orchestrated the bloody siege in Guadalajara. His name is Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes — or just El Mencho. Over the past few years, he’s risen to commanding heights in the landscape of Mexican narcotrafficking, rivaling the power El Chapo once had. The cartel he leads has chosen to seize power by any means necessary — including, apparently, rocket launchers. “He’s the top crime boss right now in Mexico,” according to Tristan Reed, a Mexican security analyst for the global intelligence firm Stratfor.      It takes a certain brilliance to map your way in today’s drug wars, in which erratic and ever-shifting narco networks battle it out in ever more brutal fashion. While the federales have had mixed success in recent years picking off the jefes — the catch-and-release saga of El Chapo is a case in point — even their victories have a downside, in that each one basically creates a power vacuum. A gaggle of smaller cartels are fighting to fill it, wreaking havoc on Mexico’s streets as they compete for market share. The stakes have only grown as the drug supply chain has extended from the U.S. to China to Europe.      All this chaos and change has given El Mencho his chance: He’s shown a foxlike dexterity for adapting to circumstance, whether it’s switching allegiances or moving to meth from heroin — all while going unseen. Indeed, while he hasn’t gotten much press outside Mexico, El Mencho and his Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación have expanded territory from coast to coast, becoming the most global of all the Mexican suppliers. “He’s different from some who might want to be feared but aren’t trying to build a territorial dynasty,” says Everard Meade, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. A businessman with a military mindset, El Mencho has focused on tightening and lengthening his supply chain, and demolishing competitors or anyone else who might get in the way.      Nearly as much lore as substance, the kingpin is rumored to be a former police officer originally from Aguililla city or Uruapan, both in Michoacán. The United States Treasury Department, which froze his assets in April, says El Mencho did time in U.S. prison for conspiracy to distribute heroin. Otherwise, he’s managed to evade the authorities, unlike his 24-year-old son, El Menchito, who’s been arrested three times now. Yet even those who’ve studied El Mencho closely can’t agree on his first name; some say it’s Nemesio, others Ruben. The law enforcement background would make sense, though, experts say, given his precise tactics and willingness to wage war against the government. Which, by the way, he seems to be winning.      About 60,000 people were murdered in Mexico between 2006 and 2012, according to Human Rights Watch.      The Mexican drug trade has long existed, of course, but the past 15 years have seen a deadly shift in the balance of power. When Mexico had a one-party political system, the government could more easily set the terms with cartels, Meade says. Typically, the exchange went like this: The government promised to leave cartels alone so long as its agents got their cut. But in 2000, the political system opened up to multiple parties, giving cartels more leverage. Instead of the government taxing the drug runners, it’s now the other way around: “The cartels set the terms,” says Meade. And their use of violence has shifted too. Murder is no longer a way of shielding the black market from public view; it’s become a tool “to terrify local governments and people into submission,” Meade says. According to numbers from Human Rights Watch, about 60,000 people were murdered in Mexico between 2006 and 2012, a death toll El Mencho is only accelerating.      Not long before the helicopter incident, his men assassinated 15 Jalisco police officers, according to Mexican authorities. A YouTube search produces gruesome videos of killing and torture that CJNG takes credit for. One, which was recently taken down, showed a father and his teenage son wrapped in explosives; they detonate the kid first so dad can watch. When businesses don’t pay their “taxes,” it’s a grenade through the front door, residents of Guadalajara say. Yet nothing compares to when El Mencho’s CJNG allegedly killed 35 members of Los Zetas, a rival gang, several years ago. Before killing their victims, cartel members tortured them, cutting off ears and limbs. The victims’ mutilated bodies were dumped on the highway at rush hour, news reports said.      As the past few years have shown, fighting the cartels is a deadly game of whack-a-mole. Take down El Chapo’s Sinaloa cartel and a new, more heinous monster rises in its place. Indeed, El Mencho has seemed to learn from the mistakes of his high-profile predecessor, remaining a shadow in an already dark underworld. And as the authorities renew their chase of El Chapo, El Mencho will likely recede further — and flourish. Turns out, says Reed, “El Chapo’s escape may have bought El Mencho some more time to remain at-large.” ||||| MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's most notorious drug trafficker began plotting to break out of prison almost immediately after his recapture at a seaside resort in February 2014.

A widespread manhunt that included... (Associated Press)      Internal Drug Enforcement Administration documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal that drug agents first got information in March 2014 that various family members and drug-world associates of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman were considering "potential operations to free Guzman."      The DEA alerted Mexican authorities 16 months ago about the plans, said a U.S. official briefed on the investigation. The official was not authorized to disclose the details and insisted on anonymity to do so.      Mexican Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong denied Monday night that authorities in Mexico were ever informed of potential escapes.      "They themselves have told us that they don't know where that information came from," he said referring to U.S. counterparts and the AP's report.      The Mexican government announced that it is offering a 60 million-peso ($3.8 million) reward for Guzman's recapture and that it has fired three prison system officials, including the director of the prison where Guzman escaped. Forty-nine people have been questioned by the government's organized crime unit, including 32 prison employees.      Widely considered the world's richest and most powerful drug trafficker before his capture last year, Guzman slipped down a shaft from his prison cell's shower area late Saturday and disappeared into a sophisticated mile-long (1.5 kilometer-long) tunnel with ventilation, lighting and a motorcycle apparently used to move dirt.      The DEA documents indicate U.S. agents did not have information about Saturday night's escape, which was the second time Guzman has fled from one of Mexico's highest security prisons.      But the documents revealed that in March 2014 agents in Los Angeles reported a possible escape operation funded by Rafael Caro-Quintero, who helped orchestrate the 1985 kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena. That plot involved threatening or bribing prison officials. The same investigation revealed four months later that Guzman's son had sent a team of lawyers and military counter-intelligence personnel to design a break-out plan.      In December of that year, agents in the DEA's Houston Field Division reported that a Mexican army general stated "that a deal was in place to release both Guzman-Loera and imprisoned Los Zetas Cartel leader Miguel Angel 'Z-40' Trevino-Morales."      The DEA documents obtained by the AP do not include details of how the previous escape plots would be carried out. In them, Guzman is identified as Guzman-Loera.      A widespread manhunt that included highway checkpoints, stepped up border security and closure of an international airport failed to turn up any trace of Guzman.      Since the 1990s his violent and powerful cartel has been known for digging sophisticated smuggling tunnels under the U.S. border with Mexico. Guzman was first arrested in 1993 but escaped in Jalisco from one of Mexico's top-security prisons in January 2001. He evaded capture in early February 2014 through an elaborate network of tunnels that connected multiple safe houses in Culiacan, in his home state of Sinaloa. He was arrested in the resort city of Mazatlan later that month.      Jim Dinkins, the former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit, said Guzman's history of tunneling makes Saturday's escape "really ingenious." The sophisticated tunnel described by Mexican authorities would usually take about 18 to 24 months to complete, Dinkins said, suggesting it was started almost immediately after Guzman's arrest in 2014.      The White House said Monday that U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke with Mexico's attorney general the day after the escape was discovered. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. government has offered its full support to Mexico. He pointed out that Guzman has also been charged with serious crimes in the U.S.      State Department spokesman John Kirby said Guzman's "swift recapture by Mexican authorities is a priority for both the Mexican and the U.S. governments."      Along with the 2014 escape plans, the DEA documents reveal Guzman was still directing facets of his drug empire.      "Despite being imprisoned in a 'high security' facility, DEA reporting further indicates Guzman-Loera was able to provide direction to his son and other cartel members via the attorneys who visited (him) in prison and possibly through the use of a cellphone provided ... by corrupt prison guards," the documents stated.      Following Guzman's capture in 2014, according to the documents, his son Ivan Guzman-Salazar became "the de facto leader of the Guzman branch of the Sinaloa Cartel." Guzman's "right-hand man, Damaso Lopez-Nunez," took over one of the four major trafficking organizations that operated under the auspices of the larger Sinaloa Cartel.      ___      Associated Press writer Alicia A.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      There was a gap of roughly 50 minutes between the time he was last seen Saturday night, when a prison guard gave him his daily medicine, to the moment when he was no longer visible on the internal video camera system, according to the Mexican national security commission.      Monte Alejandro Rubido, the head of the commission, said Sunday an alert was sent out at 8:52 p.m. and when guards went to his cell, they found a small opening in the shower area of his cell.      Photos have been released from the apparent escape route, but not inside the shower facility where an opening that is 2 square feet is believed to be through which the kingpin escaped, Rubido said.      Eduardo Verdugo/AP Photo      Attorney Generals Office/Reuters      From there, a ladder led to a tunnel that Rubido said was made out of PVC pipe that was just about as tall as Guzman himself, roughly 5-foot-6.      The tunnel extended for about a mile underground and featured an adapted motorcycle on rails that officials believe was used to transport the tools used to create the tunnel, Rubido said.      The photos show the tunnel extending into a home outside of the prison's property and there was a similarly small exit found in the floor of one of the building's rooms where the drug lord is believed to have left the tunnel and entered the free world.      Manuel Velasquez/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images      Attorney Generals Office/Reuters      As "World News Tonight" will report this evening, the half-built house in the Mexican cornfields from where Guzman is believed to have emerged was only under construction for the past five to six months, according to local gas delivery men who supply gas to all the homes in the neighborhood. The developers of the apparent escape house never requested any gas. But the building equipment never seemed unusual because the house was under construction.      There have been no reported sightings or publicized leads in the first day and a half of searching for Guzman, making this his second-known escape from a maximum security prison in Mexico.      Marco Ugarte/AP Photo      The first incident came in 2001 when he escaped from a different prison, and while few details have been confirmed in that case, he is believed to have gotten help from prison guards.      On Saturday night, 18 guards from the Altiplano maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juarez, where the most recent escape occurred, were being questioned. |||||	– Within days of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman's arrival at a maximum security prison in Mexico—and perhaps even earlier—work began on the mile-long tunnel he would eventually use to escape, a former drug enforcement official tells the Los Angeles Times. At 5 feet 6 inches high, the tunnel appears to have been made for the 5-foot-5 Guzman, who likely spent $5 million on mining experts and the best equipment for its construction, the ex-official says. But the tunnel could hardly have gone unnoticed, particularly as work began on the 30-foot shaft beneath Guzman's prison shower, from which he would disappear. Officials have the unsurprising suspicion that he had inside help. More: Officials have questioned 49 people, including 34 prison workers regarding the escape. Three have been fired, including the prison director, the AP reports. DEA documents show US agents were aware of a possible escape plan back in March 2014, the AP notes. Officials say they informed Mexican authorities, who argue they were never told of a possible breakout. Officials say Guzman escaped down a 20-by-20-inch hole in his shower, off-limits to prison cameras, then fled down the tunnel, coming out at a nearby home which had been under construction for five to six months, a local says, per ABC News. An AP reporter notes dirt in the yard reached 2 to 3 feet higher than in other nearby areas, suggesting dirt from the tunnel was spread around the property. Once out of the prison, Guzman's tracking bracelet would have been useless. So where is he now? According to taunting photos posted on El Blog del Narco, purportedly leaked by Guzman's son, the drug lord is enjoying life on the outside. They show Guzman drinking a beer and in the cockpit of a plane, reports the New York Daily News. At least one official, however, believes they could be part of a hoax. Meanwhile, Ozy reports about a cartel boss it describes as "worse than El Chapo."
summarize:      People react after a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin was toppled by protesters during a rally organized by pro-Ukraine supporters in the center of the eastern Ukrainian town of Kharkiv. (Reuters)      In an incident reflecting growing Ukrainian anger toward the Kremlin, anti-Russian protesters pulled down a massive Vladimir Lenin statue in Ukraine's second-largest city late Sunday. To many Ukrainians, Lenin is a symbol of the Soviet Union and Russia's aggressive support for the separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.      Despite the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union which resulted in the split between Russia and Ukraine, hundreds of monuments to the founder of modern Russia survived the transition. Over the last months, however, many have been toppled: This map – based on accounts of activists -- shows the massive demolition of Ukrainian Lenin monuments in 2014 alone.      "To many Ukrainians, Lenin represents not only the communist regime, but also radical separation from Europe and Western civilization more broadly," Steven Fish, a Russian studies professor at University of California Berkeley, told the Los Angeles Times last December after a statue had been toppled in Kiev.      Other scholars view the toppling in a more modern light. Sasha Senderovich, assistant professor of Russian Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder who wrote a New York Times op-ed on this issue last December, considers Sunday's event not to be connected to Lenin specifically. "At this point, after Putin's assault on Ukraine's territorial integrity, the statue has become more symbolic of Russia's continued attempt to exercise imperial dominance over Ukraine rather than solely the historical legacy of the Soviet Union," he told The Post on Monday.      Kharkiv is considered one of the most vulnerable cities in the east if the pro-Russian rebellion were to spread. Previous attempts to pull down the statue failed because pro-Russian activists intervened, according to The Post's Michael Birnbaum.      These pictures show that Sunday's incident was clearly organized and must have been noticed. First, protesters cut the Lenin statue's legs.      Then, they pulled the statue down.      In fact, the recent toppling of the Lenin statue is just the latest in a series of attacks on hundreds of others that have been toppled in Ukraine over the last months as tensions with Russia have grown. Here is an alternative chronology of Ukraine's crisis, told through toppled Lenin statues.      A measurement of anger      Tearing down the iconic Lenin monuments rapidly gained momentum when it became clear that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had lost power over his country.      On Feb. 20, Kiev witnessed its worst day of violence in 70 years, with snipers targeting and killing protesters. On Feb. 22, Yanukovych disappeared, protesters stormed presidential buildings and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was freed from jail. Data gathered by Ukrainian activists and visualized by The Washington Post show that more than 90 Lenin statues were toppled that day alone.      The activists uploaded pictures, dates and locations of the toppled statues on a platform called Leninopad and the individual contributions could not be independently verified.      How the 'statue war' spread      The visualizations below are based on the same data. Until Feb. 21 (the day before Yanukovych disappeared), the incidents appear to have largely been limited to the surrounding areas of Kiev where the pro-Western supporters had been in an overwhelming majority.            Map: Gene Thorp/ Lazaro Gamio, The Washington Post. Data: Leninopad.      Then, however, the number of toppled Lenin statues quickly increased and spread throughout the country. The statues which were toppled earlier are shown in grey in the map below. It is important to note that not all defaced monuments in Crimea and the east are included in this map, because the activists did not provide a sufficient amount of date for some of them.      However, there appears to be a general lack of incidents both in the east (where the Ukrainian Russian speakers are predominantly located), as well as in the west. The latter observation is surprising because the western areas are the ones which are least supportive of Russia.      One possible explanation could be that Lenin statues in the west had been removed much earlier: Back in June 2009, pro-Western Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had called upon his supporters to erase communist symbols from the country.            Map: Gene Thorp/ Lazaro Gamio, The Washington Post. Data: Leninopad.      This map shows more recent incidents until August, but it is not clear whether the activists kept track of the toppling of Lenin statues during this time frame in the same manner as they did in February and March.            Map: Gene Thorp/ Lazaro Gamio, The Washington Post. Data: Leninopad.      Our maps only include Lenin statues toppled in 2014. However, they have been a target for much longer, as part of a larger fight between pro-Russian activists and nationalists. Last August 2013, Russian news agency RIA Novosti specified that at least 12 Lenin statues had been pulled down or defaced since 2009, calling the incidents a "statue war."      According to The Atlantic, an advertisement video for the Euro 2012 soccer championships in Kharkiv erased a Lenin statue from a shot -- it appears to have been the very same statue which was pulled down Sunday evening and is unlikely to be the last such incident.      In a Facebook post, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov wrote on Monday: “Lenin? Let him fall down. As long as nobody suffers under his weight. As long as this bloody Communist idol does not take more victims with it when it goes." ||||| Most of the massive statue of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin that a crowd in Kharkiv toppled last week still lies where it landed in the city’s central Freedom Square. And no wonder. The statue - reputed to be the largest in Ukraine - is 8.5m tall, and weighs several tonnes.      But in recent days, body parts have begun appearing for sale. A nose here, an ear there, plus hints that there are more if collectors want them.      One seller in Kharkiv recently showed the Lenin statue’s nose – 36cm wide, 36cm long and about 25cm high – to RFE/RL’s Ukraine Service and other media in the city.      Wearing a ski mask and identifying himself only as “Oleksiy”, he said he was ready to sell the nose to anyone who will make a sizeable contribution to Ukrainian volunteers fighting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.      “If there is anyone who says, ‘I am ready, let’s say, to provide a battalion of soldiers with winter underwear and uniforms,’ then we will give him [the nose],” he said. “That is, if no one says, better yet, that he’s ready to provide two battalions with the things I have mentioned.”      Oleksiy says he got the nose when the statue hit the ground face first. The nose – including bridge, both nostrils, and moustache beneath – split off, and he and his companions lugged it away.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest An unidentified protester holds the cut off nose of the statue of Vladimir Lenin after it was toppled. Photograph: Sergei Kozlov/EPA      At the same time Oleksiy is trying to sell the nose, another seller is offering one of Lenin’s ears.      The ear is up for auction on Facebook by Aleksandr Makarenko, a Ukrainian from Kharkiv who says he, too, is raising money for Ukrainian forces.      “The money collected will go toward a thermal camera for the Kharkiv-1 battalion,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “Make me an offer. The ear weighs close to 35 kilograms. You can hear Donbas through it.”      Whether those selling pieces of Lenin can do so without fear of prosecution is an open question.      When the crowd pulled down the statue on the night of 28 September, sawing through one of Lenin’s legs and using cables to pull him off his pedestal, the city’s police looked on impassively.      Chanting “glory to Ukraine” and waving Ukrainian flags, the crowd toppled with impunity a symbol of the Soviet Union that had towered over Freedom Square since 1967.      But the day after the statue was toppled, Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes gave an angry press conference in which he branded the crowd’s actions “illegal” and vowed to put Lenin up again.      “We will restore it on Liberty Square on the same podium,” he said. “If there is no way to restore it, then we will make [a new one] from scratch.”      He also said he was ordering the police to hunt down those who had “barbarically destroyed” city property.      As Kharkiv’s mayor, Kernes has straddled the pro-Kiev and pro-Russian camps in his city in a risky balancing act that already has nearly cost him his life.      On 28 April he was shot in the back by an unknown gunman as he was jogging and now uses a wheelchair.       |||||	– Lenin must be thrilled with this: Not only did protesters in Ukraine tear down a huge statue of him, they're using old-fashioned capitalism to make some money off it. The 28-foot-tall statue came down last weekend in the eastern city of Kharkiv, and now pieces of it are going up for auction, reports the Guardian. Interested in the former Soviet leader's nose, with mustache still attached? An anti-Russian fighter named Olesky awaits your bid. How about an ear? See Aleksandr Makarenko's Facebook page for details. The catch in both examples: Proceeds will go to Ukrainian troops fighting pro-Russian forces. “If there is anyone who says, ‘I am ready, let’s say, to provide a battalion of soldiers with winter underwear and uniforms,’ then we will give him [the nose],” says Olesky. “That is, if no one says, better yet, that he’s ready to provide two battalions with the things I have mentioned.” The ear, meanwhile, will pay for a "thermal camera" for the troops. As the Washington Post explains in both story and graphics, a huge number of Lenin monuments have come down in Ukraine in this year alone, even if there's disagreement about the exact symbolism involved.
summarize: A fatal shooting by Chicago police Saturday afternoon fueled a violent clash between officers and a large crowd of onlookers who threw bottles and rocks as cops swung back with batons.      After the fracas, a comparatively peaceful protest at the Grand Crossing police station stretched into Sunday morning.      The shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. at 2098 E. 71st St., and it took police about five hours to bring things under control. Some people screamed “murderers” as officers lined up against them. Some in the crowd held cameras up to take video, while others behind them threw rocks and glass bottles, some filled with urine.      As officers tried to contain the crowd, some of them dragged people to the ground or struck them with batons. Other officers held batons over their heads to ward off people yelling at them.      “You violent mother-------,” one woman in the crowd screamed.      A Sun-Times reporter said he was hit by officers who rushed a parking lot. “I have my press badge on and identified myself as a reporter, but I got shoved to the ground by two cops who smacked my phone out of my hand,” tweeted Nader Issa.      Around 10:30 p.m., chief Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said officers had “cleared the crime scene.”      “Four officers were injured from rocks and thrown bottles,” he said. “Four demonstrators were arrested.” Two squad cars sustained minor damage.      Misdemeanor charges were pending Sunday morning against one of the demonstrators, said Officer Ronald Westbrooks, a Chicago police spokesman.      “There were glass bottles thrown … plastic water bottles. Bottles filled with urine were thrown at officers,” Guglielmi said.      The shooting occurred after patrol officers on foot saw a man who was “exhibiting characteristics of an armed person,” Guglielmi said. “He looked like he may have something on him. They go to question him, and at that point a confrontation ensues and he is shot.”      He had no details of the confrontation but said the man suffered several gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at Jackson Park Hospital. A gun and two ammunition magazines were recovered, Guglielmi said.      Antoine Howell, 42, said he worked with the man at the same barbershop for about three years and during that time had come to admire the man’s attitude. The man was supposed to attend Howell’s bachelor party Saturday night. He had just given Howell a haircut in preparation for the celebration, then had headed out to buy cigarettes and change his clothes, Howell said.      “He cut my hair and got killed 10 minutes later,” Howell said. “I'm hurt. ... I gotta go on with my life, but I loved that man.”      An hour and a half after he was shot, a crowd swelled to about 150 people at 71st Street and Chappel Avenue. Officers lined up to block the area off. The crowd was kept back near the parking lot of the Jeffery Plaza strip mall with a Walgreens and other businesses.      About 7:40 p.m., officers tried to move the crowd farther away by repositioning yellow police tape, which angered the crowd. People began pushing and shoving, flipping off police and chanting “murderers’’ as they moved backward, some of them losing their flip-flops and keys.      At least one officer fell down. Some officers drew their batons, holding them horizontally, as they pushed. The clash grew progressively more heated, ending with officers running through the crowd, hitting some people and making arrests.      Guglielmi blamed “inaccurate information” for inciting the crowd.      “There was some inaccurate information that the individual was unarmed,” he said. “We have cops out there, community affairs officers, trying to give them as much information as we can. ... There were some members of the community who were upset. This is a tragic situation where an individual lost his life.’’      Guglielmi said the initial encounter between officers and the man, and possibly the shooting, was captured by body cameras and police surveillance video.      As is routine, the officer who fired will be placed on 30-day desk duty while the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigates.      As word traveled that demonstrators were on their way to the Grand Crossing, or 3rd District, police station, officers set up barricades along the sidewalk and formed a human wall in front of the station’s entrance yards behind.      Protesters and onlookers trickled in. Then, about 9:55 p.m., the main march arrived, led by a man waving a large black flag. The group of as many as 200 people included police reformists, Black Lives Matter organizers, Citizen Police Accountability Council members and independent citizens who said they simply cared that police had shot another black man.      Over the course of the next three hours, their chants included “No justice, no peace,” “Ain’t no justice in this town,” “How you spell racist? CPD” and “Cops and crime go hand in hand.” Legal observers with the National Lawyers Guild wore bright green baseball-style hats, hanging back and keeping an eye on the demonstration.      Police did not come up to the barrier line or engage the protesters, maintaining their position near the district’s entrance as crowd members passed around a megaphone and addressed them from the street side of the boundary. One woman said her father had been a 3rd District cop, and she wanted them to know she didn’t hate the police. But she urged them to rethink their training and not send officers into neighborhoods where they’re afraid of the people.      Trina Porter, who lives less than a half-mile away from the scene of the shooting, said she felt afraid when police started “getting aggressive,” but she wanted to stay because she believed the officer who shot the man was wrong and because her nephew, James Hartsfield, was killed in a police shooting last year in Arkansas.      “We want justice,” Porter said. “We just went through that.”      Porter also knew the barber who was killed from the four years she lived on Euclid Avenue, near the barbershop where he worked. She just knew him as “Snoop.” He’d come around the corner, sit on her porch and talk to her fiance, she said.      “Right now a lot of people are upset, a lot of people are frustrated, they’re emotional,” said community activist Lamon Reccord, 19. “When this is all over, they’re going to look back and start thinking. … We act with our emotions and think about it later.”      Around midnight, Maria Hernandez, 27, took the megaphone and addressed those who remained, telling them not to leave without a partner and promoting a community meeting at 1 p.m. Sunday on 63rd Street in between Greenwood Avenue and South University Avenue. ||||| Authorities identify man fatally shot by CPD officer in South Shore      Authorities have identified a man who was fatally shot Saturday afternoon during a confrontation with a Chicago Police officer in the South Shore neighborhood.      About 5:30 p.m., officers on foot saw “a man exhibiting characteristics of an armed person” in the 2000 block of East 71st Street and a “confrontation” ensued when they tried to question him, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.      An officer then opened fire, striking 37-year-old Harith Augustus, according to Guglielmi and Frank Shuftan, a spokesman for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Augustus was taken to Jackson Park Hospital and pronounced dead at 5:50 p.m.      He lived in the South Shore neighborhood, less than a mile from where he was killed, Shuftan said. An autopsy was scheduled for Sunday.      No officers were hurt, and a weapon was recovered at the scene along with several magazines of ammunition, Gugliemi said. Though Guglilmi initially told the Chicago Sun-Times that Augustus didn’t have a valid FOID card or a concealed carry license, CPD Supt. Eddie Johnson later said at a news conference that Augustus had a valid FOID.      At the press conference at 3:15 p.m. Sunday, Johnson discussed the decision to release footage captured on the officer’s body camera, which Guglielmi said was “in the interest of transparency & to dispel [sic] inaccurate information.”      In the interest of transparency & to dispell inaccurate information, #ChicagoPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson has ordered the early release of body-worn camera video in yesterday's officer-Involved shooting.

Several officers were hurt by rocks and bottles that were hurled at them.      Four people were detained during the melee, Guglielmi said. Three felony charges were pending against one of the protesters, while the others were likely detained and released without being formally arrested.

People outside the crime scene after the shooting claimed a female officer shot the man at least five times in the back as he ran away, and that the officer was taken away from the scene in a police vehicle afterward as the crowd formed.      Contrary to those reports, Guglielmi said the officer who shot Augustus was a male.      Dozens of officers were called to help control a tense scene as more than 100 people crowded around, chanting at police, “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?”      Tension boiled over about 7:30 p.m. as police tried to push protesters back from the scene, with officers hitting at least six people with batons and some protesters punching back.      The situation just severely escalated when Chicago Police officers moved their line forward. Officers hit multiple protestors with batons, and protesters punched officers back.

Scores of people scattered after police with batons entered a parking lot where protesters were gathered near the scene. Two officers shoved a Chicago Sun-Times reporter to the ground, smacking a cellphone out of his hand.      Here's the rest of the escalation, including multiple Chicago Police officers on top of one man, hitting him, and then dragging another man.

Rainge said she was walking out of a nearby Walgreens store when she saw the officer tell Augustus not to sell loose cigarettes. When Augustus said he wasn’t, the argument escalated and the officer fired as he ran away, Rainge said.      “He was cool, laid back, very intelligent,” Rainge said.      Augustus wasn’t a documented gang member and had no recent arrest history, Guglielmi said.      He was charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery and a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession in three separate incidents over a decade ago, according to Cook County court records. He wasn’t convicted in any of the cases.      Protesters were active at the scene past 10:30 p.m. Police said two squad cars were damaged by people slashing tires and jumping on the vehicles, and that four officers received medical treatment after being hit by rocks and bottles.      “I know that they’re very passionate about things that happen in the community, especially when it’s dealing with police, but it got a little bit out of hand,” Waller said.      Protesters eventually made their way to the 3rd District police station at 70th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue.      “Every time they kill one of us they’re doing an injustice to everybody,” South Sider Aldo Reyes said. “They feel the heat, they know they’re wrong.”      Charlene Carruthers said she was at the scene of the shooting when she was pushed to the ground by an officer.      “It is completely unacceptable for us to pay for them to kill us,” she said.

Protesters threw rocks and bottles at officers and four were arrested as cops struck people with batons and dragged them to the ground. The shooting victim remains unidentified, but locals say he worked at a local barbershop, had a 5-year-old girl, and went by the name "Snoop," per the Chicago Sun-Times. Police accounts differ slightly by the media report, but officers say they encountered the man on foot, confronted him, and when he became combative and reached for a weapon in his pants they opened fire, per CNN. The man was pronounced dead at Jackson Park Hospital. Police say a weapon and several ammo mags were found on him. Gloria Rainge, 41, says she was leaving a Walgreens when she noticed a cop telling the man to stop selling cigarettes. When he denied doing it, their argument heightened and an officer opened fire as the man ran away. "He was cool, laid back, very intelligent," says Rainge. Police rep Anthony Guglielmi says the victim was shot several times, but blames "inaccurate information" for fomenting the crowd. "There was some inaccurate information that the individual was unarmed," he says. "We have cops out there, community affairs officers, trying to give them as much information as we can." Protesters weren't so tranquil: "We just want to live," a woman told reporters. "Our black kids keep getting killed. We just want to live."
summarize: At one surveyed university in upstate New York, 37% of freshmen women reported being the victims of at least one completed or attempted rape between the age of 14 and the start of their sophomore year, according to a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.            Overall, 37% of participants reported experiencing at least one rape or attempted rape between the age of 14 and the beginning of their sophomore year. Overall, 37% of participants reported experiencing at least one rape or attempted rape between the age of 14 and the beginning of their sophomore year.      In the study, rape was defined as "vaginal, oral or anal penetration using threats of violence or use of physical force, or using the tactic of victim incapacitation." Other types of sexual misconduct - such as unwanted touching or verbal abuse - were not included in this definition of rape.      Standardized surveys were completed by 483 female participants who were considered to be demographically representative of the overall freshmen attending the university during 2010. The questionnaires were completed upon arrival on campus, at the end of the fall semester and after the following summer.      "It's an important transition year," says lead and corresponding author Kate Carey, professor of behavioral and social sciences in the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, RI, of the modern rite of passage that is the freshman year.      "People are usually moving away from home for the first time," she continues, "they are experimenting with a lot of freedoms including the use of alcohol and other drugs and learning how to live by themselves. We have a better sense after our research of what are the risks within that first transition year."      Prof. Carey and colleagues found that:      9% of surveyed women reported an attempted or completed forcible rape in the first study year      15.4% reported an attempted or completed rape while incapacitated in the first study year      15.3% of the women disclosed a rape or an attempt of either kind during the fall and spring semesters      Upon arrival on campus, 18% of respondents reported experiencing a rape or attempted rape while incapacitated since the age of 14      15% reported suffering a forcible rape or attempt since age 14      By the beginning of sophomore year, 26% of participants had experienced incapacitated rape and 22% had suffered forcible rape.      Overall, 37% of participants reported experiencing at least one rape or attempted rape between the age of 14 and the beginning of their sophomore year.      Why are women who have previously been raped more at risk?      According to the analysis, women who experienced rape or attempted rape before college were significantly more likely to be raped during freshman year.      Prof. Carey says that the analysis is unable to explain why some women are repeatedly victimized, but the statistical association does suggest that underlying vulnerabilities need to be further researched so that interventions may be effective at helping women at high risk. She adds:      "A substantial number of young women start their college career having already experienced either attempted or completed forcible or incapacitated rape - and that, we know, is a historical and experiential factor that puts them at greater risk for re-victimization and other kinds of adverse outcomes related to drinking and substance use. We really need to be looking earlier to prevent these events."      Prof. Carey considers the prevalence of rape described in the study to be at "epidemic levels." She believes that the issue has remained inadequately assessed and hopes that this research will contribute to rape on campus being recognized as a widespread and serious problem.      "If you swap in any other physically harmful and psychologically harmful event, a prevalence of 15% would be just unacceptably high," Prof. Carey says. "If, for instance, 15% of our young people were breaking their legs in their first year of school, we would expect that the community would do something to enhance the safety of the environment."      Written by David McNamee ||||| PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] -- Beginning in the fall when they arrived on campus and continuing through the following summer, 18.6 percent of freshmen women surveyed at a university in upstate New York in 2010 endured at least one -- completed or attempted rape, according to a new study that is the is the first to examine the risk of sexual attack on first-year women in detail.      "It's an important transition year," said lead and corresponding author Kate Carey, professor of behavioral and social sciences in the Brown University School of Public Health and Brown's Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies. "People are usually moving away from home for the first time, they are experimenting with a lot of freedoms including the use of alcohol and other drugs and learning how to live by themselves. We have a better sense after our research of what are the risks within that first transition year."      The study, published online in the Journal of Adolescent Health, is based on questionnaires of 483 participants. It counted self-reports of completed or attempted forcible rape and rape while incapacitated, for instance because of drugs or alcohol. The female students, who were demographically representative of the school's overall freshman class, answered the standardized survey questions when they arrived on campus, at the end of fall semester, at the end of spring semester, and again after the following summer.      The study defined rape as "vaginal, oral, or anal penetration using threats of violence or use of physical force, or using the tactic of victim incapacitation." Thus, the study data do not conflate other forms of sexual misconduct such as unwanted touching or verbal abuse with the incidence of rape.      Over the study year, 9 percent of surveyed women reported an attempted or completed forcible rape and 15.4 percent reported an attempted or completed rape while incapacitated. Some women reported more than one event, which is why those numbers sum to more than the 18.6 percent prevalence of at least one such incident.      During the academic year (fall and spring semesters), 15.3 percent of the women disclosed a rape or an attempt of either kind.      These events in just one year added substantially to the women's cumulative exposure to sexual trauma. Upon entering college, 18 percent of the women surveyed said they had suffered an incapacitated rape or an attempt since age 14, and 15 percent reported suffering a forcible rape or attempt since age 14. By the beginning of sophomore year those figures had risen to 26 percent for incapacitated rape and 22 percent for forcible rape.      All told, 37 percent of the women said they had experienced at least one rape or attempted rape between age 14 and the beginning of sophomore year, according to the data.      "In our sample, by the time they were college sophomores, 37 percent of these women had experienced one or the other kind of rape -- that's over a third of female students," Carey said. "That is remarkable. If I have a class with 25 upperclass women, eight of them may have experienced an event like this and all that can come with it -- increased mental health concerns, difficulty trusting new partners, increased risk of substance misuse to cope, and the risk of getting behind and not doing well in school."      Prevention and counseling      The authors' analysis of the data shows that women who had experienced rape or an attempted rape before college were significantly more likely to experience these events during freshman year. This statistical association does not explain why some women are repeatedly victimized, Carey said, but it points to a need to discover potential underlying vulnerabilities in order to craft an intervention that could help women at higher risk.      "A substantial number of young women start their college career having already experienced either attempted or completed forcible or incapacitated rape -- and that, we know, is a historical and experiential factor that puts them at greater risk for re-victimization and other kinds of adverse outcomes related to drinking and substance use," Carey said. "We really need to be looking earlier to prevent these events."      Although women already victimized were relatively likely to be so again, Carey said, in absolute numbers most of the rape incidents disclosed in the study happened among the vast majority of women who had not been assaulted before. Colleges should develop effective prevention and counseling programs that can serve women with different experiences and histories of rape, she said.      By bringing these statistics to light, Carey said, she hopes rape on campus will come to be regarded as the widespread and serious problem that it is. Carey and her coauthors write that the prevalence of rape incidents is at "epidemic levels."      Although the issue has attained greater public attention lately, she said, it has remained inadequately addressed.      "If you swap in any other physically harmful and psychologically harmful event, a prevalence of 15 percent would be just unacceptably high," Carey said. "If, for instance, 15 percent of our young people were breaking their legs in their first year of school, we would expect that the community would do something to enhance the safety of the environment."      In addition to Carey, the study's other authors are former Brown University undergraduate Sarah Durney, who worked on the project as an honors thesis, Robyn Shepardson of the Syracuse Veterans Affairs Center for Integrated Healthcare, and Michael Carey of The Miriam Hospital and Brown.      ###      A National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism grant (R21-AA018257) to Michael Carey supported the research. |||||	– "Both incapacitated and forcible sexual assaults and rape have reached epidemic levels among college women," reads a study out of Brown University. It finds that nearly one in five—18.6%—college women are the victim of either a completed or attempted rape during their freshman year alone. "It's an important transition year," says lead author Kate Carey of Brown's Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies in a post at Eureka Alert. The study, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, surveyed 483 women in the freshman class of an unnamed college in upstate New York. Among the specifics: 9% reported an attempted or completed forcible rape; 15.4% reported an attempted or completed rape while incapacitated. Some women reported multiple events. 18% had suffered an incapacitated rape or attempt since age 14 and before college; that number was 15% for forcible rape or attempt. By sophomore year, those numbers were 26% and 22%, respectively. Women who were raped before college were more likely to be raped in their freshman year, notes Medical News Today. All told, 37% reported at least one rape or attempted rape between age 14 and sophomore year. "If you swap in any other physically harmful and psychologically harmful event, a prevalence of 15% would be just unacceptably high," says Carey. "If 15% of our young people were breaking their legs in their first year of school, we would expect that the community would enhance the safety of the environment." (Meanwhile, Emma Sulkowicz, who carried a mattress around Columbia University this year in protest of the school's decision not to kick out her alleged rapist, took her mattress to graduation.)
summarize: And The Martian isn’t just an excellent yarn. It’s one of the year’s best movies and widescreen 3D experiences, a crackerjack adventure that celebrates human ingenuity over mechanical contrivance.      This triumphant return to outer space for Scott, who directed Alien and Prometheus, adapts the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, which began as a self-published e-book. (The screenplay is by Drew Goddard, director and co-writer of The Cabin in the Woods, an ingenious horror thriller.)      Matt Damon’s stranded Mars astronaut Mark Watney also has to employ do-it-yourself strategies if he hopes to survive. He’s left alone but not forlorn, after a six-person expedition to the red planet led by Jessica Chastain’s Commander Lewis is forced to make an emergency evacuation.      Lost in a dust storm, Watney is presumed dead. The shock of his miraculous survival quickly turns to sky-high suspense, as NASA and his crewmates contemplate a high-risk rescue mission, one that on paper could take years -- unless they find a way to speed things up.      Houston has more than one problem. Politics and public relations also intrude, as hardnosed NASA chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) considers the very real possibility that a failed rescue bid could result in six dead astronauts rather than one.      Watney must use his wits and science knowledge to buy time. NASA this week announced it has found water on Mars, which seems like a fantastic (and deliberate) promotion for the movie. But that could actually detract from the exceedingly clever and scientifically accurate methods Watney employs to deal with urgent food and water issues. ||||| Photo by Giles Keyte. Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.      A few dozen days (or, as a rotation of the planet is referred to in NASA jargon, “sols”) into his lonely survival ordeal on Mars, the stranded astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) delivers a kind of mission statement into the video log he’s recording for posterity. Faced with the challenge of finding or creating enough food and water to survive the four years until the next mission is scheduled to reach the red planet, Mark decides, with the beleaguered optimism of a born survivor, to “science the shit out of this.”      Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic.      That was pretty much also the strategy of Andy Weir, who wrote the best-selling sci-fi novel on which The Martian is based. Weir, a software engineer and the son of a physicist, put in meticulous research to support his speculations about the viability of, say, indoor agriculture in a Mars habitat (Mark’s eventual, if temporary, solution to the what-to-eat problem). I couldn’t say to what degree Ridley Scott’s adaptation, in turn, sciences the shit out of Weir’s source material. But Scott has, against all odds, broken one of the most fundamental laws of physics: the tendency of systems toward entropy. Scott’s recent films, many of them grand-scale spectacles (Prometheus, Exodus: Gods and Kings) have grown progressively longer, slower, and more ponderous. Now, suddenly, the director has changed course with a movie that, while certainly long—The Martian approaches 2½ hours—feels as bouncy and light as a beach ball.      Advertisement            If that’s not the metaphor you prefer for your sci-fi blockbusters—if you like them on the more philosophically weighty side—then there are plenty of movies out there for you already. The Martian is a nerdy process film about outer space survival, with a boyish indifference to archetypal symbolism (cf. Gravity) or brooding debates about fate and free will (cf. Interstellar). Don’t bother asking Damon’s Mark Watney how he feels about being completely alone on a planet inhospitable to human life, where it’s very likely he’ll starve to death before help can reach him. He’ll simply throw a spade over his shoulder, repair a crack in his helmet with duct tape, and head out to shovel some more good red Mars dirt.      In that dirt—fertilized by the human waste left behind in vacuum-sealed packs by Mark and his former crewmates—he will grow enough potatoes to buy himself a few hundred more sols’ worth of food supply. Meanwhile the Hermes, the spaceship on which Mark was serving as team botanist, is on its way back to earth, its crew members still unaware that their colleague survived the dust storm that forced them to cut their mission short.      Get Slate in your inbox.      The final hour of The Martian is pure hokum, albeit of the most satisfying kind.      As many observers have noted, The Martian isn’t Matt Damon’s first go-round as the sole inhabitant of a hostile alien world: Last year, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar landed the actor in a similar pickle. (Damon has also done his share of plodding through barren desertscapes here on Earth, in Gus Van Sant’s black-comic parable Gerry.) It’s easy to see why Damon would be your go-to stuck-on-a-planet actor. He’s Robinson Crusoe via the Hardy Boys, stalwart without being stolid and hopeful without being (thank God) chipper. And as written by Buffy the Vampire Slayer veteran Drew Goddard—whose touch with snappy dialogue is largely responsible for The Martian’s unexpected buoyancy—Mark Watney is funny, a quality too seldom exhibited by leading men in space. Mark’s ability to see the comic absurdity of his predicament even in moments of extreme peril comes to seem inseparable from his iron will to live, and Damon conveys that connection without ever straining for bathos. The early scenes have an austere one-man show element, with Damon interacting only with the video monitor where he records his log and the harsh Martian environment that constantly threatens to engulf him. (Many exteriors were filmed in the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan, a frequent movie stand-in for the fourth planet from the Sun.)      By about halfway through, though, the solar system of The Martian has gotten pretty crowded. In addition to a following the progress of the Hermes—captained by Jessica Chastain, with a crew that includes Michael Peña and Kate Mara—the audience is gradually introduced to a boatload of supporting characters at NASA’s Houston headquarters: Jeff Daniels as the PR-conscious head of the space program. Chiwetel Ejiofor as the mission director who presses him to prioritize Watney’s rescue once they realize the stranded botanist is still alive. Kristen Wiig as NASA’s snippy director of PR (who, confusingly, has the same first name as her Bridesmaids character, making you wonder how she went from cupcake entrepreneur to aerospace bureaucrat). Donald Glover as an entry-level astrodynamicist with a left-field idea about how to speed up the rescue mission.      The plan for Watney’s rescue may rely on solid science (even if some of the last-minute MacGyvering with tarps and duct tape seems a little sketchy). But dramatically, the final hour of The Martian is pure hokum, albeit of the most satisfying kind. Watney tinkers with the space junk at his encampment to engineer a solar-powered roving vehicle, all to the accompaniment of a left-behind playlist of vintage disco, ABBA, and David Bowie (no, not “Life on Mars,” but something almost as thematically apropos). Back on Earth, the Chinese and the Americans agree to collaborate on an unprecedented international mission to save the stranded astronaut. ||||| Finally! A botanist superhero!      What took you so long, Hollywood?      Ridley Scott’s “The Martian” is arguably the warmest, cuddliest film ever made about the Red Planet, and that’s all the more surprising given Scott’s mastery of beautiful, haunting nearly cold-to-the-touch futuristic movies such as “Blade Runner,” “Alien” and “Prometheus.”      We love those films, but they aren’t exactly warm and fuzzy. “The Martian,” on the other hand, is a hopeful love letter to science and math, American resolve, the power of friendship and the dream of a world in which nations set aside their differences to unite to bring one man home.      It’s also a visual stunner, and it features one of our most likable and dependable actors giving a performance that ranks with anything he’s ever done.      “The Martian” is set in the near future, in a world where NASA apparently has kazillions of dollars, and the third manned (and womaned) mission to Mars has set up camp on the Red Planet and is going about its daily business of collecting samples, monitoring the atmosphere and doing other astronaut-type stuff.      Matt Damon is Mark Watney, a brilliant botanist with a corny sense of humor, undying loyalty to the Cubbies, love of deep-dish pizza — and an explorer’s spirit, as evidenced by his joining the Ares 3 team on this mission. Jessica Chastain is the commander, Kate Mara is the computer expert, Michael Pena is the wisecracking, family man, comic relief astronaut. They’re a neat team, and for the first few scenes, “The Martian” feels like it’s going to be a prototypical ensemble-cast space adventure.      RELATED: Matt Damon tells Roeper the movie’s ‘an antidote’ to divisive politics      But then a massive dust storm hits harder and faster than anticipated, forcing the crew into emergency evacuation mode. Believing Mark has been killed by a flying piece of a communications tower, Cmdr. Lewis tearfully issues the order to take off.      When Mark regains consciousness, he wakes up to a world of hurt (he has a suffered a severe abdominal injury) and the brutal truth of his circumstances: He’s injured, he’s alone, he has no means of communication and a limited supply of food, and he is almost certainly going to die on Mars.      Not that Mark is the type to give up. “I’m going to have to science the s— out of this,” he says in his running video diary, and in one case he means that literally.      Damon strikes just the right notes of comedy, nerdy tech talk, moments of despair and triumph. Mark cannot believe the music library of Cmdr. Lewis (it’s heavy on cheesy 1970s tunes), or the nerdy video games left behind. When he builds a greenhouse of sorts and successfully engineers actual plant growth, he hops around with glee, calls himself the first Martian and says, “In your face, Neil Armstrong.”      And when he miraculously hears from his crew, he’s overcome with emotion.      “The Martian” is three movies in one:      • The primary story of Mark’s solo adventures on Mars, where he tries to grow food, establish communication, repair a transportation vehicle and simply survive.      • Cmdr. Lewis and crew on the ship, well on the way home, and the decision they’ll have to make when they learn their friend is alive.      • A tense thriller of sorts back on Earth. Jeff Daniels is perfectly cast as the head of NASA, who wonders if it’s worth risking lives and spending untold millions to save one man. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the NASA scientist and Sean Bean is the home-base chief of the Ares 3 crew, and in their own ways, both answer yes. Welcome faces such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Benedict Wong and Mackenzie Davis have small but pivotal roles.      All three stories work, though we get a few too many scenes of the scientists on Earth saying they need six months to build this or that, only to be told it has to be done in two months, now get to work! (Overall, though, even with a running time of 2 hours, 21 minutes, “The Martian” moves along at a steady clip.)      Damon is terrific. The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene.      Chastain is her usual brilliant self in a smallish role, Ejiofor is the guy we’re rooting for to get it done on Earth, and Sean Bean brings that Ned Stark/Boromir nobility to his performance.      You look at the names in this cast and you’d be correct in assuming this is going to be one helluva fun movie to watch.      Twentieth Century Fox presents a film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Drew Goddard, based on the book by Andy Weir. Running time: 141 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for some strong language, injury images, and brief nudity). Opens Friday at local theaters. |||||	– Matt Damon plays a botanist-astronaut stuck on Mars while NASA debates whether to risk six lives in an attempt to save one in The Martian. It seems to be a winner, with a 93% favorable rating from both fans and critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: Peter Howell says the film is "out of this world." Not only does Matt Damon deliver a performance worthy of Oscar attention, but he does so in "one of the year's best movies and widescreen 3D experiences, a crackerjack adventure that celebrates human ingenuity over mechanical contrivance," Howell writes at the Toronto Star. He adds the flick is "'real-fi' rather than 'sci-fi,' because it's so down-to-Earth in its realism." The film is "a hopeful love letter to science and math, American resolve, the power of friendship, and the dream of a world in which nations set aside their differences to unite to bring one man home," writes Richard Roeper at the Chicago Sun-Times. The entire cast is strong, but "Damon strikes just the right notes of comedy, nerdy tech talk, moments of despair, and triumph," he writes. "The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene." If director Ridley Scott was aiming for a good time, "mission accomplished," writes Adam Graham at the Detroit News. But at almost 2.5 hours, the film is too long. "There's one big action set piece too many, one more disco joke than was needed. It's not a deal breaker, but it does dull its impact." Keep an ear out for ABBA's "Waterloo," which might be "Scott's sly wink to his rumored knowledge of the presence of water on Mars far ahead of this week's surprise announcement." Yes, it's long, but The Martian "feels as bouncy and light as a beach ball," writes Dana Stevens at Slate. "In a way, it's Saving Private Ryan without the World War II setting," she writes. "It's a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place: our resourcefulness, our curiosity, and our outsized, ridiculous, beautiful brains." She adds Dariusz Wolski's 3D cinematography is "dazzling."
summarize: U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) leaves after a Senate cloture vote on budget bill on Capitol Hill in Washington December 17, 2013.      WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate will vote this year on a proposed constitutional amendment that would let states and Congress regulate campaign finance laws, Senator Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday.      The New York Democrat made the announcement weeks after a ruling on April 2 by the U.S. Supreme Court striking down aggregate campaign donation limits, a decision that could allow wealthy individuals to contribute even more to candidates and party committees.      The proposed constitutional amendment, written by New Mexico Democrat Tom Udall, would empower Congress to regulate federal election spending and outside groups, and give states the chance to dictate their own internal campaign finance rules.      "The First Amendment is sacred, but the First Amendment is not absolute. By making it absolute, you make it less sacred to most Americans. We have to bring some balance to our political system," Schumer said at a Senate Rules Committee hearing that also featured testimony from former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.      Democrats generally decry the injection of large sums of money into politics, particularly since the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, which opened the door to so-called super PACs.      The proposed amendment is unlikely to pass the Senate in the highly partisan environment in the run-up to congressional elections in November. It would need 67 votes to pass and Republicans have generally supported loosening campaign finance restrictions, but it could give Democrats an opportunity to paint their rivals as opposing important reforms.      While Democrats have embraced high-profile donors of their own, they have made opposition to Republicans' reliance on billionaires such as Charles and David Koch a central plank of their election strategy.

That vote will take place at some point this year, news that was set to be announced at a Rules and Administration hearing on campaign finance policy.      Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, appeared on MSNBC ahead of the hearing to push immediate disclosure of contributions of $1,000 or more. King’s chairing the hearing, which will feature testimony from former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and numerous campaign finance experts.      But, it wasn’t entirely clear what direction the hearing might take.      During an exchange with Chuck Todd of NBC News, King conceded he would be open to higher limits (or perhaps unlimited) contributions if they were disclosed, given the rules being set by the Supreme Court.      “Would you prefer a system that allowed $250,000 checks to be written directly to candidates, as long as you knew who that person was in a 24-hour period, rather than a $250,000 check be written and find out a year later who wrote the check?” Todd asked.      “Well if that’s the choice, yes,” King replied. “I don’t think we should have $250,000 checks written to individual candidates, but if the choice is dark versus disclosed, I think that’s better. I mean, look. In Maine, you can’t go to a Maine town meeting with a bag over your head.”      The immediate plan that the Democratic caucus has for addressing campaign finance regulations faces terribly long odds.      Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, the no. 3 in the Democratic leadership and chairman of the Rules and Administration panel, was making the announcement the Senate would vote this year on a constitutional amendment that would nullify the Supreme Court’s expansive reading of the First Amendment with respect to campaign contributions.      According to his prepared statement, Schumer was planning to cite the Citizens United ruling in addition to the recent McCutcheon case. Citizens United removed many limits on outside groups, while McCutcheon did away with aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and party committees by individuals.      “These recent Supreme Court opinions, if unchallenged, could end that legacy and permanently taint future elections,” Schumer said. “That’s why Senate Democrats are going to vote this year on my colleague Tom Udall’s constitutional amendment which would once and for all allow Congress to make laws to regulate our system, without the risk of them being eviscerated by a conservative Supreme Court.”      “It’s now crystal clear that we need a constitutional amendment to restore integrity in our election system. I am grateful for the support from Senator Reid and Senator Schumer, and I look forward to a vote in the Senate as soon as possible to ensure our government is of, by and for the people — not bought and paid for by secret donors and special interests,” Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, said in his own statement. ||||| The Senate will vote this year on a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress and the states to regulate the nation’s campaign finance laws.      A roll call on the constitutional amendment, written by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), is a direct response to recent Supreme Court rulings seen by Democrats as injecting a new flow of “dark money” into the world of politics. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is expected to formally announce the vote at a Rules Committee hearing on campaign finance reform Wednesday morning that will feature testimony from former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.      Text Size -      +      reset      There is growing unease among Democrats over the recent ruling in McCutcheon vs. FEC, which struck down aggregate contribution limits for candidates and political parties, as well as lingering despair over Citizens United, the 2010 ruling that boosted the First Amendment rights of corporations’ political activities. Schumer will say on Wednesday that these decisions “permanently taint future elections” and have necessitated a response from Senate Democrats, according to Schumer’s prepared remarks, obtained by POLITICO.      (WATCH: POLITICO's Driving the Day)      “We are going to bring it up, and we ought to pass it in the Senate without delay. I will be working with Senator Udall and Majority Leader [Harry] Reid and every Republican who cares about honest elections to bring it to the floor this year,” Schumer will say Wednesday, according to the remarks. “It’s time for Congress to act — to reassert its role and protect the right of all Americans, not just those with the fattest wallet, to participate in our political system and be heard.”      Udall’s bill would allow Congress to limit fundraising and spending on federal campaigns, give states the authority to govern campaign finance laws at the state level and allow Congress to oversee super PACs and independent expenditures.      There is little chance of Udall’s constitutional amendment passing the Senate this year, given that it needs the support of 67 senators and few Republicans will support rolling back conservative court decisions. But such a vote jibes with Democrats’ election-year party platform, which seeks to contrast Democratic positions with those of Republicans on raising the minimum wage, decreasing pay disparities between men and women, and now, rewriting campaign finance laws.      “Free and fair elections are a founding principle of our democracy, but the Supreme Court’s rulings have ensured that they are now for sale to the highest bidder,” Udall will say Wednesday. “It’s now crystal clear that we need a constitutional amendment to restore integrity in our election system.” |||||	– Senate Democrats think the Supreme Court has made a mess of campaign finance rules, and they plan to vote on a proposed constitutional amendment this year to remedy the problem, reports Roll Call. Chuck Schumer announced the future vote today, arguing that decisions such as Citizens United, which unleashed huge super PAC donations, and McCutcheon, which struck down aggregate contribution limits, have gone too far. The amendment would allow Congress to regulate spending in federal elections and states to regulate spending in local elections, reports Reuters. "The First Amendment is sacred, but the First Amendment is not absolute," said Schumer. "By making it absolute, you make it less sacred to most Americans. We have to bring some balance to our political system." The amendment from New Mexico's Tom Udall stands "little chance" of passing the Senate this year, notes Politico, but it would give Democrats in the fall elections a chance to portray their rivals as opposing reforms.

After all, the designer has been making grand statements ever since he launched the brand five years ago — and the store is an apt visual representation of his ambitious, highly detailed vision. “This is a breakthrough moment for us,” Osorio said recently over lunch with his partner (in business and life) Ricardo D’Almeida Figueiredo at The Mark hotel, one of their favorite Upper East Side haunts.      At the table, Osorio quickly scrolled through photos from his stateside travels on his phone. The designer talked about how critical the U.S. market has been to the brand’s evolution and rapid rise.      In fact, he had just returned from his latest personal-appearance tour — and during this stint on the road, the self-described traveling salesman visited five U.S. cities on behalf of three different department store partners. “I love meeting clients; I’m a people person. That’s an advantage because many others aren’t,” Osorio said.      Osorio is FN’s newest cover star. CREDIT: Weston Wells      The adept networker had landed in the Big Apple a few days earlier and made the rounds at the Save Venice masquerade ball, posed for his portrait (painted by a close friend) and even found time to hit the local flea markets. Then it was back home to Florence, Italy, to put the finishing touches on the resort and spring collections, oversee the opening of his new Milan showroom and prep for the launch of Aquazzura’s European and U.S. e-commerce sites.

Never one to sit still for long, Osorio returned to the U.S. again last week to inaugurate the New York store, which he likes to refer to as a “church of shoes.” The black-and-white pillars of Florence’s Santa Maria Novella cathedral inspired it, and interior designer Ryan Korban also incorporated furnishings that mirror the interiors of Osorio’s apartment in Palazzo Corsini. The location’s eye-catching aesthetic will certainly help Aquazzura stand out on one of Madison Avenue’s hottest blocks.      The boutique, positioned at the base of the former Whitney Townhouses, is a few doors down from the new Met Breuer museum and across the street from a bustling Apple store.      Osorio is clearly proud of his latest project, but he’s already shifting focus to the rest of the year. The designer, who together with D’Almeida Figueiredo spearheads every single brand initiative, will forge ahead with significant retail expansion that will take Aquazzura into uncharted territory.      Inside the first Aquazzura store on Madison Avenue, New York. CREDIT: George Chinsee.      The brand will open another location at Bal Harbour in Miami this summer after a recent pop-up there exceeded expectations. In total, Osorio plans to debut eight stores this year across the globe: Hong Kong, Macau, Toronto, Paris and Los Angeles are all on the agenda. (An Aquazzura space debuted in Harvey Nichols’ London flagship earlier this year, and the brand already counts stores in London and Florence.)      “We need to take advantage of the momentum we’re having,” said the unabashed self-promoter. “The market is ready for it. At every major department store in the U.S., our presence is bigger than most brands. We occupy so much of retailers’ spaces and budgets. Obviously there’s a pressure [moving forward], but thankfully I work well under pressure.”      Indeed, top players have been banking on Aquazzura during a challenging year.

CREDIT: George Chinsee.      “The brand has been one of the brightest stars in footwear and quickly leapfrogged more-established [labels] — moving from emerging brand status to a significant player in a very short period of time,” said Josh Schulman, president of Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus International.      Alberto Oliveros, head of buying at Level Shoes in Dubai, said Aquazzura’s “phenomenal” growth is a rare occurrence in the shoe industry. “In less than four years, [Edgardo has gone] from being an emerging designer to becoming one of our top brands,” he said.

Osorio, 30, wouldn’t reveal financials on the size of the privately held business, except to say it tripled last year and is on track to do it again in 2016.      Still, many young design phenoms from years past have seen their businesses shrink or disappear altogether. In addition, the luxury shoe business has recently lost some of its luster, with athletic and lifestyle brands occupying a bigger place in the spotlight. The designer has observed changing patterns first hand: Many high-end consumers are spending their money on experiences instead of products.      The designer was photographed for FN on the Upper East Side last month. CREDIT: Weston Wells      So it won’t be easy for Osorio to climb to the top — and stay there — but five years in, he seems to have found many of the right ingredients for success by carving out a distinctive path.      From the start, the Colombian-born designer intentionally went in a different direction from many of his competitors. He didn’t put his own name on the brand, preferring instead for the moniker to evoke a carefree lifestyle and the spirit of the Italian seaside. (Aquazzura is derived from the Italian phrase “blue water.”)      Osorio also wanted to usher in a return to glamorous, elegant footwear, a sharp contrast from other new names that were offering up complicated statement styles. “When I was starting, every young designer at the time was creating such strange contraptions,” explained the designer, who worked for other companies, including Roberto Cavalli and Ferragamo, before breaking out on his own in 2011. “You need to have a point of view, but you don’t need to make crazy things. You can make beautiful things and still be noticed.”      Inside the first Aquazzura store on Madison Avenue, New York. CREDIT: George Chinsee.      Armed with lessons from those past experiences, Osorio focused on making his shoes both fashionable and comfortable. But most importantly, they had to be commercial. “If a shoe sells, it’s my favorite shoe. If it doesn’t, it’s my least favorite. That’s my reality,” he said during another conversation in March at Hotel Côstes in Paris. (A few minutes later, as if on cue, a stylish young local woman approached the designer’s table. “I love your shoes, and I’m not the only one. All the women wear them,” she said.)      The pair toasted their collection at Lane Crawford. CREDIT: Courtesy Image      Consumers and retailers alike gravitate to Aquazzura’s flirty, feminine styles, at least in part because they don’t break the bank. “Edgardo presents novelty at a great price,” said Barneys senior fashion director Tomoko Ogura, who noted that shoppers can spend about $700 on a highly detailed Aquazzura style, the same amount they might have to dish out for a basic look from other brands.      Erin Cerrato, divisional VP of accessories at Holt Renfrew, said the Canadian retailer’s customers respond to value, giving Aquazzura a major edge on Holt’s shoe floor. The retailer also is partnering with the designer on a shop-in-shop in its new Toronto store, set to debut in August. “Edgardo provides a fabulous quality shoe that is beautifully crafted at a price point that is approachable to many,” Cerrato said.      Osorio said that while he doesn’t limit himself on price — fall ’16’s Russian collection incorporates expensive materials such as fur, velvet and intricate embroidery — it has been important to include price points that young consumers can afford. As he has been steadily building his business, Osorio has also managed to avoid another pitfall that often plagues emerging designers: an over-reliance on one hit style.      A Poppy Delevingne x Aquazzura style. CREDIT: Courtesy of brand.      “While he knows how to milk a good item like the Wild Thing sandal or Christy lace-up flat, he has avoided, so far, getting pigeonholed as a sandal designer or a flat designer,” Schulman noted. That’s impressive, the retailer said, because even some of the industry’s most established players are linked to a particular style — a pointy-toe pump or platform, for example. “Aquazzura is more of a spirit — a fun, sexy, upbeat language which can translate into many classifications,” he said.      A well-defined product strategy is only one part of the equation for Osorio, who is obsessed with every aspect of his business and made it a priority to install a seasoned executive team as early as he could. Last year, he tapped former Pucci execs Jean-Michel Vigneau and Cyrille Callari as CEO and COO, respectively.      Alongside the team, Osorio reviews sales reports on a weekly basis, sometimes more often. “I still look at every margin on every shoe, and I still do all my prices,” he said. “I walk the shoe floors. I want to know everything. It’s impossible for a designer today to stay in their little cloud.”      Inside the first Aquazzura store on Madison Avenue, New York. CREDIT: George Chinsee.      Instead, as the visible face of Aquazzura, Osorio tirelessly travels the world, building brand recognition wherever he goes. He’s also been strategic about building a personal inner circle and surround himself with people who can help keep him in the spotlight, from young social stars such as Poppy Delevingne to stylish 70-somethings such as Naty Abascal, a former model and muse for Valentino and the late Oscar de la Renta. Aquazzura recently teamed with both women for special projects and also partnered with Ferragamo last fall for a buzzy capsule. From the start, Osorio understood the power of great collaborations. In fact, a tie-up with fashion influencer Olivia Palermo helped jump-start his business early on.      Aquazzura Gigi sandals. CREDIT: Courtesy of Saks.      Another way Osorio is building buzz is through a large social-media presence, a must for any designer today. The designer runs his own Instagram account and constantly studies the lifestyles of his consumers in an effort to better cater to their needs. “We live in a digital world,” he said. “I grew up in an Instagram generation, and very few brands have experienced that. It helped to have all the visual information and immediacy to grow the brand. It became so global so quickly.”      Osorio also has used social media to shine the spotlight on an issue he and D’Almeida Figueiredo are fiercely passionate about: the proliferation of Aquazzura imitators. During Paris Fashion Week, the designer called out Ivanka Trump on Instagram for “blatantly stealing” his best-selling Wild Thing sandal by picturing the styles side by side. (The brand, which now employs a full-time team to monitor these types of situations, has initiated legal action in the Trump matter.)      Aquazzura, Leather Pom-Pom Sandals, CREDIT: Courtesy of Saks Fifth Avenue.      “I have nothing against Ivanka Trump. It’s not only her, and I’m glad to do other posts,” Osorio said. “I plan to do the same with Steve Madden and other people who have ripped us off. Even some of my direct competitors are copying me. . . . Sometimes I look at the buys in department stores, and I see copies of my shoes. We need to be harder with our retailers. They need to protect us. You can’t cannibalize one business with another.”      While he continues to battle it out with copycats, Osorio is busy plotting category expansion. First up is the addition of children’s shoes, which will hit retail next year. Bags and beauty are also on the wish list. One category that’s not on the agenda — at least for now — is men’s. “It would need to make sense for the image,” the designer explained. “If you start making things because this is selling or that is selling, you get a completely different client and it ruins the image of the brand.”      Aquazzura Wild Thing fringed sandal.      The biggest focus for Osorio and the team is the roster of stores. With the growing retail operation, the team members will undoubtedly face some fresh challenges in a tricky marketplace. Most importantly, they must make sure they can meet the increased demand, while not sacrificing quality as production levels inevitably rise.      Peter Harris, president of Hong Kong-based Pedder Group, noted that the designer might eventually need to reduce his wholesale exposure in favor of using his own stores to tell the      Aquazzura story and drive future growth.Osorio doesn’t hold back when asked how many locations he might want to have in five years. “Maybe 100,” he said without hesitation.      As he looks to take the business to new heights, would the designer ever consider accepting outside investment or selling the company? He’s already had a number of suitors knock on his door, but he’s not ready to entertain offers. “Never say never, but it’s too early to talk about it,” Osorio said. “We have a toe in the water. Now we need to go swimming.”      To explore the new Aquazzura store, click through the gallery below. ||||| Ivanka Trump wearing a pair of strappy pumps from her own company. This particular style is not named in the lawsuit. (Photo: IvankaTrump.com)      Fashion entrepreneur and shoe designer Ivanka Trump is being called out as a thief by high-end Italian footwear company Aquazzura. The footwear brand filed suit against Trump for allegedly stealing at least three of its designs and using them in her own, eponymous shoe line, the Huffington Post reports. Also named in the suit is Marc Fisher, the manufacturer Trump collaborates with, as well as two other companies. The suit accuses the companies of “repeated infringement” and “deceptive trade practices.”      One of the main complaints in Aquazzura’s suit, which was filed Tuesday in a Manhattan federal court, is related to the super-sexy Wild Thing shoe ($785), a fringy, high-heeled sandal that looks almost identical to Trump’s Hettie stiletto ($145), which sells through retailers like Bloomingdales, Lord and Taylor, and Nordstrom. Let’s compare the two designs below: fringe covered in the front, reddish orange, and an ankle-wrapped tie with tassels. We think they look pretty similar, but Aquazzura will have to let a judge decide.            Photos: Courtesy of Farfetch.com, left, and Pinterest, right            Before he filed the suit, the founding designer of Aquazzura, Edgardo Osorio, called out Trump’s supposed thievery during Paris Fashion Week on Instagram, writing, “One of the most disturbing things in the fashion industry is when someone blatantly steals your copyright designs and doesn’t care. You should know better. Shame on you @ivankatrump! Imitation is NOT the most sincere form of flattery.”            Osorio told Footwear News he has “nothing against Ivanka Trump” personally, but rather with the copycat culture of the women’s footwear industry. “I plan to do the same with Steve Madden and other people who have ripped us off,” he told the publication. “Even some of my direct competitors are copying me … Sometimes I look at the buys in department stores, and I see copies of my shoes. We need to be harder with our retailers. They need to protect us. You can’t cannibalize one business with another.”      Other designs Trump’s company has been accused of stealing include Aquazzura’s Forever Marilyn and Belgravia shoes.

(Photo: Nicholas Hunt, Getty Images)      While GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump has been involved in at least 3,500 court actions, his daughter, Ivanka, is a legal target in a new lawsuit of her own.      Italian luxury footwear maker Aquazzura is accusing her of copying the company's copyright design to a popular sandal, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court.      Along with naming Trump, who has her own fashion collection, the lawsuit names three companies working with her, including manufacturer Marc Fisher.      The dispute focuses on Aquazzura's "Wild Thing," a sandal with fringe covering the toes and suede tassel fringe atop an oh-so-high heel. Celebrities ranging from socialite Olivia Palermo to singer Solange Knowles have been "parading the red carpet" in the footwear, according to a December posting in fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar cited by the court complaint.      "Seeking the same success Aquazzura experienced but without having to put in the hard creative work, defendants resorted to knocking off plaintiff's popular designs," the complaint charged.      The Wild Thing sandals are advertised for as much as $785 at Net-a-Porter and other fashion companies. Trump's footwear, a sandal dubbed the Hettie, under-sells the Aquazzura footwear with a listed sale price of $145 at Bloomingdale's department store.      The Italian company seeks a court injunction barring Trump from selling the purported knockoff. Aquazzura also seeks an accounting of Trump's profits from the shoe, plus damages and attorney fees.      Left: The Trump "Hettie" shoe. Right: Aquazzura "Wild Thing" shoe.

The lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend ourselves against the claim."      The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest.      Trump has followed in Aquazzura's footsteps before, the lawsuit charges, escalating complaints about copycatting the company previously made on her Instagram account.      The court filing featured side-by-side photos comparing not only the Wild Thing and the Hettie, but also Trump footwear that appeared similar to Aquazzura's Forever Marilyn and Belgravia shoe models.      Trump and the other defendants reportedly halted sales of one of those models, and filed a lawsuit for a declaration of non-infringement of copyright on the other, the lawsuit said.

(Related: Gallery: Famous Fashion Plagiarists)      The graphic black and white “Face Le New” T-shirt was designed by the artist Kesh, whose graphic, geometric depiction of her own face made it onto the $30 American Apparel shirt as part of a collaboration with the line in the spring of 2013.

But then she realized it was a real shirt produced by Versace and for sale on Selfridge’s for $650, and three sizes had already sold out.      “A friend sent an image of it to my phone,” Kesh said. “I woke up to it this morning thinking it was another cheap Chinese rip off. Then I saw the £440 price tag and that it was on the Selfridges website.”      Kesh told The Cut:      “I am deeply disappointed in this.

While a geometric black and white face graphic is not unique, the particulars of these designs make it seem inconceivable that a person could design the Versace shirt without ever having seen the Kesh shirt. |||||	– Possible future First Daughter Ivanka Trump is in legal hot water. Aquazzura, a luxury Italian shoe company, says one of Trump's shoe designs for her fashion collection is a copycat of one of its own popular sandals. The company is suing Trump and three companies that work with her, and wants a court to stop her from selling her version of the shoe, USA Today reports. The issue is over Aquazzura's Wild Thing sandals, which have an insanely high heel and lots of fringe and cost $785, and Trump's Hettie High Heel sandals, which have an insanely high heel and lots of fringe and reportedly cost $145 before they became unavailable on Bloomingdale's website. Yahoo Style has a side-by-side comparison photo. Aquazzura had actually called Trump out way back in March, posting a photo of the two shoes on Instagram and bemoaning that moment "when someone blatantly steals your copyright designs and doesn't care." Aquazzura's version has been seen on the feet of celebs including Olivia Palermo and Solange Knowles, and the lawsuit alleges that, "seeking the same success Aquazzura experienced but without having to put in the hard creative work, defendants resorted to knocking off plaintiff's popular designs." But two can play at that game: "This is a baseless lawsuit aimed at generating publicity," says the chief financial officer of one of the companies being sued. "The shoe in question is representative of a trending fashion style, is not subject to intellectual property law protection and there are similar styles made by several major brands." Aquazzura's founding designer seems to sort of agree with that: He told Footwear News last month, "It’s not only [Trump], and I’m glad to do other [Instagram] posts. I plan to do the same with Steve Madden and other people who have ripped us off." (Last year, Versace allegedly copied American Apparel.)
summarize: CNN has multiple crews in Gaza, Israel and neighboring countries to bring you the latest accurate information on the conflict, the impact on people and the recent cease-fire. Are you affected by the conflict? Share photos and video, but stay safe.      Near the Israel-Gaza border (CNN) -- Hours after a cease-fire was declared Wednesday in Israel's conflict with Gaza, it appeared to be holding, an Israeli official said.      "We assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold," Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, told CNN. "I understand now that it has taken hold. There hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire."      His remarks came after an Israeli military spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, told CNN that five rockets had been fired from Gaza in violation of the cease-fire. Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, in an interview with CNN, put the number of rockets at 12.      Wednesday's cease-fire followed eight days of violence along Israel's border with Gaza and nearly 150 deaths -- the vast majority of them Palestinian.      Egypt's Morsy praised for his key role in talks      The cease-fire, announced in a joint news conference in Cairo with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, took effect at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET).      Gazans took to the streets, firing guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over Israel's military.      The agreement calls for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to Egypt's state news agency EGYNews. It also calls for the Palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from Gaza against Israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. Border crossings were to be opened Thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said.      On the ground: Follow updates from CNN's reporters      The agreement came after a day of negotiations that included Clinton, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and Palestinian officials.      Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said the agreement calls for "complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the Gaza Strip."      "For us, that's victory. That's what we wanted," he said.      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of possible additional military action if the cease-fire fails to lead to long-term security. "But at this time, the right thing for the state of Israel is to exhaust this opportunity to obtain a long-term cease fire," he said.      Netanyahu thanked U.S. President Barack Obama for his "unreserved support" of Israel's actions.      It was the November 14 assassination by Israeli forces of Ahmed al-Ja'abari, the head of Hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting.      Opinion: Will real change come from this cease-fire?      Israel launched its offensive with a stated goal of ending the rocket attacks on southern Israel from inside Gaza by degrading the ability of Palestinians to launch such attacks.      "Their attempts backfired against them," said Khaled Meshaal, a Hamas political leader. "They wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of Hamas. They claim they have done so, and they have not. They are bankrupt."      He cited Israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. "This is their accomplishment," he said. "They have nothing else to show. And our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute."      Israel will hold Hamas responsible for any attacks from Gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, Regev said. He said the agreement reflects that understanding.      iReport: Share your stories from the region      As he was preparing to return to New York from Tel Aviv, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said late Wednesday his biggest concern was for the safety of civilians, "no matter where they are. Innocent people, including children, have been killed or injured on both sides. Families on both sides were forced to cower in fear as the violence raged around them."      He said that more than 139 Palestinians had been killed, more than 70 of them civilians, and more than 900 were injured. In addition, some 10,000 Palestinians had lost their homes, he said, adding there was a critical need for humanitarian aid in the territory.      IDF's Leibovich dismissed such concerns. "There is no crisis in Gaza," she told CNN, adding that she had seen pictures Wednesday morning of markets filled with fresh produce. "I understand that some things are not convenient," she said.      During the conflict, rocket fire killed four Israeli civilians and wounded 219 other people, most of them civilians, three of them seriously, Ban said. In addition, an Israeli soldier was killed and 16 were wounded, one critically, he said.      Smuggling weapons to Gaza -- the long way      In all, 1,456 rockets were estimated to have been fired from Gaza into Israel, with three long-range missiles hitting the outskirts of Jerusalem, a move he called "unprecedented."      Israeli forces reported strikes on more than 1,450 targets in Gaza, Ban said. They targeted, but were not limited to, attacks on rocket-launching sites, military bases, police stations and tunnels along the border with Egypt, he said.      Hundreds of other buildings were hit, Ban said, adding that he condemned "indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza into Israel," but also believed that the "excessive and disproportionate use of force that endangers civilian lives is intolerable."      Long-term solutions for Gaza and the Palestinians in general must be found, he said.      "Once calm is fully restored and the violence ends, a broader cease-fire will have to address all the underlying causes of conflict, including the full opening of crossings, Palestinian reconciliation and an end to weapons smuggling."      How Middle East has changed since last Gaza conflict      Regev said the deal calls for talks to begin Thursday on easing economic restrictions on Gaza.      "If the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming," he said.      Clinton, who shuttled among Israel, the West Bank and Egypt to help negotiate the deal, said the United States will continue to work with regional partners to implement and expand the agreement.      Obama spoke Wednesday morning with Morsy, thanking the Egyptian leader for his leadership in negotiating the proposal.      As recently as Wednesday afternoon, Hamas officials had been calling for more strikes against Israel, while that country's military continued to press its campaign against what it said were suspected rocket-launching sites and "terrorist hideouts."      Arab-Americans watch conflict with mix of worry, relief      The cease-fire talks, held in the West Bank, Israel and Cairo, continued despite a lunchtime bus attack near the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. At least two bombs were planted on the bus, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. One of the bombs exploded, blowing out the windows of the bus, he said.      Rosenfeld said 24 people were wounded, three of them seriously. Aviva Shemer with Ichilov Hospital said pedestrians were among the injured.

Hamas put its own spin on the attack in a banner on al-Aqsa, calling it "a natural response to the massacre of the al-Dalou family and targeting of innocent Palestinian civilians."      Nine members of the al-Dalou family died Sunday in an Israeli airstrike, provoking outrage among Palestinians.      "We told you #IDF that our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are," the al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said on Twitter. "You opened the Gates of Hell on Yourselves."      Diplomats said they were hoping to avoid a repeat of 2008 and 2009, when at least 1,400 people died as Israeli troops invaded Gaza after similar rocket attacks.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is visiting the West Bank and, later, Cairo after talks with Israeli leaders.      Palestinian sources had suggested a truce would be announced on Tuesday, but Israel said no deal was struck.      Some 136 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed since the flare-up began eight days ago, officials say.      On Tuesday alone, the conflict claimed the lives of at least 20 Palestinians and two Israelis.      Mrs Clinton has arrived in Ramallah on the West Bank for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is also visiting leaders in the region to try to cement a ceasefire.      In Cairo, officials from Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that has governed Gaza since 2007, had suggested a truce would come into effect at midnight on Tuesday, but Israel later said it had not agreed to a text.      Israel's demands include no hostile fire of any kind from Gaza and international efforts to prevent Hamas from re-arming, while Hamas is demanding an end to the blockade on Gaza and targeted killings by Israel.      Before me two men are salvaging burnt & damaged copies of the Quran from the rubble of the compound Paul Danahar (@pdanahar) on Twitter      An Israeli official told Israel Radio the ceasefire had not been agreed because of "a last-minute delay in the understandings between Hamas and Israel".      Offices struck      In the early hours of Wednesday, BBC correspondents in Gaza reported hearing loud explosions that were followed by a widespread power cut.      Israeli missiles struck the main complex of the Hamas-run government in the centre of Gaza City.      The BBC's Paul Danahar in Gaza said the huge compound had been laid to waste and was little more than dust and rubble.      The Israeli military later tweeted it had "surgically targeted a Hamas intelligence operations centre" on the seventh floor of a media building.      Israel's military, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said it had attacked more than 100 "terror sites" in Gaza overnight "of which approximately 50 were underground rocket launchers".      The health ministry in Gaza said 15 more people had been injured overnight.      The BBC's Jon Donnison in Gaza says the streets were again empty on Wednesday morning, as people tried to protect themselves at home while waiting for something positive to come from talks in Cairo.      Israel says more than 800 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel over the past week, 162 in the past day alone.      Many of the rockets have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system.      Overnight, two rockets were knocked down by Iron Dome and others landed on open ground, Israel Radio said. By morning, air raid sirens sounded in many parts of southern Israel, local media reported.      'Sustainable outcome'      Hamas officials in Cairo accused Israel of failing to respond to ceasefire proposals.      Israeli spokesman Mark Regev told the BBC: "I have no doubt that Hamas would be more than happy to have a temporary respite - a time out... so they could rest and re-arm and we would have missiles on Israel next week or next month. We are not interested in that."      Image caption Smuggling tunnels between Egypt and Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip have been targeted by Israel      US state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Mrs Clinton - who flew into Jerusalem late on Tuesday - had held two hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials.      "They discussed efforts to de-escalate the situation and bring about a sustainable outcome that protects Israel's security and improves the lives of civilians in Gaza," Ms Nuland said.      Speaking just before the talks, Mr Netanyahu said Israel wanted a diplomatic solution but that he was ready to take "whatever action" was necessary.      "If there is a possibility of achieving a long-term solution to this problem by diplomatic means, we prefer that. But if not, then I am sure you will understand that Israel will have to take whatever actions are necessary to defend its people," he said.      Israel's Haaretz newspaper said there were divided views in the government over the truce proposals, with Defence Minister Ehud Barak in favour of accepting an Egyptian draft, while Mr Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman were opposed.      The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says both sides want more out of this than just a ceasefire. The Palestinians want a lifting of the blockade of Gaza, permanently reopening the borders. He says the hope would be that this will defuse tension and reduce pressure on Hamas.      The Israelis want an end to attacks, our correspondent says, but specifically want to prevent Hamas restocking its missiles. He says the key to that is how the Egyptians can seal the border; but this is politically sensitive among the Egyptian people and also physically difficult, as the military has a lot of trouble controlling militants in Sinai.      Israel launched its current offensive a week ago with the killing of Hamas military leader Ahmed Jabari. The Israeli government says his assassination, and the subsequent offensive, aims to end rocket fire from Gaza.      Israel has troops massed along the Gaza border but says it is holding off on a possible ground invasion as talks continue. ||||| The deal demonstrated the pragmatism of Egypt’s new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi , who balanced public support for Hamas with a determination to preserve the peace with Israel. But it was unclear whether the agreement would be a turning point or merely a lull in the conflict.      The cease-fire deal was reached only through a final American diplomatic push: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton conferred for hours with Mr. Morsi and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon , at the presidential palace here. Hanging over the talks was the Israeli shock at a Tel Aviv bus bombing — praised by Hamas — that recalled past Palestinian uprisings and raised fears of heavy Israeli retaliation. After false hopes the day before, Western and Egyptian diplomats said they had all but given up hope for a quick end to the violence.      Tellingly, neither Israel nor Hamas was represented in the final talks or the announcement, leaving it in the hands of a singular partnership between their proxies, the United States and Egypt.      Photo      There were immediate questions about the durability of the deal. Hamas, which controls Gaza, has in the past not fulfilled less formal cease-fires by failing to halt all missile fire into Israel by breakaway Palestinian militants.      Neither side retreated from threats to resume the conflict if the deal fell through, and both said they had only reluctantly agreed under international pressure. In a televised news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel declared that some Israelis still expected “a much harsher military operation, and it is very possible we will be compelled to embark on one.”      But he said that in a telephone conversation with Mr. Obama earlier in the evening, “I agreed with him that it is worth giving the cease-fire a chance.” He added that he had reached an undisclosed agreement with Mr. Obama to “work together against the smuggling of weapons” to Palestinian militants, for which Mr. Netanyahu blamed Iran .      Khaled Meshal , Hamas’s top leader, thanked Iran for its military support in a triumphal news conference in Cairo. “This is a point on the way to a great defeat for Israel,” he said. “Israel failed in all its objectives.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      He suggested that the West had come to Hamas and its Islamist allies in Egypt pleading for peace. “The Americans and the Europeans asked the Egyptians, ‘You have the ear of the resistance,’ ” he said, using the term Hamas prefers to describe itself and other Palestinian militants fighting the Israeli occupation. “Egypt did not sell out the resistance as some people have claimed. Egypt understood the demands of the resistance and the Palestinian people.”      The agreement postponed the resolution of the most contentious issue: Israel’s tight restrictions on the border crossings into Gaza under a seven-year-old embargo imposed to thwart Hamas from arming itself. The one-page “understanding” regarding the cease-fire called for “opening the crossing and facilitating the movement of people and transfer of goods,” but it also said that “procedures of implementation will be dealt with after 24 hours from the start of the cease-fire.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But however fragile the cease-fire may be, the deal itself may be a turning point for Egypt’s Islamist leaders, in both their relations with the West and their role in the region. Since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak — a reliable ally of Washington and Israel — many in the West have been worried about how Egypt’s leaders might respond to the next confrontation that pits their allies in Hamas against Israel. As a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood ’s parliamentary bloc, Mr. Morsi often railed against Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories and praised Hamas for rejecting the Western-backed peace process in favor of armed resistance.      Advisers to Mr. Morsi acknowledged that the latest Gaza battle had put them in a bind, caught between the electorate’s anger at Israel and Mr. Morsi’s own vows — to Egyptians and the West — to encourage peace in the region. “If he responds fully to public opinion, he risks what we have been trying to do for peace and stability in the region,” said a senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks.      When the test came, several American diplomats said, Mr. Morsi chose pragmatism over ideology, working closely with Washington to bring the antagonists to the table.      Video      American officials and Mr. Morsi’s advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said both the Egyptian president and Mr. Obama had given the other room to manage the demands of their domestic constituencies. They spoke by telephone at least six times during the week of fighting, officials said. Mr. Morsi had looked past Mr. Obama’s repeated statements of support for Israel’s right to self-defense, while Mr. Obama did not object as Mr. Morsi publicly blamed the Israelis for both instigating the conflict and then using excessive force.      But behind the scenes, the Americans pushed the Israelis toward a truce and Mr. Morsi pressured Hamas, as the parties all acknowledged on Wednesday.      Essam el-Haddad, Mr. Morsi’s top foreign policy adviser, said, “I think that the United States from the first moments was trying to find an end to the bloodshed.”      “Yes, they were carrying the point of view of the Israeli side, but they were understanding also the other side, the Palestinian side,” he said of President Obama ’s role. “The sincerity and understanding was really very helpful.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian Authority ’s commissioner for international relations, who was in Cairo during the early stages of the talks and met with key players, said the published agreement was intentionally kept “as vague and as general and as concise as possible to avoid problems and misunderstandings.”      Egypt’s role in the cease-fire remains unclear, Mr. Shaath said.      “How much Egypt can really take the responsibility of a total sealing of the borders not to allow a bullet to come through, above or below?” he said.      Although the memorandum of understanding did not clarify how Gaza’s borders might be opened, Egyptians, Israelis and Americans briefed on the talks said that Egypt had broached the possibility of expanding the traffic of people and goods at Rafah. Egypt has historically resisted a broader opening of the crossing, and Israel enforces its embargo on the other sides of Gaza, fearing that it would face an influx of refugees or end up with responsibility for the impoverished enclave.      Israel also fears that an open border crossing would become a conduit for weapons.      But the people briefed on the talks said the Egyptians were considering restoring something like a previous arrangement, under which the Palestinian Authority and the European Union would operate the border crossing to provide Israel and Egypt some measure of security.      The arrangement might also force Hamas and the Palestinian Authority to work together. Mr. Morsi’s advisers say they are intent on reconciling the rival factions.      After the agreement was announced, the White House said, Mr. Obama called Mr. Morsi and each thanked the other. ||||| GAZA |      GAZA (Reuters) - Two cameramen working for al-Aqsa TV and an educational programming director for the al-Quds channel, both affiliated with Gaza's Hamas government, were killed by Israeli air strikes on their cars on Tuesday.      The cameramen were killed in their car not far from the main Shifa hospital in Gaza city. The al-Quds program director was killed in his car in the central Gaza Strip.      Their deaths have sparked outrage among Gaza's press corps and also from Hamas, which accused Israel of trying to suppress coverage of Israeli attacks in the coastal enclave.      "The Israeli aggressors want to cut the picture and silence the voice of the brave people of Gaza. Journalism in Gaza plays a major, effective role in exposing the enemy's crimes to the world," Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told a news conference.      For its part, Israel says it takes pains only to strike combatants and warns civilians away from its strikes, which have killed over 125 Palestinians in six days of fighting, around half of them civilians, including around 30 children.      "The terrorists use schools, mosques, the media and even their own kids as human shields," Israel army spokesman Arye Shalicar told Reuters.      "Every time we target a site, and we have hit more than 1400 targets, we try to have nearly 100 percent certainty about where and what the target is, so that we only strike the terrorists," he said.      Four Israelis have been killed by hundreds of rocket salvos fired into Israel by Gaza-based militants.      A tower block housing many of Gaza's local and international media offices has twice been bombed by Israeli planes in recent days, in attacks Israel said targeted the communications infrastructure and personnel of militant groups.      Travelling down a laser-straight path toward the building on Monday, three Israeli missiles burst into earth-shaking fireballs, killing a cyber warfare operative from the militant Islamic Jihad group and wounding six others.      Tenants of the building, which include Britain's Sky News and Saudi-owned Al Arabiya, said they did not realize militants also occupied the non-descript office targeted.      The building's roof was bombed on Sunday, in a strike Israel said targeted military communications infrastructure. A similar attack on the same morning attacked another building, also crowded with media offices, housing Hamas-affiliated al-Quds TV. It wounded eight journalists.      International media watchdogs have criticized Israel.      "Israel should respect its obligations under international law and immediately halt its attacks against news media offices," Sherif Mansour of the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement on Monday.      "Authorities know these buildings are home to numerous news organizations whose employees are civilians protected by international law," he said.

Diplomats will resume talks today in an effort to bring an end to hostilities that have killed at least 139 people in Gaza, including many civilians, and five Israelis, including a soldier killed by a rocket strike yesterday, the New York Times reports. Hillary Clinton, who called for a "durable peace" after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday, will meet Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and Palestinian Authority chief Mahmoud Abbas today, but she is not expected to travel to Gaza itself, CNN reports. Israel hit the Hamas government's main complex in Gaza overnight, reducing the huge compound to rubble, the BBC reports. Israel says it struck scores of "terror sites," including 50 that harbored rocket launchers. A truce was close last night but was thwarted by last-minute delays, according to the Telegraph. Sources say both sides expect an Egypt-brokered ceasefire deal to emerge sometime today. Three journalists were among those killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza yesterday, Reuters reports. Two cameramen and an educational programming director for the Hamas-affiliated al-Quds channel were killed in their cars, sparking outrage among international media groups.
summarize: The death chamber is seen through the steel bars from the viewing room at the federal penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas in this September 29, 2010 handout.      AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas executed by lethal injection on Wednesday a Mexican citizen who was convicted of bludgeoning a man to death and repeatedly raping the man's wife.      Ramiro Hernandez, 44, was pronounced dead at 6:28 p.m. CDT at the Texas state death chamber in Huntsville after receiving a dose of lethal drugs, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.      Hernandez was the sixth convict executed in Texas this year and the 16th in the United States.      The Mexican government has tried to halt other executions of its citizens in the state, arguing Texas has not met international obligations concerning the treatment of foreign nationals taken into custody. It had appealed to Texas to halt the execution of Hernandez.      Texas has usually proceeded with the executions despite the diplomatic protests and the Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry had said it had exhausted all remedies to stop the execution.      In a last statement in Spanish translated by the state criminal justice department, Hernandez said he thanked God for letting him see his family and told them not to be sad.      "I am sorry for what I have done," Hernandez said. "Be mindful that I am happy till the end. To the family of my boss, I love you."      Hernandez said, "I have no pain and no guilt. All I have is love. Love will win. Thank you God. I am going with you."      Hernandez, a hired hand, was convicted of beating his employer Glen Lich to death with a metal bar in October 1997 in the south central Texas county of Bandera.      "(He) then ransacked the Lich residence and repeatedly sexually assaulted Lich's wife at knife-point," the Texas Attorney General's office said in statement.      A federal court had granted Hernandez a temporary stay of execution, saying the state needed to provide information about the supplier of the lethal injection drug.      The stay was reversed by a U.S. appeals court this week, which said there was no compelling evidence that protections provided by the U.S. Constitution would be violated under Texas' current procedures.      (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin and David Bailey in Minneapolis; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) ||||| HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — A man who escaped prison in his native Mexico while serving a murder sentence was executed in Texas on Wednesday for fatally beating a former Baylor University history professor and attacking his wife more than 16 years ago.      Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas, 44, was lethally injected in the state's death chamber in Huntsville.      He was in the U.S. illegally when he was arrested for the October 1997 slaying of 49-year-old Glen Lich. Just 10 days earlier, Lich had given Hernandez-Llanas a job helping with renovations at his ranch near Kerrville, about 65 miles northwest of San Antonio, in exchange for living quarters.      Investigators said Hernandez-Llanas lured Lich from his house by telling him that there was a problem with a generator, then repeatedly clubbed him with a piece of steel rebar. Armed with a knife, he then attacked Lich's wife. She survived and testified against Hernandez-Llanas, who also had been linked to a rape and a stabbing.      Strapped to a gurney inside the death chamber, Hernandez-Llanas asked for forgiveness. He also said he was at peace and thankful for being able to see relatives, and he urged them not to be sad.      "I'm happy... I am sorry for what I have done," he said, speaking in Spanish during a nearly five-minute final statement. "I'm looking at the angel of God."      He raised his head from the gurney three times and blew three loud kisses toward a brother, a sister and two friends watching through a window. He also thanked prison officers and the warden.      "I say this with a lot of love and happiness: I have no pain and no guilt. All I have is love," he said.      As the lethal drug took effect, he snored loudly twice, then appeared to go to sleep. Within seconds, all movement stopped. He was pronounced dead 11 minutes later, at 6:28 p.m.      Lich's son, who also witnessed the execution, declined to speak with reporters afterward.      Hernandez-Llanas was the second Texas inmate to receive a lethal injection of a new supply of pentobarbital. Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials have refused to identify the source of the powerful sedative, contending secrecy is needed to protect the drug's provider from threats of violence from capital punishment opponents. The U.S. Supreme Court backed the state's position in a related case last week.      Texas and other states that have the death penalty have been scrambling for substitute drugs or new sources for drugs for lethal injections after major drugmakers — many based in Europe with longtime opposition to the death penalty — stopped selling to prisons and corrections departments.      Hernandez-Llanas' appeals were exhausted, and the Texas parole board on Tuesday refused to delay his death sentence or commute it to life in prison.      He was among more than four dozen Mexican citizens awaiting execution in the U.S. when the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled in 2004 that they weren't properly advised of their consular rights when arrested. A measure mandated by the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce that ruling has languished in Congress.      On Wednesday, the Mexican government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement condemning the execution.      "This is the fourth case of a Mexican being executed in clear violation of the judgment of the International Court of Justice," the ministry said. "The Government of Mexico expresses its most vigorous protest at the failure to comply."      But that issue never surfaced in Hernandez-Llanas' appeals, which focused primarily on claims that his mental impairment made him ineligible for the death penalty. Testimony from psychiatrists who said he was not mentally impaired and would remain a danger was faulty, his attorneys argued.      According to trial testimony, Hernandez-Llanas was arrested just hours after the attacking Lich and his wife. He was sleeping in the bed where he had wrapped his arm around the terrorized woman, who managed to wriggle from his grasp and restraints without waking him and call police.      Evidence showed Hernandez-Llanas was in Texas after escaping from a Mexican prison, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for a 1989 bludgeoning murder in Nuevo Laredo. He was linked to the rape of a 15-year-old girl and a stabbing in Kerrville. While awaiting trial, evidence showed he slashed another inmate's face with a razor blade. In prison, he was found with homemade weapons.      "This is exactly why we have the death penalty," Lucy Wilke, an assistant Kerr County district attorney who helped prosecute Hernandez-Llanas, said ahead of the execution. "Nobody, even prison guards, is safe from him."      Hernandez-Llanas was the sixth prisoner executed this year in Texas, the nation's busiest death penalty state. |||||	– A man who escaped the prison in Mexico where he was serving a murder sentence and killed again in the US has become the second Mexican citizen executed in Texas this year. Ramiro Hernandez, 44, was executed by lethal injection for beating a university professor to death in 1997 and repeatedly raping his wife, Reuters reports. He had been hired as a ranch hand just 10 days before the murder. "I’m looking at the angel of God," he said after being strapped to a gurney in the Huntsville death chamber. "I ask forgiveness from the family of my boss." Hernandez was among dozens of Mexican citizens on death row found to not have been properly advised of their consular rights, and the Mexican government expressed "its most vigorous protest," at the execution "in clear violation of the judgment of the International Court of Justice." But that issue did not play a role in his appeals, which focused on alleged mental impairment, the AP finds. Hernandez is the second person to be executed with pentobarbital from Texas' new supplier, whose identity the state has refused to reveal. Serial killer Tommy Lynn Sells, who claimed to have killed up to 70 people across the US, was executed last week.
summarize: The 10 Most Vulnerable Senators      By Kyle Trygstad and Alexis Levinson      There is a new chart-topper in Roll Call’s latest monthly ranking of the 10 most vulnerable senators.      Montana’s appointed Sen. John Walsh was by far the most endangered incumbent in the chamber at the time of the previous installment in early August, but his decision last month to not seek a full term opened the top slot to a couple other worthy contenders.      Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., is still in a perilous political position, but Louisiana Sen. Mary L. Landrieu has leapfrogged him on the list to become the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbent.      The Democrat is pushing hard to eclipse 50 percent on Nov. 4, the day of Louisiana’s jungle primary and possibly Landrieu’s best opportunity for re-election. She will undoubtedly get close. But if Landrieu doesn’t win a majority of the vote against a few GOP challengers, she will likely face Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in the Dec. 6 runoff.      If that happens, all bets are off, and Landrieu’s viability may depend on which party prevailed on Election Day.      With the elections just two months away, Democratic incumbents overall have run strong-enough campaigns to ensure the fight for the Senate majority remains a tossup — despite a playing field tilted heavily in the GOP’s direction.      Republicans, who need a net gain of six seats to take control of the chamber, are expected to get halfway there by picking up the open seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. Its open-seat opportunities don’t stop there, but the GOP will likely need to defeat at least two sitting senators to win the majority.      They have several to choose from:      1. Mary L. Landrieu, D-La.      No incumbent faces a more complicated path to re-election than Landrieu, thanks to the state’s unique voting process and calendar. With a challenging national climate and a strong GOP challenger in Rep. Bill Cassidy, Republicans may finally defeat the senator who has won some tough races before.      2. Mark Pryor, D-Ark.      Pryor is surprising people in both parties and is in far better shape at this point than some expected a year ago. But he remains a top target of national Republicans, who believe Rep. Tom Cotton will ultimately win over the GOP voters who have supported Pryor in the past.      3. Mark Begich, D-Alaska      The Democrat running arguably the best campaign also happens to be in possibly the most challenging state for the party. Begich and his Democratic backers have been hammering Republican Dan Sullivan for months, long before he finally emerged with the nomination Aug. 19.      4. Kay Hagan, D-N.C.      Hagan is a top target for Republicans, but circumstances have been good to her. Republican Thom Tillis, the state House speaker, had to put his candidacy on the back burner for the past several months when the legislature’s “short session” ended up not so short. He only became a full-time candidate last week, when the House finally wrapped up.      5. Mark Udall, D-Colo.      Udall has a strong opponent in Rep. Cory Gardner, and Colorado is a solidly purple state that could go either way. Democrats are hoping their 2010 playbook, which got Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet elected in a Republican wave year, will be as successful the second time around.      6. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.      If rankings went by polling alone, McConnell might be higher on this list. He faces a legitimate challenge in Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, a rock star fundraiser who makes the party optimistic. Grimes needs to top the 47 percent McConnell’s previous opponent received in 2008, but that’s not easy in a midterm cycle with an unpopular Democratic president.      7. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.      Shaheen is well-liked and remains the clear favorite, but a single poll in mid-August showing a 2-point race caused an uproar of speculation. It’s likely not that close, but Republicans hope former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown will begin to close the gap after the Sept. 9 primary.      8. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.      With a solid lead in the polls and large financial advantage, Merkley doesn’t appear to be in much danger. But Republican Monica Wehby is getting some much-needed help from the Koch brothers on the airwaves and Merkley’s poll numbers, while strong, don’t match Al Franken’s, pushing the Oregon senator up one spot on this list.      9. Al Franken, D-Minn.      Franken is a strong fundraiser in a solidly blue state. There’s a path for Republicans to potentially make this race competitive, but so far, GOP nominee Mike McFadden hasn’t made it happen.      10. Mark Warner, D-Va.      It would take a Republican wave election to oust Warner, a popular former governor with a massive cash advantage over his Republican opponent Ed Gillespie. He joins this list largely for lack of another option.      Editor’s note: Roll Call will publish a revised list of the Top 10 Most Vulnerable House Members on Wednesday. These features will be updated during the first week of October and again before Election Day.

Bill Enyart (D-Ill.)      Text Size -      +      reset      Enyart, a freshman Democrat, is running for reelection in a southern Illinois district where Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and President Barack Obama are deeply unpopular. A former adjutant general in the Illinois National Guard, Enyart remains an unknown figure throughout much of the district and has struggled to raise campaign cash. His Republican opponent, state Rep. Mike Bost, is famous for his tirades on the floor of the Legislature.      Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.)      Grimm’s 20-count federal indictment has made him the most endangered House GOP lawmaker of 2014. But he’s not done yet. Internal polling from both parties suggests that Grimm is tied or slightly ahead of his Democratic opponent, former New York City Councilman Domenic Recchia. But Democrats have promised to bombard Grimm with millions of dollars of TV ads, and national Republicans are queasy about coming to Grimm’s aid.      (WATCH: House races preview)      Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.)      Democrats have grown increasingly worried about Nolan, who won a 2012 comeback race after serving in the House from 1974 to 1980. Over the summer, the Democratic groups House Majority PAC and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees joined forces to air TV ads in an attempt to boost the 70-year-old incumbent, who has also struggled to raise money. Nolan faces a strong opponent in Republican businessman Stewart Mills, who has been dubbed the “Brad Pitt” of the GOP.      Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H.)      Polling shows Shea-Porter, a third-term Democrat, falling behind her likely Republican opponent, former Rep. Frank Guinta. Guinta, who unseated Shea-Porter in 2010 and then lost to her in 2012, is well known in the Manchester area and the favorable environment could push him over the top in a district that skews slightly to the right.

Southerland, a sophomore Republican, faces perhaps the strongest Democratic recruit in the country in Gwen Graham, a Leon County schools official who is the daughter of former Sen. Bob Graham. Graham has outraised Southerland, and she’s waging an energetic campaign, running quality TV ads and joining her father on the trail. |||||	– The congressional midterm elections are coming, meaning it's time to mine the tea leaves for potential losers.

summarize: JK Rowling has been hailed an “inspiration” after she was asked by a young Harry Potter fan why Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore was gay.      Rowling, 49, revealed Dumbledore's sexuality almost a decade ago in 2007, after the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published.      In a tweet that has since been deleted, fan Ana Kocovic asked: “Thank you so much for writing Harry Potter. I wonder why you said that Dumbledore is a gay because I can’t see him in that way.”      The author’s powerful response was simply: “Maybe because gay people just look like…people?”      .@anakocovic21 Maybe because gay people just look like... people? — J.K.

In 2007, Rowling said that Dumbledore was gay when she revealed he had lost his moral compass after falling in love with Gellert Grindelwald as a young man.      “I had always seen Dumbledore as gay, but in a sense that’s not a big deal. The book wasn’t about Dumbledore being gay. It was just that from the outset obviously I knew he had this big, hidden secret," she said in a 2008 interview with The Student.      "The issue is love. It’s not about sex. So that’s what I knew about Dumbledore. And it’s relevant only in so much as he fell in love and was made an utter fool of by love. He lost his moral compass completely when he fell in love and I think subsequently became very mistrusting of his own judgment in those matters so became quite asexual. He led a celibate and bookish life.”      BONUS: 'Harry Potter' in Two Minutes      Have something to add to this story?

summarize: SANTA ANA – Nadya Suleman – known as "Octomom" – filed bankruptcy papers on Monday in federal court.      Suleman's debt could be as much as $1 million – 20 times more than her net worth, according to court documents. The mother of 14 has up to $50,000 in assets.      "I have had to make some very difficult decisions this year, and filing Chapter 7 was one of them," Suleman, 36, said through an e-mail sent by her manager, Gina Rodriguez. "But I have to do what is best for my children, and I need a fresh start."      Under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a court-appointed trustee will go through and liquidate whatever assets Suleman has that can be used to pay off her creditors. Debtors like Suleman typically receive a discharge from most of their debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, according to the federal courts website.      The court will go through Suleman's finances – including her debts and her current income – to make sure she is not abusing the protections of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.      The list of people and organizations to which Suleman owes money include her father, Ed Doud; the city of La Habra's water department, which supplies residents' water; DirecTV; Whittier Christian School; Verizon Wireless; Southern California Edison; a gardener; and the Department of Motor Vehicles.      Suleman owes more than $30,000 to Amer Haddadin, the previous owner of her four-bedroom, three-bathroom home on Madonna Lane.      Through an agreement known as an all-inclusive trust deed, Suleman purchased the home from Haddadin more than three years ago. Suleman, who holds the deed, was responsible for making the monthly payments to Haddadin, who in turn, was to pay the mortgage.      But after Suleman fell 11 months behind on her $3,000 monthly payments, Haddadin also fell behind – prompting foreclosure proceedings.      A foreclosure auction involving the home, which was scheduled for Monday, has been postponed for a week.      Suleman, in an interview with the Register on April 11, acknowledged collecting $2,000 per month in food stamps.      She gave birth to eight babies in January 2009 after already having six. All of the children were conceived through fertility treatments.

"It's nonstop," she said.      "Everyone go pee-pee," she told her children. "Stand in line to go pee."      The Orange County, California, home she bought after she gave birth to octuplets three years ago is in foreclosure, but she says she has no fears of becoming homeless.      "God forbid that we lose the house, I have a very good friend and her husband -- huge house, and they're offering," she said. But her goal is to raise enough cash to buy a new home outright, with no mortgage, she said.      Suleman said no two years ago when an adult film company offered to pay off her mortgage if she would sign a movie contract, but she's open to another offer now, she said.      "If it's a job, and it's a well-paying job, and it's going to allow me to get us out of here and into a very safe huge home that they deserve, then I'm going to do it," she said. But she would allow no kissing and no touching.      Although she said previously that she would never pose nude for money, she recently earned $8,000 for posing topless for a British magazine.      "You know, if the opportunity comes up, I'll be the first to admit I'm gonna eat my words, because all that matters is that I can take care of my family," she said.      She pushed back at the negative media reports questioning how she's raising her children.      "Look at what's happened," she said. "They're over 3, not one broken bone, not one injury, not one child with a disability."      Social workers visited her home recently to check on reports that it was filthy and unfit. But they found nothing wrong, she said.      Graffiti on the walls, put there by her oldest son as a way of venting his frustration, and holes punched by a son who is autistic, do not mean its not a safe, happy home, she said.      "I'm so done," she said. "You people, you keep your business to yourself, and I'll keep my business to myself. My kids are healthy, they're happy, they've got food."      The octuplets -- six boys and two girls -- are actually easier to care for than the six older children, she said.      "They're so, so good because I started from day one implementing structure and discipline," she said.      Her main disciplinary tool is a "time out rug," she said.      "It's a very important spot because most of them don't really need it anymore," she said. "But at this point, all I have to do is just point to it."      Her children eat up to 10 meals a day, she said.      "They eat all the time, every hour, two hours, they get a meal, and we're talking meals that are vegetables, fruit, oatmeal," she said.      She gets $2,000 a month in Food Stamp assistance to help feed them. Applying for the state aid was a low point for her, she said.      "I cried making that call, and you know what? I'd do it again," she said. "But my goal, my goal is to get off this immediately."      Suleman dreams of building a business "empire" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children.      She ultimately hopes to become a role model for other women facing major struggles, she said.      "In the future, and I've got to win the battle," she said. "But right now, people don't understand that." |||||	– Child-rich but cash-poor California mother Nadya Suleman filed for bankruptcy yesterday. The mother of 14, including her famous 3-year-old octuplets, has some $50,000 in assets, but owes up to $1 million to her father, a Christian school, the city of La Habra's water department, and the previous owner of her house, which is now in foreclosure, the Orange County Register reports. "I have to do what is best for my children, and I need a fresh start," says Suleman, who was recently visited by social services following claims her children were living in squalor. Suleman denies media reports that she isn't taking care of her children properly. "You people, you keep your business to yourself, and I'll keep my business to myself," she tells CNN. "My kids are healthy, they're happy, they've got food." Suleman says she has no fear of becoming homeless. While she has friends that she and the kids could stay with if she loses her home, she hopes to raise enough cash to buy a house outright with no mortgage. To do so, she says, she'd even be willing to appear in a porn film—as long as she doesn't have to touch anybody. "I would not kiss somebody. I wouldn't touch somebody," she explains.
summarize: Sister Lucia, the last survivor of the three Portuguese shepherd children who told of a series of apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the village of Fátima in 1917, died on Sunday in her convent in Coimbra, Portugal. She was 97.      A spokeswoman for her order, the Carmelite Sisters, announced her death to the Portuguese news media.      She had lived in near isolation since 1948 in the convent, where she had devoted her life to prayer and meditation.      Sister Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, originally named Lucia Abobora, was born on March 22, 1907, and was 10 when she and her two cousins, Francisco Marto and his sister Jacinta, said they first saw the Virgin in a field on May 13, 1917. Lucia said she was the only one of the three who could hear what the Virgin said.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Their reports, which said the appearances continued for five months, were greeted with skepticism, and the children were even jailed and asked to retract their statements. But their visions were followed by what witnesses described as "the Miracle of the Sun," in which the sun was said to have broken through rain clouds and trembled and spun for 10 minutes, which was taken as confirmation of the visions. ||||| FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2005 file photo, a devotee holds a picture during the funeral of Sister Lucia Marto at the Coimbra Cathedral before her burial in the graveyard of the Carmelite convent,... (Associated Press)      FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2005 file photo, a devotee holds a picture during the funeral of Sister Lucia Marto at the Coimbra Cathedral before her burial in the graveyard of the Carmelite convent,... (Associated Press)      LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Catholic Church officials in Portugal said Monday they have assembled more than 15,000 pages of testimony and documentation to support the proposed beatification of Sister Lucia, one of three shepherd children who said the Virgin Mary appeared to them in the town of Fatima 100 years ago.      The officials said the case for Sister Lucia's beatification — the first step toward canonization as a saint — will be sent to the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in line with church procedure.      The documentation was presented at a church ceremony in the convent in Coimbra, 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Lisbon, where Sister Lucia lived from 1948 until her death at age 97 in 2005.      Her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto, who also said they witnessed the apparitions, died at ages 9 and 11 of pneumonia. They were beatified in 2000.      The Catholic bishop of Coimbra, Virgilio Antunes, said the documentation on Sister Lucia took eight years to compile and includes information from 11,000 letters she wrote as well as some 61 witness statements.      If the Vatican congregation's experts agree a candidate for beatification lived a virtuous life, the case is forwarded to the pope, who signs a decree attesting to the candidate's virtues.      Pope Francis is to visit Fatima, a small farming town dominated by the Catholic shrine erected to honor the apparitions, on May 12-13 for the pilgrimage marking their centenary. He will be the fourth pontiff to visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima. ||||| Versions of the secret, broadcast on hundreds of Web sites (usually under headlines like, ''Third Secret Revealed!'') range from worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.      Fatima fanatics have held hunger strikes -- one even hijacked a plane -- to try to force the Vatican to disclose the secret. During John Paul's first visit to the shrine in 1982, on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt, a knife-wielding Spanish priest tried to kill the pope, but was wrestled to the ground by security officers.      John Paul has always credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving his life. After he visited the shrine in 1982 to give thanks for his survival, a bullet extracted from his body was placed alongside diamonds in a gold crown worn by a statue of the Virgin.      In 1991, on the 10th anniversary of the attack, he returned again to give thanks for his life as well as for the collapse of Communism, which believers say the Virgin of Fatima also predicted in 1917.      ''On the solemn occasion of his visit to Fatima, his holiness has directed me to make an announcement to you,'' Cardinal Sodano said, adding that the pope ''wishes his pilgrimage to be a renewed gesture of gratitude to Our Lady for her protection during these years of his papacy.      ''This protection seems also to be linked to the so-called third part of the secret of Fatima.''      The cardinal said the secret in its entirety would soon be published by the Vatican ''after the preparation of an appropriate commentary.''      The pope did refer to the prophecies today, speaking of ''Fatima, where these times of tribulation were foretold,'' but he made no mention of the ''third secret.'' Instead, he once again gave thanks ''for the goodness of God toward me, when severely struck on that May 13, 1981, I was rescued from death.''      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The pope first learned of the secret a few days after he was elected in 1978, the Vatican said. He did not announce it himself today, said his spokesman, Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, because he was ''personally involved.'' Vatican officials did not say why the secret was not revealed sooner after the assassination attempt in 1981.      In a new tribute at a prayer service at the shrine on Friday night, the pope donated to the shrine the ring given to him by Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the late primate of Poland. Cardinal Wyszynski, whose long fight against Communism in Poland inspired the present pope and millions of their countrymen, told John Paul after his election in 1978 that he would lead the church into the new millennium.

He described the ring as ''one of the pope's most precious possessions,'' given as an offer of thanks.      The fact that the pope put the two dead witnesses to the Virgin's apparitions on the path of sainthood today was another sign of his devotion to Fatima. The two, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, are the first children ever beatified by the Roman Catholic Church who were not martyrs. Beatification, which is bestowed only on the dead, is the penultimate step before sainthood.      Before the ceremony, the pope, who turns 80 on Thursday, met privately inside the basilica near the children's tombs with the third surviving witness to the apparition, Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, 93, a Carmelite nun, who believers say was the main recipient of prophecies from the Virgin about 20th century debacles. The Vatican said that it had consulted with Sister Lucia before making its announcement today.      The Virgin of Fatima was said to have appeared before three shepherd children on May 13, 1917, and on five later occasions. Lucia was 10. Her cousins, Francisco and Jacinta, who were 8 and 7, died in the influenza pandemic a few years later. Believers say two of the Fatima secrets were revealed in writing by Lucia in the 1940's. The third secret was put in a sealed envelope and sent to Rome more than 40 years ago.      Interpretations of the secrets vary, but generally believers think that the first foretold the end of World War I and the start of World War II, and that the other predicted the spread, then the collapse of Communism and the conversion of Russia.      The latter prophecy, which came with a request that the church consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, made Fatima an ideological shrine for anti-Communists during the cold war. John Paul II finally consecrated the whole world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1984.      Fatima, like the rest of Portugal, also had fascist links during World War II, when Portugal was neutral under the right-wing dictatorship of Antonio Salazar but traded with the Nazi regime. This month, the rector of the sancutary, Luciano Guerra, confirmed news reports that in 1976 Fatima received Nazi gold bars bearing the Third Reich insignia looted from Jews during the war, and sold them in 1982 and 1986 to finance construction at the sanctuary.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Today, many pilgrims, some wearing baseball hats emblazoned with the names of Jacinta and Francisco, cheered after Cardinal Sodano delivered his message.      ''It's wonderful that the pope knew the prophecy and survived it,'' said Lucia Dias, 31, a lawyer from Sintra, who added that she had once believed that the third secret was a prophecy of World War III. She made her own prediction about the pope: ''I think now he will die soon.''      Until today, besides John Paul and Sister Lucia, the only other living person believed to be privy to the secret was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 1996, he told Portugal's main Catholic radio station that there was nothing worrisome in the message, and that it remained secret because the Vatican wanted to avoid ''confusing religious prophecy with sensationalism.''      Whether today's announcement will appease some of the more fanatical devotees of the ''third secret'' mystery is unclear. Some of those believers, who choose to view the reforms of the Second Vatican Council as heresies predicted by the Virgin of Fatima, may dismiss the Vatican's announcement as a cover-up.      Even some who attended Mass today seemed let down. ''What they said all happened in the past,'' Julio Estela, 33, a car salesman from northern Portugal, said after the cardinal spoke. ''This isn't a prediction. It's disappointing. I think there's more.'' |||||	– Catholic Church officials in Portugal said Monday they have assembled more than 15,000 pages of testimony and documentation to support the proposed beatification of Sister Lucia, one of three shepherd children who said the Virgin Mary appeared to them in the town of Fatima in 1917. The officials said the case for Sister Lucia's beatification—the first step toward canonization as a saint—will be sent to the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in line with church procedure. Her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto, who also said they witnessed the apparitions, died at ages 9 and 11 of pneumonia during the 1918 influenza pandemic. They were beatified in 2000, reports the AP. The documentation was presented at a church ceremony in the convent in Coimbra, 120 miles north of Lisbon, where Sister Lucia lived from 1948 until her death at age 97 in 2005. In her obituary, the New York Times reported that Lucia said only she heard what Mary told the children. The third of the "three secrets" of Fatima, said to relate to the attempted assassination of John Paul II in 1981, was revealed in 2000. The Catholic bishop of Coimbra, Virgilio Antunes, said the documentation on Sister Lucia took eight years to compile and includes information from 11,000 letters she wrote as well as some 61 witness statements. Pope Francis is to visit Fatima on May 12-13 for the pilgrimage marking their centenary. He will be the fourth pontiff to visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima.
summarize:      FILE: HIV medication. HIV medication      Disappointed researchers reported on Thursday that a second child thought to have been cured of HIV is showing signs of infection.      The patient, a boy born born at a hospital in Milan in December 2009, had only stopped treatment for two weeks when his viral load surged from being undetectable to 36,840 copies per mL.      The news was especially devastating because -- unlike the child in Mississippi who missed treatments because her mother did not bring her back to for followup visits -- doctors in this case stopped the anti-retrovirals on purpose.      The boy, who began receiving aggressive therapy within 12 hours of his birth, was being closely monitored and continued to test negative for HIV on even the most sensitive tests since he began treatment. Writing in this week's edition of the journal Lancet, his doctors said that at the time the child was around 3 years old, they determined that treatment might no longer be necessary, given the results and in view of "recent reports of apparent cure of HIV infection."      The Mississippi baby made headlines last fall when a study about her apparent cure was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In a phone interview, Mario Clerici, a professor at the University of Milan and a co-author of the study, said the mother of the boy in the Lancet study read stories on the Internet about the Mississippi case and asked clinicians to stop her own child's therapy. HIV treatments can have a number of serious, long-term side effects, including damage to bones, liver and heart and she felt that if they could avoid subjecting her child to those risks they should, Clerici said.      "We had a long discussion and we also spoke with all our colleagues around the world, and we all said it looks like the Mississippi baby is cured, so let's do it. Unfortunately, it was not the reality," Clerici said.      One week after stopping treatment, the child still appeared to be cured, but two weeks later the child's viral load rebounded and the team restarted anti-retrovirals. By the third week, the boy's his viral load appeared to be under control and fell to low levels, but other tests for HIV turned positive. Clerici said the child's viral load has since returned to undetectable levels and that researchers are watching to see if the child will be able to clear all signs of the virus again with continued treatment.      In July, U.S. government researchers announced what Clerici and his colleagues already feared -- that the Mississippi baby had also not been cured. In a routine clinical visit, researchers found that girl, who was nearly 4 years old at the time and had been off of treatment for more than two years, had detectable levels of the virus.      A third baby who was thought to be cured and who was born near Los Angeles has not stopped treatment and remains free of the virus. Scientists now believe that reservoirs of HIV may be hiding in the body even when the virus appears to be gone, but can't be detected by current testing methods. ||||| Image copyright SPL      Giving drugs within hours of HIV infection is not a cure, say doctors treating a baby in Milan, Italy.      The newborn infant cleared the virus from their bloodstream, but HIV re-emerged soon after antiretroviral treatment stopped.      Doctors had hoped rapid treatment would might prevent HIV becoming established in the body.      Experts said there was "still some way to go" before a cure was found.      Drug treatments have come a long way since HIV came to global attention in the 1980s and infection is no longer a death sentence.      However, antiretrovirals merely clear the virus from the bloodstream leaving reservoirs of HIV in other organs untouched.      The hope was that acting before the reservoirs formed would be an effective cure.      HIV baby      Doctors at the University of Milan and the Don Gnocchi Foundation in the city have reported a case, in the Lancet medical journal, of a baby born to a mother with HIV in 2009.      Drug treatment started shortly after birth and the virus rapidly disappeared from the bloodstream. HIV was undetectable at the age of three.      The doctors said: "In view of these results, and recent reports of apparent cure of HIV infection, and in agreement with the mother, we stopped antiretroviral therapy."      For one week everything seemed fine, but in the second week, after treatment stopped, the virus had returned.      Image copyright SPL Image caption The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system      Prof Mario Clerici, from the University of Milan, told the BBC News website: "Just a couple of hours after infection, the virus has already started seeding the organs and hides so therapy cannot eradicate HIV.      "You can treat patients, but you cannot cure them. Right now it is impossible."      In July, a baby girl in the US born with HIV and believed cured after very early treatment was found to still harbour the virus.      Doctors said tests on the four-year-old child from Mississippi indicated she was no longer in remission.      She had appeared free of HIV as recently as March, without receiving treatment for nearly two years.      "A cure for HIV is still at ground zero," said Prof Clerici.      Distant prospect      Commenting on the findings Prof Sanjaya Senanayake, from the Australian National University Medical School, said: "This case shows that undetectable HIV in the blood does not mean that the body is free from virus and that there is still some way to go before a cure is found."      Only one person has been "cured" of HIV.      In 2007, Timothy Ray Brown received a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV.      He has shown no signs of infection for more than five years. |||||	– "The search for an HIV cure continues." That from a new study published in The Lancet that reports a second child believed to have been cured of HIV has seen a return of the virus. A baby boy, born HIV-positive in Milan in December 2009, was given antiretroviral treatment to fight the virus within 12 hours of birth, the Washington Post reports. The virus quickly became undetectable in his blood. HIV treatments can cause heart damage and other significant side effects, and so after reading about the apparent cure of a Mississippi baby born with HIV, the boy's mother asked doctors to stop the then-3-year-old's treatment. They agreed to do so. In the first week, the child's viral load was undetectable. In the second week, it jumped to 36,840 copies per mL. While antiretrovirals can rid the bloodstream of the virus, they don't attack reservoirs of HIV in organs, which scientists are currently unable to test. Researchers had hoped the boy's early treatment would keep reservoirs from forming, but that now appears to have been a pipe dream. "Just a couple of hours after infection, the virus has already started seeding the organs and hides so therapy cannot eradicate HIV," study co-author Mario Clerici tells the BBC. "You can treat patients, but you cannot cure them. Right now it is impossible." The boy's renewed treatment has again brought the virus to undetectable levels. The Mississippi baby's HIV has also returned. (Meanwhile, researchers have traced the HIV pandemic to a 1920s African metropolis.)
summarize: Abstract Background and Purpose Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in survivors of acute life-threatening illness, but little is known about the burden of PTSD in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study estimated the prevalence of stroke or TIA-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment were included. PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample were abstracted from all included studies. The coding of all articles included demographics, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. Results Nine studies (N = 1,138) met our inclusion criteria. PTSD rates varied significantly across studies by timing of PTSD assessment (i.e., within 1 year of stroke/TIA versus greater than 1 year post-stroke/TIA; 55% of heterogeneity explained; Q 1 = 10.30; P = .001). Using a random effects model, the estimated rate of PTSD following stroke or TIA was 23% (95% CI, 16%–33%) within 1 year of the stroke or TIA and 11% (95% CI, 8%–14%) after 1 year. Conclusions Although PTSD is commonly thought to be triggered by external events such as combat or sexual assault, these results suggest that 1 in 4 stroke or TIA survivors develop significant PTSD symptoms due to the stroke or TIA. Screening for PTSD in a large population-based prospective cohort study with cardiovascular outcome assessments is needed to yield definitive prevalence, and determine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or mortality.

Introduction Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder initiated by exposure to a traumatic event and is characterized by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance of reminders of the event, persistent negative mood and cognition, and physiological hyperarousal that persist for at least 1 month after the event. Observational evidence suggests that PTSD is related to increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease [1] [2]. A recent meta-analysis further suggests that PTSD triggered by cardiovascular events - specifically, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - is associated with a doubling of risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality [3] [4]. Until recently, only a few studies assessed PTSD due to stroke, another potentially traumatic acute cardiovascular event. Prevalence estimates in these studies has varied from 3–37% [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. A more recent study, the largest on this topic to date, found that 18% of 535 stroke or TIA survivors reported clinically significant PTSD symptoms. While the association between stroke or TIA-induced PTSD and risk for recurrent stroke or other cardiovascular events was not examined, participants in this study were nearly three times more likely than those without PTSD symptoms to report medication nonadherence [13]. These data suggest that, similar to ACS-induced PTSD, stroke or TIA-induced PTSD may increase risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events. This meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies was designed to estimate the overall prevalence of PTSD due to stroke or TIA.      Methods Search Strategy and Selection Criteria We sought to identify all studies that reported a valid prevalence estimate of PTSD due to stroke or TIA. Included studies must have been observational cohorts and must have assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment. Further, studies must have used a self-report PTSD screening instrument or clinical interview designed or specifically altered to query about only stroke or TIA-induced PTSD. For the one study that reported multiple PTSD assessments, we abstracted only the earliest estimate (at 1 month post-stroke) [10]. Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles published in English were identified by a search of the biomedical electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus conducted by an information specialist (L.F.) with expertise in behavioral medicine. Databases were searched from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. All relevant subject headings and free-text terms were used to represent PTSD and stroke or TIA and the sets of terms were combined with AND. Terms for MEDLINE included: exp Stress Disorders, Traumatic/OR ptsd.tw. OR (post-traumatic OR (post adj traumatic)).tw or posttraumatic.tw. AND exp stroke/OR Stroke$.tw OR cerebrovascular.tw. OR ((brain or vascular or lacunar or venous or cerebral or isch?emic) adj2 (accident$ or infarct$ or event$ or attack$)).tw. Search terms were adapted for the other databases. Additional records were identified by scanning the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews and by employing the Related Articles feature in PubMed/Medline and the Cited Reference Search in Scopus. To determine the studies to be assessed further, two authors (S.R., D.E.) independently read the title, or title and abstract of every record retrieved. Opinion differences were resolved by consensus. All potentially relevant articles were investigated as full text. Database Construction and Coding We abstracted PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample from all included studies (Table 1). The coding of all articles included demographic information, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. We also evaluated the quality of each study based on the Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research (MORE)- Observational Studies of Incidence or Prevalence of Chronic Diseases developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [14]. One study’s prevalence estimate, 7 and another’s demographic characteristics were uncertain [9], so authors were contacted to obtain this information. We converted one study’s prevalence estimate to make it consistent with the method used by the other studies that estimated prevalence using a screening questionnaire [13]. All studies that were included used either diagnostic interviews or well-validated self-report screening questionnaires that assessed PTSD specifically due to stroke or TIA.

Characteristics of Studies on the Prevalence of Stroke-Induced PTSD. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066435.t001 Quantitative Methods Comprehensive Meta-analysis (version 2, BioStat Software, Engelwood, NJ) served as the statistical platform for completing all statistical tests and associated graphic results. To summarize the prevalence findings, we computed prevalence point estimates using these formulas: Logit Event Rate = Log [Event Rate/(1 �?� Event Rate)]. Event Rate Standard Error = �?�(1/(Event Rate ·Sample Size)/(1/[(1�?�Event Rate) · Sample Size]), We computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using this formula: Lower Limit = Logit Event Rate �?� (1.96 · Logit Event Rate Standard Error). Upper Limit = Logit Event Rate+(1.96 · Logit Event Rate Standard Error). Results are presented after back-transformation. There was statistically significant heterogeneity in prevalence estimates, so random-effects models were used. In addition, we used sensitivity analyses to assess evidence of moderator effects for the prevalence results across two methodological factors: (1) method and (2) timing of PTSD assessment. Finally, we produced a forest plot and calculated both the classic and Orwin’s fail-safe N to address the issue of publication bias.      Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analytic review of stroke or TIA-induced PTSD. We found an overall prevalence of 13% among stroke/TIA survivors, with 23% prevalence in the first year post-stroke and 11% after the first year. Given that about 85% of the 795,000 patients who experience a stroke each year in the US [15] survive at least 30 days [16], and up to an additional 500,000 suffer from a TIA [17], these results suggest that 297,850 stroke and TIA survivors in the United States alone will develop PTSD symptoms due to the event annually. Within 90 days of the index stroke, 6% of survivors experience a recurrent stroke [18], and recurrence rates increase substantially over longer term follow up [19]. We do not yet know if stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is associated with increased risk for a recurrent cerebrovascular attack, but given the doubling of ACS recurrence risk due to ACS-induced PTSD [3] and recent research showing that PTSD is strongly associated with medication nonadherence [13], such research is sorely needed. Important caveats to this review include the fact that only studies with relatively small sample sizes have addressed stroke-induced PTSD, and one of the studies represented half of all of the participants included in this review. Also, none of the included studies used population-based sampling, and all but one study [10] relied on cross-sectional designs (and we used only the earliest point estimate, 1 month after stroke). Further, the PTSD screening questionnaires used in many of the studies have not been validated against clinical diagnosis of PTSD in survivors of stroke/TIA, though they perform very well in other patient populations. Thus, although this meta-analysis was able to quantify more precisely the prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD symptoms, a clear need for additional research remains. It is also important to note that we were very strict in our inclusion of only studies that measured PTSD specifically due to the stroke event, so these estimates may represent an underestimate of the total burden of PTSD symptoms in these participants in so much as PTSD due to other types of events may have been present. The estimated prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD was lower when PTSD was assessed by clinical interview. This may be due to the fact that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders is often higher when measured using diagnostic instruments as compared to clinical psychiatric interviews Nevertheless, research on the association between ACS-induced PTSD and ACS recurrence and mortality risk suggests that even elevated symptoms of PTSD, not clinical diagnosis, is associated with increased risk. Hence, the estimate of the prevalence of PTSD symptoms based on diagnostic instruments may still be clinically relevant [3]. Study Limitations Prevalence estimates were limited to patients who could participate in PTSD assessments and hence should be extrapolated to patients with severe cognitive impairment or aphasia with caution. Similarly, these results should be interpreted with awareness that the mean age of the participants was slightly low relative to the entire population of stroke survivors and PTSD is associated with younger age in ACS-induced PTSD [3], and therefore our rate estimate may not generalize to older stroke survivors. We were unable to determine whether the prevalence of PTSD differed if due to TIA or stroke, as the only study to include TIA survivors [13] did not record the proportion of participants who experienced either condition. Moreover, none of the studies reported on the severity of the stroke event in terms of the types of critical care that may have been necessitated such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Only one of the studies included in this review evaluated for stroke lesion localization [6], suggesting the need to further examine whether stroke location (i.e. hemisphere, etc) or the nature of the associated deficits (i.e. paresis/paralysis, aphasia, anosagnosia) further differentiate PTSD risk. Such knowledge would allow clinicians to identify those at higher risk for PTSD to implement early intervention. Similarly, we opted to retain one study that focused on PTSD due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, which clinicians and epidemiologists view as a distinct condition from stroke/TIA, because of the similarities in patient experience and because the aggregate estimate was not sensitive to its exclusion. Future research should determine whether PTSD due to subarachnoid hemorrhage is rightly grouped with PTSD due to stroke/TIA. It is also important to note the difference in prevalence estimates reported in studies that assessed PTSD by screening questionnaire versus clinical interview. Although screening questionnaires are often used to identify patients who should be further assessed for PTSD diagnosis–and therefore may overestimate prevalence–reliance on screening questionnaires for estimates of stroke-induced PTSD prevalence may further inflate those estimates due to overlap in symptoms of stroke and PTSD. Very little is known about the validity of PTSD questionnaire items in stroke survivors, but the evidence that exists suggests that PTSD questionnaires are valid in this population. In one study, confirmatory factor analysis of responses to the PTSD Checklist-specific for stroke conformed to the established factor structure for PTSD due to other types of events [13]. In another small study, PTSD severity was not related to either lesion site or neurologic and memory deficits that could be expected to inflate PTSD symptoms were the scale not valid [6]. Further research on the influence of neurologic and cognitive deficits on PTSD symptom expression is sorely needed. Finally, future research should also consider concomitance with other comorbid stroke factors including depression, however, it is important to note that the effect of ACS-induced PTSD on ACS recurrence and mortality is independent of depression [3]. Conclusions Across published studies estimating the prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD, two general conclusions can be drawn: (1) stroke-induced PTSD is relatively common, with approximately one in four experiencing PTSD in the first year after stroke and one in nine experiencing chronic PTSD over a year later, and (2) based on a single study, stroke-induced PTSD symptoms appear to influence important secondary prevention behaviors such as medication adherence [13], independent of depression. Though no data now exist to address the issue, if the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular event recurrence associated with stroke-induced PTSD is comparable to that found for PTSD after ACS, stroke-induced PTSD may be a significant, novel risk factor for recurrent stroke, especially given its high prevalence after stroke. Screening for PTSD in a large, population-based prospective cohort study would yield definitive prevalence and secondary risk estimates, and should be a priority for researchers. In the meantime, clinicians should be mindful that PTSD can be a devastating mental health condition and should consider screening for PTSD in stroke survivors. ||||| Post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD, is not just a problem for military veterans, sexual assault survivors and other crime victims — it also plagues many stroke victims, according to new research.      The study, published online Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, reports that 23% of stroke and mini-stroke victims surveyed within one year of the event suffered from PTSD. In addition, 11% of stroke victims surveyed more than a year after the event reported that they experienced PTSD.      A stroke occurs when an artery carrying essential oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked or bursts, causing damage to the brain and potentially impairing speech, sight and motor control. A mini-stroke, also known as a transient ischemic attack, occurs in a similar way but lasts only a few minutes.      Strokes kill about 137,000 people per year in the United States and in 2010 led to $73.7 billion in healthcare costs.      The new research developed from a growing awareness that medical traumas can lead to PTSD. Study leader Donald Edmondson, an assistant professor at Columbia University, previously established that PTSD is common among heart attack survivors and that it is linked to an increased risk of later developing heart disease. This led his team to question how often stroke victims develop PTSD.      “For something especially acute and scary like a stroke, we wondered: Why couldn’t that be a trigger for PTSD?” said Dr. Ian Kronish, a general internist at Columbia and part of the research team.      PTSD is an anxiety disorder affecting about 7.7 million American adults. It is characterized by a traumatic event that leads to three families of symptoms: flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of anything that triggers memories of the event, and hyper-vigilance.      Scouring medical publications, the team compiled as much information as they could about PTSD prevalence in stroke victims. They found nine completed studies that met their criteria. In seven of the studies, participants were diagnosed with PTSD through a screening questionnaire, while interviews with a clinician were used for diagnosis in the other two studies.      The data from the nine studies were combined for a total of 1,138 participants, all from the U.S. or Europe. All participants were assessed for PTSD between one and 60 months after the stroke.      PTSD appeared more commonly within a year of the stroke (23% of participants) than a year or more out (11%). Kronish was surprised by the findings.      “1 in 4 is a big number,” Kronish said about the studies examining PTSD within one year. “Until doing this research, I hadn’t really thought of PTSD being due to a medical event.”      One limitation of the study was that in several cases, participants were assessed for PTSD using questionnaires that had not been cross-validated with clinical interviews among stroke victims.      Future research aims to further examine the link between stroke and PTSD by following the same group of participants over time in order to specifically address whether the disorder increases the risk of additional strokes and heart disease.      Future research will also examine how mental health intervention may reduce symptoms specifically in stroke victims.      The study is available at the PLOS One website.

An MRI scan of the brain can show a stroke. (Photo: Photo Disc) Story Highlights PTSD may hinder recovery after a stroke or mini-stroke      Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the USA      Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability      A stroke may leave some survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder, which may hinder their recovery, according to a study released today.      About 23% of patients who survive a stroke or transient ischemic attack, a brief interruption of blood flow to the brain, have PTSD symptoms within a year, the study finds. About 11% have chronic PTSD, in which symptoms last three months or longer, more than a year later. The study, led by Columbia University Medical Center researchers, was published online today in the journal PLOS ONE.      "Strokes are among the most terrifying life-threatening events," says lead author Donald Edmondson.      People think about PTSD in relation to external events like war or sexual assault, says Edmondson, assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health. "There is something different about PTSD after a stroke because the threat is inside your body," he adds.      The analysis looked at nine studies of PTSD induced by a stroke or TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke. The studies included 1,138 stroke or TIA survivors in France, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. The average age of participants was 64.5 and 47.5% were men.      PTSD can develop after an event involving physical harm or the threat of physical harm, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Symptoms include having nightmares, avoiding reminders of the event and feeling tense. Treatments are psychotherapy, medications or a combination.      Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the USA, according to the American Stroke Association. It is a leading cause of serious long-term disability.      Ralph Sacco, an American Heart Association spokesman who was not involved in the study, says Edmondson's research looks at an under-recognized condition. "This is one of the first studies that investigates what's in the literature about PTSD after a stroke or TIA," he adds. "We often think of PTSD as coming on after other kinds of stressful events — wars or other emotional events.      "A stroke or TIA can be an emotionally charged event — some strokes can be life-threatening or potentially disabling," says Sacco, chairman of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami.      Edmondson says, "Our current results show that PTSD in stroke and TIA survivors may increase their risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events."      The concern is that PTSD may threaten recovery. Previous research has shown that PTSD is associated with patients not adhering to their schedule for taking medications.      Sacco recommends that stroke patients who suspect that they have PTSD symptoms get medical attention.      Edmondson says there are good PTSD treatments. "But first, physicians and patients have to be aware that this is a problem," he says. "Family members can also help. We know that social support is a good protective factor against PTSD due to any type of traumatic event."      He adds, "The next step is further research to assess whether mental health treatment can reduce stroke- or TIA-induced PTSD symptoms and help these patients regain a feeling of normalcy and calm as soon as possible after their health scare."

About 23% of stroke and mini-stroke patients will develop post-traumatic stress disorder within a year, while 11% battle the disorder after 12 months, according to a study published in PLoS One. While PTSD is usually linked to sexual assault or war, "there is something different about PTSD after a stroke because the threat is inside your body," study lead, Donald Edmondson, tells USA Today, noting that PTSD may threaten recovery and increase the risk of recurrent strokes. The research looked at nine studies showing PTSD was brought on by strokes or mini-strokes in 1,138 survivors in Europe and the US. Two studies used clinical diagnosis while the other seven used questionnaires—a drawback, reports the LA Times, since questionnaire diagnoses were not cross-verified.

summarize: Swedish furniture giant Ikea halted sales of elkmeat lasagnes across all its European stores after a batch tested positive for pork in a Belgian lab.            It was in late March that Belgian authorities discovered that the elk mince, produced by Swedish food manufacturer Familjen Dafgård and sold at Ikea stores, contained a bit over 1 percent pork, which is the limit for contamination of meat products.An estimated 10,000 tonnes of lasagne stored in the furniture giant's central warehouse and at its department stores have been blocked for sale, reported Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet (SvD) on Saturday.Ikea also withdrew a total of 17,600 packages of lasagne from its stores. All were produced at the Dafgård factory at the time the contamination is thought to have taken place.Anders Lennartsson, head of sustainability at Ikea, told SvD that it is not yet clear how many packages of the pork-contaminate elk lasagne have been bought by customers, but he believes it's a question of "small volumes"."The elkmeat lasagne production only started in January. Most products that could have traces of pork are in our warehouses and have not yet reached the department stores," said Lennartsson.Ikea decided to withdraw the elk lasagnes from all its European stores on the day the test results came in, but the company did not tell customers why it was doing so."We followed company routines," said Lennartsson."Since there were still many question marks, there were no grounds for informing the public while the investigation was ongoing. Now that it has been confirmed we will see how we can best communicate this."Dafgård also ordered its own tests that revealed four cases where the elkmeat lasagne contained small amounts of beef or pork.Dafgård put this down to a failure to clean the premises properly between the handling of different animals. The company said measures have been taken to ensure this is rectified.In a letter to Sweden's National Food Agency ( Livsmedelsverket ), Dafgård's head of quality said that the company has introduced stricter routines to avoid mixing different animal species.Ikea now plans to introduce a global standard for purchasing and processing meat products and to increase the number of supplier inspections.Ikea has not yet decided what to do with the thousands of tonnes of elkmeat stored in its warehouses, but Lennartsson said one possibility is to re-label the packages to show they contain pork.He said Ikea plans to inform the public about the Belgian lab find and encouraged concerned customers to get in touch. ||||| Ikea says it has withdrawn 17,000 portions of moose lasagna from its home furnishings stores in Europe after traces of pork were found in a batch tested in Belgium.      Ikea spokeswoman Tina Kardum said the product had only been on sale for a month when it was pulled off the shelves on March 22.      The company didn't announce the withdrawal publicly until Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet wrote about it Saturday.      Kardum said the company found out Friday that a follow-up test in Belgium confirmed the lasagna contained 1.6 percent pork. She said: "We have more information now. That's why we choose to inform now."      Ikea has previously recalled meatballs and other meat products sold in its cafeterias and frozen foods sections after tests showed they contained traces of horsemeat. |||||	– Maybe Ikea should just stick with furniture: First, its beef contained too much horse meat, and now its elk meat has too much pork. Ikea has pulled 17,000 packages of elk lasagna—you read that correctly—from stores across Europe because they contained about 1.6% pork, reports the Local of Sweden. The product had been on shelves for about a month before getting yanked in late March, but the chain didn't publicize the move until a Swedish paper wrote about it today, reports AP.
summarize: The measure would require the president's signature to become law.      Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a measure – by accident – that could legalize same-sex civil unions as part of a larger bill, lawmakers noted on Tuesday.      Conservative lawmakers voted for the bill’s passage without recognizing the included language that could be interpreted to change the definition of marriage, according to the daily La Nación. Lawmakers immediately called for President Laura Chinchilla to veto the bill.      José María Villalta, a lawmaker from San José, inserted the language into the bill. Villalta is a member of the leftist Broad Front Party. The language confers social rights and benefits of a civil union, free from discrimination, according to La Nación.      Villalta attached the measure to a reform of the Law of Young People, which covers various social services for young people and laws governing marriage.      “During the discussion in the first debate, we explained that the Law of Young People should be interpreted with this sense of opening to gays and no one objected,” Villalta said, according to La Republica.      Conservative politicians such as Justo Orozco, a member of the evangelical National Renovation Party, slammed the measure.      “That preference is not a right,” Orozco said, according to La Nación. “It’s a stunted development of sexual identity. It can change like alcoholism, tobacco addiction.”      Carlos Avendaño, a lawmaker from another evangelical party, the National Restoration Party, threw cold water on the measure. According to La Prensa Libre, Avendaño said the measure is a mirage because the law already established that marriage unions are between a man and a woman.      “The reference that is here is for heterosexual partners,” Avendaño said.      Marco Castillo, president of the Diversity Movement, said he was optimistic about the bill’s passage. However, for civil unions to survive, it would have to survive a constitutional challenge in the court.      “It is a big step forward for gay rights in Costa Rica,” Castillo said in a phone interview.      The legislation comes one day after thousands marched for gay marriage in San José. In 2011, Chinchilla said she would not oppose gay marriage if the courts allowed, but she has not campaigned on the issue. A poll at that time said 73 percent of Costa Ricans opposed same-sex marriage.      Currently, five Latin American countries recognize same-sex unions. Argentina and Uruguay recognize gay marriage, while Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador recognize same-sex unions, according to the Washington Post. ||||| The president told reporters on Wednesday morning that it is not the executive branch's role to interpret laws passed by Congress.

Courtesy Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.      Just days after lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizers kicked off a national campaign for marriage equality in Costa Rica, sexual diversity advocates here are celebrating a bizarre series of events in their favor.      After legislators “accidentally” passed a law that includes language that could open a path to same-sex civil unions in the Central American country, President Laura Chinchilla said on Wednesday that she would not veto it, as some lawmakers have urged.      “No, we’re going to go forward and will sign this law. We understand that the debate is over how some interpret the law and this alone is not sufficient for the executive to veto the law,” Chinchilla told reporters, according to a video posted by AmeliaRueda.com.      Tico Times Editorial A miracle on the Cuesta de Moras      The president added that the only members of government equipped to interpret the law are judges and lawmakers.      Communications Minister Carlos Roverssi confirmed the president’s statement, according to the daily La Nación.      On Monday, the Costa Rican Legislative Assembly passed the Law of Young People, which included a new version of the Family Code that recognizes the right to a common-law marriage “without discrimination against to human dignity.” Article 242 of Costa Rica's Family Code defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The modification of the Young People Law – if ruled constitutional by the country's Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court – would strike language defining unions specifically as that between a man and woman.      Supporters and many opponents believe the new language opens the legal possibility of same-sex unions.      In the past, Chinchilla has been lukewarm on her support for same-sex unions. In 2011, she said that she would not oppose the legalization of gay marriage in Costa Rica, but stopped short of a full endorsement, saying that it was not part of her “national agenda.”      In a meandering response to a reporter’s question about if and when she would support gay rights during U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit in early May, Chinchilla said, “I hope and trust that the debate truly can become much more balanced and more mature, without stigmatization and without disqualifications, and that, finally, will generate a decision in the Congress of the Republic.”      On Sunday, organizers with the Front for Equal Rights launched a national campaign for marriage equality, demanding full marital and family rights for LGBT couples in Costa Rica. According to the group’s Facebook page, they collected more than 2,000 signatures in support of the bill.      Past bills to legalize civil unions and common-law marriage between same-sex couples have languished in the legislature. Marco Castillo, president of the Diversity Movement, told The Tico Times last week that “religious fundamentalist” deputies and a lack of political will were the biggest hurdles to passing LGBT rights and protections in Costa Rica.      Costa Rica would be the first country in Central America to approve same-sex civil unions if the provision’s legal interpretation holds up in court. |||||	– Um ... whoops? Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly passed a bill Monday, and conservative lawmakers didn't realize until Tuesday that the bill could very well have just legalized same-sex civil unions, Tico Times reports, citing La Nación. Seems the lawmakers failed to recognize language that one leftist lawmaker inserted into the bill, which could be interpreted as changing the definition of marriage. (The measure was a reform of a law covering social services for youth, as well as marriage.) Specifically, the new version removes language defining unions as between a man and a woman, and says a common-law marriage can be obtained "without discrimination against to human dignity." But President Laura Chinchilla still has to sign the bill, and lawmakers are calling for her to veto it (though she said yesterday that she won't). Plus, even if it does survive, same-sex civil unions would need to make it through a court challenge.

Buzz60      In this 2007 file photo, adult film actress Stormy Daniels arrives for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. (Photo: Matt Sayles, AP)      President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen claims adult film actress Stormy Daniels violated a nondisclosure agreement and could have to pay $20 million in damages.      Daniels is accused in court filings of violating the nondisclosure agreement 20 times, which would amount to Cohen being entitled to $20 million in damages. Cohen and Trump also intend to push the dispute back into private arbitration proceedings, removing the ongoing legal drama from public view, according to Friday's court filings.      Daniels' story of an alleged affair has been the center of controversy for weeks after it was discovered Cohen paid the porn star $130,000 shortly before the 2016 presidential election.      Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, recently filed a lawsuit in California, claiming the nondisclosure was invalid because Trump never signed it and Cohen has discussed some aspects of the agreement publicly.      She has also offered to return the $130,000. Trump's representatives have denied he had a sexual relationship with Daniels.      More: Did the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels break the law?

The potential damages against Clifford, an actress in adult films who uses the stage name Stormy Daniels, were disclosed Friday in a filing in federal court in Los Angeles by Essential Consultants LLC, an entity that was set up by Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in 2016 to pay her $130,000 in exchange for her silence.      The company moved the lawsuit, filed by Daniels last week in California state court against Trump, to federal court, saying that neither Daniels, Trump nor the LLC are California residents and the amount of damages exceeds the $75,000 minimum for a case to proceed in federal court. Trump supports the transfer of the case between courts, according to Essential Consultants’ filing.      “It could be a strategic move to intimidate them,” said Joseph Rothberg, a lawyer with Brutzkus Gubner Rozansky Seror Weber LLP in Woodland Hills, California. “They may be saying, ‘We’re not going to make it easy for you.”’      Federal judges, who are appointed by the president, are perceived as somewhat more conservative than California state court judges, who are elected, according to Rothberg, who isn’t involved in the case. On top of that, the anti-Trump sentiment in California may have played a role in the decision, Rothberg said.      Daniels faces $1 million in damages for each violation of the agreement, according to Friday’s filing. Essential Consultants said it will file a request at the earliest opportunity to force Daniels to arbitrate the case privately rather than to litigate it in open court.      She sued on March 6 to nullify the confidentiality agreement she says she struck with Cohen in October 2016, before the presidential election, to keep quiet about the alleged affair. She argues the document is invalid because Trump didn’t sign it, even though she took the $130,000 offered in exchange for her silence.      Cohen has said he paid it himself, through a company he set up. Cohen has previously said neither the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign were involved in the payoff.      “The fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20 million in bogus ‘damages’ against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is truly remarkable,” Michael Avenatti, Daniels’s lawyer, said in an emailed statement. “We are not going away and we will not be intimidated by these threats.” ||||| President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer said former adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford could be liable for damages of at least $20 million for breaching a nondisclosure agreement that barred her from discussing an alleged extramarital affair with Mr. Trump.

They argue Stormy Daniels breached the agreement at least 20 times.      The actress claims she had an affair with Mr Trump that began in 2006 and lasted several months.      The president's lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said he paid her $130,000 of his own money to remain silent.      This is the first time President Trump has become directly involved in the case. He "vehemently denies" the alleged affair.      The lawyer acting for Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, this month filed a lawsuit aiming to scrap the non-disclosure agreement.      Michael Avenatti said the filing by the law firm representing the president were "unprecedented" and "yet another bullying tactic" against her.      The filing also sought a change of venue from state to federal court.      Ms Clifford says the 2016 agreement is invalid as Mr Trump did not sign it.      She first made claims of a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine.      The story came back into the public eye earlier this year when reports emerged she was paid not to discuss the alleged affair in the run-up to the 2016 election.

A similar request made on Mr Trump's behalf came from another lawyer, Charles Harder - best known for his handling of the Hulk Hogan sex tape case against Gawker and for defending Melania Trump in a suit against the Daily Mail.      This motion says: "Mr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by the law."      It is thought that moving the case to a federal court would help keep the case behind closed doors in arbitration - a view expressed by Ms Clifford's lawyer in a tweet.      Mr Avenatti alleged on Friday that the porn actress had been physically threatened, but did not give further details.      Ms Clifford has recorded an interview with the CBS network's 60 Minutes programme to air later this month about her fight to void the agreement.      A CrowdJustice campaign to raise funds for her legal fees has already raised almost $200,000.      Mr Trump has also obtained a restraining order against the adult film actress to try to prevent her sharing "confidential information" about their alleged relationship. |||||	– The latest development in the Stormy Daniels saga: Michael Cohen, the lawyer for President Trump who paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 after she signed a nondisclosure agreement related to her alleged affair with Trump, now says she could owe $20 million in damages. That's based on Cohen's allegations, which USA Today reports are detailed in a court filing, that she violated the terms of the NDA on 20 occasions, triggering $1 million in damages per violation. For her part, Daniels has sued the president, claiming the NDA is invalid because it's missing Trump's signature. The Wall Street Journal reports the filing says the damages could be owed to either Trump or Essential Consultants, the LLC through which Cohen paid Daniels the $130,000. The BBC reports the filing also requested the case be taken from state to federal court, upping the likelihood the case would go arbitration and exit the "public view," as USA Today puts it. Bloomberg reports the filing argues that neither Daniels nor Trump are residents of California, where Daniels' own lawsuit was filed; a Calif. lawyer not involved in the case says federal judges are generally seen as a bit more conservative than their California state counterparts. Here's how Michael Avenatti, Daniels' lawyer, responded on Twitter: "The fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20M in bogus 'damages' against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is remarkable. Likely unprecedented in our history. We are NOT going away and we will NOT be intimidated. #basta." (Daniels' lawyer says she has been physically threatened.)

President Trump Expected to Announce Steps on Border Wall      During the interview, which took place at the White House this morning, Trump said that Mexico would pay the U.S. back "100 percent."      He confirmed that U.S. taxpayer dollars would be used to start the construction but said reimbursement would follow.      "All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico," he said. "I'm just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. What I'm doing is good for the United States. It's also going to be good for Mexico. We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico."      When asked about the start of construction, Trump said it would happen in "months."      "As soon as we can, as soon as we can physically do it," he said. "I would say in months, yeah. I would say in months -- certainly planning is starting immediately."      In the hours after the ABC News interview took place, Trump issued two executive orders, one of which is about the commission of the border wall. The order calls for the secretary of homeland security to "take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border."      The order calls for agency and department heads to "identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico." It does not specifically state how or if those payment sources will be connected to the payment of the wall.      Trump talked about these orders during a speech he gave at the Department of Homeland Security this afternoon, saying that "Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders."      Talking about his executive orders, Trump predicted that they will "save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and billions and billions of dollars."

Patricia Roybal Caballero, D-Albuquerque, speaks at a press conference by the Democratic Party of New Mexico in downtown Albuquerque, N.M. Caballero... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation's immigration policies Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall and block federal grants from immigrant-protecting "sanctuary cities."      "We've been talking about this right from the beginning," Trump said during a brief signing ceremony at the Department of Homeland Security.      As of Wednesday afternoon, the White House had not circulated copies of the documents or briefed reporters on the details, as has been typical practice in past administrations. But Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of his campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. U.S. taxpayers are expected to pay for the upfront costs, though Trump continues to assert that Mexico will reimburse the money through unspecified means.      In an interview with ABC News earlier Wednesday, Trump said, "There will be a payment; it will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form."      While Trump has repeatedly said the border structure will be a wall, his spokesman Sean Spicer said more generally Wednesday the president was ordering construction of a "large physical barrier."      Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has insisted his country will not pay for a wall, is to meet with Trump at the White House next week.      The orders Trump signed Wednesday also increase the number of border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to be hired. And the president ordered the end of what Republicans have labeled a catch-and-release system at the border. Currently, some immigrants caught crossing the border illegally are released and given notices to report back to immigration officials at a later date.      Later in the week, Trump is expected to sign orders restricting the flow of refugees into the United States. His current proposal includes at least a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, as well as a temporary ban on people coming from some Muslim-majority countries, according to a source from a public policy organization that monitors refugee issues. The person was briefed on the details of that proposed action by a government official and outlined the plan to The Associated Press.      The public policy organization source insisted on anonymity in order to outline the plans ahead of the president's official announcements.      Trump campaigned on pledges to tighten U.S. immigration policies, including strengthening border security and stemming the flow of refugees. His call for a border wall was among his most popular proposals with supporters, who often broke out in chants of "build that wall" during rallies.      In response to terrorism concerns, Trump controversially called for halting entry to the U.S. from Muslim countries. He later turned to a focus on "extreme vetting" for those coming from countries with terrorism ties.      To build the wall, the president may rely on a 2006 law that authorized several hundred miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile frontier. That bill led to the construction of about 700 miles of various kinds of fencing designed to block both vehicles and pedestrians.      The Secure Fence Act was signed by then-President George W. Bush, and the majority of that fencing in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California was built before he left office. The last remnants were completed after President Barack Obama took office in 2009.      The Trump administration also must adhere to a decades-old border treaty with Mexico that limits where and how structures can be buil. The 1970 treaty requires that structures cannot disrupt the flow of the rivers, which define the U.S.-Mexico border along Texas and 24 miles in Arizona, according to The International Boundary and Water Commission, a joint U.S.-Mexican agency that administers the treaty.      Trump's order to crack down on sanctuary cities — locales that don't cooperate with immigration authorities — could cost individual jurisdictions millions of dollars. But the administration may face legal challenges, given that some federal courts have found that local jurisdictions cannot hold immigrants beyond their jail term or deny them bond based only a request from immigration authorities.      It appeared as though the refugee restrictions were still being finalized. The person briefed on the proposals said they included a ban on entry to the U.S. for at least 30 days from countries including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, though the person cautioned the details could still change.      There is also likely to be an exception for those fleeing religious persecution if their religion is a minority in their country. That exception could cover Christians fleeing Muslim-majority nations.      As president, Trump can use an executive order to halt refugee processing. Bush used that same power in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Refugee security vetting was reviewed and the process was restarted several months later.      ___      Zoll reported from New York. AP writer Alicia A.

"We've been talking about this right from the beginning," he said during a stop at the Homeland Security department, per AP. In a separate interview with ABC News, the president said he expected construction to begin in "months." He added that while the US would pay upfront, Mexico would eventually reimburse the nation. "I'm just telling you there will be a payment," he said. "It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form." Trump said negotiations on the payment would begin soon. As for the wall itself, "as soon as we can, as soon as we can physically do it," he said of the timeline. "I would say in months." Trump actually signed two executive actions related to immigration while at DHS. He also will beef up border security by increasing the number of detention centers and field agents, and he'll penalize US cities—so-called "sanctuary cities"—that fail to comply with immigration laws by withholding federal grant money. Still to come is an order that is expected to curb the number of refugees coming from Muslim-majority nations such as Syria. The details on that one were reportedly still being worked out.
summarize: Congress was scheduled to be off this week, but lawmakers must stay in Washington because they made no progress over the weekend in settling a dispute over spending that threatens a possible government shutdown.      Despite promises to work together following a public backlash against the bickering that consumed much of the summer, Republicans and Democrats face the reality that disaster aid could run out Tuesday and the government could partially shut down beginning this weekend unless they strike a deal quickly.      ... ||||| With time running out, Congress returns Monday to try to pass a short-term funding measure to avert a government shutdown and avoid yet another market-rattling showdown over the federal budget.      The Democratic-led Senate, which on Friday blocked a GOP House measure to fund the government through Nov. 18, will vote late Monday on its own version of the bill.      The Senate bill includes dollars for disaster relief without an offsetting spending cut elsewhere that the House GOP demands.      It is not clear how the dispute will be resolved. A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Sunday that leaders have been in touch, but other congressional aides said there was no progress toward a compromise over the weekend.      And members of Congress who appeared on Sunday talk shows gave little sign that they would move quickly from their parties’ positions on disaster relief.      “The Senate is saying . . . why should we, in effect, rebuild schools in Iraq on the credit card but expect that rebuilding schools in Joplin, Missouri, at this moment in time have to be paid for in a way that has never been in any of the previous disaster assistance that we’ve put out before?” Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He blamed the dispute on tea-party-affiliated Republicans in the House who demanded the spending cut.      Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said on the same program: “Everybody knows we’re going to pay for every single penny of disaster aid that the president declares and that FEMA certifies. And the House sent over a bill that does that and the Senate should have approved it.”      He blamed Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) for manufacturing a crisis over funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.      But Warner and Alexander, who have been pushing for more bipartisan cooperation over the far more difficult and consequential task of deficit reduction, appeared weary over the mess. Warner called it “embarrassing.”      “I don’t like this business of sitting around blaming each other over such small potatoes,” Alexander said.      But the small potatoes are part of a much larger and ongoing fight about debt and deficit spending in Washington.      Last week, Boehner lost a vote on how to fund the federal government, sending Washington bumbling into its third shutdown showdown in the past six months.      His problem was the same as in the previous spending battles — roughly 50 of the most conservative Republicans who mutinied in the name of deeper spending cuts.      But Boehner may have strengthened his hand in the fight by persuading his fractious team to rally around his leadership.      The fact that a resolution now hinges on action in the Senate is a sign that Boehner is in stronger position politically than he was a week ago — that he can now sometimes harness the power of his majority, despite nine months of often chaotic rule.      Rather than working with Democrats, he worked on Republicans, persuading enough to switch their votes. The House passed an almost identical version of the spending bill Thursday and forced the issue to the Senate.      Boehner has had to rely on temporary and unstable coalitions to achieve victories, often won with bluffs and brinkmanship against a deadline of impending doom.      Last week, he built one with Republicans. This week, he may be forced to turn to Democrats. Without the full strength of his majority behind him, that has been Boehner’s go-to in the past — tricky arrangements that have required him to win three-quarters of the votes of Republicans but still keep nearly half of Democrats on board.      What appeared in the end to persuade the reluctant GOP members who switched last week was not arm twisting or legislative pressure tactics that were once famous in the House, but something else entirely: logic.      Leaders argued that if members wanted to cut spending, voting for the measure was their only viable option.      The alternative was to require Boehner to negotiate with Democrats on a bill that would not offset any of the $3.65 billion Republicans had agreed to set aside for FEMA and other disaster relief efforts.      In other words, voting against the bill in hopes of forcing government to spend less would actually result in spending more.      “He said you have to pick — and they picked,” said Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio), a close ally of Boehner’s. “It’s too bad we had to have the vote and lose, but I think people came to the right conclusion pretty quickly.”      One key moment came in a closed-door meeting Thursday for House Republicans, when Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) rose to his feet and acknowledged that he had planned to support the bill the night before but decided to vote against it when he saw it was headed for defeat.      It was cowardly, he said. If given another opportunity, he promised to stick by Boehner and vote “yes.”      “That helped,” said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.). “It defused things and made it so it wasn’t like a test of wills.”      King said people laughed. Then others acknowledged they had done the same.      “He saw it was going to go down anyway, so he could take the easy vote and vote ‘no’ and be a hero to the people back home to people who wanted more cuts,” King said.      Slowly but surely, Republican leaders are persuading freshman elected last year on promises to remake Washington that there’s more to being an effective congressman than heroics for the folks back home.      “I think the speaker and the leader are trying to get that across,” King said. “I think it is starting to sink in.”      The message worked on some.      Rep. Jeffrey M. Landry (R-La.), who had voted against the bill Wednesday, said he was persuaded to support the bill a day later by the argument that his “no” vote would help produce a bill with higher spending.      “That would have been a bill that I wouldn’t have supported but Americans would likely have had to live with,” he said.      Boehner found a way to entice conservatives, including Landry. Rather than eliminating the spending offset as Democrats wanted, he added a new cut — $100 million from the program that had loaned money to the now-bankrupt Solyndra solar-panel manufacturer that had been championed by the Obama administration.      Though a minor cut, it gave Republicans an opportunity to bash the administration over a loan to the failed company.      Despite the hard sell from Boehner, a bloc of 24 Republicans still defied the speaker on Thursday.      “I represent 600,000 people,” said Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.), one of the “no” votes. “I think I know them. I think I know what they want me to do.”      Read more on PostPolitics.com      Government Shutdown 2011      Pessimism grows after new congressional feud      Fact Checker: Obama’s strained symbolism at an Ohio River bridge |||||	– After rejecting the House's bill to fund the government into November, the Senate will vote today on its own version, hoping to dodge a new threat of government shutdown, reports the Washington Post. After the weekend brought leaders no closer to agreement, and with disaster relief potentially running out tomorrow, Congress is at work during a scheduled week off, the Wall Street Journal notes. All eyes are now on the Senate as it prepares a bill that pays for disaster relief—without cutting other programs. The Senate bill would fund the government until Nov. 18, with $3.65 billion for disaster relief; FEMA is currently shelling out tens of billions daily. Yesterday’s talk shows saw lawmakers taking shots over the bill: “There is a group, and I do believe it is mostly centered in the House in terms of these Tea Party Republicans, who say, 'On every issue, we're going to make this a make-or-break,’” said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, on the other hand, says Harry Reid has “manufactured a crisis.” Click through for more on the rush to avoid shutdown.
summarize: President Obama rolled out a $3.7 trillion budget blueprint Monday that would trim or terminate more than 200 federal programs next year and make key investments in education, transportation and research. The plan is aimed at boosting the nation's economy while reducing record budget deficits.      In a news conference at a Baltimore County middle school, Obama cast the document as a responsible alternative to the deep spending cuts that Republicans will urge in a vote this week on the House floor. Obama's plan would trim domestic spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, striking hard at programs long favored by Democrats to make room for targeted increases in energy and medical research, corporate research and development and a new network to bring high-speed Internet access to 98 percent of Americans.      However, Obama also would rely heavily on new taxes, to a degree unacknowledged by administration officials in recent days. His budget request calls for well over $1.6 trillion in fresh revenue over the next decade, much of it through higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses.      Households with income of more than $250,000 a year would immediately see new limits on the value of their itemized deductions. And starting in 2013, they would lose the lower tax rates and other breaks that were enacted during the George W. Bush administration and recently extended.      The president proposes to hit businesses with an array of proposals he has offered in the past, including an end to subsidies for oil and gas companies, new taxes on hedge fund managers and a $30 billion fee on financial institutions aimed at repaying taxpayers for the federal TARP bailout.      The cuts target defense, heating assistance and the environment.      The announcement was Obama's opening argument in what is likely to be months of debate with congressional Republicans who want to see deeper cuts.      He cast the reductions as necessary but also said that more funding for scientific research, innovation and education were essential to keep American competitive with other nations.      "It would mean cutting things that I care deeply about," Obama said. "But if we're going to walk the walk when it comes to fiscal discipline, these kinds of cuts will be necessary,"      He said that "while we are absolutely committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to find further savings ... we can't sacrifice our future in the process."      Obama described his education initiatives as "investments in the future" and said he would fight for more funding. His budget proposal includes $40 million for training math and science teachers in elementary, high school and college classrooms.      Although Obama seeks an overhaul of the corporate tax code to lower the 35 percent rate on corporate profits, his budget does not make that costly adjustment. Instead, it offers previous proposals to eliminate tax breaks for corporations that do business overseas, reaping $129 billion in new revenue through 2021. ||||| WASHINGTON—The White House projected Monday that the federal deficit would spike to $1.65 trillion in the current fiscal year, the largest dollar amount ever, adding pressure on Democrats and Republicans to tackle growing levels of debt.      WSJ's David Wessel reports on President Obama's proposed $3.73 trillion budget which calls for just over $1 trillion in spending cuts. Also, Apple plans to release a line of lower-priced iPhones that would compete with other smartphones on the market.      The projected deficit for 2011 is fueled in part by a tax-cut extension that President Barack Obama and Republican lawmakers brokered in December, two senior administration officials said. It would equal 10.9% of gross domestic product, the largest deficit as a share of the economy since World War II.      The new estimate is part of Mr. Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012, which becomes public Monday morning.      Mr. Obama is proposing $3.73 trillion in government spending in the next fiscal year, part of a plan that includes budget cuts and tax increases that administration officials believe will sharply bring down the federal deficit over 10 years.      The deficit would decline in fiscal year 2012 to $1.1 trillion, or 7% of gross domestic product, under Mr. Obama's plan, as a year-long payroll tax holiday and an extension of federal jobless benefits expired, administration officials said. By 2017, the budget plan says, the deficit would be shaved to $627 billion, or 3% of gross domestic product.      Senior administration officials said the new budget would address concerns about the country's long-term fiscal challenges while spending more money on education and research programs that the administration says are needed to boost economic growth.      But Mr. Obama's plan is likely to be rewritten by Republicans who control the House, as proposed spending cuts in his budget fall short of the reductions congressional Republicans are seeking.      View Full Image Getty Images Barack Obama is proposing $3.73 trillion in government spending in the next fiscal year.      Even before turning to Mr. Obama's plan for fiscal year 2012, which begins Oct. 1, lawmakers are battling over levels of government spending for the remainder of fiscal year 2011, which House lawmakers will debate this week.      "We're very eager to work with Republicans to cut spending and reduce our deficit," a senior administration official said Sunday night.      At $1.65 trillion, the administration's projection for the 2011 deficit is significantly larger than the $1.48 trillion estimated by the non-\partisan Congressional Budget Office a few weeks ago. In fiscal year 2010, the deficit was $1.29 trillion.      White House officials believe their budget proposal would shave $1.1 trillion off of accumulated federal deficits over 10 years, which they believe would push levels of federal spending into a healthier balance.      That would be less than the $4 trillion in reductions the White House's deficit-reduction commission proposed in December, but it's still a level administration officials believe is achievable and sustainable.      The budget wouldn't do much, though, to arrest a future spike in the projected costs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Mr. Obama has said he's open to making changes in these programs, but he wants cooperation from Republicans before he will begin.      The savings in the budget come from a combination of spending cuts and increases in revenue. A five-year freeze on non-defense discretionary spending would save more than $400 billion over 10 years, the administration says.      The White House, in its plan for 2012, reduces certain programs to save an additional $33 billion. This includes more than $2 billion in cuts to travel, printing, supplies and other overhead costs. The plan also would cut more than $1 billion in grants to large airports and $950 million to revolving funds for state water treatment plants, among other things.      View Full Image Associated Press Willow Wimbush, left, and Nancy Harris, work on copies of the Appendix of the fiscal 2012 federal budget on Thursday at the U.S. Government Printing Office in Washington.      The proposed budget seeks to prevent many middle-class Americans from being subjected to the Alternative Minimum Tax, which would raise their tax bills, for three years starting in fiscal 2012. To cover the cost, the administration would put new limits on the ability of the wealthiest earners to utilize tax deductions to lower their tax burden, among them deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest.      The Alternative Minimum Tax was designed to ensure that wealthier earners do not use deductions to avoid most or all taxes. Lawmakers in both parties want to find a long-term solution that limits its growing reach into middle-class households. But Republicans are unlikely to agree to what, in effect, is a tax increase on wealthier Americans to pay the cost of doing so..      The budget will also propose averting scheduled reductions in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients for the next two fiscal years, at a cost of $62 billion over 10 years. To cover the cost, savings would be found by making improvements in the health care delivery system that weren't detailed by administration officials.      The White House will propose cutting 12 tax breaks to oil, gas and coal companies, which it projected will raise $46 billion in revenue over 10 years.      The budget calls for $148 billion in overall spending on research and development, which includes $32 billion in biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. It would create 20 new Economic Growth Zones, providing tax incentives meant to attract investors and employers in hard-hit economic areas.      The tax deal agreed to by the president and congressional Republicans in December extended all current tax rates for two years, continued an expanded federal jobless benefits program for a year, and exempted most Americans from having to pay payroll taxes for a year. When it was signed into law, it was estimated the compromise would cost more than $850 billion over the next decade.

That figure—which is significantly more pessimistic than the Congressional Budget Office’s $1.48 trillion estimate—comes alongside Obama’s newly released $3.73 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2012, which the administration says would shave $1.1 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. Under Obama’s plan, the deficit would shrink to $1.1 trillion in 2012, and to around $600 billion a year thereafter through 2018. The budget would cut funding on a host of programs long-championed by Democrats, and raise taxes on the rich and corporations, the Washington Post reports. At the same time, it would boost spending on education, energy and medical research, and high-speed internet infrastructure. It's a revealing look at Obama's priorities, but odds are it'll be all but ignored on Capitol Hill, as Republicans push much larger cuts in a House vote this week.
summarize: In 2002, when I was working as a lowly researcher at Spin magazine, the White Stripes — a band, who, along with fellow revivalists the Strokes and the Hives, were in the midst of "saving rock and roll" (to borrow a phrase thrown about liberally at the time) — played a free show in New York's Union Square. It was, and still is, one of the five greatest rock gigs I've ever seen, and not just because it meant I got to skip out on work to go see it.      Although it lasted only an hour, it was my first indoctrination into the way of the White Stripes: Do it fast, do it cheap, do it loud and don't stop doing it even when the man pulls the plug, which in fact happened. After organizers turned off the sound, Jack and Meg tore through an unplugged cover of the standard "Boll Weevil Blues." I would see them again in subsequent years — a thunderous '03 performance at Roseland Ballroom, months after they conquered the world with Elephant and appropriately used footlights to cast mile-high shadows against the backdrop, a roaring set in 2007 at Bonnaroo, where they unified the masses with Icky Thump's skronk — but nothing stuck with me quite like that first show.      Check out photos of the White Stripes through the years.      Maybe it was because I was still young and impressionable, at least impressionable enough to truly believe that a duo from Detroit could change the world with nothing more than a guitar and a drumkit, or maybe it was because the Stripes were the closest thing I'd seen to a genuinely revelatory rock band. There was a mythology to them — the red-and-white getups, the whole "brother/sister" dynamic, the fact that Jack White seemed like a genuine sharecropper's son — not to mention a blue-collar power that recalled the punch of fellow Motor City maniacs the MC5 or nearby neighbors the Stooges. They didn't care about fashion, they didn't care about pristine studio sound, they just cared about playing music in the loudest, most primitive way possible. And that's where the magic came from.      The White Stripes were, in short, everything I could ever want in a rock band. And on Wednesday (February 2), when they announced they were ending their 13-year run, I was genuinely saddened. And not just because I would never get to see them live one last time, or listen to another one of their records front to back or, even, get the chance to interview them again (something I only had the opportunity to do once), but because, in some small way, it meant that a little part of my youth had died too. And it was never coming back.      Because, though they were a preternaturally old band (their entire output recalls nothing recorded over the past 30-plus years), the Stripes were also incredibly young. Jack White, ever the aged bluesman, was also remarkably childlike; he delighted in nothing more than playing loud, tweaking the media and doing things his way. And it would be easy to say that Meg White played the drums like a child, but I prefer to look at the unbridled joy with which she hammered away at the kit. It was as if she had never known better. And the band was better because of it.      But the thing that made them eternally young (at least in my eyes) was their unyielding sense of purpose. There truly was no obstacle they could not overcome, no challenge too great, because the White Stripes believed in themselves. It's what drove them to start a band in the first place — so what if our drummer can't drum, we'll figure it out ourselves — and record in the most arcane ways imaginable. It's what drove them to play a show in every province and territory in Canada: They simply knew they could do it.      There's a name for that childlike confidence and people call it DIY. It's how we got bands like the Ramones and Minutemen, how hip-hop grew from rec rooms in the South Bronx and, really, it's the reason anyone should ever decide to pick up an instrument: I can do this. We can do this. Together, we can change the world.      It's the engine that drove the best bands in history and, yes, the White Stripes are definitely one of those. I'd argue that, of all their contemporaries, they're the only group that we'll still be talking about in 20 years' time. Their place in rock history is secure. And though I was saddened to learn of their demise, there was something in their farewell message that gave me hope. It's how they decided to sign off, with a statement that, if anything, recalled the very spirit that made them start the band way back in 1997. Here's what they wrote:      "The White Stripes do not belong to Meg and Jack anymore. The White Stripes belong to you now and you can do with it whatever you want. The beauty of art and music is that it can last forever if people want it to. Thank you for sharing this experience. Your involvement will never be lost on us and we are truly grateful."      That's about as DIY. as you can get. The White Stripes now truly belong to us. And if that's not a fitting way to end this piece, then I don't know what is. So farewell, White Stripes, you lightning rods, you touchstones, you eternal children. You were everything that rock and roll should be, and you will be missed.
