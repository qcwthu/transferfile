summarize: John Smith. Photo: Oslo Police      A man found with total amnesia in Norway last December has told the country's national broadcaster that he had been bound and drugged before being discovered.      The man, who calls himself 'John Smith', told Norway's NRK channel that he woke up with a three-day beard in hospital on December 15th, with cuts on his wrist as if they had been strapped.      "The cuts were deep and it took several months before the wounds healed," he said. "It was quite obvious that my hands had been tied together."      A passerby found him in a snowdrift, and called an ambulance. He says that he had probably been drugged.      "I was paralyzed and could not speak. But the doctor said it was different drugs in the system," he said.      He then spent over twenty hours in a coma.      "I'm desperate, scared and want nothing more than to get out of this situation," he added. "I think I'm Czech, it is the language I understand best," he says. "I also understand Polish, Slovak and Russian. But I think and dream in English.      As far as he knows, he has no connection to Norway.      "I do not understand Norwegian, and I know no one here."      Smith has lived in Oslo for almost four months, after being discovered "in a bad condition" in a snowdrift in the east of Oslo on December 14th.      He has no idea of his name or even what country he is from. Police on Tuesday released his photo in the hope that someone would recognize him.      "At least I know I can't be a criminal, although I almost wish I was," he told NRK. "Then they would have found out who I was."      "I woke up with a nurse beside me, and as I did not understand, I asked her to speak to me in English. I remembered nothing. It was so funny when she asked what my name was and then I couldn't remember it."      Norwegian police said on Wednesday they had "interesting leads".            "We have received information from Norway but also from other countries and we find some of that information very interesting," Oslo police spokesman Sturla Henriksbø told AFP.            "It's particularly from the Czech Republic that we have received information," Henriksbø said.       ||||| Image copyright Norwegian Police      Police in Norway have released photos in a bid to identify a young man found in a snowdrift near Oslo in December, apparently suffering from amnesia.      Police say they do not know where the man comes from but that he speaks good English with an East European accent.      A police spokesman told the Norwegian VG newspaper there was reason to believe he had been a victim of crime.      The man, who calls himself "John Smith" for now, agreed to his photo being released after inquiries drew a blank.      His fingerprints and photo were sent to East European police forces via Interpol but without success.      "The man did not possess any form of identification, and did not remember his name, origin, how he ended up in Norway or any other details of his life," the police said in a statement.      "[He] is of European origin, speaks very well English with a Eastern/Central-European accent, and understands Czech, Slovak, Polish and Russian languages. He is 187 cm [6.1 ft] tall, has blue eyes and dark blonde hair."      According to the police, he is aged in his twenties and was found in a snowdrift in an industrial area east of the Norwegian capital.      Amnesia, the partial or complete loss of memory, is usually associated with either physical trauma such as a blow to the head or some sort of psychological trauma.      It is usually a temporary condition and tends to affect only a certain part of a person's experience.      'Clear-headed'      Police prosecutor Sturla Henriksbo told VG that despite his apparent amnesia, the man could "reason and think clearly".      He said that aspects of the case had led police to suspect the man was a victim of crime but he did not elaborate.      His case is being handled by the violence and sexual crimes branch of the Norwegian police.      In 2003, a young Asian man turned up in Norway with similar memory loss and was dubbed Mr X by the media. The last thing he could remember was being in Switzerland and wanting to go to Norway to see one of its famous stave churches.      It was eventually established that the man was Japanese but only the return to his home country helped him piece together his identity.      Last year a court in the German capital Berlin sentenced a young Dutchman to community service for tricking officials into thinking he had lived in a forest for years with his father.      Robin van Helsum, 21, admitted making up a story that his parents were dead and that he did not know who he was or where he was from. |||||	– Police in Norway are asking the public to help them identify a young man found in a snowdrift months ago apparently suffering from total amnesia.

summarize: CLOSE Ines Rau has posed for the magazine before. Time      Ines Rau is Playboy's first transgender Playmate. (Photo: Derek Kettela)      Playboy will feature a transgender Playmate in its November issue, the magazine announced Wednesday.      French model Ines Rau, 26, will be the centerfold in the first issue to publish since Playboy's founder Hugh Hefner died in September.      While many women pose nude in the magazine, there is only one Playmate each month, who is featured as the centerfold. Rau is no stranger to the magazine, and previously posed fully nude in a May 2014 issue.      In a statement, Rau said the 2014 spread was how she celebrated coming out as transgender.      “I lived a long time without saying I was transgender,” Rau said in a statement. “I dated a lot and almost forgot. I was scared of never finding a boyfriend and being seen as weird. Then I was like, 'you know, you should just be who you are. It’s a salvation to speak the truth about yourself, whether it’s your gender, sexuality, whatever.'"      And while Rau is the first transgender playmate, she is not the first transgender woman to appear in a pictorial in the magazine. In 1991, Bond Girl Caroline “Tula” Cossey, who is transgender, posed for the magazine.      Rau, who hopes to fight for a slew of issues ranging from LGBTQ rights to battling global warming, said she had a feeling someday she would be able to achieve a better life.      “I always knew from within, when I was a little kid in my room in the ghetto, that a beautiful destiny was waiting for me,” she says. “I don’t know how to explain it. A little voice was telling me, ‘You’ll see. Patience.’ ”      Cooper Hefner, Playboy's chief creative officer, told the New York Times that choosing Rau as the Playmate "speaks to the brand's philosophy."      “It’s the right thing to do," Hefner told the Times. "We’re at a moment where gender roles are evolving.”      While Hefner stands behind his decision, the reaction from fans on social media was mixed. Many praised Rau's beauty, but others accused the magazine of using the model as a marketing ploy and "pushing" their agenda down readers throats.

The French model Ines Rau, 26, will appear as the November centerfold in the first issue since the death of Hugh Hefner, Mr. Hefner’s father and the magazine’s founder.      Selecting Ms. Rau “very much speaks to the brand’s philosophy,” said Mr. Hefner, 26, Playboy’s chief creative officer. “It’s the right thing to do. We’re at a moment where gender roles are evolving.”      Mr. Hefner said he selected Ms. Rau to be a Playmate two months ago because she’s “lovely” and has “a remarkable personality,” but also to resolidify the magazine’s voice. “This is really a moment for us to take a step back and say that so much of what the brand stood for in the early years is very much still alive in culture.” ||||| LONDON — Men's magazine Playboy has featured its first ever transgender "playmate" centerfold in its November issue, a move which the model hopes will pave the way for “all women — trans or otherwise — in fashion and other sectors.”      Ines Rau, a French fashion model who was featured nude in a 2014 issue of Playboy and has previously worked with Balmain and Vogue Italia, is the first transgender model to appear as a centerfold in the magazine’s 64-year history.      “Every woman’s beauty deserves to be celebrated,” Rau, 26, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in her first interview to the media about the feature.      “No one deserves to be a woman more than those [trans women] who routinely suffer abuse and are treated like they’re less than nothing.”      The Playboy feature comes as transgender models are becoming increasingly visible in fashion brands and media. In March the French edition of Vogue featured a transgender model for the first time on its cover, as did Marie Claire Spain in 2016.      In August French cosmetics giant L‘Oreal hired is first transgender model, Munroe Bergdorf, to front an advertising campaign celebrating diversity. It sacked her days later after she described "all white people" as racist on Facebook.      Rau said Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, an outspoken supporter of civil rights, had personally chosen her to be the magazine’s first transgender playmate before he died at the age of 91 in September, and “told me he was very proud of me.”      “The messages of encouragement I’ve received from people have been amazing, although I‘m still told by some that I'm ugly and should never be allowed in Playboy,” she said in a phone interview on Thursday.      Rights groups celebrated the feature as a positive step bringing LGBTQ rights into the spotlight.      “Trans women are women. That is not up for debate, by media commentators or anyone else. We applaud Ines for continuing to speak out on the rights of trans people everywhere,” said a spokesman for LGBTQ charity Stonewall.      The decision to feature Rau sparked debate on social media, with one man commenting on the magazine’s Facebook page that “this was the last straw, sorry but I like my women real, not 500 surgeries later.”      “There will always be trolls,” said Rau. “But if I can help others to love themselves then it’s worth it.”      While Rau is the first official transgender "playmate," she is not the first openly trans woman to pose for Playboy. That distinction belongs to Caroline "Tula" Cossey.      FOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM |||||	– The November issue of Playboy will be the first published since Hugh Hefner's death in September, but it's getting attention for an entirely different first: the magazine's first transgender playmate, USA Today reports. Ines Rau, 26, will appear nude as the November issue's centerfold. The French model told the New York Times that being named a Playboy playmate "was a compliment like I've never had." She says she "cried of happiness" posing for the magazine while "thinking of being this little lonely boy in the ghetto." Cooper Hefner says featuring a transgender playmate "very much speaks to the brand's philosophy," calling it "the right thing to do." "So much of what the brand stood for in the early years is very much still alive," the son of Hugh Hefner says. The online reaction to Rau being made a playmate has been mixed at best. She says she was caught off guard by some of the transphobic comments the news has gotten, with some people claiming Hugh Hefner would never have allowed a transgender model in the magazine. That's wrong on a number of counts. "Bond girl" Caroline Cossey posed nude for Playboy in 1991, becoming the magazine's first transgender model. And Rau actually posed nude in the magazine in 2014 before now becoming its first transgender playmate (there is just one playmate per issue, featured in the centerfold). She tells Reuters that Hugh Hefner chose her for the honor himself, telling her "he was very proud of me." Meanwhile, Playboy is comparing the negative reactions to Rau to the negative response it received in 1965 after featuring its first black playmate.
summarize: A British student has told how he survived for eight nights on a mountain by eating insects and sleeping in a cave.      David Mackie, 21, from Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, and two Dutch friends got stranded when they got lost on what was supposed to be a one-day hiking trip in Antalya, Turkey .      He said they lost their bearings due to bad weather and flooding and were left without shelter until they found a cave to sleep in.      Mr Mackie eventually managed to make an emergency call from his mobile phone on Friday, which had just 2 per cent of battery left.      He acknowledged that the call had "probably saved our lives".      Hundreds of people joined the search in the canyon before rescue crews managed to reach the students on Monday and airlift them to safety, which was all captured on a head camera.      After an emotional reunion with his family, Mr Mackie said: "I've not eaten for seven days now. We ate a few ants and things like that and drank spring water from the mountains.      "We are extremely hungry and exhausted."      Mr Mackie's parents, Christopher and Alison Mackie, raised the alarm when their son failed to get a flight back to Istanbul, where he is studying engineering.

I felt like I was in a documentary channel the whole week." They say they got lost soon after setting out from Antalya and tried to follow a dry creek bed to the closest town. Then came incessant rain that washed out the creek and forced them to take refuge in a cave, reports the Telegraph. They caught a huge break when Mackie's nearly dead phone finally picked up enough of a signal to place an an emergency call, and a rescue helicopter spotted them. They were brought back to civilization on Jan. 19, though accounts differ on whether they set out on Jan. 11 or Jan. 14. Either way, "none of them are injured," a doctor tells the Turkish Hurriyet Daily News. "They survived ... by drinking water from the river and eating fruits and small bugs." (In Mexico, an American yoga teacher got lost while hiking and never made it out.)
summarize: Draper's plan splits California into six new states. (KGO/ABC News)      A venture capitalist who feels colossal California is too unwieldy to govern is proposing to split it into six separate states, and Secretary of State Debra Bowen has given him the green light to start collecting petition signatures.      Tim Draper filed a ballot initiative in December stating that because of recent social and economic changes California has become "nearly ungovernable."      He proposed dividing California into six states. San Diego and Orange County would make up "South California." "West California" would include Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, while Bakersfield, Fresno and Stockton would make up the larger "Central California." San Francisco and San Jose would be in the new "Silicon Valley." "North California" would include the Sacramento area, and "Jefferson" would be home to the Redding and Eureka areas.      "California as it is is ungovernable," Draper told ABC News today. "It is more and more difficult for Sacramento to keep up with the social issues from the various regions of California. With six Californias, people will be closer to their state governments, and states can get a refresh".      Brendan Nyhan, Assistant Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, isn't sold on the idea. "Splitting California into six states would raise all sorts of concerns about the partisan balance of the senate. I can't imagine this would ever go anywhere" said Nyhan.      Nyhan says a plan like this would surface many issues. Things like water policy, agricultural policy, and even the electoral college would all change if this plan were to take action.      The plan aims to settle California's financial issues after the separation of the states. If things can't be resolved, each state would receive a portion of the state's debts based on the newly created state's population.      If the federal government approves creating six new states, "all tax collections and spending by the existing State of California would end, with its assets and liabilities divided among the new states," Secretary of State Debra Bowen said in a statement on Tuesday.      That would leave decisions regarding taxes and public spending of the new states up to its elected leaders.      If California were its own separate country, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world.      In order to make this plan a reality, Draper needs to start collecting signatures in order to qualify the petition for a ballot. He needs the signatures of 807,615 registered voters in 150 days, making his deadline July 18, 2014.      "We are going to put together a grass roots effort to get signatures," Draper said. "It looks very promising since there are already several movements to create new states here". ||||| Could “Silicon Valley” become its own U.S. state?      That’s what a ballot measure, approved this week for signature gathering, is seeking to do. That, and carve out five other regions of California into their own independent U.S. states — with their own laws, politicians and capitols.      The idea was pitched by venture capitalist Tim Draper, who is now expected to throw his money toward collecting the 807,615 signatures required to put the plan before voters. He has until July 18.      That’s not the only hurdle. Not only would California voters have to approve the initiative, so would Congress.      Then there’s the messy task of splitting up California’s regional assets and liabilities between the new states (think water, bridges, sports teams) as well as setting up brand new governments (new laws, electoral systems, etc.).      But Draper, who spoke to ABC News on Wednesday, claimed that the benefits of smaller government and a less unwieldy California would be worth the hassle.      “California, as it is, is ungovernable,” he said. “It is more and more difficult for Sacramento to keep up with the social issues from the various regions of California. With six Californias, people will be closer to their state governments, and states can get a refresh.”      Under Draper’s plan, San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose would be part of the state of Silicon Valley, which would extend to Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. It would be the wealthiest, and likely most politically liberal, of the new states.      San Diego and Orange County, meanwhile, would comprise South California. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara would make up West California. Fresno and the San Joaquin Valley would be Central California. Marin, Sonoma and the greater Sacramento area would make up North California. And a bunch of rural counties in far northern California would make up Jefferson.      Secretary of State Debra Bowen, who approved the measure for circulation, wrote: “If the federal government approves the proposed creation of six new states, all tax collections and spending by the existing State of California would end … Decisions by appointed commissioners and elected leaders would determine how taxes, public spending, and other public policies would change for the new states and their local governments.” |||||	– Californians may soon get a chance to vote on splitting their state into six smaller ones, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Venture capitalist Tim Draper has gotten formal approval to start collecting petitions for his "Six Californias" idea. If he can get about 807,000 names by July 18, the idea would go before voters. Of course, even it passes, it would still have to get through Congress, making this seemingly closer to a thought experiment than a potential reality. "I can't imagine this would ever go anywhere," says a government expert at Dartmouth. But California, "as it is, is ungovernable,” Draper tells ABC News. “It is more and more difficult for Sacramento to keep up with the social issues from the various regions of California." Under his plan, the United States would add: Silicon Valley (San Francisco and San Jose) South California (San Diego and Orange County) West California (LA and Santa Barbara) Central California (Bakersfield, Fresno, and Stockton) North California (Sacramento) Jefferson (Redding and Eureka)
summarize: According to sources who have been reliable in the past, Apple currently plans to hold their iPad 3 announcement on Wednesday, March 7, 2012. Along with the 2048x1536 Retina display, the iPad 3 will feature a quad-core Apple A6 system-on-a-chip, and possibly 4G LTE networking.      The March 7 date fits with what AllThingsD reported last week, about the next iPad event being scheduled for the first week of March, and Wednesday is a traditional day for Apple to hold these types of events.      Whether Apple would simply improve and optimize the current dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor found in the Apple A5 SoC, or go quad-core has been a lingering question, with 9to5Mac finding code references to quad-core but The Verge hearing otherwise. However, it sounds like they're going quad-core.      4G LTE networking has been another mystery surrounding the iPad 3, with a compatible Qualcomm chipset becoming available, but international LTE coverage is still slim, and in some cases a year or more away. It sounds like Apple has 4G LTE lined up for iPhone 5 this October, but we're still not certain if the iPad 3 will get it earlier. Verizon is going to want iOS devices that go faster than 2-3mbps, of course, especially with AT&T offering HSPA 14.4, and potentially faster, models. Apple could release a 4G LTE variant model, targeted at Verizon, AT&T, Rogers, Bell, and other carriers that have rolled out enough support to see demand, or they could wait and debut it in the next iPhone instead. (No doubt Apple has already decided, it just isn't clear to us which way they went for the iPad 3.)      Other rumors from iLounge have included better cameras, either a 5 or 8 megapixel rear camera and a FaceTime HD front camera. We haven't received any information on these, though any camera Apple includes will have to fit into the thin iPad 3 casing. Likewise, they're probably going to want to keep component costs down low enough to maintain their $499 entry level price tag. (Even if Apple decides to keep iPad 2 around, with a low end, low storage offering at $399.)      Again, these are rumors, and an extract of a lot of information we're still trying to properly sort, but we'll update when and as needed to clarify and correct. Either way, we'll only know for certain when Apple executives take the stage next month to officially announce the iPad 3. ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Indeed if you stay in a hotel in certain parts of Ikea’s homeland in southern Sweden you will find the latest Ikea catalogue next to the customary New Testament.            One in 10 Europeans now living was supposedly conceived on an Ikea bed. The resulting babies are likely to sleep in an Ikea cot while their parents sit on Ikea sofas and eat off Ikea crockery which they store in Ikea cupboards. A third of all kitchens sold in France and Sweden are from Ikea. In Norway it’s half. Here in Britain we lag behind a bit but not much.            Last year with much of the world stuck in recession the Swedish furniture and homewares retailer delivered record annual net profits of £3.2billion. Sales in the 44 countries with Ikea stores grew by almost 10 per cent to a staggering £27.6billion.            All of which should add a satisfying element to the 87th birthday tomorrow of Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad. But Mr Kamprad, a widower, does not go in for extravagances such as birthday parties. For despite featuring regularly in lists of the world’s richest billionaires, the man who persuaded the British to “chuck out the chintz” is notoriously careful with money.            He could easily afford a private jet but would rather fly economy class and preferably on a budget airline. Arriving at a gala to receive a Businessman Of The Year Award he was at first refused entry because he had come on the bus. At home he drove an ancient Volvo for years until he was persuaded that it was too dangerous.            Rather than dining in Michelin starred restaurants he likes to drop in to one of his stores for a cheap meal of his favourite Swedish meatballs. In cafeterias he swipes the little packets of salt and pepper to take home.            Admittedly he has lived in Switzerland as a tax exile since 1976. But his home is a modest bungalow and he assembled every stick of Ikea flatpack furniture in it himself.            He regards luxury not merely as an indulgence but almost as a sin. In his memoir Testament Of A Furniture Dealer he wrote: “We don’t need flashy cars, impressive titles, uniforms or other status symbols. We rely on our strength and our will!”            Employees – although he prefers to call them “co-workers” – at Ikea HQ are told to use both sides of a sheet of paper and get a telling-off if they leave the lights on when leaving a room. Certainly anyone encountering him doing his shopping in the local market (always near closing time when vendors are more likely to drop their prices) dressed in his scruffy coat would assume he was just another elderly gent living on a tight budget rather than the fifth wealthiest entrepreneur in the world.            And that is just how Ingvar Kamprad likes it. Ever since he started his business in 1943 when he was just 17, he has controlled his own and his company’s public image with consummate skill. ||||| At least once in your life–maybe even once a week or once a day for that matter–you have fantasized about coming into a lot of money. What would you do if you were worth millions or even billions? Believe it or not there are millionaires and billionaires among us who masquerade as relatively normal, run-of-the-mill people. Take a peek at some of the most frugal wealthy people in the world.      Warren Buffett            Millions of people read Buffett’s books and follow his firm Berkshire Hathaway’s every move. But the real secret to Buffett’s personal fortune may be his penchant for frugality. Buffett, who is worth an estimated $47 billion, eschews opulent homes and luxury items. He still lives in a modest home in Omaha, Neb., which he purchased for just $31,500 more than 50 years ago. Although he’s dined in the best restaurants around the globe, given the choice he would opt for a good burger and fries accompanied by a cold cherry Coke. When asked why he doesn’t own a yacht, he responded “Most toys are just a pain in the neck.”      Carlos Slim            While most of the world is very familiar with Bill Gates, the name Carlos Slim rarely rings a bell. But it’s a name worth knowing. Slim, who is a native of Mexico, was just named the world’s richest billionaire–that’s right, richer than the überfamous Microsoft founder. Slim is worth more than $53 billion, and while he could afford the world’s most extravagant luxuries, he rarely indulges. He, like Buffett, doesn’t own a yacht or plane, and he has lived in the same home for over 40 years.      Ingvar Kamprad            The founder of the Swedish furniture phenomenon Ikea struck success with affordable, assemble-it-yourself furniture. For Kamprad, figuring out how to save money isn’t just for his customers, it’s a high personal value. He’s been quoted as saying “Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.” That goes for the founder as well. He flies coach for business, and when he needs to get around town locally he either takes the bus or will head out in his 15-year-old Volvo 240 GL.      Chuck Feeney            Growing up in the wake of The Depression as an Irish-American probably has something to do with Feeney’s frugality. With a personal motto of “I set out to work hard, not get rich,” the co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers has quietly become a billionaire but even more secretively given almost all of it away through his foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies. In addition to giving more than $600 million to his alma mater Cornell University, he has given billions to schools, research departments and hospitals.      Loath to spend if he doesn’t have to, Feeney beats both Buffett and Kamprad in the donation category, giving out less grants than only Ford and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations. A frequent user of public transportation, Feeney flies economy class, buys clothes from retail stores, and does not wast money on an extensive shoes closet, stating “you can only wear one pair of shoes at a time”. He raised his children in the same way; making them work the same normal summer jobs as most teens.      Frederik Meijer            If you live in the Midwest chances are good that you shop at Meijer’s chain of grocery stores. Meijer is worth more than $5 billion and nearly half of that was amassed when everyone else was watching their net worth drop in 2009. Like Buffett he buys reasonably-priced cars and drives them until they die, and like Kamprad he chooses affordable motels when on travel for work. Also, like Chuck Feeney, rather than carelessly spending his wealth Mr. Meijer is focused on the good that it can provide to the community.      The Bottom Line            The dirty little secret of some of the world’s wealthiest people is that they rarely act like it. Instead of over-the-top spending, they’re busy figuring out how to save and invest to have that much more in the future. It’s a habit you might want to consider in order to build up your own little storehouse of cash. ||||| Profile      Billionaires: March 2012 Billionaires: March 2011 Billionaires: March 2010 Billionaires: March 2009 Billionaires: March 2008 Billionaires: March 2007 Billionaires: March 2006 Billionaires: March 2005 Billionaires: March 2004 Billionaires: March 2003      After his lawyers produced documents last year proving that Kamprad had irrevocably transferred the majority of his economic stake in global furniture retailer Ikea to his philanthropic foundations, later selling them the balance, his net worth took a drastic slide. But with the exception of his winery in Provence, Kamprad has historically shown little interest in the trappings of wealth anyway. He reportedly drives a Volvo 240 GL he has owned for two decades. At age 85 his great love remains Ikea and the culture he built that made Ikea one of the world's most successful brands and retailers. Known for his relentless pursuit of efficiency, Kamprad introduced the flat-pack in 1953, moved production to Soviet Poland in 1961 to minimize labor costs and publishes the Furniture Dealer's Testament or the "Ikea Bible," which includes maxims such as "wasting resources is a mortal sin at Ikea." Through his Ikano Group, Kamprad currently has interests in banking, real estate, asset management and insurance; Ikea is one of the firm's biggest customers.

Kamprad, who turns 90 on 30 March, has a reputation for penny-pinching, which he claims helped Ikea to become one of the world’s top brand names.      We've hit peak home furnishings, says Ikea boss Read more      “I don’t think I’m wearing anything that wasn’t bought at a flea market. It means that I want to set a good example,” he told Swedish channel TV4, according to business daily Dagens Industri which viewed the documentary.      “It’s in the nature of Smaland to be thrifty,” he said, referring to Sweden’s southern agricultural region where he comes from.      Kamprad is estimated to have an accumulated fortune of about 610bn kroner (about ‎€65.5bn), according to recent Swedish media reports.      But it is difficult to separate what belongs to him, what belongs to his children and what is held in a family foundation in one of Europe’s most infamous tax havens, Liechtenstein.      In 2006, the American business magazine Forbes listed him as the fourth richest person in the world.      Kamprad’s modest spending habits have made headlines over the years. In 2008, he told newspaper Sydsvenskan that a €22 bill in the Netherlands had broken his hair cut budget.      “Normally, I try to get my haircut when I’m in a developing country. Last time it was in Vietnam,” Kamprad explained.      In 1973, he fled Sweden’s higher tax structure for Denmark, before seeking even lower taxes in Switzerland.      From 2010 onward, Kamprad progressively retired from the family company to make way for his three sons, finally returning to live in Sweden in 2014. |||||	– Want to end up a billionaire like Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad? Consider doing as he does and trade the mall for the ... flea market. In a documentary set to air on Swedish television, the 89-year-old says that's where he shops for clothes, reports the AFP. "I don't think I’m wearing anything that wasn't bought at a flea market. It means that I want to set a good example. It's in the nature of Smaland [the region of Sweden he hails from] to be thrifty." It's hardly the first time Kamprad has made headlines over his penny-pinching ways. A 2013 Daily Express article wrote of him pocketing packets of salt and pepper from his own Ikea cafeterias to bring home, driving a decrepit Volvo, and once initially being denied entry to a gala where he was being honored because he had arrived via bus. In 2010, Forbes noted that he prefers to fly coach. The AFP also has this tidbit: Kamprad tries to get his hair cut when he's in a developing country to save a few bucks. "Last time it was in Vietnam," Kamprad says. But Forbes notes one "exception" to his lack of interest in "the trappings of wealth": a winery in Provence.

summarize: Minneapolis officers failed to turn on their body cameras in the first fatal police shooting since the city began equipping cops with the devices last year.      On Saturday night, officer Mohamed Noor and another officer responded to a call of a possible assault in south Minneapolis. Neither had their body camera on when Noor fired the shots that killed 911 caller Justine Ruszczyk. Noor's attorney confirmed his identity to MPR News.      Minneapolis police are required to turn on body cameras in more than a dozen situations — including traffic or suspicious-person stops, and prior to any use of force, according to the police department's Policy and Procedure Manual.      Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor City of Minneapolis      "If a BWC [body-worn camera] is not activated prior to a use of force, it shall be activated as soon as it is safe to do so," reads the manual.      There's still a lot about the lead up to the shooting that's unknown, said Jenny Singleton of the Police Conduct Oversight Commission, or PCOC. But it appears to her that the cameras should have been turned on.      "We do know there was a gun discharged, which obviously is a use of force incident," Singleton said.      The PCOC researched body cameras and provided recommendations in 2014.      The commission also conducted several community listening sessions. Many of the people who attended the sessions said they hoped the cameras would provide transparency and accountability for officers who use excessive force.      Those calls for transparency and accountability rose significantly after officer Dustin Schwarze shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015.      Dave Bicking, with Communities United Against Police Brutality, is a former member of the city's Civilian Review Authority, now known as the Office of Police Conduct Review.      Bicking said he favored a policy in which there would be less officer discretion for when the cameras should be turned on and off.      With a few exceptions for the sake of privacy, he said, "there's no reason not to have them on as basically the default."      Justine Damond was shot and killed by Minneapolis police late Saturday night. Courtesy Stephen Govel      The American Civil Liberties Union was cautiously supportive of the body camera roll out. While the organization was concerned about privacy for people captured on police video, it expressed hope that cameras would increase transparency and reduce incidence of police violence.      However, the lack of video may affect what will happen to the officers involved.      The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating, and it will eventually turn over its findings to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.      Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said while he doesn't have any more information than what's been publicized, he feels the officers should have started recording the interaction.      "At this time, it's our understanding that there is no video or audio evidence, but that's only what we've been told," said Freeman. "The investigation is in its early stages. I hope there is."      Freeman added that video and audio evidence makes his decision easier because it will present "more concrete evidence."      Freeman will decide whether Noor and his partner will face criminal charges. It is not clear from the Minneapolis police policy manual what kind of discipline the officers could face for failing to turn on their cameras. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

The Australian woman died from a single gunshot to the abdomen, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner stated Monday. The manner of death was determined as homicide.      Damond’s legal name was Justine Ruszczyk, though she frequently went by the surname of her fiancé, Don Damond. Don Damond is the general manager of Little Six Casino, located roughly 20 miles from the Minneapolis neighborhood where he lived with his fiancée. The couple planned to marry in August.      Justine Damond moved to the U.S. from Australia in 2015 to be with her fiancé. She was a qualified yoga instructor and ran a business as a motivational speaker and meditation teacher. She grew up in Sydney, where she received a bachelor’s degree in veterinary science from the University of Sydney in 2002.      Don Damond was away on a business trip during the shooting. He told reporters on Monday that both his and his fiancée’s families were getting nothing from police. “Sadly, her family and I have been provided with almost no additional information from law enforcement regarding what happened after police arrived,” he said outside his home in Fulton. ||||| After changing careers to join the Minneapolis Police Department in 2015, Mohamed Noor was lauded by the mayor and his fellow Somalis as a welcome addition to the force.      “I want to take a moment to recognize Officer Mohamed Noor, the newest Somali officer in the Minneapolis Police Department,” Mayor Betsy Hodges posted on Facebook last year. “Officer Noor has been assigned to the 5th Precinct, where his arrival has been highly celebrated, particularly by the Somali community in and around Karmel Mall.”      Noor, 31, who has two active complaints against him in his police file, is one of nine Somali officers in the department, and he became the first to patrol the Fifth Precinct in the city’s southwest neighborhoods. He worked the “middle watch” evening shift, and on Monday went from one of hundreds of the city’s anonymous beat cops to the latest officer embroiled in controversy after the fatal shooting of 40-year-old Justine Damond, an unarmed civilian, in her south Minneapolis alley after she called 911 to report a possible crime.      The Somali American Police Association, of which Noor is a member, declined to comment, as did Minneapolis Police Federation President Lt. Bob Kroll. Both said they are waiting for the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to complete its investigation.      Thomas Plunkett, Noor’s attorney, said Monday that the officer “extends his condolences to the family and anyone else who has been touched by this event. He takes their loss seriously and keeps them in his daily thoughts and prayers.”      “He came to the United States at a young age and is thankful to have had so many opportunities,” Plunkett said in the statement. “He takes these events very seriously because, for him, being a police officer is a calling.”      Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor      Meanwhile, some Somali residents who knew the officer are scrambling to understand what happened. Others chose to remain silent, wary that the incident could shed a negative light on the state’s Somali population.      Suud Olat said he did not know Noor personally but saw him at community events. The first time he met Noor was six months ago at a soccer tournament in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood where Noor and other officers were patrolling. Olat described Noor as a kind, fair person who cares about protecting citizens. “I feel sad,” Olat said. “As a community, we love members of our community who serve in the police.”      Abdikadir Hassan, a candidate for the Park Board seat in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, said Noor was considered a role model. “He is inspiring to young people in the community,” Hassan said. “He is very supportive and good with the kids. He is such a lovely guy.”      Noor holds a degree in business administration, management and economics from Augsburg College. Before joining the department, he worked in commercial and residential property management in Minneapolis and St. Louis, and was general manager of a hotel in Eden Prairie.      According to the Office of Police Conduct Review, Noor has had three complaints filed against him, two of which remain open. Another was closed without discipline. Noor has been sued once in his short career with the police department, stemming from an incident on May 25 in which he and two other officers went to a woman’s home and took her to a hospital, which the woman alleges constituted false imprisonment, assault and battery. According to the ongoing lawsuit, the officers claimed they had reason to believe the woman was suffering a mental health crisis — which she denied — and Noor “grabbed her right wrist and upper arm,” exacerbating a previous shoulder injury in the process.      Plunkett said in a statement that the current environment for police is difficult, but Noor accepted it as part of his calling. The officer is a caring person with a family he loves, and he empathizes with the loss others are experiencing, he said.      Divorce documents filed in December describe Noor as a caring, involved father who was at times consumed by the demands of his job.      His mother often watched Noor’s son while he was at work. They spoke Somali at home, but Noor insisted that English be his son’s first language.      An evaluator sent to observe Noor interacting with his son concluded that he never raised his voice and that his “even keel and calm demeanor may have ultimately been responsible” for calming the agitated child down.      Sixth Ward City Council candidate Mohamud Noor, who is unrelated to the officer, said the community is doubly shaken because “this is another officer-involved shooting and the officer is a member of the Somali community.”      “People are shocked because of the tragedy of the killing that took place,” Mohamud Noor said. “This should be treated as a police-civilian issue. There is a loss of life and we’re always concerned. We believe the police should be held accountable as any other police shooting.”      Somali activist Omar Jamal, who knew Mohamed Noor from group breakfasts and community meetings, said he is waiting for facts to emerge. “We don’t know what went wrong or what happened,” he said. “But becoming an officer was a dream come true. Not only was it symbolic to become a member of the force, but confirmation of being part of the United States.”      Staff writers Andy Mannix and Libor Jany contributed to this report.      david.chanen@startribune.com 612-673-4465      faiza.mahamud@startribune.com 612-673-4203 ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      The grieving father of an Australian bride-to-be shot dead by police in Minneapolis after calling 911 paid tribute to her Tuesday as “a beacon to all of us.”      John Ruszczyk said his daughter, spiritual healer Justine Damond, “was so special to us and to so many others.”      The 40-year-old’s killing has left her grieving family and protesters demanding answers in a city that has just been at the center of another high-profile police shooting.      “Justine was a beacon to all of us,” Ruszczyk told reporters in her hometown of Sydney, Australia. “We only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.”      Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported the killing under the front page headline: "AMERICAN NIGHTMARE."      Damond died of a single gunshot wound to the abdomen shortly before midnight Saturday after calling 911 to report a possible assault, officials have said.      Mohamed Noor, the police officer who shot Justine Damond. City of Minneapolis      The officer who fired the shot has been identified by his lawyer as Mohammed Noor, who joined the force in 2015 — and was celebrated as the Fifth Precinct's first Somali officer. He was recognized in May 2016 by Mayor Betsy Hodges, who called his assignment a "wonderful sign of building trust and community policing at work." He has two open complaints, from 2017 and 2016.      The lawyer, Tom Plunkett, said in a statement that the officer "extends his condolences to the family and anyone else who has been touched by this event. He takes their loss seriously and keeps them in his daily thoughts and prayers."      Plunkett described Noor, who arrived in the United States as a child, as “a caring person with a family he loves” who “empathizes with the loss others are experiencing.”      The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said it was investigating, although there appeared to be no video because the officers' body cameras were switched off.      Both officers have been placed on standard administrative leave, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, but police are not confirming the identity of either officer while the investigation continues.      The tragedy unfolded shortly after 11:30 p.m. Saturday local time (12:30 a.m. Sunday ET), when the police officers responded to call about a disturbance in southwest Minneapolis, officials said.      According to local NBC affiliate KARE's sources, Noor shot across his partner, who was "stunned."      Minneapolis Police Department Chief Janeé Harteau said on Twitter that she "acknowledged the pain and frustration that family and community members" felt after the shooting.      Damond, who had already taken her fiance's family name prior to a planned wedding next month, ran meditation workshops at the Lake Harriet Spiritual Community, which in a statement called her “a loved and a respected member.”      Justine Damond via Instagram      “She was a gifted speaker, meditation leader, teacher and transformation coach,” the community said in a statement sent to NBC News by administrator Nancy Coune. “She inspired us with example of how she chose to live her life. She had a great joy for spiritual growth that inspired those around her.”      Damond's stepson, Zach, said she had called the police after hearing a noise near her home.      "My mom is dead, because a police officer shot her, for reasons I don't know, and I demand answers," he said in a tearful Facebook Live video. "I guess she thought that something bad was happening and, next thing I know, they take my best friend's life."      Last July, a suburban Minneapolis police officer fatally shot a black man during a traffic stop that was live-streamed on Facebook. Officer Jeronimo Yanez shot school cafeteria worker and licensed gun owner Philando Castile, 32, in front of his girlfriend and her young daughter, sparking outcry and protests.      Yanez was last month found not guilty of manslaughter and other charges for killing Castile, and was soon after given a $48,500 buyout package to leave the force, prompting more outrage.      Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said his community was "shaken by yet another unarmed person killed by a Minneapolis police officer."      "Our community is still working to cope with the deaths of Philando Castile, Jamar Clark, and many others. But at the end of the day, our prayers are not enough," Ellison said in a statement.      "We need to confront the reality of so many unarmed people killed by the same officers who swear an oath to protect us. Justine's death shows no one should assume 'officer-involved shootings' only happen in a certain part of town or to certain kinds of people.      "This tragedy, and others like it, will persist as long as our society resists holding our law enforcement accountable," he said. ||||| Justine Damond opens up on some tough times she went through in a recent presentation. Courtesy: YourLHSC      JUSTINE Damond had a mortal fear of guns and expressed reservations about US gun laws to friends before moving to America to start a new life.      Kat Kinnie, who says she became close to Ms Damond while the pair participated in Soul Sessions workshops in Sydney, said she was “just so excited” to be joining her fiance Don Damond and future stepson Zach but worried about the prevalence of guns in her new home.      “(Ms Damond’s fear of guns) was her biggest reservation about moving to the (United) States,” Ms Kinnie told the Triple M Grill Team this morning.      “Like, there was no question about how much she loved Don — he was her beloved, he was her wish come true. She was just so excited to be starting her life with him and to be engaged with him and become part of his family and become a mother to Zach but she was worried about moving to the States and worried about how different things are in comparision to Australia and with the gun laws ... it’s a real shame that she has left us in that way.”      Ms Kinnie described her friend in the same glowing terms as so many others have since the 40-year-old was inexplicably gunned down by a US police officer outside her Minneapolis home on Monday.      “She was one of the most beautiful people I have ever met,” she said.      “She was a model human being and if someone could have been designed with the biggest heart and the most love and kindness and compassion that I’ve ever met, that was Justine.”      Meanwhile, a video has provided insight into the dark struggle that led Ms Damond towards a life of spirituality.      Ms Damond, a yoga teacher who moved from Sydney to Minneapolis about three years ago, was shot and killed by police officer Mohamed Noor outside her house on Saturday night under mysterious circumstances.      Now, a video posted to YouTube of her giving an hour-long lecture eight days before her death has provided a window into a darker side of her life.      In a speech at Minneapolis’s Lake Harriet Spiritual Community centre, the 40-year-old describes watching her mother spiral into alcoholism and severe depression before dying of cancer.      “I saw that my mum was really at the mercy of her mind and her emotions and she couldn’t get out. She was really being ruled by her addictions,” Ms Damond says.      “I was witnessing a potential future for myself … and that terrified me.”      After her mother’s death, she developed her own addictions and coping mechanisms that took a hold on her.      “It was one of the darkest points in my life and over the six months before I’d really spent several periods considering whether I wanted to stay on the planet or not,” she said.      “So I was really, really unhappy and really quite sick.”      While seated on her bed on New Year’s Day, 2006, Ms Damond had an “out-of-body experience” where she watched her life repeat before her eyes.      “I was the one that kept showing up and I was the one that kept blaming everything outside of me for all the stuff that I believed was happening to me as a victim,” she said.      “But, if I was the one common denominator, then perhaps I would have the power to change something internally or begin to take power back within myself.”      This epiphany led to her life long commitment to meditation and using her spiritual beliefs to try to help others.      As her family and friends have expressed their shock and grief over the loss of Ms Damond, a theme has emerged.      She was remembered at a vigil on Sunday as “one of the most loving people you would ever meet”; her step son called her a “passionate” woman with a “generous heart”; a friend described her as “giving, smart, funny and caring”.      The YouTube video provides a glimpse into why she was so beloved.      Ms Damond comes across as warm, engaging and funny as she shares her views on new age spirituality, while barefoot on stage.      Using a good dollop of self-deprecating humour (“I’m a nerd by nature,” she says at one point) and with her Aussie accent fully intact, Ms Damond links science with self-help philosophies to help people unlock their potential by reprogramming their subconscious.      “We work to help people … learn about how your brain works so that you can use it to create the state of health that you want and create the life that you want,” Ms Damond says in the speech.      “There’s a benevolent force here, there’s a loving, caring witness to you and … it’s just waiting for you to come home, to turn around and pay attention to it.      “Turn of the television, turn off the iPhone, close your eyes and start to find out how you can enter into conversation and that loving nature will come through to you so quickly because it’s responsive. It’s a field of information and it’s at your beck and call.      “This loving force will bring you anything you want but you are the sole creator of your reality.”      Even if you’re not convinced by her views on spirituality and the universe, it’s hard not to be taken in by her irresistible spirit.      At one cute moment in the video, she breaks into a spontaneous dance to distract from a technical problem with her microphone.      Later, she describes her joy at rescuing a raft of ducklings that had fallen into a drain.      “You’ve never lived unless you’ve had eight ducklings fling themselves into your lap because they’ve realised your trying to help. So beautiful,” says Ms Damond, who is a qualified veterinary surgeon.      Anger is growing in Minnesota and Australia over a lack of answers about why Ms Damond was shot.      The state’s independent Bureau of Criminal Apprehensions has launched an investigation into the killing but has provided few details about what sparked the deadly incident. |||||	– When Mohamed Noor joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2015, becoming the first Somali officer to patrol the Fifth Precinct, he was celebrated by the Somali community and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who took "a moment to recognize him" in a Facebook post, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. On Monday, Noor was identified as the officer who fatally shot Justine Damond two nights earlier after Damond called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home. The Star-Tribune has more on the 31-year-old Noor, who is one of only nine Somali officers in Minneapolis. For Noor "being a police officer is a calling," his lawyer says. Here's what else you need to know about Saturday's fatal shooting: As previously reported, Noor has three complaints on his file since joining the Minneapolis Police Department. Eight days before her death, Damond gave a lecture about her struggles with depression and addiction and the 2006 out-of-body experience that led her to new age spirituality, News.com.au reports. Video of that lecture is available on YouTube. HuffPost lists what we know and don't know about the shooting, including the two big questions: What happened between Damond's 911 call and her death, and did the responding officers ever look into the sexual assault she believed she heard taking place? A medical examiner has ruled the death of Damond, who was unarmed and in her pajamas when she was shot, to be a homicide, AAP reports. It's unclear why officers' body cameras weren't turned on during the first fatal shooting since police started wearing them last year, according to MPR News. Officers are required to turn the cameras on before any use of force. Damond's father, John Ruszcyzk, says his daughter was "so special" and a "beacon to all." “We only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death," NBC News quotes him as saying. The Washington Post reports Minneapolis' Somali community is worried about a backlash following the identification of Noor as the shooter. "They fear this will be just another event used to create animosity toward the Somali community,” says the executive director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota.
summarize:      Meet Buddie, one of many controversial figures in Ohio's marijuana legalization battle. (John Minchillo/AP)      On Tuesday, Ohio could become the fifth state to legalize recreational marijuana.      But the story line there is less about how a culturally conservative state feels about pot and more about how a group of savvy political and business operatives are forging a new path forward for the growing movement that could fundamentally change who gets in the game -- and why.      Depending on what happens in Ohio, the next iteration of pro-legalization activists could be motivated by an entirely different kind of green: Cash.      Here's what you need to know about Ohio's unusual ballot initiative to legalize pot and how it could change the marijuana legalization movement.      It's not your average legalization campaign      There are a lot of firsts in Ohio, actually. If it legalizes recreation marijuana, Ohio would be the first Midwestern state and the first privately organized legalization campaign, notes Denver-based journalist Josiah M. Hesse in a Politico magazine piece.      It's also the first state to try to legalize recreational and medical marijuana at once. (States like Colorado and Washington already had a medical marijuana infrastructure in place when they expanded to recreational pot.)      But it's what happens after legalization that really sets Ohio's initiative apart. Cultivating and selling pot would be limited to 10 pre-determined farms. Any pot distributor in Ohio would have no choice but to buy marijuana grown from one of these farms. In essence, it's a marijuana monopoly.      Also unusual is the legalization campaign's blunt end game (see what we did there?). It's a constitutional amendment backed and financed almost exclusively by those who stand to benefit from its passage.      [6 questions about the future of pot legalization]      It's backed by Ohio pop culture stars            Like this guy. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)      The owners of the 10 farms include a grab-bag group of 24 investors that include former 98 Degrees boy-band crooner Nick Lachey, as well as descendants of former president William Howard Taft and NBA star Oscar Robertson. If the amendment is approved, they'll be ground-floor investors in a business that advocates estimate will bring in $1 billion a year.      Each ownership group was asked to invest roughly $2 to $4 million in the ResponsibleOhio campaign advocating for legalization.      And that's precisely the problem, say a diverse group of opponents that includes marijuana legalization advocates, who are joining forces with the usual cast of opponents like law enforcement officers. Ohio's constitution could soon basically enshrine these people's rights to make money, explains The Washington Post's Jessica Contrera.      The idea is so controversial that, in July, state lawmakers threw their own ballot initiative out there to counter this one. Known as the "anti-monopoly amendment," it would ban anyone from creating a constitutional amendment exclusively for financial gain.      If both pass -- a possibility -- this whole drama could go to the courts.

Supporters say the private-sector-driven initiative is the only way they could get a conservative-leaning state to even consider legalizing pot.      The brainchild of the initiative is veteran Ohio political operative Ian James, who has 30 years of experience in Ohio politics but little track record in the way of drug legalization. James has zeroed in on the traditional arguments for legalizing pot -- civil liberties, social justice, tax benefits -- and stayed away from the controversial layout of Ohio's potential pot industry.      "Let's stop pretending either that Ohioans don't consume marijuana or that only bad people do," he wrote in one of several op-eds during the spring.      [Marijuana could improve my teen son's life. But we won't know until it's legal]      Opponents, unsurprisingly, are calling to attention to the unique set-up.      "They are creating a constitutionally mandated oligopoly,” argues Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.      Despite Nadelmann's statement, the New York Times reports that the Marijuana Policy Project and Drug Policy Alliance are officially neutral on the initiative, while the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws "gave it an uneasy endorsement."      The public is also split on what to do            These guys are fans. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)      Ohioans appear as undecided as the pros.      A recent Bowling Green University poll shows 44 percent were for it and 43 percent were against it -- well within the three-and-a-half-point margin of error -- and a relatively high 13 percent undecided.      Other polls also show just about anything could happen on Tuesday.      [Ohio voters support and oppose legalizing marijuana. Wait, what?]      Ohio has arguably already changed the legalization game      Ohioans aren't just voting on a new model for financing and regulating legal pot. They're potentially reforming marijuana from a libertarian/hippie activity relegated to states out West into a socially acceptable investment that can flourish in unlikely places.      That's a big change for a country where marijuana is still classified as one of the most dangerous of drugs and where banks are technically prohibited from financing the industry. (The Justice Department has agreed to look the other way in states that legalize it.)      As Denver-based journalist Hesse notes, the game is already shifting just by Ohioans considering this measure. No matter what happens Tuesday, the state has begun to reframe the legalization debate from marijuana's social impact to its financial one.      "[W]ith recreational marijuana having already proved itself as an endeavor worthy of Big Business attention," he wrote, "it’s certain that we’re going to see large influxes of cash into future campaigns by investors looking for a stake in the coming green rush." ||||| Photo by redjar      Once upon a time it seemed that the seven-candidate mayoral race would be the one everyone would really watch closely on election night, but that was before Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance ended up on the ballot as City of Houston Proposition 1. Now, election day is finally here, and it looks as if HERO is going to be the star of the show.      For those who have been living under a rock, HERO is the equal rights ordinance that Mayor Annise Parker ushered into existence in 2014. The ordinance is designed to protect all kinds of people from being discriminated against in everything from employment to housing to public accommodations based on race, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity and a whole slew of other factors. In addition to being designed to protect against discrimination, the ordinance was also set up to allow quick legal action for those who experience discrimination.      However, despite the fact that the ordinance was designed to prevent many different types of discrimination, the anti-HERO folks almost immediately locked onto one particular angle with the ordinance: that transgender women would have the right to use women's restrooms. Why? Because they're convinced that "troubled men," as former Astros star Lance Berkman described them, will use the ordinance to dress up as women in order to attack women in public restrooms.      After Berkman's anti-HERO ad came out, Parker hit back on Twitter against his claims that HERO could put his wife and four daughters at risk in Houston's public bathrooms:      Lance Berkman played in St. Louis. Guess his girls didn't go to his games! SL has a non-discrimination ordinance.-A http://t.co/gzEbKIYOd9 — Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015      And:      When Lance Berkman went from NYC to STL to play ball did he do it to escape NYCs scary nondiscrimination law?-A — Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015      And:      Then Lance Berkman went to Dallas. Oops. Dallas amended its Charter to clarify gender identity protections. Can you spell hypocrite?-A — Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015      As soon as the law was passed by the city council last year, the anti-HERO groups started signing petitions and doing everything they could to repeal the ordinance or at least get it on the ballot for a vote. After lots of legal back-and-forth, the Texas Supreme Court ultimately decided back in July that the ordinance had to be put to a vote as City of Houston Proposition 1, and since then it's become the issue at the heart of this election.      (Keep in mind when voting that there are actually a number of different items called "proposition 1" on the ballot. The Texas Constitutional Amendment section Proposition 1 has to do with changing the homestead exemption on public school taxes ad valorem, while Harris County's Proposition 1 is about county road improvement bonds. If you go to the polls to vote on HERO, you're looking to vote for City of Houston Proposition 1, specifically.)      The thing is, it's looking less than certain that voters will uphold HERO. Sure, the polls going into the election showed voters leaning in favor of approving HERO, but a lot of people have already cast their ballots in early voting — about 133,000 voted early or by mail, according to the Houston Chronicle. Normally that would be a good thing, since it means people are actually voting in a non-presidential election year, but in this case it could actually be a sign that HERO will be defeated. As Texas Monthly pointed out, HERO's success will hinge on younger, socially progressive types getting out and voting, but so far it looks as if the increase in early voting turnout is coming from the more conservative enclaves like Kingwood, Memorial and Clear Lake, and the voters are generally skewing older. Meanwhile, the youngsters, the ones more likely to vote in favor of HERO, have barely shown up at the polls at all.      So there's a lot at stake on this Election Day. The mayoral race — composed of Sylvester Turner, Adrian Garcia, Ben Hall, Bill King, Steve Costello, Chris Bell and Marty McVey — will be mildly interesting, but it will almost definitely end up in a runoff. Yet the real show will play out as voters decide whether to approve HERO or to vote it down. If HERO is rejected at the polls, Houston will go in one fell swoop from being the first large city to elect an openly gay mayor to being the only large city in Texas without an equal rights ordinance.      Ultimately, no matter which way the electorate votes on this, it'll be national news. The fate of Proposition 1 has been on the political radar for months. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her support for the ordinance a few days ago.      No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love—I support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond. #HERO #YesOnProp1 -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 29, 2015      Then the day before the election, Gov. Greg Abbott sent out a tweet encouraging opposition to the ordinance, declaring there should be "no men in women's bathrooms."      HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms. — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) November 2, 2015      So yeah, it's election day, and by the time it's over, we'll either be known as the type of city that has an equal rights ordinance or we'll be the type of city that voted an equal rights ordinance down.       ||||| The Kentucky Republican Party has been frustrated with its mercurial nominee for the governor's mansion, Matt Bevin, pictured at left with opponent Jack Conway during a recent debate. | AP Photo 10 elections to watch Voters will head to the polls Tuesday to decide a number of races and issues that could ripple through 2016.      It’s not a presidential election year, but voters in a number of states will head to the polls on Tuesday to decide a number of races and issues that could resonate in 2016.      Democrats are hoping to chip away at Republicans’ recent dominance at the state level by retaining one competitive governorship and recapturing a key, swing-state legislative chamber. Republicans, meanwhile, are trying again to assert their off-year supremacy by demolishing the Democratic bench that is key to a potential comeback.      Story Continued Below      The elections aren't all about partisan politics. In a number of states and cities across the country, activists are hoping to enact sweeping policy changes via the ballot box, including marijuana legalization in a crucial Midwestern swing state.      Here are 10 contests to watch:      1) Kentucky governor: Kentucky has voted for the Republican nominee in seven of the past nine presidential elections, but the GOP has been shut out of the governor’s mansion for all but one four-year term since the early 1970s. The GOP thought the departure of term-limited Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear would break that streak, but the party has been frustrated with its mercurial nominee, Matt Bevin, who won a fractious GOP primary back in May by 83 votes. Still, Republicans think Bevin has a chance to defeat Democratic state Attorney General Jack Conway, who holds a slight lead in most polls: A group backed by the Republican Governors Association has spent more than $3 million since Labor Day, despite going dark for three weeks last month.      2-3) Kentucky auditor/attorney general: Republicans are hoping they can stop two future Democratic recruits in their tracks on Tuesday. State Auditor Adam Edelen is thought to be Democrats’ top pick to challenge Sen. Rand Paul next year, but Edelen first must dispatch Republican Mike Harmon. The GOP has also spent millions of dollars attacking Andy Beshear — the son of the outgoing governor who is bidding to succeed Conway as attorney general. But a poll released last week by a number of Kentucky media outlets showed Beshear leading Republican Whitney Westerfield.      4) Mississippi attorney general: Democrats are left with just one statewide officeholder in the Deep South: longtime Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, who was first elected in 2003 and is seeking a fourth term on Tuesday. A Mason-Dixon poll last week showed Hood with just a modest, 6-point lead over Republican Mike Hurst — but Hood’s campaign asserts the incumbent has a more comfortable lead. Still, Democrats didn’t put up a competitive candidate at the top of the ticket — their nominee to take on Gov. Phil Bryant is trucker Robert Gray — so we’ll be watching to see if Hood can withstand the wave.      5) Virginia state Senate District 29: All 40 seats in the Virginia state Senate are up for election on Tuesday, and Democrats’ chances to flip control of the chamber would be boosted if the party can hold onto the district being vacated by retiring state Sen. Chuck Colgan. Democrat Jeremy McPike and Republican Hal Parrish have both mounted extensive advertising campaigns in the expensive Washington market — even though most viewers don’t live in their Northern Virginia district. Much of that advertising — as is typical in suburban and exurban Virginia — focuses on transportation issues, with Republicans charging that McPike and other Democrats want to impose expensive tolls on local highways. Every single race is crucial: Republicans currently have a 21-19 advantage in the chamber; Democrats just need to get to a 20-20 tie to have the Democratic lieutenant governor vote to transfer control.      6-7) Michigan state House Districts 80 and 82 (primary): Control of Michigan’s state Legislature isn’t up for grabs — Republicans maintain safe majorities — but on the ballot Tuesday are two infamous former GOP state legislators mounting long-shot comeback bids. State Rep. Todd Courser — facing expulsion following a bizarre sequence of events stemming from an extramarital affair with a House colleague — resigned earlier this year. That colleague — state Rep. Cindy Gamrat — was expelled. But both are now running in the special primary elections to fill their respective seats. Courser has been updating voters on his campaign via his Facebook page — one post last week began with the sentence: “Today I received an endorsement letter from my wife!”      8) Ohio Issue 3 (legalize recreational marijuana): After successful campaigns in Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, marijuana legalization moves to a traditional Rust Belt swing state: Ohio. Issue 3 would legalize growing marijuana at 10 in-state facilities — and set up a regulatory regime for its production, sale and recreational use. But the measure faces some hurdles: Even some supporters like former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland (who is running for Senate next year) are troubled by the fact the initiative limits production to those 10 pre-selected firms. That’s prompted a second ballot initiative to prevent monopolies; depending on the vote on both measures, the courts may end up sorting out what happens next. Either way — the vote on Issue 3 will test the extent to which attitudes about marijuana are changing in a 2016 battleground state.      9) Houston Proposition 1 (equal rights): A ballot initiative in the nation’s fourth-largest city has the country’s top politicians weighing in. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton backed the measure — which prohibits “discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment and housing” — in a Twitter post last week. Opponents argue, however, that the measure would allow men — including sexual predators — to use public women’s restrooms. “HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values,” Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted Monday from his campaign account. “Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.”      10) San Francisco Proposition F (residential rentals): Affordable housing advocates want San Francisco voters to limit short-term residential rentals to 75 days a year — a blow to the rental website Airbnb, which is based in the city. Airbnb has reportedly spent millions to try to convince San Franciscans to reject the measure and released an internal poll last week showing a majority intend to vote against it. The initiative is also backed by hotel unions. ||||| The governor's race in Kentucky and a school-funding battle in Mississippi are among the top races Tuesday in what otherwise is a relatively low-key, off-year election cycle.      Just two states are holding elections for governor while three have general state legislative elections. Yet decisions made by voters in several cities and states could be an important bellwether of sentiment ahead of next year's presidential elections.      In Virginia, a swing state, Democrats are pushing to reverse a narrow Republican majority in the state Senate and empower Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in negotiations with Republicans who control the state House.      Houston and Philadelphia are among cities selecting mayors, while Salt Lake City voters will choose between the incumbent and a challenger who seeks to become the first gay person elected mayor of Utah's capital.      Several city or state ballot initiatives will test voter preferences on school funding, marijuana, gay and lesbian rights, and the sharing economy.      Closely watched is the battle for Kentucky's open gubernatorial seat, which features a two-term Democratic attorney general who vows to maintain the state's Medicaid expansion and a Republican businessman looking to upend the political dynamic in a Southern state where Democrats still control statewide offices.      Republican Matt Bevin has been running as an outsider, wooing the state's conservative voters with a message of "vote your values and not your party." Democrat Jack Conway has been emphasizing his support for early education programs while saying that 400,000 people could lose taxpayer-funded health insurance if Bevin is elected. Also on the ballot is Drew Curtis, a businessman running as an independent.      The governor's race in Mississippi has been largely overshadowed by a fight over a constitutional amendment that would allow people to sue the state to increase funding for public schools. Critics say it would take budget decisions away from Mississippi lawmakers and give the courts too much power. The Legislature has put forward its own ballot measure that would prohibit "judicial enforcement" of school funding.      The outcome could prompt similar efforts in other states where education remains a key challenge for lawmakers as they look to balance their budgets with tax revenues that have yet to rebound to pre-recession levels.      Meanwhile, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, appears on track for re-election. He faces political newcomer Robert Gray, a long-haul trucker who was the surprise winner of the Democratic primary.      In Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, efforts to secure non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people will face a key test. Now that same-sex marriage is legal, such laws have become a priority for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups. Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, contend the measure infringes on their religious beliefs.      Houston voters also will chose from among 13 candidates to replace outgoing Mayor Annise Parker. In Philadelphia, Democrat Jim Kenney, a former city councilman, is considered the favorite to succeed Mayor Michael Nutter.      The Salt Lake City mayoral race features two-term incumbent Ralph Becker, one of Obama's appointees on a climate change task force, and former state lawmaker Jackie Biskupski. If Biskupski wins, she will be the city's first openly gay mayor.      Elsewhere, voters in Ohio will consider whether to allow the use of marijuana for recreational and medicinal use. San Francisco voters will decide a citizen-backed initiative to restrict the operations of Airbnb, the room-rental site, and a $310 million bond package for affordable housing.      In Washington state, a proposal backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen would add state penalties for anyone who imports certain animal products for commercial purposes, such as elephant ivory or rhino horns.      And Colorado voters will decide what to do with $66 million in tax revenue generated from the sale of recreational marijuana. An existing state law requires excess tax revenue to be returned to taxpayers. A statewide initiative on Tuesday's ballot asks voters to make an exception with the marijuana revenue and direct it instead toward public education and drug-prevention programs.      ___      Follow Christina Almeida Cassidy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/AP_Christina . ||||| The Governor of Kentucky is the head of the executive branch of Kentucky's state government,[1] and serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[2] The governor has a duty to enforce state laws;[3] the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Kentucky General Assembly;[4] the power to convene the legislature;[5] and the power to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.[6] He or she is also empowered to reorganize the state government or reduce it in size. Historically, the office has been regarded as one of the most powerful executive positions in the United States.[7]      Fifty-eight individuals have held the office of Governor. Prior to a 1992 amendment to the state's constitution, the Governor was prohibited from succeeding himself in office, though four men (Isaac Shelby, John L. Helm, James B. McCreary and Happy Chandler) served multiple non-consecutive terms. Paul E. Patton, the first Kentucky Governor eligible for a second consecutive term under the amendment, won his reelection bid in 1999. James Garrard succeeded himself in 1800, before the constitutional provision existed.      William Goebel, who was elected to the office in the disputed election of 1899, remains the only Governor of any U.S. state to die from assassination while in office.[8] Martha Layne Collins, who held the office from 1983 to 1987, was the first woman to serve as governor and was only the third woman to serve as governor of any U.S. state who was not the wife or widow of a previous governor.[7] The 62nd and current Kentucky Governor is Republican Matt Bevin, who took office on December 8, 2015.      Governors [ edit ]      Kentucky was initially Kentucky County in Virginia. It achieved statehood and was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1792; see the list of governors of Virginia for the period before statehood. There have been 57 governors, serving 61 distinct terms.      An unelected group proclaimed Kentucky's secession from the Union on November 20, 1861, and it was annexed by the Confederate States of America on December 10, 1861. The Confederate government elected two governors (listed separately), but it never held much control over the state, and the main line of governors was preserved.      The original 1792 Kentucky Constitution had the governor chosen by an electoral college for a term of four years.[9] The second constitution in 1799 changed this to a popular vote, and prevented governors from succeeding themselves within seven years of their terms.[10] The third constitution in 1850 reduced the succession limitation to four years.[11] A 1992 amendment to the constitution allowed governors to have a second term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.[12]      Confederate governors [ edit ]      During the Civil War, a group of secessionists met at the Russellville to form a Confederate government for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While this government never successfully displaced the government in Frankfort, two men were elected governor of the Confederate government: George W. Johnson, who served from November 20, 1861 to his death on April 8, 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh, and, on Johnson's death, Richard Hawes, who served until the Confederate surrender on April 9, 1865. The Confederate government disbanded shortly after the end of the war in 1865.[15]      See also [ edit ]      Notes [ edit ]      References [ edit ]      General      Constitution ||||| a 24-year military veteran and captain of a major fire department                  Iris tells wearehero.us: "Once you leave military service, you are not afforded the same protections as you were given serving in active duty.

And while no federal offices are on the table, results from these states will have implications for House and Senate contests in 2016.      Here’s what to watch on Election Day 2015:      Big day in Kentucky: The state’s banner gubernatorial race features Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway and Republican businessman Matt Bevin to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Steven L. Beshear, who is term-limited. Throughout October, Conway held a slight lead in most polls.      The race has been a wild ride for Bevin, who at the beginning of the fall briefly lost the support of the Republican Governors Association, which disagreed with his campaign tactics. But in mid-October, the RGA returned to the state to compete with the Democratic Governors Association, which has provided money and support for Conway.      Conway has repeatedly criticized Bevin for his apparent inconsistencies when talking about repealing Medicaid expansion (which were featured on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” on Sunday) and his refusal to release his tax returns. Bevin, who has never before held elective office, has portrayed Conway as a career politician who would rubber-stamp President Barack Obama’s agenda.      The race could also have implications for the Bluegrass State’s Democratic bench.      Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes — the Democrat who led an unsuccessful challenge to Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell — is using her re-election campaign to rebuild her popularity. Andy Beshear, the governor’s son, is fighting for a win in the state’s tight race for attorney general against Republican state Sen. Whitney Westerfield. And Adam Edelen, Kentucky’s auditor of public accounts, is looking for strong numbers as he considers a campaign next year against Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who has faced criticism at home for his lagging presidential bid.      Last Democrat standing in Mississippi: The elections in Mississippi could mark a milestone for both parties: If Attorney General Jim Hood loses re-election, Republicans will hold every statewide elected office in the Magnolia State.      Hood’s personality and politics fit the state, but it’s unclear whether having an uppercase D next to his name on the ballot in a state that has gone solidly Republican will outweigh the goodwill he’s built over his 10 years as the state’s top law enforcement officer.      At the top of the ballot, Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, is expected to sail to re-election. He is being challenged by Democrat Robert Gray, a truck driver who won the August primary without spending a penny.      Also on the ballot are dueling measures dealing with education funding. Initiative 42 would give courts more power to enforce funding requirements under the state’s education foundation formula. The measure is opposed by Bryant and a large number of trade organizations. Republicans in the Legislature have placed Initiative 42A, which will appear alongside Initiative 42, on the ballot. The counter initiative would prohibit courts from being involved in education funding.      Local New York race with 2016 House implications: Mike Hein, the Ulster County executive, is on the ballot for re-election, and if victorious, he could make a decision soon on whether to run for Congress in New York’s 19th District.      If he does decide to run, Hein would likely be a top-tier candidate in the Tossup race for this open seat held currently by Rep. Chris Gibson, a Republican who is not seeking re-election.      Another state considers legal weed: Ohio voters will determine whether the state becomes the fifth, along with the District of Columbia, to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. A group of 10 wealthy investors is pushing the measure by spending nearly $25 million on the campaign while it is opposed by a coalition of law enforcement officials, public officials from both parties, business, clergy, physicians, and farmers.      While Colorado deals with excess revenue from it: What to do with the $66 million in excess tax revenue generated from the sale of recreational marijuana? An existing state law requires excess tax revenue to be returned to taxpayers. A statewide initiative on the ballot asks voters to make an exception, and instead direct the tax revenue from marijuana sales toward public education and drug-prevention programs.      Tipping the scales in Virginia: Democrats must net two seats to win control of the state Senate. Netting one seat would allow Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam to break a tie.      A Democratic Senate could help Gov. Terry McAuliffe push Medicaid expansion, but with the House of Delegates expected to remain in GOP hands, McAuliffe’s priorities aren’t likely to go very far.      Both sides are hoping that winning control of the Senate, and the ground operation built in the process, will foreshadow a presidential victory for their respective nominees.      Control of the General Assembly aside, the electoral success (or failure) of Democratic state legislature candidates could push some of them to jump into Virginia’s congressional races, with the 10th District currently the most competitive.      Several districts in the Old Dominion State could become more competitive depending on how a three-judge court redraws the state’s congressional map. (A court dismissed a similar challenge to its legislative districts on Oct. 22.) Democratic recruitment at the congressional level has been slow since state-level Democrats are waiting to see what the federal map will look like.      High drama on high court: In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court elections could have a broad impact on the state’s 2020 redistricting.      Seats on the seven-member court are up every 10 years, and three of them are on the ballot this year. If Democrats win two of those seats, they would regain control of the body.      And with the court often tasked with picking the fifth member of the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, this could give Democrats a leg-up on redrawing the 18 congressional seats in the Keystone State, of which Democrats currently control just five, despite carrying presidential, governor and Senate races.      A very short redemption story in Michigan: Two tea-party-backed former lawmakers who had an affair, and then attempted to cover it up with a hoax letter about a male prostitute, are hoping for a second chance in the Legislature.      Ex-Rep. Todd Courser, who resigned in September, and ex-Rep. Cindy Gamrat, who was expelled, have filed to run in the special primary to fill the seats that they lost.      But with low turnout and multiple conservatives running in each primary, it would be a surprise if the disgraced former lawmakers advanced to the special general election in March.

Conway leads Republican Matt Bevin by about 3 percentage points in the Huffington Post/Pollster aggregate and Real Clear Politics average of Kentucky gubernatorial polls. That may surprise some of you given that this is the same state that elected McConnell by over 15 percentage points last year and voted for Mitt Romney by over 22 percentage points in 2012.      But whether Conway wins or not, you shouldn’t be surprised if the race is as close as the polls suggest. There is an increasingly strong relationship between the presidential bent of a state and down-ticket ballot preferences; people are more likely to pick all Republicans or all Democrats. But voters are still willing to buck the party line in gubernatorial races much more so than in Senate elections.      You can see the lack of the relationship quite well by plotting the 2014 gubernatorial margin in a state versus the 2012 presidential margin.      There’s some correlation, but it’s not particularly strong. The 2012 presidential vote in a state explains only 36 percent of the variation in the 2014 gubernatorial margin. Voters in 12 states chose a governor opposite the party that won their state’s presidential contest two years earlier. Some of those were in swing states such as Florida (Republican Rick Scott) and Wisconsin (Republican Scott Walker), but many weren’t, including dark-blue Maryland (Republican Larry Hogan) and Massachusetts (Republican Charlie Baker). Nor was it just that Democratic states were choosing Republican governors. The normally Republican-leaning voters of Alaska tossed out incumbent Sean Parnell for the independent ticket of former Republican Bill Walker and Democrat Byron Mallott. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback barely won re-election in a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 50 years.      The lack of nationalization in 2014 gubernatorial elections is in stark contrast to Senate races. Here’s the same chart as above but using the 2014 senatorial races instead of the gubernatorial ones.      The 2012 presidential results explain 76 percent of the variation in the 2014 senatorial results. There were the same number of Senate and governor races last year, but only three states voted for a senator from a different party than the candidate they chose in the 2012 presidential race. Two of those were swing states (Colorado and Iowa). Only Maine, by re-electing longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins, really strayed from its 2012 presidential choice.      How could there be such a difference between the gubernatorial and senatorial voting patterns? The easy interpretation is that voters are smart. Senators work with the president, so an attack ad saying that a candidate is a rubber stamp for the [insert party] agenda holds a lot more weight in federal races. Governors don’t work with the president on most issues. They work with their state legislatures.      Indeed, voters separated their gubernatorial and presidential voting patterns in 2014 for state specific reasons. Voters in Maryland looked to Hogan in anger over high taxes by the previous Democratic administration, as did those in Illinois. In fact, Illinois elected a Republican governor even as its Democratic senator won re-election easily. Alaskans were upset over Parnell’s handling of oil taxes and his poor relationship with fellow Republicans in the legislature. Kansas voters felt betrayed by Brownback’s position on education funding and budget shortfalls.      Kentucky is a clear example of voters looking past their national allegiances. The state has elected just two Republican governors since World War II, even as it has become increasingly Republican on the national level. This year, Bevin (a tea party outsider who ran against McConnell in the Republican Senate primary last year) has made a number of missteps on the campaign trail and has alienated many members of the Republican establishment. He’s been tagged as too extreme, including on Kentucky’s relatively popular expansion of Medicaid. Meanwhile, Conway, the state’s attorney general, is the definition of smooth. So far, these factors have worked together to give Conway a lead, but one that is small enough that Bevin could win.      If Conway wins, he can be thankful that many voters are still willing to split their gubernatorial and presidential tickets. |||||	– Everyone's watercooler buzz has been focused on Election 2016 lately, but there's business to be taken care of at the polls Tuesday. Some notable races and ballot items to keep an eye on: The GOP hopes to address the elephant in the room in Kentucky: that there has only been one Republican governor there since the early 1970s, Politico notes. Still, Republicans are hoping nominee Matt Bevin can beat Democratic state Attorney General Jack Conway. Bevin—who FiveThirtyEight notes "has made a number of missteps … [and] alienated many members of the Republican establishment"—is losing to the "smooth" Conway in the polls, but not by much. Ohio will be voting on whether to legalize pot for both medical and recreational use at once—the only state to do so, per the Washington Post—with its Issue 3 initiative. Surprisingly, Issue 3 is expected to be voted down by many pot advocates, who don't like that the measure would effectively create a marijuana monopoly (and make guys like Nick Lachey super-rich). The Virginia state Senate is in the hot seat. The Dems want to wrest control from their GOP counterparts, which means they need to net just two seats, per Roll Call. Perhaps the most closely watched race: who will fill the slot of retiring Democratic state Sen. Chuck Colgan, with Dem Jeremy McPike and his GOP opponent, Hal Parrish, both going all out with their ad campaigns, Politico notes. Mississippi's Jim Hood, deemed by Roll Call as the "last Democrat standing" in the state, is up for his fourth term as attorney general: If he loses to Mike Hurst, Republicans would inhabit every statewide elected office. Also making waves there (even more so than the governor's race): a state constitutional amendment that would let people sue Mississippi to up funding for public schools, the AP reports. Houston's Prop 1, supported by the LGBT community, would prevent discrimination in everything from employment and housing to public accommodations, the Houston Press reports. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday asked Houston voters to "Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms," which the Houston Chronicle notes was a response to Hillary's previous support for the measure. Hillary Clinton's response Tuesday: "@GregAbbott_TX is right about one thing: equality is one of Hillary's values. Houston—vote #YesOnProp1 today." (Meanwhile, Airbnb's future in San Francisco depends on a critical proposition vote.)
summarize: Austria’s coalition government has promised to ban Muslim face-covering veils and to restrict eastern European workers’ access to the labour market, in a package of policies aimed at countering the rise of the far-right Freedom Party.      The anti-Islam Freedom Party (FPO) has topped opinion polls for months, boosted by the influx of more than a million migrants into Europe in the past two years and concerns over their impact on jobs and security. Last month the FPO candidate came close to winning Austria’s presidential election.      With a parliamentary election due next year, Chancellor Christian Kern of the Social Democratic Party (SPO) hopes the package will provide fresh impetus to an eight-month-old coalition widely seen as ineffective.      “We agreed that we must work faster and more clearly,” conservative Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner told a joint news conference with Kern outlining their 35-page plan. “It is now up to us to do what governing parties do, namely implement the programme.”      The deal included a ban on Muslim veils such as the burka and niqab, which cover all or most of the face, and said a more general ban on civil servants wearing religious symbols was in the works.      “We believe in an open society that is also based on open communication. Full-body veils in public spaces stand against that and will therefore be prohibited,” the agreement said.      Mainly Catholic Austria is home to around 600,000 Muslims in a total population of about 8.7 million. The conservative People's Party, the junior coalition member, obtained tougher measures on security, including the electronic tagging of former jihadists.      The SPO opposed its call for a lowering of an annual cap on asylum claims, agreeing instead to strengthen existing border controls in general and to support measures such as greater incentives for voluntary deportation.      The deal also included a requirement that 30 per cent of a company's supervisory board members be female and a plan to make foreign multinationals, particularly online companies, pay the same tax on advertising revenue as newspapers.      Unemployment in Austria has been steadily rising but is still relatively low at 5.9 per cent, under a harmonised EU measure.      Earlier this month Kern proposed returning to a system that gave local workers priority for jobs in sectors that employ a high number of people from poorer eastern European member states. The system was in place provisionally from 2004 to 2011 after many ex-communist countries joined the bloc.

Brussels is unlikely to accept such a system, however, as it clashes with the fundamental EU principle of free movement of people. ||||| Austria's governing coalition has agreed to ban full-face veils in courts, schools and other "public places" as part of a reform programme aimed at countering the rise of the far-Right in the country.      The agreement was made between the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and the centrist People's party as Chancellor Christian Kern attempts to regain the political initiative from the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) ahead of next year's parliamentary election.      "The full-face veil will be banned in public spaces," Mr Kern said after the week-long negotiations concluded, adding that the ban will be implemented over the next 18 months. ||||| (CNN) The Austrian government has announced plans to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public, part of a raft of measures to contain the rise of the far-right Freedom Party.      The plan -- which would ban the burqa, niqab and other face-covering veils -- echoes calls that German Chancellor Angela Merkel made last month for a similar ban in Germany.      It also comes amid growing concerns of harassment against Muslims around the world following US President Donald Trump's temporary ban on citizens from some Muslim-majority countries entering the United States.      The Social Democratic and Austrian People's parties, which rule in a coalition, released a 35-page document outlining their vision for Austria as an "open society that requires open communication."      "Full-face veils in public places are the opposite of that and will be banned," the document said.      Photos: Burqa, hijab, niqab: What's what?

Hide Caption 6 of 6      Any ban would need the Austrian Parliament's approval to be enforced.      The document says that Austria was introducing the reforms to ensure the "state presents itself in a world-open and religiously neutral manner," adding that civil servants in uniform as well as judges and prosecutors should show religious neutrality in the way they dress in public, effectively banning them from wearing Islamic headscarves.      'Integration contracts' for asylum-seekers      The announcement was met with a backlash from Islamic groups and Austrian Muslims, who slammed the plan as discriminatory.      "It is saddening. This is a setback for Austria, for our democracy and for our understanding of diversity," said Amani Abu Zahra from the Islamic religion department at the University for Teacher Education of Christian Churches.      Tarafa Baghajati, chair of the Austrian Muslim Initiative, said that while he didn't necessarily agree with the full-face veil, he considered an outright ban "counterproductive."      Baghajati said he found the "de facto headscarf ban" on civil servants more problematic.      "This is state-run discrimination against Muslim women that violates the constitution and anti-discrimination laws," he said.      The government will also try to force asylum-seekers and some migrants to sign an "integration contract and a declaration of values" and agree to "strict sanctions" if the contract is violated. It will seek to reinforce border controls, increase police presence and tighten asylum procedures.      The document is an 18-month plan that will take the government, led by Chancellor Christian Kern, up to the next elections, likely to be held in 2018.      The ruling parties are facing a rapid rise in popularity of the far-right, Euroskeptic Freedom Party, which has campaigned against what it sees as the Islamization of the country, calling for "zero migration" and a boost to border security.      France became the first European country to ban the full-face veil officially in 2010. Bans are also in place in Belgium and some parts of Switzerland, while other European countries have debated the issue. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images      Countries across Europe have wrestled with the issue of the Muslim veil - in various forms such as the body-covering burka and the niqab, which covers the face apart from the eyes.      The debate takes in religious freedom, female equality, secular traditions and even fears of terrorism.      The veil issue is part of a wider debate about multiculturalism in Europe, as many politicians argue that there needs to be a greater effort to assimilate ethnic and religious minorities.      Germany      On 6 December 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the wearing of full-faced veils should be prohibited in Germany "wherever it is legally possible".      Her comments, made at a CDU party meeting, came after plans to outlaw the burka - or any full-face veil - in public buildings were proposed by Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere in August.      There has been no national law restricting the wearing of veils in Germany prior to these proposals.      In September 2003 the federal Constitutional Court had ruled in favour of a teacher who wanted to wear an Islamic scarf to school.      Image copyright AFP      However, it said states could change their laws locally if they wanted to.      At least half of Germany's 16 states went on to ban teachers from wearing headscarves and in the state of Hesse the ban included civil servants.      The southern state of Bavaria went on to prohibit full-face veils in schools, polling stations, universities and government offices in early 2017.      Austria      The ruling coalition agreed in January 2017 to prohibit full-face veils (niqab and burka) in public spaces such as courts and schools, with the law coming in to force in October the same year. The government said at the time it was considering a more general ban on state employees wearing the headscarf and other religious symbols.      The measures were seen as an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right Freedom Party, which almost won the presidency in December 2016.      The coalition, made up of the left-wing Social Democrats and the conservative Austrian People's Party, said that full-face veils in public stood in the way of "open communication", which it said was fundamental to an "open society".      Only an estimated 150 women wear the full niqab in Austria but tourism officials expressed fears that the measures would also deter visitors from the Gulf as it would apply at ski resorts, as much as the capital, Vienna.      The measures require parliamentary approval before they can come into force.      France      On 11 April 2011, France became the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places.      Under the ban, no woman, French or foreign, is able to leave their home with their face hidden behind a veil without running the risk of a fine.      As President, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose administration brought in the ban, said that veils oppress women and were "not welcome" in France.      In 2016 France introduced a controversial ban on women's full-body swimsuits, known as "burkinis". Prime Minister Manuel Valls called the swimsuits "the affirmation of political Islam in the public space".      The burkini ban, imposed by French Riviera mayors, was later lifted in seaside resorts after France's top administrative court overruled the law.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Headscarves are allowed at French universities - but not schools      France has about five million Muslims - the largest Muslim minority in Western Europe - but it is thought only about 2,000 women wear full veils.      The penalty for doing so is a 150 euro (£133, $217) fine and instruction in citizenship. Anyone found forcing a woman to cover her face risks a 30,000 euro fine.      Data from 2015 showed that 1,546 fines had been imposed under the law.      The European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban on 2 July 2014 after a case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman who argued that the ban violated her freedom of religion and expression.      Most of the population - including most Muslims - agree with the government when it describes the face-covering veil as an affront to society's values. Critics - chiefly outside France - say it is a violation of individual liberties.      A ban on Muslim headscarves and other "conspicuous" religious symbols at state schools was introduced in 2004, and received overwhelming political and public support in a country where the separation of state and religion is enshrined in law.      Belgium      A law banning the full-face veil came into effect in Belgium in July 2011.      The law bans any clothing that obscures the identity of the wearer in places like parks and on the street.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Veiled women in Belgium have staged protests against the ban      In December 2012, Belgium's Constitutional Court rejected appeals for the ban to be annulled, ruling that it did not violate human rights.      The Belgian law was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2017.      Before the bill was passed, the burka was already banned in several districts under old local laws originally designed to stop people masking their faces completely at carnival time.      The Netherlands      In November 2016, Dutch MPs backed a ban on the Islamic full veil in public places such as schools and hospitals, and on public transport.      The niqab and the burka full-face veils were included in the ban along with face coverings such as ski-masks and helmets.      In order for the ban to become law, the Dutch Senate must approve the bill.      Prime Minister Mark Rutte's ruling Liberal-Labour coalition described the bill, which will see offenders fined up to 410 euros (£350, $435), as "religious-neutral".      The proposed ban reflected the influence of the anti-Islamist Geert Wilders, whose Freedom party was at that time the third largest in parliament and the minority coalition government's chief ally.      Image copyright AFP Image caption Populist politician Geert Wilders, of the anti-immigration Freedom Party, wants tougher policies on Islam      Around 5% of the Netherlands' 16 million residents are Muslims, but only around 300 are thought to wear the niqab or the burka. The wearing of headscarves is far more common, however.      Italy      Several towns in Italy have local bans on face-covering veils. The north-western town of Novara is one of several local authorities to have already brought in rules to deter public use of the Islamic veil.      In the Lombardy region of Italy, a burka ban was agreed in December 2015 and came into effect in January 2016.      Governments have discussed extending laws to impose penalties on Muslim face coverings, but these have not yet been enforced nationally.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This sign in Varallo says that the Burqa, Niqab and Burqini are not allowed by communal decision      In 2004 local politicians in northern Italy resurrected old public order laws against the wearing of masks, to stop women from wearing the burka.      Some mayors from the anti-immigrant Northern League have also banned the use of Islamic swimsuits.      Spain      Though there are no plans for a national ban in Spain, in 2010 the city of Barcelona announced a ban on full Islamic face-veils in some public spaces such as municipal offices, public markets and libraries.      At least two smaller towns in Catalonia, the north-eastern region that includes Barcelona, have also imposed bans.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Barcelona was the first major city in Spain to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public buildings      But a ban in the town of Lleida was overturned by Spain's Supreme Court in February 2013. It ruled that it was an infringement of religious liberties.      Barcelona's city council said the ban there targeted any head-wear that impeded identification, including motorbike helmets and balaclavas.      Britain      There is no ban on Islamic dress in the UK, but schools are allowed to decide their own dress code after a 2007 directive which followed several high-profile court cases.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Islamic groups see a ban on full-face veils as discrimination against Muslims      In January 2010, then Schools Secretary Ed Balls said it was "not British" to tell people what to wear in the street after the UK Independence Party called for all face-covering Muslim veils to be banned.      In September 2013, Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne called for a "national debate" about Islamic veils in public places, such as schools.      In 2014 UKIP came first in the European elections in Britain, winning 24 seats in Brussels. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said that full veils are a symbol of an "increasingly divided Britain", that they "oppress" women, and are a potential security threat.      Some 57% of the British public support a burka ban in the UK, a YouGov poll in August 2016 found.      Turkey      For more than 85 years Turks have lived in an officially secular state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who rejected headscarves as backward-looking.      Image copyright AFP Image caption Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's wife, Emine, wears a headscarf      Scarves are banned in civic spaces and official buildings, but the issue is deeply divisive for the country's predominantly Muslim population, as two-thirds of all Turkish women - including the wives and daughters of the prime minister and president - cover their heads.      In 2008, Turkey's constitution was amended to ease a strict ban at universities, allowing headscarves that were tied loosely under the chin. Headscarves covering the neck and all-enveloping veils were still banned.      In October 2013, Turkey lifted rules banning women from wearing headscarves in the country's state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police.      The governing AK Party, which has Islamist roots, said the ban meant many girls were being denied an education. But the secular establishment said easing it would be a first step to allowing Islam into public life.      In August 2016, Turkey began allowing policewomen to wear the headscarf.      Denmark      The Danish parliament approved a bill in May 2018 to punish anyone wearing a full-face veil with a fine, which would increase tenfold if an individual was caught again. It is due to come into effect in August 2018.      Ten years earlier, the government announced it would bar judges from wearing headscarves and similar religious or political symbols - including crucifixes, Jewish skull caps and turbans - in courtrooms.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Denmark's parliament approved a ban on niqabs and burkas in May 2018      That move came after pressure from the Danish People's Party (DPP), known for its anti-Muslim rhetoric, which has since called for the ban to be extended to include school teachers and medical personnel.      After a Danish paper published a controversial cartoon in 2005 depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a bearded man with a bomb in his turban, there were a series of protests against Denmark across the Muslim world.      Russia      Russia's Stavropol region has a ban on hijabs - the first of its kind imposed by a region in the Russian federation. The ruling was upheld by Russia's Supreme Court in July 2013.      In Chechnya, the authorities have defied Russian policy on Islamic dress. In 2007 President Ramzan Kadyrov - the pro-Moscow leader - issued an edict ordering women to wear headscarves in state buildings. It is a direct violation of Russian law, but is strictly followed today.      President Kadyrov even voiced support for men who fired paintballs at women deemed to be violating the strict dress code.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 16 million Muslims live in Russia      Switzerland      In late 2009, Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said a face-veil ban should be considered if more Muslim women begin wearing them, adding that the veils made her feel "uncomfortable".      In September 2013, 65% of the electorate in the Italian-speaking region of Ticino voted in favour of a ban on face veils in public areas by any group.      It was the first time that any of Switzerland's 26 cantons has imposed such a ban.      There are about 350,000 Muslims in Switzerland, which has a population of eight million.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Swiss Muslim women protested against the cantonal vote in Ticino on banning face-covering veils      Bulgaria      In October 2016, Bulgaria's parliament passed a bill backed by a nationalist coalition to fine and cut the benefits of women who cover their faces in public. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Several European countries have imposed a full-face veil ban and others are considering it      Austria's ruling coalition has agreed to prohibit full-face veils in public spaces such as courts and schools.      It is also considering a more general ban on state employees wearing the headscarf and other religious symbols.      The measures are seen as an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right Freedom Party, whose candidate narrowly lost last month's presidential vote.      The centrist coalition nearly collapsed last week amid crisis negotiations over the government's future direction.      'Symbolic' step      Detailing the package of reforms, the coalition devoted just two lines to the planned ban on the Islamic niqab and burqa.      "We are committed to an open society, which also presupposes open communication. A full-face veil in public places stands in its way and will therefore be banned," it said.      An estimated 150 women wear the full niqab in Austria but tourism officials have expressed fears that the measures will also deter visitors from the Gulf.      One government spokesman told an Austrian newspaper that the ban would apply for ski resorts such as Zell am See as much as the centre of Vienna.      Several European countries have imposed similar bans but the Austrian move is, according to the vice chancellor a "symbolic" step.      Integration Minister Sebastian Kurz said it was important to be seen to be neutral, especially for anyone dealing with the public in the police or schools.      France and Belgium introduced a burqa ban in 2011 and a similar measure is currently going through the Dutch parliament.      Chancellor Angela Merkel said last month that the full-face veil should be prohibited in Germany "wherever it is legally possible". The UK does not ban the niqab or burqa.      Further measures agreed by Austria's Social Democrats and their conservative People's party partners include electronic tagging of former jihadists and a proposed curb on foreign workers.      Many of the plans must be hammered out in detail and receive parliamentary approval before they can come into force, BBC Vienna correspondent Bethany Bell reports.      What is a niqab and a burka?      The niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. However, it may be worn with a separate eye veil. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf.      The burka is the most concealing of all Islamic veils. It is a one-piece veil that covers the face and body, often leaving just a mesh screen to see through. |||||	– Face-covering veils are set to be banned in public places in Austria, per the country's ruling coalition, with a more widespread ban of all headscarves and religious symbols worn by state employees possible down the road, the BBC reports. The ban on niqabs (veils that cover all of the face except the eyes) and burkas (full body-and-face coverings that usually have just a mesh opening to peer through) was included in a 35-page packet of policies meant to counteract the ascension of the ultra-conservative Freedom Party, per the Independent. "We believe in an open society that is also based on open communication," reads the document, which adds that face-hiding coverings in public spaces "stand against that" open communication. Austria is a Catholic-majority country, with about 600,000 Muslims in a population of 8.7 million or so, the Independent notes. The full-face veil has become a controversial issue in Europe: France was the first EU country to ban it in 2011, with Belgium following later that year, per the BBC. Cities in other countries have similar bans, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for one in December. Muslims in Austria are pushing back on the development in their own country, with some calling it a "setback" and "counterproductive," per CNN. "This is state-run discrimination against Muslim women," the chair of the Austrian Muslim Initiative says. The Austrian government also has an "integration contract and a declaration of values" it wants to make refugees and certain immigrants sign. "Those who are not prepared to accept Enlightenment values will have to leave our country and society," the document text reads, per the Telegraph. (A woman in Australia went off on a student wearing a niqab.)
summarize: ST. PETERSBURG — The first butts, perhaps, appeared in April on some steps behind the Sundial shopping plaza.      They were black marker scrawled on dirty, caution-yellow paint, about six inches tall, and shapely.      Three buttocks, formed by four unbroken lines. A simple yet mind-bending design that conjures a police lineup of backsides, or an alien race anatomically different from our own. They stood out among downtown's indecipherable graffiti, the signatures of bandit artists who mark up buildings undetected. People prone to walking might know of "blob dylan," and "dgen" and the person stenciling "fat guys with beards are everywhere."      But butts? On social media, a photo of the butts was a hit. They were kind of cute, people said, and definitely funny.      And then, the butts were everywhere. Dozens have appeared around the city since spring.      MORE FROM THIS WRITER: He tried to profit from St. Pete's murals, then felt the artist's wrath      A walk along Third Street between Fourth Avenue S and Central Avenue revealed what appeared to be an overnight butt spree, half a dozen more on the backs of signs and an empty display board outside a vacant nightclub. Soon they were on a pay phone in Williams Park, a trash bin in Old Northeast, the wall of an empty building in Grand Central and a utility box near the Morean Arts Center.      There were variations. Some had four cheeks. One on the restroom wall inside Black Crow Coffee has seven. Just this week, butts appeared on boards covering broken windows at the old YMCA building and along Second Avenue S.      Tagging seems to be on the rise, St. Petersburg Police officials say. The city's graffiti abatement program, which cleans up the tags, reports a 50 percent increase in calls to its graffiti hotline compared to this time last year. A weeklong project recently scrubbed 550 tags from the downtown corridor.      St. Petersburg assistant police chief James Previtera estimates maybe two or three people get arrested for tagging each year. The charge is misdemeanor criminal mischief, though if you've been convicted before, it can be a felony.      Generally, the few who get in trouble are caught in the act, or were tagging something someone really cared about.      "We're mostly concerned with investigating the graffiti that people report to us, the ones that cause real damage to private property that costs people money," Previtera said.      The city photographs and logs the address of every single tag it cleans up, so when a tagger gets caught, they can also be charged for previous work. Mostly, though, the taggers remain a mystery since the work is completed in seconds, in the dark, and with paint pens small enough to be concealed in a pocket.      As for the butts, the city's lone detective tasked with investigating graffiti is "very aware" of them, said St. Petersburg public information officer Yolanda Fernandez. Regina Williams, who runs the graffiti abatement program said, "Oh yeah, we've seen those." She chuckled about the butts, but made it crystal clear: "Graffiti is vandalism, and it takes a lot of work to clean up."      There's a sharp distinction between the type of street art St. Petersburg has become known for through its many murals, and graffiti, which is done without permission.      Muralist Johnny Vitale of the Vitale Bros. thinks a few taggers have some artistic skill, but are perhaps too lazy to do a mural, even though they live in a city where people are readily offering up blank walls. He has seen the butts, and admits they are pretty funny.      "It's an adrenaline rush to go out there and do that," Vitale said. "These kids — they're not even kids, they're adults — I think they do it for the rush."      Was that the motive behind the mysterious butt bandit? Adrenaline? For months, the tags offered no clues as to who might have the answer, or what the motives might be. Was it even one person? There could be a whole collective of butt-drawing taggers.      And then, a possible clue. A fresh butt appeared, mostly all alone, except for another conspicuous tag next to it: "neverfart."      Searching "#neverfart" on Instagram turned up, among many other accounts, an account for Soft Hoagie Rolls, which mostly posts photos of local skaters and zine-style collages. They'd also posted a somewhat familiar-looking butt drawing.      That butt photo led to the Instagram account of Jeremy Trevino, filled with pages on pages of butts in hilariously rendered situations. There are skateboarding butts, butts boxing each other, butts baking cookies. Those drawings look similar to the butt graffiti, but his are more detailed.      Trevino has even previously sold stickers featuring his own butt-centric art in St. Petersburg.      Did he do it? Has he tagged the butt onto the city?      "I can neither confirm nor deny that," Trevino said when reached by phone.      He did recognize the tags as using the design from his original drawings, which, he said, has been used by other people, "poorly." He even heard about someone getting a terrible tattoo of it.      Why does he think the person who is tagging the butt graffiti is doing it?      "For the laughs," he said. "Part of it is probably just knowing these mature, grown, white-collar people are looking at these lowbrow butts." ||||| - St. Pete is being overrun with rear ends. Police are trying to figure out who has been tagging walls downtown with a drawing that looks an awful lot like a naked buttock.      "It is clearly an image of a butt," said an employee of a coffee shop where the image was tagged on the bathroom wall.      "It appears to be a posterior or two," offered a worker downtown.      "It looks like a butt with three cheeks," said another passerby.      The painted posteriors have shown up mostly downtown -- behind buildings, the bottoms of walls, and the rears of restaurants.      They feature between two and seven cheeks and have produced just as many opinions.      "I don't think it is funny at all," said one downtown worker. "I don't think it is very good either. It's not very creative."      St. Pete police have documented at least 20 tuchuses, most of which have already been wiped by the property owners.      "It has been speculated that is part of the human anatomy," said St. Pete Police Assistant Chief Jim Previtera. "But what it looks like to us is vandalism."      Police aren't yet close to identifying the person who has been moonlighting in moons, but when they do, that person will have to pay out the you-know-what for each property to be cleaned.      They could even face a felony.      "We have one detective who, in addition to some other duties, his duty is to document it, to investigate graffiti downtown and, in recent weeks, I have added additional people to investigate it because the problem is beginning to spread," said Previtera.      The city of St. Pete is not keen on the keesters and neither are most people who spoke with FOX 13 downtown. One man analyzed it from an art critic's perspective.      "It's a classic. Is it art or not? My personal angle on it is it's just vandalism. One is funny. Beyond that? No more," he decided.      St. Pete police make two to three arrests a year for graffiti. ||||| ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — You could call it a derrière dilemma, a keister caper, or even a rump riddle. Ah, yes. It is sixth-grade humor at its finest with endless comical posterior possibilities.      At the end of the day, however, what’s now being called “butt graffiti” is ultimately illegal.      The design is popping up all over the place in St. Petersburg, in places near the old YMCA and the Morean Arts Center.      At least twenty cases have surfaced in the last several months. The silhouette of three “cheeks,” so to speak, is the featured signature of the anonymous artist.      “The bottom line is whoever is doing this is destroying property,” St. Petersburg Assistant Police Chief Jim Previterra said. “They are marking up the beautiful downtown area of St. Petersburg.”      Indeed, St. Pete is a city known for its beautiful art and stunning murals. Many people are upset by this new graffiti involving a tush trend. They don’t like the fact that the bold buttocks are suddenly everywhere.      “This is not art. At all,” said one woman. “It’s vandalism.”      “There should be consequences. You can’t just take it upon yourself to do whatever you want to do,” another man said.      The assistant police chief describes it as an “eyesore.”      “It’s causing the city to have to go around behind who this is and clean up,” he said. “And, we have to dedicate more resources to it.”      In the end, the mystery man or woman who is showcasing these backsides will most likely get a front row seat in a court room      “It’s illegal,” Assistant Chief Previterra said. “In the end, everyone gets their day.”      St. Pete ‘butt graffiti’ View as list View as gallery Open Gallery      STORIES OTHERS ARE CLICKING ON:      BACK TO TOP STORIES |||||	– "It is clearly an image of a butt," a coffee shop employee tells Fox 13 regarding a piece of graffiti that recently appeared in their bathroom. But police have a different view. "What it looks like to us is vandalism," Assistant Police Chief Jim Previterra says. Dozens of pieces of "butt graffiti" have been popping up all over St. Petersburg in Florida dating back to at least April. The Tampa Bay Times describes the offending art: "Three buttocks, formed by four unbroken lines. A simple yet mind-bending design that conjures a police lineup of backsides, or an alien race anatomically different from our own." While the butt graffiti usually features three cheeks, some examples have had up to seven. The butts have been a big hit on social media, but not everyone is a fan. "I don't think it is very good," one person tells Fox 13. "It's not very creative." “This is not art. At all,” a woman tells WFLA. “It’s vandalism.” Police have documented at least 20 instances of butt graffiti in St. Petersburg. And Previterra, who calls the graffiti an "eyesore," says they will catch the culprit. “In the end, everyone gets their day," he says. Meanwhile, the Times went down an internet rabbit hole to find the artist who could possibly be responsible for the ballooning butt problem. The artist says he "can neither confirm nor deny" the butts are his.

As Deadspin laid out in brutal detail on Wednesday, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o’s dead girlfriend is neither dead nor Manti Te’o’s girlfriend nor a corporeal being. Te’o and Lennay Kekua never met on the field at Stanford, never hung out together in Hawaii, and didn’t talk on the phone each night as she lay dying of leukemia. As we wait to learn more details of this amazing hoax, it’s worth examining the second-biggest mystery of the Manti Te’o fake girlfriend saga: How did the sports media come to spread this phony story?      Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slate’s editorial director.      The writer who did the most to popularize Te’o’s tale of triumph over tragedy was Sports Illustrated’s Pete Thamel. In late September, Thamel wrote that the Notre Dame star “played remarkably well under the most depressing of circumstances—the death of his girlfriend and grandmother within [a] 24-hour span before the Irish's game against Michigan State.” (The part about his grandmother's death is true.) In the Oct. 1 edition of the magazine, which placed Te’o on the cover and noted that the linebacker “has restored the shine to the Golden Dome,” Thamel reported the precise date of Lennay Kekua’s supposedly almost-deadly car accident (April 28) and stated that her “relatives told [Te’o] that at her lowest points, as she fought to emerge from a coma, her breathing rate would increase at the sound of his voice.” And in a Dec. 20 piece, Thamel explained that Kekua wrote Te’o a series of inspirational notes before her passing, and that her brother Kainoa and sister U’ilani “would read the letters to Manti” to help soothe his pain. "It's given me a sense of strength and perseverance," the Heisman Trophy finalist told the Sports Illustrated writer.      If Thamel or anyone else at SI had used Nexis or Google, they would’ve discovered that Lennay Kekua (not to mention her brother and sister) didn’t exist. A reporter doesn’t expect to learn that his subject's dead girlfriend is nothing but a fake Twitter avatar. But a reporter, especially at a fact-checked magazine like SI, also doesn’t generally put someone’s name into print and say that she smashed up her car on April 28 without confirming the spelling and the wreckage. That assumption of basic competence filters down to everyone else in the sports media ecosystem: If Manti Te’o’s story of woe is in Sports Illustrated, then it must be true.      Advertisement            Get Slate in your inbox.      Manti Te’o was a sports hero, and his standout play this year demanded the details to flesh out that storyline. There’s a journalistic cliché: If your mother says she loves you, check it out. For sports hagiographers, it’s more like: If he makes a lot of tackles, don’t you dare check anything. Stardom demands that feature writers color in the lines with off-field greatness. And Te’o’s character, it seemed, was unimpeachable. After all, there had been all these stories about how humble and religious he was, and how he’d been led to Notre Dame to do something.      There must be sports villains to stand alongside the heroes, of course. That brings us to Pete Thamel’s other recent college football opus, and the other kind of confirmation bias. In the Oct. 22 issue of SI, Thamel and Thayer Evans wrote a cover story on Tyrann Mathieu called “Trials of the Honey Badger.” Mathieu, a 2011 Heisman Trophy finalist, was kicked off the LSU football team prior to the 2012 season, reportedly because he smoked marijuana. For the SI piece, Thamel and Evans went to Louisiana and performed the kind of dogged shoe-leather journalism that nobody bothered to do when reporting on Manti Te’o, humble Boy Scout. Their prize finding: Mathieu’s face appeared on a nightclub flyer, which might possibly constitute an NCAA violation.      In addition to playing the part of NCAA enforcers, Thamel and Evans want us to know that Mathieu is at a “crossroads.” “Three decades ago his father came to the same point,” they write, making a comparison that’s entirely unsupported by their reporting. The Honey Badger’s crime is smoking weed—he was arrested on marijuana possession charges after the SI piece came out—a practice that doesn’t land the typical college student on the cover of a national magazine. Mathieu’s father, by contrast, is in prison for killing a man. Thamel and Evans want us to believe, I guess, that Mathieu’s going to murder someone if he doesn’t straighten up.      Advertisement            The Honey Badger, like Manti Te’o, is a cartoon character. But since Mathieu found himself on the sports world’s naughty list—troubled athlete, at the crossroads—he was the athlete who got a vetting more suited for a presidential candidate.      SI’s Mathieu and Te’o features both infantilize their subjects in their own way. In his Oct. 1 cover story, Thamel writes that Te’o has “linked the program’s glorious past with a promising future,” helping redeem Notre Dame from “the George O’Leary résumé fiasco, the death of student videographer Declan Sullivan in a tower collapse and the allegations of sexual misconduct lodged against a player by a St. Mary’s College student who committed suicide soon after.”      No matter what we learn about Te’o in the coming days, this black-and-white narrative—good man fixes bad things—enlightens no one and does the athlete no favors.      According to Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick, Te’o was the “perfect mark” for this fake girlfriend hoax, not its perpetrator. “He is a guy who is so willing to believe in others,” Swarbrick said at a press conference.            Advertisement            Whether or not that’s true about Te’o, it’s an apt description of his chroniclers. Sports Illustrated looked at the linebacker and saw a classic template, not a human being who demanded the scantest thought or scrutiny. In the end, they got back the exact amount of effort they put in. This was journalism as fill-in-the-blank exercise, the creation of a simple story that tells you what you already know. In this case, what we already knew happened not to be the truth. If only Manti Te’o hadn’t been such a boy scout. Then we might have known how interesting he was all along.      Update, Jan. 16, 10:40 p.m.: ESPN's Gene Wojciechowski, who voiced a five-minute video feature on Te'o's tragic losses, says he was unable to find Lennay Kekua's obituary or documentation of her car accident. He didn't follow up, though, because the Notre Dame player "said the family would prefer not to be contacted" and "at that moment, you simply think that you have to respect those wishes."      Update, Jan. 17, 4:30 p.m.: In an interview with Dan Patrick, Sports Illustrated's Pete Thamel says he happened upon some "small red flags" while reporting his Manti Te'o cover story. Those red flags: no obituary, no death notice, no trace of Lennay Kekua in LexisNexis' public records search. Thamel says he passed along those holes to his editors, but convinced himself that Kekua's absence from LexisNexis wasn't necessarily significant because "sometimes when you're 20 and 21 you don't have a footprint." |||||	– The crazy hoax involving the nonexistent girlfriend of Notre Dame star Manti Te'o now gets the ultimate modern tribute—its own meme.

(Associated Press)      NASA Live TV showed the rocket, emblazoned with the pale blue Sochi 2014 logo, launching from the Russian-operated Baikonur cosmodrome on a clear morning in Kazakhstan.      The torch will make its way to the International Space Station before being taken into space itself _ making it the Olympic flame's first spacewalk in history.      Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, NASA's Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata of Japan beamed at the crowd as they carried the lit torch aboard the Soyuz rocket.      For safety reasons, the torch will not burn when it's onboard the space outpost. Lighting it would consume precious oxygen and pose a threat to the crew. The crew will carry the unlit torch around the station's numerous modules before taking it out on a spacewalk.      The Olympic torch has flown into space once before _ in 1996 aboard the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis for the Atlanta Summer Olympics _ but will be taken outside the spacecraft for the first time in history.      "It's a great pleasure and responsibility getting to work with this symbol of peace," Tyurin told journalists on Wednesday ahead of the launch.      The torch will remain in space for five days. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazanskiy, who are currently manning the International Space Station, will take the flame for a spacewalk on Saturday, before it is returned to earth by three astronauts on Monday.      The four-month Sochi torch relay, which started in Moscow on Oct. 7, is the longest in the history of the Olympics. For most of the 65,000-kilometer (39,000-mile) route, the flame will travel by plane, train, car and even reindeer sleigh, but 14,000 torch bearers are taking part in the relay that stops at more than 130 cities and towns.      Last month, the Olympic flame traveled to the North Pole on a Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker. Later this month it will sink to the bottom of the world's deepest lake, Lake Baikal, and in February it will reach the peak of Mount Elbrus, at 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) the highest mountain in Russia and Europe.      The torch will be used to light the Olympic flame at Sochi's stadium on Feb. 7, marking the start of the 2014 Winter Games that run until Feb. 23. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Timelapse video of the Olympic torch blasting off into space      A Soyuz rocket carrying the torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has docked with the International Space Station, as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia.      On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit.      The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur.      The rocket left Earth at 04:14:25 GMT.      It blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, crewed by three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata from Japan.

"We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work."      The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. It will not be lit aboard the space station as this would consume oxygen and pose a risk to the crew.      The Sochi torch will then be returned to Earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year.      It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles).      The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi.      In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month.

The 2014 Sochi torch, which will not be lit during its five days in space, blasted off on a Soyuz rocket this morning accompanied by Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio, and Koici Wakata from Japan. The torch has been to space before, aboard the space shuttle Atlantic before the 1996 Atlanta Games, but two Russian cosmonauts plan to take it on its first spacewalk this week. As part of a four-month, 14,000-bearer relay before the Games kick off in February, the torch has already been to the North Pole aboard a Russian icebreaker and will be taken to the bottom of Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake, and to the top of Mount Elbrus, Europe's highest mountain, the AP reports. But in another setback for a Games already troubled by allegations of corruption and a backlash against Russia's harsh anti-gay laws, the flame has gone out several times since the relay last month, the BBC notes.
summarize: A one-of-a-kind solid gold Darth Vader mask is going on sale for ¥154 million ($1.4 million).      Tanaka Kikinzoku Jewelry on Tuesday showcased the 15-kg (33-pound) sculpture, which has been commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of the release of “Star Wars.”      The sculpture of science fiction’s most famous villain will be available for purchase on May 4 — a date known among fans as “Star Wars Day” because of its similarity to the phrase “May the Force be with you.”      It is displayed at the jeweler’s main store in Tokyo’s Ginza shopping district.      The jeweler will also offer a commemorative plaque featuring three small oval coins made of pure gold and a replica “Star Wars” poster from the film’s release 40 years ago. The plaque’s suggested sale price is ¥1.22 million ($11,000). Only 77 copies will be available.      The coins bear designs associated with the film series and the number “1977525” — May 25, 1977, the date of the first film’s release.      Tanaka Kikinzoku, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year, has in the past created gold commemorative products including a Christmas tree, samurai helmets and soccer player Lionel Messi’s left foot. ||||| This will appear next to all of your comments      This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| To celebrate 40 years of darkness, the galaxy’s favorite villain has taken on a much shinier disposition.      For less than the cost of a trip to Tatooine, one lucky Star Wars fan will soon be able to own a solid gold Darth Vader mask — perfect for bartering, though perhaps not so good for heavy breathing.      On Tuesday, the Japanese jeweler Ginza Tanaka unveiled the imposing headgear and announced that it would go on sale at the company’s flagship store in Tokyo on May the fourth (do we need to spell this out for you?) to celebrate Star Wars’ 40th Anniversary.      The price? A mere 154 million Japanese yen, or about $1.4 million. Tax included!      Its vendors describe the mask as life-size — 26.5 centimeters by 30 centimeters to be exact. But in an email, a spokesperson for Ginza Tanaka noted, “Unfortunately, you cannot wear this mask because it is too heavy.” |||||	– Star Wars fans might consider it a golden opportunity. Tokyo jeweler Ginza Tanaka is offering a life-size Darth Vader mask made of 24-karat gold at a hefty price of $1.4 million to mark the 40th anniversary of the release of the first Star Wars movie. The creation measures 10.4 inches wide and 11.8 inches high, reports the AP. The jeweler says the mask was not designed for wearing—at about 33 pounds, it would be too heavy and has no opening for a head. It goes on sale Thursday, or "May the Fourth" as the New York Times puts it. For those who can't afford the golden version, a black plastic one can be had via Amazon for $40. While the mask is the jeweler's most expensive Star Wars memorabilia, it has made pricier products. In 2013, a gold Disney-themed Christmas tree was priced at $4.5 million, and the Japan Times notes the century-old jeweler has also created a gold replica of soccer player Lionel Messi's left foot.
summarize: JERUSALEM — Israel ’s borders erupted in deadly clashes on Sunday as thousands of Palestinians — marching from Syria , Lebanon , Gaza and the West Bank — confronted Israeli troops to mark the anniversary of Israel’s creation. More than a dozen people were reported killed and scores injured.      With an unprecedented wave of coordinated protests, the popular uprisings that have swept the region touched Israel directly for the first time. Like those other protests, plans for this one spread over social media, including Facebook, but there were also signs of official support in Lebanon and Syria, where analysts said leaders were using the Palestinian cause to deflect attention from internal problems.      At the Lebanese border, Israeli troops shot at hundreds of Palestinians trying to force their way across. The Lebanese military said 10 protesters were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Israel said it was investigating the casualties.      In the Golan Heights, about 100 Palestinians living in Syria breached a border fence and crowded into the village of Majdal Shams, waving Palestinian flags. Troops fired on the crowd, killing four people. The border unrest could represent a new phase in the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.      In the West Bank, about 1,000 protesters carrying Palestinian flags and throwing stones and occasional firecrackers and gasoline bombs fought with Israeli riot troops near the military checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel. Scores were injured, local medical officials said.      In Gaza, when marchers crossed a security zone near the border, Israeli troops fired into the crowd, wounding dozens.      In Jordan and Egypt, government security forces thwarted protesters headed to the border.      Every year in mid-May, many Palestinians observe what they call “the nakba,” or catastrophe, the anniversary of Israel’s declaration of independence in 1948 and the war in which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians lost their homes through expulsion and flight. But this was the first year that Palestinian refugees and their supporters in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, inspired by the recent protests around the Arab world, tried to breach Israel’s military border from all sides.      “The Palestinians are not less rebellious than other Arab peoples,” said Ali Baraka, a Hamas representative in Lebanon.      At day’s end, as a tense calm returned to the country’s borders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the protests had been aimed at destroying Israel, not creating a Palestinian state alongside it.      “The leaders of these violent demonstrations, their struggle is not over the 1967 borders but over the very existence of Israel, which they describe as a catastrophe that must be resolved,” he said. “It is important that we look with open eyes at the reality and be aware of whom we are dealing with and what we are dealing with.”      Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, saluted the protesters in a televised speech, referring to the dead as martyrs. “The blood of the nakba fatalities was not spilled in vain,” he said. “They died for the Palestinian people’s rights and freedom.”      Officials and analysts have argued that with peace talks broken down and plans to request the United Nations to declare Palestinian statehood in September, violence could return to define this conflict, relatively quiet for the past two years.      “This is war,” said Amjad Abu Taha, a 16-year-old from Bethlehem who joined the protesters in Ramallah, a rock in one hand and a cigarette in the other. “We’re defending our country.”      Nearby, hundreds of Israeli troops roamed the area, using stun guns and tear gas.      In Gaza, the Hamas police stopped buses carrying protesters near the main crossing into Israel, but dozens of demonstrators continued on foot, arriving at a point closer to the Israeli border than they had reached in years and drawing Israeli fire.      Later, in a separate episode, an 18-year-old Gazan near another part of the border fence was shot and killed by Israeli troops when, the Israeli military says, he was trying to plant an explosive. ||||| Egyptian riot police fired tear gas and live ammunition overnight to disperse thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, and a security official said Monday that at least 20 demonstrators were arrested.      Demonstrators burn an Israeli flag near the Israeli embassy in Cairo, Egypt Sunday, May 15, 2011. Israeli troops clashed with Arab protesters Sunday along three hostile borders, including the frontier... (Associated Press)      The rally in Cairo followed calls on Facebook for Arabs to march on Israel on Sunday in support of the Palestinians, who were holding annual ceremonies marking the "nakba," or "catastrophe" _ the term Palestinians use to describe their defeat and displacement in the war that followed Israel's 1948 founding.      Egypt's Health Ministry said at least 353 people were hurt outside the embassy, mostly from smoke inhalation. A security official said that some protesters sustained bullet wounds and that one protester was in critical condition. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media.      The protesters set fire to an Israeli flag, chanted anti-Israeli slogans and called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador and the closure of the embassy.      A youth organization, which played a key role in the uprising that toppled former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said on its Facebook page that the protest in front of the embassy was "civilized," and questioned the riot police's use of force in dealing with the demonstrators.      A witness, who wouldn't give his name fearing reprisals, claimed the police used unjustified force.      Egypt's state-run news agency MENA said the protesters managed to push aside barricades placed around the embassy building and attempted to storm the embassy itself to tear down the Israeli flag, which prompted the police action.      Security forces had used trucks and barricades to close off at least three main roads leading to the embassy, located in the Cairo suburb of Giza. |||||	– Egyptian police fired live ammo and tear gas at pro-Palestinian protesters today as violence continued following yesterday's clashes at Israel's borders. More than 350 protesters were injured, one critically, outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo, AP reports. At least 16 people were killed yesterday when Israeli troops opened fire in skirmishes as thousands of protesters marched from Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and the Left Bank on the annual Palestinian day of "nakba," or catastrophe, marking Israeli's 1948 independence. Israel has accused rival nations of supporting the clashes to distract demonstrators from ongoing Mid East unrest in surrounding countries, reports the New York Times. It was the first time Palestinians and their supporters attempted to breach Israel's border from all sides. One of the protesters declared yesterday: "This is war." Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu said the protesters were seeking to destroy Israel, not create a Palestinian state alongside the nation.
summarize: A drunken woman fighting a deputy, a thief crashing the car he stole and the last arrest of a home invasion suspect helped keep the Sheriff's Office busy over the holiday weekend, according to reports.      Early Monday morning, Deputy Michael Claudy stepped between two women who were arguing in the parking lot of the Circle K store at Mile Marker 92, spokeswoman Deputy Becky Herrin said.      Claudy tried to calm Sara Henderson, 33, of Tavernier, who "was obviously intoxicated" and continued to yell loudly and try to attack the other woman, Herrin said.      Despite several warnings to stop yelling or face arrest for disorderly intoxication, Henderson only kept yelling, Claudy reported.      When he went to handcuff her, Henderson allegedly pulled away, knocked the deputy's radio microphone off his shirt and kicked him.      Claudy used pepper spray on Henderson, who according to the Sheriff's Office rubbed her hands on her face and then rubbed pepper spray on Claudy's face, "impeding his ability to see well."      Claudy finally was able to call for backup, managing to hold Henderson on the ground until other deputies arrived.      Henderson was arrested on suspicion of disorderly intoxication, battery on a law enforcement officer, depriving an officer of his means of communication and resisting arrest with violence.      Crash leads to arrest      A 24-year-old Stock Island man was arrested after he crashed a stolen Jeep Cherokee into a boat parked on a trailer on 4th Avenue at about 5:37 a.m. Sunday, according to the Sheriff's Office.      Daryl Burgess was injured and airlifted to a Miami hospital the night of the crash with possible internal injuries but was released the next day.      The Sheriff's Office arrested him on suspicion of vehicle grand theft, two counts of burglary, reckless driving with damage to property, fleeing and eluding police and driving with a suspended licence.      After the crash, deputies learned the SUV didn't belong to Burgess and that he had a suspended license due to a 2006 DUI arrest.      In Burgess' pockets, deputies said they found a camera, a pink iPod and an insurance card belonging to a woman who lives on Fogarty Avenue.      Key West police said the camera and iPod were stolen from a Honda Accord parked at the same Fogarty Avenue address.      Burgess only drew attention for his erratic driving and for not having his lights on, Herrin said.      Deputies spotted the Cherokee swerving on Maloney Avenue, having left the Ocean Spray Trailer Park.      Burgess allegedly refused to stop for deputies and instead sped up and took a left on 4th Avenue, where he swerved several times and nearly crashed into a garbage truck before losing control and crossing lanes of traffic until he struck the parked boat.      Robbery suspect found      Authorities picked up the last of three men suspected of a home invasion robbery on Grassy Key in May.      Joseph Van Burne, 24, of Big Pine Key, was taken into custody Aug. 11 in Kansas City, Missouri, and returned to the Florida Keys on Sunday, where he faces charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, use of a weapon in commission of a felony, improper exhibition of a firearm, discharging a firearm in public, criminal mischief, home invasion robbery and tampering with evidence.      Two other men face charges in connection with the robbery: Russell Kane, 22, of Little Torch Key, and Matthew Storm, 24, of Marathon.      The drug-related crime took place May 27 in the early morning hours, deputies said. All three suspects were armed with handguns.      During the robbery, one man was shot in the leg and more shots were fired in and around the house.      The robbery victim, Robert Moir, 40, was arrested Aug. 4 on suspicion of heroin and cocaine-related charges after an undercover drug surveillance operation produced a search warrant on his home. ||||| TAVERNIER (CBSMiami) – A woman who officials said got into a violent fight with a Monroe County Sheriff’s deputy was arrested early Monday morning.      According to officials, 33-year-old Sara Henderson was being arrested for disorderly intoxication when she began attacking Deputy Michael Claudy.      The deputy said he saw two women in an altercation at the Circle K by the 92 mile marker and he tried to separate them. Henderson refused to calm down, authorities said.      Henderson continued to yell and the deputy said she began to fight him as he tried to arrest her.      Deputy Claudy said Henderson managed to knock his microphone off of him preventing him from calling for back-up.      She was sprayed with pepper spray, but Deputy Claudy said she wiped her face and then put her hands on him wiping the spray on his face so he could not see.      Deputy Claudy was able to reach for his microphone, call for help and hold Henderson down until other officers arrived.      Henderson reportedly told emergency room staff at Mariner’s Hospital that she purposely rubbed the pepper spray into Deputy Claudy’s eyes.      Claudy sustained an injury to one of his eyes that will require follow-up treatment.      Henderson was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on a law enforcement officer, depriving an officer of his means of communication and resisting arrest with violence.      RELATED CONTENT: |||||	– When a Florida sheriff's deputy spotted two women arguing in a store parking lot, he intervened, Keys News reports—but the response was more than he bargained for. As the officer attempted to arrest Sara Henderson, 33, on charges of disorderly intoxication, he says she fought back. In the process, she hit his microphone off his body, making it impossible to call for backup; and when the deputy pepper-sprayed her, he says she rubbed the stuff right back in his own eyes, CBS Miami reports. She later told hospital employees she'd done it on purpose. Now, in addition to a disorderly intoxication charge, she's been charged with battery of a police officer, depriving an officer of his means of communication, and resisting arrest with violence.
summarize: The blogger behind the satirical site WTForever21, whose particular brand of sass we have known and appreciated for some time, has been hit with a cease-and-desist from the California-based clothier. If Rachel Kane doesn't delete her site — Forever 21's latest deadline is June 10 — the company says it will file a lawsuit against her.      Forever 21's threatening letter, a copy of which I obtained from Kane, accuses WTForever21 of "trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition and dilution" of the Forever 21 brand. Forever 21's in-house counsel, Jerry Noh, wrote that while Forever 21 appreciates Kane's "indicated patronage" of the store, her "website's name refers to an abbreviation for colloquial expression that the general public may find offensive, and such colloquial expression is being used in conjunction with our Company's name, registered trademark, and domain name." The idea that a reader might mistake WTForever21.com for Forever 21's own homepage is ludicrous, but clearly this isn't a fair legal fight. Forever 21 has the resources to make any court case unpleasant and protracted. Forever 21 has spread around the world (and made its owners, Do Won Chang and Jin Sook, extroardinarily wealthy) amid concerns over labor violations and many instances of Forever 21's theft of other designers' intellectual property. (The company has settled numerous lawsuits stemming from its copyright violations; a documentary, Made in L.A., covers one of the company's legal tussles with its workers, to whom it paid illegally low wages. In January, a reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek visited a Los Angeles area sweat shop and found garment workers sewing Forever 21 vests for twelve cents apiece. If a worker finished 66 vests in an hour, she would make minimum wage.) You can read Forever 21's very sternly worded cease and desist letter to Kane in full; click to enlarge.      WTForever 21 pokes fun at Forever 21 for making ugly clothes. It often does this by making references to pop culture; a ram's head ring is like the horse head scene in The Godfather, a post about a sweater that looks like it is "made of muppet parts" is "brought to you by the letters W, T, and F," courtesy of Sesame Street screengrabs, a tiny purse becomes "The Tiny Purse for Women Who Can't Carry Things Good (and Who Wanna to Learn to Carry Other things, too)." It's pretty funny! Kane rails against inexplicable feathered accessories ("oversized cat toys"), anything lamé ("it's spelled that way for a reason"), and jumpsuits ("If you bought this, sort your life out, IMMEDIATELY"). She also points out errors in Forever 21's own poorly edited copy. ("Constructed from different color fabrications this dress is sure to show off your curves in this form fitting dress.") Occasionally, she likes stuff, too. Almost nobody enjoys being made fun of, but Forever 21 is an corporate entity and as such attracts public commentary — and parodies (even parodies of trademarks) are, as a rule, protected speech.      Advertisement      Advertisement      This seems like a textbook example of a SLAPP, a lawsuit or legal threat that is intended not to win a claim, but to silence a critic. Sadly, it's working: Kane says she's probably going to take her site down by the June 10th deadline. "Unless I can work something out with Forever 21, June 10 will be the last day for WTForever21.com," she wrote in an email, adding, "I'm so disheartened by this."      Forever 21: 1. Free speech: 0. WTF, Forever 21?      Update: The blogger decides to fight back.      WTForever21 [Official Site]      Sponsored      Earlier:      Forever 21's Bizarre Knockoff Empire      For When You Look At That Thing From Forever 21 And Just Go What The Fuck ||||| Today in uncool corporate news, we have the case of humorless fashion retailer Forever 21, a store that has, for the record, been sued various times for copyright infringement. Despite being rather public Christians (their bags have "John 3:16" written at the bottom), they seem to be not particularly forgiving and are not at all happy that Rachel Kane, who created the satire blog WTForever21, is making fun of their clothes. They don't like the "F" standing for you-know-what, apparently. They sent her a cease and desist in April, accusing her of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, unfair competition, and dilution.      WTForever21 is, of course, satire -- Kane's home page includes the disclaimer "And, just FYI, The term 'Forever 21' is a trademark of Forever 21, Inc. This site is not affiliated with Forever 21, Inc." Beyond that, it actually serves to bring attention to Forever 21's products, even if it does mock them a bit. So we can't help thinking it's total bullshit for a corporate entity to come stomping on a single blogger -- who's not making any money from her site -- just because they don't like her content about them. But they have.      Kane wrote to Consumerist about her legal woes, explaining that she'd responded to Forever 21 via her attorney disputing the accusations, but that on June 2 the retailer responded with a "firm threat to sue" unless she takes down the blog. She has until June 10 to make her decision.      She also wrote,      WTForever21.com began little more than a year ago as an exercise in my favorite pastime - complaining. I was a newly unemployed writer and Los Angeles native with nothing on my plate but the anxiety of my dwindling savings, so I started to commit one post a day in an effort to keep my mind from turning mushy. In November, 2010 the site gained initial attention from the pop culture site Jezebel.com, whose writers have been historically critical of Forever 21. Mentions on many other sites followed, including Time.com, TheFrisky.com and a space on The Huffington Post's blogger roster. More than 333,000 views and countless LOLs later, I am employed again but forced with the painful reality of sinking the community and life raft that kept me afloat through tough times last year all because of an irate bully who can't take a joke. The only thing I have to console myself with in this defeat is the hope that consumers at large will know just how humorless the people are who make the day glow pink panties they have buy in bulk.      Seriously, guys, if bloggers can't make fun of corporations on the Internet, where are we?      Updated: We got in touch with Kane, who had the following to add.      As of right this minute, I'm hoping I can figure out some way to keep WTForever21.com up without getting sued, but it doesn't seem to be possible. It's really unfortunate, but I'll most likely be forced to take down the site, barring any serious deus ex machina. I don't have the resources (financial or otherwise) to take on a behemoth like Forever 21 over a little satire blog I love. Their pockets are just too deep. The real bummer for me is the community that's grown up around it is going to suddenly disappear. That's where the fun comes from -- people chiming in about their own WTF moments is the real special sauce. WTForever21.com is just the bowl it comes in. I can't tell you how many times I've had a reader email me personally and ask me to find them something on the site they couldn't find in store or how many times I've had a reader comment that they love this hideous purse or that insane harem pant. I drive a pretty healthy percentage of clicks from my site to theirs and I'm certain they've made sales from WTForever21.com they wouldn't have otherwise collected.      As for whether the site's making any money...      Since the site started, I have made exactly ZERO dollars. I have spent more than $80 to pay for domain fees, though. The Google ads I have on the site now hardly justify them even being there and I only put them up to bankroll giveaways and contests. Google adsense doesn't pay out until you reach $100 and I am very far away from ever seeing any money made off WTForever21.com.      Updated 2: Kane sent us a copy of the cease and desist. Note Forever 21's sort of hilarious "Your website's name refers to an abbreviation for colloquial expression that the general public may find offensive," along with claims that WTFForever21 constitutes "unfair competition" and has led to "monetary damages" for the poor, downtrodden retailer.      Forever 21 Doesn't Want To Be Made Fun Of, Sues Satire Blog [Consumerist]      [JDoll // @thisisjendoll] ||||| It’s often the biggest companies that have the tightest reign on their public perception—and inexpensive clothing company Forever 21 is no exception. Despite their public image of being young and fun (and, oh, totally Christian), the company is really, really up in arms over WTForever21, a funny blog that chronicles the hits and misses that come out of what blogger Rachel Kane calls the “shame factory.” Forever 21 sent Kane a cease and desist letter in April, claiming that she was violating copyright and trademark laws, even though Kane clearly states on the homepage, “Just FYI, The term ‘Forever 21’ is a trademark of Forever 21, Inc. This site is not affiliated with Forever 21, Inc.”      Posts on Kane’s site typically involve picking out tacky or cheaply-made pieces of Forev’s ephemera and waxing poetic on them in a silly way. Still, Forever 21 claims in its cease and desist that “your website’s name refers to an abbreviation for colloquial expression that the general public may find offensive,” and claimed the blog was “unfair competition” and has led to “monetary damages” for the company.      It doesn’t matter if those claims can be substantiated or not. Given the legal muscle Forever 21 has backing it, Kane says she’ll more than likely have to shut down her blog. “I don’t have the resources (financial or otherwise) to take on a behemoth like Forever 21 over a little satire blog I love,” she said. “The real bummer for me is the community that’s grown up around it is going to suddenly disappear. That’s where the fun comes from—people chiming in about their own WTF moments is the real special sauce. WTForever21.com is just the bowl it comes in.” At the end of the day said Kane, “The only thing I have to console myself with in this defeat is the hope that consumers at large will know just how humorless the people are who make the day glow pink panties they buy in bulk.” [Village Voice] ||||| Sticks and stones aren’t what is upsetting Forever 21 these days, instead words are totally hurting them, as they’re getting upset at a satire blog WTForever21 for making fun, and have gone ahead and sued the blogger behind it, she says.      WTForever.21’s creator Rachel Kane wrote in to tell Consumerist.com of her saga, noting that the clothing giant and maker of cheap flowy rompers and graphic T-shirts has itself been sued for copyright infringement (designers like Diane Von Furstenberg, Gwen Stefani and Anna Sui), so it’s a bit nutty that they’re upset at her for having the gall to make fun of bedazzled shoes.      Apparently they don’t like being associated with the “f” word, and so have brought out the lawyers.      She writes:      Wouldn’t it be funny if a major clothing manufacturer which has been sued multiple times for copyright infringement and come under consistent fire for sweatshop labor conditions then threatened to sue someone else for copyright infringement? Get ready to laugh. On April 23, Los Angeles based retailer and clothing manufacturer Forever 21, sent me (Rachel Kane), the writer behind the satire blog, “WTForever21.com,” a Cease and Desist letter accusing me of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, unfair competition and dilution. Forever 21 also insists WTForever21.com, which uses pop culture and historical references to lampoon the behemoth retailer’s most unsavory garments, is damaging the company’s reputation by associating the internet “colloquialism” of “WTF” with their company. Since then, I have responded via my attorney disputing the accusations in hopes that I could continue freely poking fun at bubble shorts and rosettes, but as of yesterday, June 2, Forever 21 has responded with a firm threat to file suit unless I take down the blog. I have until June 10 to decide. WTForever21.com began little more than a year ago as an exercise in my favorite pastime – complaining.

summarize: WASHINGTON The Republican chairman of a House of Representatives committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said on Friday that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had failed to respond to the panel's subpoena for documents in the case.      Representative Trey Gowdy said Clinton had not provided a single new document and her lawyer told the committee a server she used for emails while she was the top U.S. diplomat had been wiped clean.      "We learned today, from her attorney, Secretary Clinton unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server," Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said in a statement.      He said the committee will seek to speak to Clinton, the presumed front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, about the emails and the server.      Clinton, who was sharply criticized after it was revealed she used a private email address while secretary of state, has said she has already given copies of all her work-related emails to the State Department.      Clinton has told the committee and the State Department that she would like all her emails made public as soon as possible and welcomes the opportunity to appear before the House panel, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.      The State Department has said it has already given Gowdy's committee all the relevant emails from that cache, some 300 in all, about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.      Members of Gowdy's committee say they need to see all of Clinton's emails, including those she did not give to the State Department, to be sure of this.      But the top Democrat on the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings, said the letter the panel received from Clinton's lawyer confirmed that Clinton had turned over all relevant emails.      "It is time for the Committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton’s public testimony now,” Cummings said in a statement.      (Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Will Dunham and Ken Wills) ||||| He said while it’s “not clear precisely when Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server, it appears she made the decision after October 28, 2014, when the Department of State for the first time asked the Secretary to return her public record to the Department.”      ADVERTISEMENT      Last week, Gowdy sent a letter to Clinton’s attorney asking that the email server be turned over to a third party in the hopes that an investigation could recover about 30,000 emails that her team deleted before turning the rest over to the State Department.      Gowdy said "it is clear Congress will need to speak with the former Secretary about her email arrangement and the decision to permanently delete those emails." “Not only was the Secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,” Gowdy said. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the panel's top Democrat, said the letter the select committee received from Clinton's attorney detailing what happened the server proves she has nothing to hide. "This confirms what we all knew — that Secretary Clinton already produced her official records to the State Department, that she did not keep her personal emails, and that the Select Committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in Benghazi," he said in a statement. "It is time for the Committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton's public testimony now."      Clinton has maintained that the messages were personal in nature, but Gowdy and other Republicans have raised questions over whether she might have deleted messages that could damage her expected White House run in the process.      “I have absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department," Clinton said during a press conference in New York earlier this month. She said she had culled through more than 60,000 emails from her time at State and determined that roughly 30,000 of them were public records that should have been maintained. Clinton said the rest were messages related to private matters, such as her daughter’s wedding or her yoga class schedule, and didn't need to be kept.      Gowdy said given Clinton’s “unprecedented email arrangement with herself and her decision nearly two years after she left office to permanently delete” information, his panel would work with House leadership as it “considers next steps.”      Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Gowdy and other members of the Benghazi panel in the past have hinted that the full House could issues a subpoena for Clinton’s server. ||||| Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton advised a House panel that she permanently deleted all emails from her server, raising the stakes in a controversy that has dogged the presumptive presidential candidate for weeks.      WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told a House select committee Friday that she permanently deleted all emails from the private server she used to conduct official business, apparently after she was first asked by the State Department to turn them over, the panel’s chairman said Friday.      In response to a congressional subpoena, Clinton also said she would not allow an independent third party to analyze the server.      Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, said in a letter to the panel that after her lawyers determined which emails were personal and which were private, a setting was changed to retain only emails sent in the previous 60 days.      “Thus, there are no hdr22@clintonmail.com emails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized,” Kendall said.      The House Select Committee on Benghazi had subpoenaed the server this month, asking Clinton to hand it over to a third party so it could determine which emails were personal and which were government records.      The head of that committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said: “Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest.      The disclosure raised the stakes in the controversy that has dogged the potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate for weeks, since it was revealed that she had used an email server in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home to conduct government business during her tenure from 2009 to 2013 as the nation’s top diplomat. The home is protected around the clock by the Secret Service.      Gowdy said Clinton’s attorney informed the committee Friday that she “unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server.”      “While it is not clear precisely when Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server, it appears she made the decision after Oct. 28, 2014, when the Department of State for the first time asked the secretary to return her public record to the department,” Gowdy said.      It was not immediately clear whether the emails still could be recovered from the server through cyberforensic procedures.      The congressman said that “in light of the secretary’s unprecedented email arrangement with herself and her decision nearly two years after she left office to permanently delete all emails,” and because of the matter’s import to the American people, the panel will work with House Speaker John Boehner, of Ohio, and other Republican leaders in considering its next steps.      Clinton said at a recent news conference at the United Nations that, in hindsight, it would have been smarter to have conducted State Department business through a government server. She said her attorneys had turned over 30,490 emails to the State Department in response to a request from the agency, but that she deleted more than 32,000 emails that she considered personal.      A spokesman for Clinton said in a statement Friday: “She’s ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public.”      The spokesman, Nick Merrill, added that Clinton’s representatives “have been in touch with the committee and the State Department to make clear that she would like her emails made public as soon as possible.”      The Benghazi committee’s ranking Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, sought to play down Friday’s development, saying it merely confirmed what was already known. “It is time for the committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton’s public testimony now,” he said.      Gowdy is heading the latest House inquiry into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Killed in the violence were U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.      Meantime, Clinton’s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, has asked his agency’s internal watchdog to examine how it handles its records and responds to requests for information after revelations about his predecessor’s use of a personal email account for government business.      “It is critical for the State Department to preserve a full and complete record of American foreign policy,” Kerry wrote to Inspector General Steve Linick. “It is also important for the American public to have access to that record.”      State Department officials said Friday that the request to the inspector general did not call for an examination of Clinton’s email but that Linick’s review could end up looking into the former secretary’s email.      The Obama administration has declined to explain much about Clinton’s use of a personal server and personal email account.      Clinton said many of her work-related emails were archived through other official accounts of those she communicated with. But State Department officials said in recent weeks that email was not automatically archived during her tenure. |||||	– Republicans hoping that Hillary Clinton's email server still has the 30,000 or so emails she deleted after deeming them to be personal are apparently out of luck. Clinton's attorney informed a House panel investigating the Benghazi attack that they no longer exist on the home server she used while secretary of state, reports Reuters. The Republican chairman of the committee, Trey Gowdy, criticized Clinton's decision to "wipe her server clean" and said Clinton would eventually have to explain herself to Congress. In her response to the panel, Clinton also rejected the idea of allowing a third party to analyze the server, reports McClatchy News, which adds that It's unclear whether the emails could still be retrieved through high-tech techniques. A spokesperson said Clinton is "ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public.” And the panel's top Democrat, Elijah Cummings, said it's time for Republicans to "stop this political charade," reports the Hill.

Shelling resounded on the outskirts of the city Friday as Russian-backed... (Associated Press)      The announcement by OSCE's Heidi Tagliavini came as representatives of Ukraine, Russia, pro-Russian rebels and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe met in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. She said the cease-fire would start at 1500 GMT (11 a.m. EDT).      Since mid-April, Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine in a conflict the U.N. estimates has killed nearly 2,600 people. On Thursday, a NATO military officer told The Associated Press that the ranks of Russian soldiers directly involved in the conflict have grown.      Earlier Friday, Associated Press reporters heard heavy shelling north and east of Mariupol. The key southeastern port of about 500,000 lies on the Sea of Azov, between Russia to the east and the Crimean Peninsula to the west, which Russia annexed in March. The shelling appeared to indicate that rebels had partially surrounded the area and were probing its defenses.      The seizure of Mariupol would give the rebels a strong foothold on the Sea of Azov and raise the threat that they carve out a land corridor between Russia and Crimea. If that happens, Ukraine would lose another huge chunk of its coast and access to the rich hydrocarbon resources the Sea of Azov is believed to hold. Ukraine ready lost about half its coastline, several major ports and untold billions in Black Sea mineral rights with Russia's annexation of Crimea.      "Mariupol is a strategic point. If we lose it then we could lose the entire coastline, the whole south of Ukraine," said Tatyana Chronovil, a prominent Ukrainian activist at a mustering point for the volunteer Azov Battalion on the eastern edge of the city.      The rebel offensive follows two weeks of gains that have turned the tide of the war against Ukrainian forces, who until recently had appeared close to crushing the five-month rebellion in the east. Ukraine and the West say the rebel counterattack was spearheaded by regular Russian army units, a charge the Kremlin has denied.      Saying he is "ready to do my best to stop the war," Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko voiced "careful optimism" about Friday's meeting. Earlier this week, he discussed the outlines of a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who also expressed optimism about the chances of reaching an agreement.      For all the upbeat assessments, however, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was still skeptical of Russian motives.      "What counts is what is actually happening on the ground," he said at the NATO summit in Wales on Thursday. "I have to say that previously we have seen similar statements and initiatives and they have been a smoke screen for continued Russian destabilization of the situation in Ukraine."      Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's national security council in Kiev, said seven servicemen had been killed over the past day, bringing the Ukrainian forces' death toll to 846.      ___      Leonard reported from Mariupol, Ukraine. John-Thor Dahlburg in Newport, Wales and Jim Heintz from Kiev, Ukraine, contributed to the story. ||||| MINSK Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels reached a ceasefire agreement on Friday, the first step toward ending fighting in eastern Ukraine that has caused the worst standoff between Moscow and the West since the Cold War ended.      The ceasefire deal was struck in the Belarussian capital Minsk along with a deal allowing for prisoner exchanges, deliveries of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of heavy weapons after five months of a conflict that has killed more than 2,600 people.      Despite some initial shelling in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk after the truce began at 6 p.m. (1100 ET), the ceasefire appeared to be holding. But many residents and combatants were skeptical that the ceasefire could last long or provide the basis for a durable peace settlement. The two sides remain far apart on the future of the region.      Despite the deal, European Union ambassadors agreed to stronger sanctions against Russia over its involvement in the war in Ukraine, with the measures set to be implemented on Monday, diplomats said in Brussels.      The diplomats said the EU sanctions - the latest economic measures aimed at Moscow over Ukraine - could be suspended if the truce holds and Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine.      "Human life is the highest value. We must do everything possible and impossible to end the bloodshed and put an end to people's suffering," Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a statement announcing the truce, reached with representatives of Russia and the OSCE security watchdog.      The Kremlin welcomed the agreement, based largely on proposals made by President Vladimir Putin and leaving the pro-Russian separatists in control of vast swaths of territory.      Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, urged the sides to build on the deal and seek a permanent political settlement, although many problems remain and an earlier June ceasefire lasted only 10 days.      OBAMA WARY ABOUT CEASEFIRE      At a NATO summit in Wales, U.S. President Barack Obama, who accuses Russia of arming the rebels and sending in troops to back them, reacted with skepticism to the deal.      "With respect to the ceasefire agreement, obviously we are hopeful but based on past experience also skeptical that in fact the separatists will follow through and the Russians will stop violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it has to be tested," Obama told a news conference.      "We also sent a strong message to Russia that actions have consequences. Today the United States and Europe are finalizing measures to deepen and broaden our sanctions across Russia's financial, energy and defense sectors," Obama added.      The agreement among the European Union countries expanded the package of sanctions against Russia to measures related to access to capital markets, defense, dual-use goods and sensitive technology, an EU diplomat said. The EU also expanded the list of people under an asset freeze to include the new leadership in Ukraine's Donbass region, Crimea's government and Russian decision-makers and oligarchs.      Also attending the NATO summit, Poroshenko told reporters Ukraine was ready to grant a significant decentralization of power and economic freedom to the regions as well as the right to use the language of their choice and an amnesty.      A senior rebel leader said separatists still want a formal split for their mainly Russian-speaking regions. "The ceasefire does not mean the end of (our) policy to split (from Ukraine)," Igor Plotnitsky, a leader of the Luhansk region, told reporters.      NATO also sent a firm message to Russia by approving wide-ranging plans to boost its defenses in eastern Europe, aiming to reassure allies nervous about Russia's intervention in Ukraine that the U.S.-led alliance will shield them from any attack.      The plan includes creating a "spearhead" rapid reaction force and pre-positioning supplies and equipment in eastern European countries so they can be reinforced within days in a crisis.      Minutes after the ceasefire began, three blasts were heard north of Donetsk, followed by scattered mortar and artillery fire, but this later fell quiet. The ceasefire allowed people to emerge from cellars where they have been taking shelter.      "We went out for a walk after three days of hiding, and this is a huge relief," said Lesya, 30, carrying her newborn boy in Mariupol. "But I am not optimistic. We have already seen so many broken ceasefires."      Hopes the ceasefire will hold are also clouded by Western suspicions that Putin unveiled a seven-point peace plan this week merely to dupe NATO's leaders and avert new sanctions being considered by the European Union over the crisis.      Fighting began in east Ukraine in mid-April, after Russia annexed Crimea following the removal of a Ukrainian president sympathetic to Moscow and Kiev shifted policy toward the EU.      By pushing for a ceasefire this week, Poroshenko changed his position after the tide turned in the conflict and Ukrainian troops were beaten back by a resurgent rebel force which the West says has received military support from Russia.      'ALL FOR NOTHING'      Moscow denies arming the rebels or sending in Russian troops, but Poroshenko appears worried he cannot now defeat the rebels and needs time to tackle a growing economic crisis and prepare for a parliamentary election. It is a risky move.      "If he goes for a peace plan, then all these dead and wounded and exiled and all the homes burned and jobs lost and money lost, it was all for nothing," said a Ukrainian soldier, who gave his name only as Mykola.      Putin for the first time this week put his name to a concrete peace plan, proposing seven steps which would leave rebels in control of territory that is home to about one-tenth of Ukraine's population and an even larger share of its industry. It would also require Ukraine to remain unaligned.      Although the Kremlin leader may not have secured all his goals, he had reason to secure a settlement because of the growing impact of sanctions on Russia's stuttering economy.      Public support for Putin is high because of the seizure of Crimea, a Russian territory until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine 70 years ago. But this could change if the conflict drags on and many Russians are killed.      Putin's key goals appear now to be to ensure that Ukraine, a country of more than 40 million where Moscow has long had major influence, does not join NATO and that the eastern regions of Ukraine win much more autonomy.      Although Poroshenko still calls for Crimea to be part of Ukraine, there is little chance of Russia giving it up. Moscow can also hope to maintain influence in eastern Ukraine if a peace deal seals the rebels' territorial gains, creating a "frozen conflict" that ensures Ukraine is hard to govern.      U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the ceasefire but said "credible and comprehensive monitoring and verification are essential elements for successful implementation."

The two sides agreed to stop firing by 15:00 GMT and the truce appeared to be holding. But the rebels said the truce had not changed their policy of advocating splitting from Ukraine.      Meanwhile EU ambassadors have expanded a list of Russian and pro-Russian individuals targeted by sanctions.      More than 2,600 people have died since rebels stormed several eastern cities.      The takeover - which followed the annexation by Russia of the southern Crimea peninsula in March - prompted a military operation by Ukrainian forces to retake the cities.      The rebels, who had largely been pushed back towards their strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk, made new advances in recent days.

Witnesses said three large explosions were heard in Donetsk just before the ceasefire came into force.      At the scene: Fergal Keane, BBC News in Mariupol      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption As Fergal Keane reports, casualties continued in Ukraine in the hours before the ceasefire      There are rumours that Ukrainian battle tanks have pulled back from the eastern edge of the city. The rebels are holding their positions outside Mariupol.      It is all in dramatic contrast to the day's beginning. Before dawn I was woken by the noise of explosions as government and pro-Russian forces fought an artillery duel.      The sound of rockets, air strikes and mortars continued to be heard throughout the morning. Large plumes of smoke dotted the fields around the east of the city.      One of those explosions claimed the lives of Lubov Vasylivna's grandchildren: 10-year-old Nikita, who was disabled, and his six-year-old sister, Karolina.      They died just hours before the ceasefire came into effect. "I don't know how I am going to survive this," Lubov told me. "The images of them are in front of my eyes."      Querying Nato's rapid reaction force      Image copyright AFP Image caption Cities such as Mariupol have been the scene of fierce fighting in the past few days      But later reports suggested fighting in both cities and elsewhere in the region had subsided.      The West accuses Russia of sending arms and troops to back the rebels in eastern Ukraine - allegations denied by Russia.      The ceasefire talks in Minsk, Belarus, were brokered by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and involved a former Ukrainian president, leaders of the pro-Russian rebels, and a Russian delegate.      Both sides agreed to stop fighting, and the OSCE said it would monitor the ceasefire. However, the full agreement has not been published.      President Petro Poroshenko said the ceasefire was based on a 12-point peace plan that included the release of "hostages", which he said would probably happen on Saturday.      "It is very important that this ceasefire lasts long, and during this ceasefire we continue the political dialogue to bring peace and stability," he said.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "The only reason that we're seeing this ceasefire... is because of both the sanctions that have already been applied and the threat of further sanctions"      Russian President Vladimir Putin had been told of the plan during a phone call, he added.      In another development, Nato agreed to form a multi-national "spearhead" force capable of deploying within 48 hours.      At the close of a two-day summit in Wales, Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Russia's actions in Ukraine had been a wake-up call for the alliance, and had spurred the formation of the rapid-reaction force.      He welcomed the ceasefire, saying he hoped it "could be the start of a constructive political process".      However, Russia's foreign ministry reacted angrily to Nato's announcements.      "The essence and tone of [Nato] statements on the Ukraine situation, and the plans announced to hold joint Nato exercises with Kiev on the territory of that country before the end of 2014, will inevitably lead to heightened tension," a statement said.      "They risk wrecking the progress made in the peace process in Ukraine, and encourage a deepening of the split in Ukrainian society."      Sanctions      European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a statement on Friday that the EU had expanded the list of persons under an EU asset freeze and travel ban to include the new leadership in eastern Ukraine, the Crimean government and Russian decision-makers and oligarchs.      The sanctions are due to be formally adopted on Monday. However, diplomats quoted by Reuters said the measures could be suspended if the ceasefire held and if Moscow withdrew forces from Ukraine.      Earlier, US President Barack Obama said the ceasefire had been agreed because of sanctions imposed on Russia.      Measures against Russia would be reviewed in line with the implementation of the ceasefire, which he said would be a very long process. |||||	– It looks like the fighting will stop in Ukraine today, at least for a while. The government signed a ceasefire deal with pro-Russia rebels at talks in Minsk, reports the BBC. The deal was struck after Vladimir Putin, perhaps hoping to avoid new penalties from an ongoing NATO summit, floated a peace plan amid skepticism—and without admitting that Moscow is providing support to the rebels. The ceasefire was to go into effect at 11am EDT today, and fighting seemed on track to continue right up until that hour. Reuters reports that the rebels were trying to capture the key port city of Mariupol. If they were able to take the city before the ceasefire went into effect, the AP explains why that would be a huge deal: It "would give the rebels a strong foothold on the Sea of Azov and raise the threat that they carve out a land corridor between Russia and Crimea. If that happens, Ukraine would lose another huge chunk of its coast and access to the rich hydrocarbon resources the Sea of Azov is believed to hold."
summarize: The Japanese efforts focused on a different part of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, 140 miles northeast of here, from the reactor — No. 4 — depicted in Washington on Wednesday as presenting a far bleaker threat than the Japanese government had offered.      The decision to focus on the No. 3 reactor appeared to suggest that Japanese officials believe it is a greater threat, since it is the only one at the site loaded with a mixed fuel known as mox, for mixed oxide, which includes reclaimed plutonium.      Western nuclear engineers have said that the release of mox into the atmosphere would produce a more dangerous radioactive plume than the dispersal of uranium fuel rods at the site. The Japanese authorities also expressed concern on Wednesday that the pressure in the No. 3 reactor had plunged and that either gauges were malfunctioning or a rupture had already occurred.      After the military’s effort to cool the spent fuel atop the reactor with fire trucks, Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said it was too early to assess the success of the attempt.      Mr. Nishiyama also said that radiation of about 250 millisievert an hour had been detected 100 feet above the plant. In the United States the limit for police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers engaged in life-saving activity as a once-in-a-lifetime exposure is equal to being exposed to 250 millisieverts for a full hour. The radiation figures provided by the Japanese Self-Defense Force may provide an indication of why a helicopter turned back on Wednesday from an attempt to dump cold water on a storage pool at the plant.      A White House statement late Wednesday said that President Obama had “briefed Prime Minister Kan on the additional support being provided by the U.S., including specialized military assets with expertise in nuclear response and consequence management.”      Photo      On Thursday a Pentagon spokesman, Col. David Lapan, said the military expertise made available to the Japanese included a nine-person assessment team that has or will shortly arrive there to work with the Japanese military and government.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The team members, Colonel Lapan said, will then recommend whether additional American military forces are needed to assist in the effort.      The American military is also gathering information on the damaged nuclear power plant. Officials said that a Global Hawk drone was flying missions over the reactor. In addition, U-2 spy planes were providing images to help the Japanese government map out its response to the quake and tsunami.      Earlier Thursday Japanese military forces tried to dump seawater from a helicopter on Reactor No. 3, making four passes and dropping a total of about 8,000 gallons as a plume of white smoke billowed. The Japanese government said that the reactor typically needs 50 tons of water, or about 12,000 gallons, a day to keep from overheating.      Video of the effort appeared to show most of the water missing the reactor and the Japanese military later said the measure had little effect on reducing the temperature in the pool where the spent rods are stored. A photograph from the air showed a light that seemed to suggest the presence of water in the pool, according to Tokyo Electric, but analysts said it was unclear what the image meant.      The military also announced that it had postponed plans to drop water on Reactor No. 4, which Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , on Wednesday pinpointed as a cause for serious alarm. On Thursday, at a White House briefing, he issued the warning that resolving the situation could “take time, possibly weeks,” according to Bloomberg.      On Thursday afternoon, the Self-Defense Forces and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police had begun deploying eight water cannon trucks to Reactor No. 3. Before the radiation level drove them back, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police planned to use the trucks, which are usually used in riot control, to spray at least 12 tons of seawater into the reactor.      Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the reactors, was also working to restore the electricity needed to run the cooling systems. But the company said that the work was proceeding slowly and that it would be halted Friday morning to allow helicopters and trucks to resume pouring water on the reactor, Reuters reported.

View all New York Times newsletters.      Some of the maneuvers seemed at odds with the most startling assertion by Mr. Jaczko (pronounced YAZZ-koe) that there was little or no water in the pool storing spent nuclear fuel at the No. 4 reactor, leaving fuel rods stored there exposed and bleeding radiation into the atmosphere. His testimony before Congress was the first time the Obama administration had given its own assessment of the condition of the plant, apparently mixing information it had received from Japan with data it had collected independently. “We believe that radiation levels are extremely high, which could possibly impact the ability to take corrective measures,” Mr. Jaczko said.      His statement was quickly but not definitively rebutted by officials of Tokyo Electric, the plant’s operator.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “We can’t get inside to check, but we’ve been carefully watching the building’s environs, and there has not been any particular problem,” Hajime Motojuku, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric, said Thursday morning in Japan.      Later, a spokesman for Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, Yoshitaka Nagayama, was more equivocal, saying, “Because we have been unable to go to the scene, we cannot confirm whether there is water left or not in the spent fuel pool at Reactor No. 4.”      Video      At the same time, officials raised concerns about two other reactors where spent fuel rods were stored, Nos. 5 and 6, saying they had experienced a slight rise in temperature.      On Wednesday night, Mr. Jaczko reiterated his earlier statement and added that commission representatives in Tokyo had confirmed that the pool at No. 4 was empty. He said Tokyo Electric and other officials in Japan had confirmed that, and also emphasized that high radiation fields were going to make it very difficult to continue having people work at the plant.      If the American analysis is accurate and emergency crews at the plant have been unable to keep the spent fuel at that inoperative reactor properly cooled — it needs to remain covered with water at all times — radiation levels could make it difficult not only to fix the problem at No. 4, but also to keep servicing any of the other problem reactors at the plant. In the worst case, experts say, workers could be forced to vacate the plant altogether, and the fuel rods in reactors and spent fuel pools would be left to melt down, leading to much larger releases of radioactive materials.      While radiation levels at the plant have varied tremendously, Mr. Jaczko said that the peak levels reported there “would be lethal within a fairly short period of time.” He added that another spent fuel pool, at Reactor No. 3, might also be losing water and could soon be in the same condition.      On Wednesday, the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of “approximately 50 miles” from the Fukushima plant. South Korea , Australia and New Zealand followed suit in advice to their citizens, and Spanish authorities on Thursday recommended an either wider berth, about 75 miles, news agencies reported. The advice to Americans in Japan represents a graver assessment of the risk in the immediate vicinity of Daiichi than the warnings made by the Japanese themselves, who have told everyone within 20 kilometers, about 12 miles, to evacuate, and those within about 20 miles to take shelter.      While maps of the plume of radiation being given off by the plant show that an elongated cloud will stretch across the Pacific, American officials said it would be so dissipated by the time it reached the West Coast of the United States that it would not pose a health threat.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Close to the site, however, Mr. Jaczko said, “We would recommend an evacuation to a much larger radius than has currently been provided by Japan.” That assessment seems bound to embarrass, if not anger, Japanese officials, suggesting they have miscalculated the danger or deliberately played down the risks.      Late Wednesday night the State Department announced what it described as a “voluntary” evacuation of dependents of American government personnel in northeastern Japan, and down to Tokyo and Yokohama . The undersecretary of state for administration, Patrick Kennedy, said that no one would be ordered to leave, but that the government would provide charter flights for dependents who wanted to leave.      On Thursday evening the American Embassy in Tokyo began offering seats aboard chartered flights to Americans wishing to evacuate from Japan. Americans who show up at the two main airports serving Tokyo, Narita and Haneda, would be flown to still unspecified “safe haven locations” from where they would be expected to arrange onward travel on their own, said Karen Kelley, a spokeswoman for the embassy.      The American move followed advisory notices from several European countries urging their citizens to move away from Tokyo or leave Japan altogether. On Thursday, Germany said it was moving its embassy operations from Tokyo to the southern city of Osaka , farther from the stricken plant.      American officials who have been dealing with their Japanese counterparts report that the country’s political and bureaucratic leadership has appeared frozen in place, unwilling to communicate clearly about the problem’s scope and, in some cases, unwilling to accept outside assistance. Two American officials said they believed that the Japanese government itself was not getting a clear picture from Tokyo Electric.      General Electric said it would send about 10 gas turbine generators to Japan to help replace lost power generating capacity. Michael Tetuan, a spokesman for the company, said that the operators of the damaged plant had requested generators, but he did not know what they would be used for. The units can produce roughly the same amount of power as the diesel generators at nuclear plants.      Though the plant’s reactors shut down automatically when the quake struck on Friday, the subsequent tsunami wiped out the backup electronic pumping and cooling system necessary to keep the fuel rods in the reactors and the storage pools for spent nuclear fuel covered with cool water. ||||| Japanese engineers are racing Friday to extend an emergency power cable to a nuclear reactor complex crippled by the country's earthquake and tsunami a week ago.            A steady supply of power could enable workers at the Fukushima plant to get water pumps working again in their urgent effort to cool off overheated nuclear fuel rods.            The International Atomic Energy Agency says that Japanese authorities have told them they have been able to lay a cable line to reactor number two at the nuclear plant. However, it is not clear how close workers are to actually restoring power.            The U.N. nuclear agency reported the situation at the Fukushima nuclear station was "very serious" Thursday, but that the problems caused by last week's natural disaster had not become significantly worse during the previous 24 hours. That assessment was delivered before the announcement late Thursday night that the circuit delivering electric power to the plant had just been restored.                  In Vienna, an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency, Graham Andrew, told reporters radiation levels had risen "significantly" in some locations up to 30 kilometers away from the Fukushima plant. However, in Tokyo, 240 kilometers away, radiation levels have been well below levels considered dangerous to human health.            In Washington, top U.S. military officials at the Pentagon said they are sending a nine-member team of experts to evaluate how the U.S. can help Japan deal with its nuclear crisis.            The risk of radiation poisoning has already forced the evacuation of more than 200,000 people who lived within 20 kilometers of the reactor site. Many are in makeshift shelters, with inadequate food, water and other supplies, in frigid winter weather.             ||||| LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Japanese shares rose sharply out of the open Friday, with the U.S. dollar shooting higher after news the Group of Seven leading industrial nations had agreed to work with Japan to stem the yen's post-quake rise.

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this undated file photo made available on Sunday Sept. 25, 2011, al-Saadi Gadhafi, son of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, watches a military exercise by the elite military unit commanded... (Associated Press)      Prosecutors said Wednesday they broke up not one, but two Indiana Jones-style plots to "extract" the son of late dictator Moammar Gadhafi from Libya and bring him to Mexico as his father's regime crumbled.      The plan to sneak out al-Saadi Gadhafi involved piles of stolen passports, white-knuckle flights with pilots who refused to land in war-torn Libya and luxury homes bought under false names in Mexico, Assistant Attorney General Jose Cuitlahuac Salinas said.      He said it was led by a Canadian woman, a Danish man and two Mexican suspects who were charged this week with attempted immigrant trafficking, falsifying documents and organized crime.      Salinas said the group hired pilots to fly from Mexico to Kosovo, from there to the Tunisian capital of Tunis and on to Libya in July, but that attempt failed to extract the dictator's son.      "They weren't able to do it out because the pilots refused to carry out a secret landing," Salinas said.      The ring then allegedly made arrangements for a second attempt, hiring pilots and a plane. But Mexican authorities were tipped off to the scheme by a series of anonymous e-mails and arrested the four suspects in November, before the second flight could take off.      The suspects were detained in November and held under form of house arrest until last week, when they were formally charged. Because they have not been ordered held over for trial, they have not entered pleas, nor do they have lawyers of record.      Authorities have said that Canadian Cynthia Vanier was the alleged ringleader of the plan, and the Danish man, identified as Pierre Christian Flensborg, was "the logistic liaison."      Salinas said the story began in 2009, when 4,586 blank Mexican passport forms were stolen in Mexico City. Apparently, the ring got hold of some of those blank passports. It had also discussed what false names to use for al-Saadi and his family, he said.      He said Vanier had a false Mexican passport and birth certificate in her own name when she was detained in November; the documents were apparently used to open bank accounts. Vanier, 52, has been identified in Canadian news media as a former mediator for Indian tribes from Mount Forest, Ontario.      The suspects also reportedly arranged to acquire properties where al-Saadi Gadhafi and his relatives were to have lived under false identities once they arrived in Mexico.      Those properties included a $1.25 million dollar apartment at the St. Regis, a hotel and residential tower on Mexico City's leafy Reforma boulevard. The hotel's website describes its 24-hour room service and butlers, and says "St. Regis Residences offer a unique opportunity to expand your incomparable lifestyle."      They had allegedly made arrangements to buy that apartment but the deal had not yet gone through, prosecutors said.      The conspirators had also allegedly made a $57,000 down payment on a home at a coastal development near the Pacific coast resort of Puerto Vallarta.      The beachfront house, whose total cost was not clear, sports an ornate double car port, a swimming pool and direct beach access, according to photos of the property at the address listed by prosecutors. Vallarta & Beyond, a real estate company that once represented the sellers, said the house had been for sale at a a price of around $600,000.      Prosecutors said Wednesday that a fifth suspect, who they would not identify, was still at large.      In December, Gary Peters, the director of the Canada-based Can/Aust Security & Investigations International Inc., told The Associated Press that he had worked as al-Saadi's North America security chief in Canada, and that Vanier had been involved in efforts to get him into Mexico.      Peters said Vanier's role was to get travel documents for Gadhafi's son, but he said the arrangements were legitimate, as far as he knew.      "It wasn't smuggling," he said. The plan, Peters said, "was to help him get there on humanitarian rights."      "I don't know where these documents were coming from; that was all Cindy's area. I was just doing security," Peters said.      "As far as I knew, the contacts that she was talking to, they weren't going to be false, they were going to be legitimate documents." But he added he didn't know whether al-Saadi's name would appear on the passports. "I don't know whose name, I don't know, that wasn't my area."      Prosecutors described the anonymously emailed tip in a slide presentation along an image of the Guy Fawkes mask. The image of Fawkes, a 17th century English revolutionary, has become a symbol of the Internet network "Anonymous," which has claimed credit for internet hacking around the world. They did not explain that connection.      A Twitter account linked to the Anonymous IberoAmerica website, which has carried comments from the movement in Mexico in the past, did not immediately respond to queries about whether the Anonymous movement was responsible for blowing the whistle on the plot.      In December, a lawyer for al-Saadi Gadhafi denied that his client plotted to sneak illegally into Mexico.      Al-Saadi Gadhafi, who is known for his love of professional soccer, playboy lifestyle and run-ins with police in Europe, never made it to Mexico, but did reach the Western African country of Niger, where he has been living.      The elder Gadhafi ruled Libya with an eccentric brutality for nearly 42 years before he was ousted by an uprising in August. He was captured and killed in October, along with his son Muatassim. Killed earlier in the civil war were younger brothers Seif al-Arab and Khamis. Another son, Seif al-Islam, was captured in Libya in November. Their mother, Safiya, and sister Aisha fled to neighboring Algeria. ||||| FILE - In this undated file photo made available on Sunday Sept. 25, 2011, al-Saadi Gadhafi, son of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, watches a military exercise by the elite military unit commanded...

summarize: The adult primary care “physician shortage” is more accurately portrayed as a gap between the adult population’s demand for primary care services and the capacity of primary care, as currently delivered, to meet that demand. Given current trends, producing more adult primary care clinicians will not close the demand-capacity gap. However, primary care capacity can be greatly increased without many more clinicians: by empowering licensed personnel, including registered nurses and pharmacists, to provide more care; by creating standing orders for nonlicensed health personnel, such as medical assistants, to function as panel managers and health coaches to address many preventive and chronic care needs; by increasing the potential for more patient self-care; and by harnessing technology to add capacity.      The health policy literature has been inundated with articles on the worsening shortage of primary care physicians. 1–3 One projection estimates that by 2020 the shortage will balloon to 40,000 physicians. 4 A more recent estimate suggests a gap of 52,000 primary care physicians by 2025. 5 The problem particularly affects primary care for adults more so than for children.      Growing demand for adult primary care comes from eighty million aging baby boomers, insurance expansion, and the diabetes and obesity epidemics. Capacity is declining because only 9 percent of US medical students choose family medicine and general internal medicine—the two adult primary care careers. 6 By 2016 the number of adult primary care physicians leaving practice will exceed the number entering, and more primary care physicians are choosing to work part time. 1 As the demand for adult primary care explodes, the capacity to provide that care is shrinking.      Common policy recommendations include increasing primary care reimbursement, improving the stressful primary care work life, and graduating more nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs). These policy prescriptions, although laudable, are insufficient. Even with a change in the attractiveness of primary care as a career, it would take decades to produce enough primary care physicians to fill the gap. A 50 percent increase in primary care Medicare payments would be needed to greatly narrow the primary care-specialty income gap—an increase with no chance of taking place. 7 One study of physician work life described an “alarming level” of burnout, worst among adult primary care physicians. 8 There will be insufficient NPs and PAs to bridge the gap; the ratio of adult primary care clinicians (family physicians, general internists, NPs, and PAs) to population is likely to fall by 9 percent from 2005 to 2020. 9 Instead of relying on policy wish lists, it is time to focus on increasing primary care capacity by redefining who does what. New thinking is needed.      Not Just A Physician Workforce Problem      What, then, is the solution? The first step is to redefine the crisis, which is currently mislabeled as a physician workforce shortage. The accurate formulation is a demand-capacity mismatch. Primary care practices could greatly increase their capacity to meet patient demand if they reallocate clinical responsibilities—with the help of current technologies—to nonphysician team members and to patients themselves. Physicians often complain that they are responsible for tasks that team members with far less training could perform. 10      We performed a literature review on the primary care shortage, accessing articles published since 2010. We found fifty articles, all of which defined the problem as a physician or clinician shortage, with forty-two of these proposing an increase in the number of clinicians (primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants). Others suggested adding capacity through different professionals, such as chiropractors and pharmacists. None reformulated the problem as a demand-capacity gap.      Donald Berwick and Andrew Hackbarth recently described a “wedge” approach to reducing medical costs. 11 A similar wedge approach can be employed to add primary care capacity. Five wedges combine to meet the growing need for primary care services: clinicians (medical doctors, NPs, and PAs), nonclinician licensed practitioners, nonlicensed personnel, patients themselves, and technology.      Balancing Capacity And Demand Without More Physicians      In this section we discuss how the four nonclinician wedges can move primary care toward a balance of demand and capacity.      Nonclinician Licensed Practitioners And Nonlicensed Personnel      The grouping of licensed practitioners includes nurses (registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and licensed practical nurses), pharmacists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical and occupational therapists, and health educators. These highly skilled professionals are seriously underused in their capacity to fill roles generally performed by clinicians. Nonlicensed health care personnel—medical assistants, front desk staff, health coaches, patient navigators, and lay educators—are equally underused.      An effective team adds capacity by sharing the care between clinicians and nonclinicians. 12 However, sharing the care works only if the nonclinician team members are empowered by standing orders to provide needed services. High-performing practices empower medical assistants to provide algorithm-based, periodic chronic and preventive care services. Other practices utilize registered nurses, pharmacists, or medical assistants as health coaches, assisting patients with chronic conditions to engage in behavior change and improve medication adherence. In some practices, registered nurses or pharmacists have standing orders to take total care of patients with diabetes, only rarely involving the clinician. 13      Can this reallocation of work increase capacity? An analysis of data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey estimated that 17 percent of the average family physician’s time is spent on preventive care, 37 percent on chronic care, and 46 percent on acute care. 14 The following paragraphs explore how capacity can grow without training more clinicians ( Exhibit 1 ).      Exhibit 1 Estimated Primary Care Physician Time Savings Type of care Percent of physician’s time in traditional practice Estimated percent of physician’s work that can be reallocated to nonclinicians Estimated percent of physician’s time saved Preventive 17 60 10 Chronic 37 25 9 Acute 46 10 5 Total 100 — a 24      Clinical Preventive Services:      One-fifth of primary care visits involve preventive care, 15 most of which consists of cancer screening, counseling, and immunizations. A number of primary care practices have delegated many of these services to nonclinician team members. 13 An estimate that 60 percent of these preventive care services can be performed by nonclinicians suggests that 10 percent (60 percent times 17 percent) of clinicians’ time could be saved, which could translate into a 10 percent increase in primary care capacity. 16 How might this work?      Standardized preventive care—based on US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines—involves immunizations; screening for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer; or cardiovascular risk reduction (smoking cessation, healthy eating, eating, and physical activity). Transferring the responsibility for prevention from physicians to nonclinician panel managers increases the percentage of patients who receive preventive care. 17 Nurses can perform pap smears of equal quality as those performed by clinicians. 18 Some practices have created standing orders empowering medical assistants to give immunizations without clinician involvement. 19      Chronic Care:      Most of the time required to care for patients with chronic conditions is needed for health coaching: patient education, behavior change counseling, and medication adherence discussions. A conservative estimate holds that 25 percent of chronic care could be reallocated to nonclinician health coaches, 16 saving 9 percent (25 percent times 37 percent) of physician time. In diabetes, health coaching performed by nurses, pharmacists, or trained medical assistants is associated with better outcomes than traditional physician-driven care. 20,21 Much care for hypertension and hyperlipidemia can also be provided by nonclinicians. 22,23 Patients with depression coached by medical assistants have significant improvement compared with those receiving physician-only care. 24,25 Integrating behavioral health into primary care improves care and reduces the time physicians must spend with patients’ behavioral health issues. 26      Acute Care:      Acute care consumes 46 percent of primary care physicians’ time. Registered nurses managing uncomplicated upper respiratory infections, using standing orders, provide care equal in quality to that offered by physicians; 27,28 also, patients are more satisfied with nurse-provided care. 29 Women whose history indicates uncomplicated urinary tract infection can be treated by nurses without urinalysis, urine culture, clinician visit, or adverse consequences. 30      In a study of uncomplicated low back pain, registered nurses independently managed patients as well as physicians did, and patients were more satisfied with nurse management. 31 Physical therapists also manage uncomplicated back pain as well as physicians do. 32,33 Removing uncomplicated low back pain from physicians’ workload gains capacity and improves care.      Given the percentage of primary care visits for uncomplicated upper respiratory infections, cystitis, and musculoskeletal problems, a cautious estimate suggests that 10 percent of time could be allocated away from clinicians—a 5 percent time saving (10 percent times 46 percent).      Adding up the potential rechanneling of care from clinicians to nonclinician personnel for preventive, chronic, and acute issues, it is possible that 24 percent (10 percent plus 9 percent plus 5 percent) of clinician time could be saved by sharing the care among a primary care team. The registered nurse and pharmacist workforces are sufficient to add primary care capacity. 34,35 Expanding the medical assistant workforce could be accomplished quickly and would both enhance primary care capacity and create jobs. 36 Many of these concepts are being implemented in a variety of primary care practices throughout the United States. 13      Will patients accept care by team members who are not doctors? Does such a change disrupt the all-important patient-physician relationship? 37 First, the patient-physician relationship is not alive and well. Seventy-eight percent of physicians believe that they provide compassionate care, but only 54 percent of patients agree. 38 Second, patient satisfaction with nurses or physical therapists for the care of minor acute illness and low back pain is greater than satisfaction with physicians for these conditions. 29,31,32 Third, patients who experience care from NPs and PAs are satisfied with their care. 39 Finally, a 2012 survey of low-income Californians found that 94 percent of those receiving team care are satisfied with the team, and 81 percent of those without team care are willing to try team care, even if it means seeing their physician less often. 40      Patient Self-Care      Many human activities, enabled by technology, have moved toward self-service. Decades ago, gas station attendants fueled up our cars and cleaned our windshields; now drivers perform these functions for themselves. Bank customers used to wait in line for tellers; now automated teller machines are universal. Online shopping, research, and desktop publishing are common self-service activities. Health care is catching up, with new technologies allowing patients to care for themselves. Self-care helps balance primary care demand and capacity by reducing demand instead of increasing capacity.      In the diagnostic arena, patients use home pregnancy tests and home HIV kits. For chronic disease management, patients with diabetes monitor glucose and self-titrate insulin doses. Patients with blood pressure monitors who home-titrate their medications using algorithms achieve better blood pressure control than those cared for solely by physicians. 41 Selected patients on anticoagulation monitor their international normalized ratio (INR) levels at home and self-titrate their warfarin doses, achieving better INR control than physicians achieve. 42 Self-treatment with over-the-counter medications is expanding in the care of minor respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal disorders.      In addition to self-care, patients with chronic conditions can add primary care capacity by serving as peer coaches for patients with the same conditions. Low-income community clinic patients with peer coaches improved their diabetes control more than patients with usual care. 43 African American community residents trained as asthma coaches improved pediatric asthma outcomes compared with a control group. 44      Technology      Technology has dramatically changed travel, banking, shopping, and communication, enabling lay people to perform tasks formerly done by professionals. Health care is virtually the only industry whose basic modes of interaction remain the same as those established in the 1940s. 45 Technology tends to replace art with science, labor with capital, and personal experience with rules and protocols. Because art, labor, and personal experience continue to be necessary components of health care, technology complements these values instead of replacing them.      Telemedicine innovations contribute to home-based management of diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and HIV, saving thousands of time-consuming physician visits. 46 Computers can be programmed with standing orders to determine whether a patient with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia should receive a medication refill and can authorize the refill without any human effort. 47      One could imagine competent adult patients with uncomplicated urinary tract symptoms entering their symptoms into a kiosk, which would also serve as a vending machine. Patients without red flags could be provided with three days of appropriate antibiotics without any interaction with the health care system. Although such an innovation would require legislative or regulatory reform, it is supported by evidence on urinary tract infection self-care. 48 The use of the Centor clinical decision rules plus rapid strep testing 49 could enable patients with streptococcal pharyngitis and without penicillin allergy to stick their health insurance card into a vending machine to obtain penicillin. The possibilities are endless.      Addressing The Mismatch Between Demand And Capacity      How might some major obstacles impeding the wedge-shaped approach to America’s primary care gap be solved?      Payment Reform      As long as primary care physicians are paid by piecework and required to perform the work personally, they will hold on to obsolete work to maintain their incomes. In addition, they will have little incentive to redistribute work to nonclinicians who increase expenses but do not produce revenue. The Report of the National Commission on Payment Reform offers concrete suggestions on how to address this barrier. 50      Changes In Scope Of Practice      The performance of primary care tasks by nonphysicians is held back by myriad laws and regulations that prescribe what work can be performed by whom. Changing these statutes is difficult because they vary from state to state, and each professional stratum protects its turf. Without these changes, nonphysicians are restricted in assuming broader responsibilities for which they are perfectly capable, if properly trained and deployed. Health care institutions may interpret scope-of-practice laws in an overly narrow fashion and could reallocate clinical responsibilities without changes in legal statutes.      Training Nonclinicians To Assume New Responsibilities      A number of practices have trained medical assistants as panel managers and health coaches. 13 However, medical assistant training programs in community colleges or allied health professional schools do not provide training for these roles. Examples are multiplying of provider organizations partnering with community colleges to add panel management and health coaching to medical assistant training courses.      Personnel Limitations In Small Practices      The problem small practices face in possessing the needed personnel for new primary care roles will fade in importance as small practices increasingly join hospital systems or loose practice networks that can provide the personnel to redistribute care.      Tension Between Adding Capacity And Improving Care      Panel management and health coaching can improve preventive and chronic care but have not been proven to add substantial capacity. Studies are needed to determine whether panel management and health coaching truly save clinician time and thereby allow clinicians to see more patients. Professional team members—registered nurses, pharmacists, and behavioral health providers—who assume responsibility for subpanels of patients are likely to save clinician time because they are substituting for work currently done by clinicians.      Insufficient Innovations In Technology      The average well-motivated mother, with user-friendly technology, can probably do an adequate job of diagnosing strep throat and ear infections in her children. Yet a rate-limiting step may be the lack of a profitable business model that encourages self-care innovation. The flurry of health care–oriented start-ups is already expanding self-care opportunities available to the public. It remains to be seen whether the start-up model will succeed in spreading creative innovations widely.      Promoting An Innovation Culture      From the first day of professional school, physicians need to learn and internalize the five wedges of primary care capacity building, moving from the lone provider model to the team model, with engaged patients as part of the team. At the same time, the general public needs to shed its dependence on physician-only care and develop knowledge and confidence in team-based care and self-care. As noted above, this culture change is beginning but is not yet wide and deep. The culture will change as physicians and patients experience successful team care.      Conclusion      The policy construct of an adult primary care physician shortage needs to be reconceptualized as a primary care demand-capacity mismatch. Licensed and nonlicensed personnel, patients, and technology can add enormous capacity and reduce demand to narrow the demand-capacity gap. With this new way of thinking, the issue changes from, “How many primary care clinicians do we need?” to, “How many clinicians; nurses; pharmacists; panel managers; health coaches; peer educators; and confident, well-educated patients do we need to train; how can we accelerate the adoption of time-saving and demand-reducing health technology; and how can we reorganize payment to allow this transformation to take place?”      In moving toward broad implementation of the five-wedge transformation, physicians need not mourn for their professional identity. The new world can liberate physicians from protocol-based tasks that could be performed by less trained people or well-programmed computers, allowing physicians to do what they love: build relationships with patients who truly need them; solve diagnostic conundrums; create care plans and coordinate care for patients with complex, challenging illnesses; and help people toward the end of life to navigate their remaining time as free as possible from unwanted and ineffective invasive interventions. If physician time is reserved for high-level functions, work life will be more satisfying, and many patients will meet their health needs through nonclinician personnel, peer coaching, self-care, and technologic innovation.

Medical schools nationwide have been conducting aggressive... ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      By Maggie Fox      New York University said Thursday that it will offer free tuition to all its medical school students, in the hope of encouraging more doctors to choose lower-paying specialties.      Many surveys have shown that medical school graduates gravitate to the more lucrative specialties, in part to pay off enormous student debts.      “Every student enrolled in our MD degree program receives a full-tuition scholarship, regardless of merit or financial need, that covers the majority of the cost of attendance,” the school says on its website.      NYU said it got a batch of grants to pay for the full scholarship option, including some from Home Depot co-founder Kenneth Langone, who chairs the medical school’s board of trustees.      “This decision recognizes a moral imperative that must be addressed, as institutions place an increasing debt burden on young people who aspire to become physicians,” Dr. Robert Grossman, dean of NYU’s school of medicine, said in a statement.      Medical school is expensive. The Association of American Medical Colleges calculates that it costs an average of more than $240,000 to attend a public medical school. It costs $322,000 for four years at a private school, the group calculates.      NYU says its scholarship, which begins in the 2018-19 school year, is worth $55,000 a year.      According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the average debt for medical students is more than $100,000. The medical college association pegs the average debt at nearly twice that, or $180,000.      "I think what this does, it allows good smart kids from every social-economic background to be a doctor and that’s what we need."      To pay it off fast, medical school graduates often choose high-paying specialties such as orthopedics or plastic surgery. A survey last year by Medscape showed that orthopedists make $489,000 a year, compared with family practice physicians and pediatricians, who earn $200,000 a year.      The result is a shortage of the general care practitioners who are most needed, especially in rural parts of the country and in the so-called Rust Belt across the Midwest, according to several studies.      Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer at the AAMC, called NYU's decision "wonderful".      "There are a number of students who choose not to go into medical school because they see an overwhelming debt," Orlowski said in an interview.      Orlowski said she struggled to pay off her own medical school debt. "Going into my third and fourth years, my tuition doubled," she said. She took out a bank loan to pay it, but had to argue hard to get the money in the first place.      "I think what this does, it allows good, smart kids from every social-economic background to be a doctor and that’s what we need," she said.      Other high-profile schools have sought in recent years to make their pricey programs more accessible. Stanford University offers full-tuition scholarships to all undergraduates whose family income is under $125,000 a year, and adds free room and board to students whose families earn less than $65,000.      The Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers free tuition to students whose families make less than $80,000 a year, and MIT says 90 percent of its students receive financial aid. |||||	– New York University has a plan to encourage more medical students to pursue careers in lower-paying specialties: alleviate the six-figure debt that comes with pursuing a medical degree. To do that, NYU will now give all of its medical students a free ride, the Wall Street Journal reports. The huge amount of debt that medical students graduate with—a median of $195,000 in loans—is one of the reasons that they choose to pursue higher-paying specialties, according to NBC. The result is a shortage of primary care physicians and researchers, per the WSJ. For instance, a plastic surgeon earns about $473,000 a year on average, while a pediatric doctor makes about $222,000. "If you're faced with debt that you're likely to have into your 50s, it's got to have an influence on what you choose to do," Lee Goldman, dean of the Columbia University medical school tells the paper. Other schools, including Columbia, are making efforts to ease the tuition burden on medical students. But the NYU program to cover 100% of tuition for all medical students is "a first among the nation's major medical schools," per the WSJ. So far, NYU has raised $450 million of $600 million it says it will need to fund the program. More than 450 new and current students will benefit—though they will still need to pay about $29,000 a year for room, board, and living expenses.
summarize: Hands evolved to punch faces. Faces evolved to take punches. That’s the hypothesis being bandied about by University of Utah researchers Michael Morgan and David Carrier, the pair proposing that the apparent “protective buttressing” of our skulls and hands is a sign of violent prehistoric fights where fists of fury dictated who would mate and who would exit the gene pool. It’s a great example of a just-so story.      Morgan and Carrier’s new paper, published in Biological Reviews, is a sequel to an initial paper that suggested our hands evolved as cudgels. This was more than a bit of a stretch. “The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the proportions of the human hand make it an effective weapon,” Morgan and Carrier wrote in the first study, but they couldn’t provide any evidence that punching was a preferred or even common mode of fighting in the past. The hypothesis rested on a post hoc fallacy of the same sort used by “aquatic ape” devotees – because our hands can be effective weapons, then they must have evolved for that purpose. No surprise that the concept of a spandrel – a trait that wasn’t molded specifically by natural selection, but is an evolutionary byproduct later co-opted for a different use – never appears in Morgan and Carrier’s considerations of pummeling fists.      But the skull paper is even stranger. Although Morgan and Carrier focused on the bludgeoning qualities of modern human hands in their previous paper, their new review suggests that our ancient relatives and forebears – the australopithecines – had faces that were molded into punching bags by natural selection. No sooner did humans come out of the trees, Morgan and Carrier suggest, than they started whaling away on each other. The trouble is that they undercut their own hypothesis, leaving only a crumpled heap of speculation.      Citing crime statistics from western countries, Morgan and Carrier write that fistfights often result in broken noses, jaws, and other facial bones. Therefore, they reason circularly, prehistoric humans that punched each other in the face should have more robust facial bones to cope with such blows. Given that early humans Australopithecus and Paranthropus – the latter often called “robust australopithecines” – had broad faces with wide cheeks and thick brow ridges, they’re obviously perfect candidates for Morgan and Carrier’s favored interpretation.      Morgan and Carrier didn’t study whether or not the hands of the early australopithecines could form a fist. Their previous work was on our species, Homo sapiens. Nor did they look for signs of broken facial bones or blunt-force trauma on prehistoric skulls, or even try to model how early human skulls would have reacted to the stresses of an incoming fist. The entire argument is simply that australopithecine skulls look like they could take a punch.      In Morgan and Carrier’s view, the heavy brows, large jaws, and flaring cheeks of the australopithecines are not signals of the way primates grow or the different plant foods they dined on, as paleoanthropologists have discerned, but were adaptations for reducing damage doled out by males as they competed for mates. There’s no evidence that australopithecines fought like this. The entire conjecture is based on sports like mixed martial arts and modern crime stats. And females don’t even figure into Morgan and Carrier’s hypothesis. Female mate choice, and why sexual dimorphism between the sexes has drastically decreased through time, is either ignored or overshadowed by the belief that we owe our most distinctive features to males walloping each other. This is bro science – dudes pummeling each other driving human evolution.      Those early humans couldn’t make the tight fists we do, though. Australopithecines – Lucy and her kin – were bipedal walkers that retained some signs of their arboreal ancestry, such as more ape-like arms and fingers. The hands and limbs of archaic hominins don’t match up with the supposedly “buttressed” skulls. More than that, our species doesn’t have the reinforced cheek bones, deep jaws, or prominent brow ridges that Morgan and Carrier cast as defensive structures. If our fists are so well-suited for punching, why have our faces lost their osteological protection? Morgan and Carrier suppose that we’re weaker than our ancestors, and therefore don’t need thick facial bones, but this runs counter to the heart of their hypothesis. If our hands evolved as weapons, then we should see a coevolution between striking hands and stout faces. Our prehistory shows no such pattern.      Saying that our hands are adapted to strike or that our skulls evolved to withstand those anatomical truncheons is fine as a hypothesis. But a hypothesis is just the initial fuel for the scientific engine. Morgan and Carrier haven’t let that experimental machinery run, instead looking to isolated tidbits of modern culture and projecting those behaviors onto our past. That’s not science. That’s storytelling.      References:      Morgan, M., Carrier, D. 2013. Protective buttressing of the human fist and the evolution of hominin hands.

DOI: 10/1111/brv.12112 ||||| Carrier and Fish, a biomechanist at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, had been arguing at a conference many years earlier about whether the sperm whale's bulging head had developed for ramming other male whales to compete for access to females. Fish believed the answer was no, and he balled up his hand into a fist to emphasize his point. (No blows were thrown, of course.) |||||       A (living) hand demonstrates the positions used in the experiment. (David Carrier, University of Utah)      A new study claims that punching may have helped our ancestors evolve a unique human hand shape, one capable of forming a fist. The experiment, which relied on cadaver arms strung up with fishing line and guitar tuners, is delightfully offbeat. But many researchers seem unconvinced by the findings.      David Carrier's ideas about the human hand are controversial, but that doesn't seem to bother him much. Ironically, his hypothesis — that ancient fisticuffs helped drive the evolution of the human hand — first came to him in the middle of a loud argument.      [Scientists examine why men even exist]      A decade ago, the University of Utah biologist had published a paper suggesting that sperm whale foreheads evolved as battering rams, meaning that male-on-male sexual competition had driven a quintessential feature of the species. An old friend of his didn't buy it, and soon they were yelling at each other in the hallway.      "At one point, to illustrate the point he was trying to communicate, he held his fist up in front of my face and said 'I can hit you in the face with this, but that’s not why it evolved!' And I thought hey, maybe it did," Carrier told The Post. "I didn’t say that at the time, because he was already upset."      [Ancient shoulders show signs of humanity’s ape-like past]      Since then, Carrier has published several papers on the subject — and they've all been controversial. The studies center on the thesis that the human hand, with its relatively delicate fingers, long thumbs, and short palms, may have been driven into its strange shape by fighting between males. No other primate can make a fist, Carrier points out, which is quite a convenient coincidence for us. He's even argued that the human face evolved its shape to better take a hit from a fist. Brian Switek, who blogs about evolution for National Geographic, accused one of Carrier's studies of being "bro science — dudes pummeling each other driving human evolution."      [What making puppy eyes with your dog says about evolution]      Even Carrier admits that the more traditional hypothesis, which is that our hands evolved to hold tools "makes perfect sense."      "We're masters of dexterity," Carrier said. "But what we’re suggesting is that maybe there’s another component."      In other words, Carrier feels that fisticuffs could have been a secondary but vital driver of hand evolution.      His latest study, published Wednesday in the Journal of Experimental Biology, sets out to test the resilience of the human fist as a weapon. He wanted to test how much different bones in the hand deform under the force of a blow, so he and his co-authors got hold of some cadaver arms — all donated to science, of course — and tested their punching power.            The apparatus for the experiment. (Andre Mossman, University of Utah)      "We were using little transducers you have to glue directly to the bone," Carrier explained, "Which is obviously too invasive to do on a living subject."      The apparatus sounds pretty gruesome: Strong fishing line was tied directly to tendons in each arm, and the limbs were then mounted on a platform. The fishing line connected to guitar tuners, which the researchers could use to "tune" each arm tightly into whatever position they wanted. Then the whole platform would swing, sending the hand into a dumbbell with an accelerometer on it to calculate force.            The hand positions used in the experiment. (University of Utah)      The data suggests that humans can safely strike with 55 percent more force with a fully closed fist than with an open one (as shown above). A fist allows for twice the force of an open-palmed slap before bones begin to break.      [Scientists find the oldest-ever hand bone to resemble a modern human’s]      Arizona State University's Mary Marzke was unimpressed with the hypothesis, pointing out that chimps and gorillas do manage "fist-like" grabbing gestures, even if they don't have thumbs long enough to make a true human fist. These animals don't use their half-fists for fighting, but for breaking up food.      "It also is surprising that the authors compared fist-punching with palm-slapping, instead of with striking by the heel of the palm," Marzke told The Post. "The latter is well known to be very effective in fighting. It has the advantage of concentrating force over a relatively small area of the hand, an advantage that the author highlighted for the fist in an earlier study. The palm heel punch does not require hominin thumb and finger proportions."      Brigitte Demes of Stony Brook University was also critical of the study, suggesting that the data didn't really prove anything one way or another — it just fit the narrative Carrier likes.      "The conclusions drawn are not based on evidence," Demes wrote in an e-mail. Just as Carrier's angry colleague suggested a decade ago, the capability to punch — even if punching really is superior to other hand-to-hand combat techniques — is not proof that the hand evolved for it. "At best, pugilistic encounters as an explanation for the evolution of the human hand remains just another story. There are many other behaviors that could be marshaled to explain the morphology of human hand bones," Demes said.      As far as Carrier is concerned, his naysayers are just scared.      "There’s a fear, and I don’t think it’s necessarily valid, but there’s a real fear that evidence suggesting we’re anatomically built for fighting could be used to justify bad behavior," Carrier said when asked about scientists who discount his research. "What I would argue is that if our goal is to reduce violence in the future, we need to understand what this dark side of human nature is all about."

That may be true, but if it is a coincidence, it is unfortunate.”      “As an alternative, we suggest that the hand proportions that allow the formation of a fist may tell us something important about our evolutionary history and who we are as a species,” Carrier adds. “If our anatomy is adapted for fighting, we need to be aware we always may be haunted by basic emotions and reflexive behaviors that often don’t make sense – and are very dangerous – in the modern world.”      PHOTO CREDIT: University of Utah Marketing & Communications Download Full-Res Image      Humans have shorter palms and fingers and longer, stronger, flexible thumbs compared with other apes. These features have been long thought to have evolved so our ancestors had the manual dexterity to make and use tools.      Carrier and his collaborators not only have argued our hands evolved partly for punching but that the faces of human ancestors, the australopiths, evolved to resist punching – and that human faces became more delicate as our violence became less dependent on brute force. The new study sought more experimental evidence for his theory using nine male cadaver arms purchased from the university’s body donor program and from a private supply company.      “We tested the hypothesis that a clenched fist protects the metacarpal [palm or hand] bones from injury [and fracture] by reducing the level of strain during striking,” the study says.      After hundreds of punches and slaps using eight arms (one was too arthritic), “our results suggest that humans can safely strike with 55 percent more force with a fully buttressed fist than with an unbuttressed fist, and with twofold more force with a buttressed fist than with an open hand slap,” Carrier and his students write.      They add that the evolutionary significance of the hands of humans and their ancestors “may be that these are the proportions that improved manual dexterity while at the same time making it possible for the hand to be used as a club during fighting.”      The research was funded by the National Science Foundation. Carrier conducted the study with two undergraduate biology students who helped design the experiment and did much of the work with the cadaver arms: Joshua Horns and Rebekah Jung.      The punching dead: showing what happens ‘when guys get mad’      Carrier emphasizes: “We are not proposing the only important things were natural selection for dexterity and for punching.” Other possibilities include genetic drift – variation in hand proportions being lost among a small, isolated population – and unidentified genetic and developmental factors. Carrier notes that natural selection favored lengthening the big toe and shortening other toes so human ancestors could run more easily, and the same genes likely affected hand proportions as well.      The experiment’s cadaver arms were placed in a pendulum-like apparatus so they could swing toward and punch a padded, force-detecting dumbbell with either a clenched or buttressed fist (thumb locked around index and middle fingers, which are curled tightly to the palm) or an unbuttressed fist (thumb outward and not touching the loosely folded fingers) or side-slap the target with an open hand.      PHOTO CREDIT: Andre Mossman, University of Utah Download Full-Res Image      The cadaver hands were placed in those positions with fishing line tied to tendons of forearm muscles. Those tendons pull various muscles that control the wrist, thumb and fingers. Guitar-tuner knobs controlled tension on the fishing lines to adjust the hands.      “Metacarpals are bones in the hand that break most often – not finger bones, but bones of the palm,” Carrier says. “When guys get mad and punch a wall, or when bars close and they punch each other, the bones that break most often are the metacarpals.”      Strain gauges to measure bone deformation – stretching and compression – were glued to the back-of-the-hand side of the metacarpals, usually the second metacarpal. The gauges measured stress on those hand bones during punches and slaps.      Strain placed on the hand bones during the study was sevenfold less than needed to break a metacarpal. Why? With too much tension, the fishing lines would snap while trying to control a cadaver’s hand. The researchers used 25-to 200-pound test line – the thicker line is for deep-sea fishing – because “we had many lines break,” Carrier says. Stronger lines slipped off tendons.      He says it is valid to extrapolate to the larger forces of a real punch “because there is a linear relationship between force applied to a bone and how much it bends.”      Because fingers often smashed strain gauges applied to the palm side of the bones during punches, most of the strain data came from the backside of second metacarpal, the hand bone beneath the index finger. The experimenters did get some data from the palm side of that bone, and from the back sides of the third and fifth metacarpals.      “Each one of these hands took about a week of work,” he says. “First we had to dissect it to expose the muscles, apply one or more strain gauges, and then attach the lines to all the tendons so you can control the position of the wrist, thumb and fingers to create a buttressed fist, unbuttressed fist or open-palm posture. Everything had to be lined up just right – all the joints, tension in muscles, the orientation of bones.”      PHOTO CREDIT: Denise Morgan, University of Utah Download Full-Res Image      Responding to claims of ‘bro science’      Carrier’s theory has been criticized harshly by some, with one well-known blogger calling it “bro science – dudes pummeling each other driving human evolution.” Here are some criticisms and Carrier’s responses:      — Critics say that if the human hand is adapted for fighting, then the primary target of fists – the face – would have coevolved protective features. Carrier and colleagues argue that is what the fossil record indicates happened in burly human ancestors, the australopiths. In humans, “as our face became less massive, we also lost punching power” along with upper body size, Carrier says.      — Skeptics say the idea the face evolved to resist punches ignores the nose. Carrier acknowledges “the nose is the one part of the face – in Homo, not australopiths – that is inconsistent with the idea that the face has evolved to be protected from punches. It sticks out. It is weak. But in great apes and australopiths it is flat. And in australopiths, all of the features of the face are consistent.”      — Many anthropologists argue that little historic and prehistoric evidence exists for fistfighting. Carrier says history shows the use of fists to strike was common in many human cultures, and the prehistoric record provides consistent ancient evidence.      — Some people believe the human hand is too delicate to have evolved to be an important weapon. They say early humans would use sticks or rocks. However, Carrier says studies of assault injuries indicate that human fists are common, effective weapons, and that when humans fight, face bones break much more frequently than hand bones.      — Critics argue that if men were adapted for fistfighting, our species would exhibit large rather than relatively small differences in body mass between men and women. Carrier counters that in terms of lean body mass and upper body muscular strength, such differences in humans are large. He adds that the male-female differences in hand and face shape and size are among the largest.      — Critics of the “aggressive ape” theory of human evolution often argue that humans are by nature empathetic, cooperative and peaceful. Carrier agrees, but believes aggression played a key role in our evolution.      PHOTO CREDIT: David Carrier, University of Utah Download Full-Res Image      Video courtesy of Newsy/E.W.

University of Utah researcher David Carrier and his colleagues used fishing line and guitar tuners to string up the arms of nine cadavers for their experiments. The upshot? They say the shape of our hands evolved to make it possible to best punch with a closed fist without damaging bones, especially those in the palm, the Los Angeles Times reports. Most researchers think our hands evolved the way they did entirely because of the more dexterous tasks early humans started performing, but "we suggest that the hand proportions that allow the formation of a fist may tell us something important about our evolutionary history and who we are as a species," Carrier says in a press release. Carrier, whose earlier research claimed that male faces evolved to take punches, says no other primate can form a "buttressed" fist with the thumb outside the fingers. He admits that his findings are controversial, and notes that a National Geographic science blogger declared his work to be "bro science—dudes pummeling each other driving human evolution." He tells the Washington Post that the idea for the research came during an argument with an old friend about biology, during which his friend held up a fist, and said: "I can hit you in the face with this, but that’s not why it evolved!" (Other researchers claim that people who suffer chronic back pain have less evolved spines.)
summarize: WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge is allowing Maryland and the District of Columbia to proceed with their lawsuit accusing President Donald Trump of unconstitutionally accepting gifts from foreign and state interests through his Washington hotel. The decision Wednesday clears the way for the plaintiffs to seek financial records from the president's company.      In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte rejected arguments from the Justice Department that earnings from business activities, including hotel room stays, do not qualify as unconstitutional gifts.      At issue is the Constitution's "emoluments" clause, which bans federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval. The plaintiffs argue Trump's hotel harms area businesses because of the president's ties.      Two other emoluments lawsuits are also moving through federal courts. ||||| Washington (CNN) A federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday denied a motion to dismiss portions of a lawsuit alleging that President Donald Trump, through his Trump International Hotel in DC and the Trump Organization, violated a constitutional clause banning gifts or advantages from foreign and domestic governments.      In his opinion, Judge Peter Messitte of the US District Court of Maryland largely sided with Maryland and Washington, DC's definition of emolument as an "advantage." Trump was arguing for a more restrictive definition of the term as a "gift."      Department of Justice spokesman Andy Reuss said the department is reviewing the judge's order.      "We continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed, a position that was shared by a New York court in a related case. The Justice Department is reviewing the order and determining next steps to continue vigorously defending the President," Reuss said.      Maryland and Washington, DC, have argued that the Trump International Hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the Trump Hotel got special tax concessions.      Messitte deferred a ruling on the President's motion to dismiss the case against him in an individual capacity. However, the court is still considering whether he violated the emoluments clause in an official cap acity.      The ruling is on the President's lawyers motion to dismiss an amended lawsuit from Washington, DC, and Maryland. An earlier motion to dismiss was also rejected.      Wednesday's order directs parties to confer and produce a proposal on next steps for the discovery process, which may include producing tax returns, Raquel Coombs, the director of communications for Maryland's Office of the Attorney General, told CNN.      #BREAKING: Judge allows our #emoluments case to proceed.

In a statement later Wednesday, Racine said the court specifically agreed with the plaintiffs' position "that President Trump cannot accept profits from private transactions, including those involving services given at fair market value, like those we allege are occurring at the Trump International Hotel here in the District."      Racine added that this marked the first time a court has interpreted the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses.      Interpreting the emoluments clause      In his opinion, Messitte expansively read the term "emolument" in the Constitution to cover, and ultimately ban, the President from receiving "anything more than de minimis profit, gain, or advantage" in his private capacity.      Messitte based his interpretation on the constitutional text of the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses and his reading of the framers' intentions, along with dictionaries and other outside sources.      Addressing the words of the provisions themselves, he wrote, "The text of both (Foreign and Domestic Emoluments) Clauses strongly indicates that the broader meaning of 'emolument' advanced by Plaintiffs was meant to apply. As Plaintiffs point out, the Foreign Clause bans, without Congressional approval, 'any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.' Use of such expansive modifiers significantly undermines the President's argument that this Clause was meant to prohibit only payment for official services rendered in an employment-type relationship."      Messitte said the use of "any kind whatever" was intended to ensure the broader meaning of the emolument term.      He said Trump's narrower definition of emoluments would essentially prohibit only outright bribes.      "The President's interpretation of the limited meaning of the Emoluments Clauses cannot be the correct one," Messitte wrote. It "would reduce the Clauses to little more than a prohibition of bribery which, in addition to already being addressed elsewhere in the Constitution, is ... a very difficult crime to prove."      Messitte also rejected arguments from the President's lawyers that such a broad interpretation would create absurd consequences.      "For example," the judge wrote, "he claims that if the Court were to adopt Plaintiff's interpretation, it would mean that a federal official's stock holdings in a global company would violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause if some of that company's earnings could be traced to foreign governments. ... Notwithstanding the parade of horribles the President calls up, the Court does not see how the historical record reflects anything other than an intention that the Emoluments Clauses function as broad anti-corruption provisions."      Correction: The headline and first paragraph of this story have been corrected to reflect that the Trump Organization and Trump International Hotel are not named parties in the lawsuit against the President. |||||	– Justice Department lawyers' latest bid to get an emoluments suit against the president tossed has been unsuccessful. US District Judge Peter Messitte on Wednesday denied the motion, which the Washington Post describes as apparently "the first time a federal judge had interpreted [the Constitution's emoluments clauses] and applied their restrictions to a sitting president." The suit, filed in 2017 by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, says the document's emoluments clause forbids federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. The lawsuit says Trump is doing exactly that by reaping profits from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, even while doing government business with other nations. In his ruling, Messitte wrote that the allegations were plausible and that the ban could apply to any business dealings with foreign governments that resulted in a "profit, gain, or advantage" for Trump. CNN notes that the plaintiffs had been pushing to define emolument as an "advantage," while Trump's lawyers were looking to limit it to the definition of "gift." The Justice Department's argument is that the original intention of the clause was to prevent bribe-taking, not legitimate business endeavors. The AP reports the decision will enable the plaintiffs to request the hotel's financial records, with the Post adding it's possible they could try to get access to Trump's tax returns. The Justice Department has not said whether it will appeal. Trump faces two other active emoluments-related lawsuits.
summarize: Normally, I have little patience with people who criticize the Academy Awards, taking the view that something as trivial and inconsequential as the handing-out of movie trophies simply isn't worth getting your knickers in a twist over. It's show biz. It's hype. It's glitz layered with more glitz. Don't take it so seriously. But this year's Oscars put me in such a rotten mood, I was forced to bring out the long knives.      Here are the three worst things about the 2014 Oscar show.      1. Ellen Degeneres. She ruined it. I positively LOVE Ellen, and yet she ruined the show by turning a glittering movie tribute -- an annual ceremony dedicated solely and exclusively to the motion picture industry -- into a version of a television show! Ellen did the one thing she knew how to do: namely, be a TV host. Incredibly, she treated this gathering of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science members as if they were a daytime studio audience, a TV game show audience.      She went out among them, she huddled with them, she mock-joked with them, she kept up a constant line of patter; she schmoozed with them, hugged them, kissed them. Ellen did what so many afternoon TV talk show hosts do: She resorted to props. She ordered pizzas as a gag. She took selfies. She asked audience members to go into their purses and wallets. She dressed up in funny costumes. In other words, she brought her television shtick to the movies. I'm surprised she didn't reach out with the mic and ask a couple, "So where are you folks from?"      2. Too long. The show ran half an hour late. Had it ended at its scheduled time, 8:30 PM, it still would have seemed interminably long, but at exactly 8:25 PM (PST), they still hadn't handed out Oscars in six important categories: Best Original Screenplay, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Movie. I looked at my watch and couldn't believe it. The show was supposed to over in five minutes, yet the best categories still hadn't been touched.      We can lay part of the blame for that on host Ellen Degeneres, for having spent so much cavorting with the audience, but the main reason the show ran long was due to all the commercials ABC chose to run. If you had deleted only those repetitive Cadillac ads and the tedious promos for the ABC show, "Resurrection," we might have finished with time to spare.      3. No surprises. Other than maybe, the song from "Frozen" beating out U-2's Nelson Mandela's tribute, there were no surprises, no upsets. None. The Vegas handicappers had this thing totally wired. And because there were no surprises, there was no drama. Blanchett won Best Actress, Nyong'o won Best Supporting, both heavy favorites. McConaughey won Best Actor, Leto won Best Supporting, both heavy favorites. Cuaron won Best Director for "Gravity," as predicted, and "12 Years a Slave" won Best Picture as every fifth-grader in America knew it would.      But you can't blame anyone just because we all knew who was going to win. Predicting the winners has become a science, and they're getting better at it every year. One problem is all the awards shows that precede the Oscars. By the time March rolls around, we already know which actors and movies have won all the major awards. Indeed, if "12 Years a Slave" hadn't won Best Picture, that would've been the Oscar's lead story. That's what it's come to. Our shock at who didn't win.      David Macaray is an LA playwright and author ("It's Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor," 2nd edition). ||||| Let the charges fly that this year’s Oscars were “boring,” but from the nature of the production, one suspects that wasn’t far from the intent. Ellen DeGeneres did not sing a song about seeing actresses’ boobs on screen, but rather delivered an opening monologue in which she playfully bantered with the nominees and joshed about Hollywood’s foibles – a tone that extended throughout the night. In that respect, DeGeneres felt much like a throwback to the old days – when Bob Hope or Johnny Carson handled those chores – relying on the movies, and whatever spontaneity the recipients could muster, to make the show memorable or (more often) forgettable.      For all the pandering the Oscars have done through the years to attract a younger audience – including last year’s choice of Seth MacFarlane – DeGeneres’ latest turn as host spoke to another phase of the process, which might be acceptance. After all, her daytime profile dovetails pretty well with the demos of the Oscarcast, which is to say more female than male, and a little on the older side.      About as close as this year’s awards got to hip was having the camera swivel around the presenters, which more than anything felt like an attempt to create a sense of movement (or less charitably, car-sickness) in a show that was frequently inert.      More Reviews Off Broadway Review: 'The Jungle' Film Review: 'Bumblebee'      No, if this year’s Academy Awards were going to escape the dreaded snooze effect – and that’s invariably a problem with a three-hour-plus telecast, where most of the winners aren’t identifiable to viewers at home – the magic was going to have to be generated by someone other than the host or producers, whose taped pieces were nothing special. The tributes to screen heroes felt especially flaccid, with part two representing a self-conscious nod to the kind of crowd-pleasing movies that seldom get nominated. Similarly, a segment devoted to animated heroes should have played adjacent to best animated feature.      The evening’s principal wrinkle, such as it was, involved moving DeGeneres around the auditorium, which allowed her to continue ribbing and interacting with stars, such as presenting Bradley Cooper a consolation lotto ticket after he didn’t win or (in the best bit) ordering pizza for heavyweights in the audience – and trying to pass the bill to Harvey Weinstein.      For the most part, the stars were helpfully willing to play along – posing for a tweeted selfie, for example, which briefly crashed Twitter – but those kind of gags are both slim and a hit-miss proposition.      To quote the late Gilbert Cates, the “award show gods” either smile on producers or they don’t, and this year’s telecast enjoyed several small blessings from above. They included Darlene Love belting out a song after “20 Feet From Stardom” won best documentary; Lupita Nyong’o’s exuberance and radiance; Jared Leto’s touching tribute to his mother, right off the bat; and Bill Murray throwing out an acknowledgement to the late Harold Ramis.      Of course, amid such a bloated show, those interludes felt few and far between. The same goes for the graceful musical performances – Pink’s tribute to “The Wizard of Oz,” U2’s stirring performance of its Oscar-nominated song from “Mandela,” Bette Midler’s necrology rendition of “Wind Beneath My Wings,” Idina Menzel’s spine-tingling pipes on “Frozen’s” “Let it Go” – which didn’t exhibit much imagination in their staging.      Despite safe choices from top to bottom, the Oscars have become a political lightning rod, and this year’s telecast will likely be no exception. Cultural warriors are apt to seize upon everything from references to AIDS and gay acceptance by the winners from “Dallas Buyers Club” to Cate Blanchett’s pitch regarding the box office viability of movies starring women. Then again, it’s rare for an actor to deliver such an impassioned thanks to God, as Matthew McConaughey did.      Such gripes notwithstanding, DeGeneres is in many ways one of the few talents suited to this sort of steadfastly middle-of-the-road take on the Oscars – able to joke around with celebrities from June Squibb to Liza Minnelli to Jennifer Lawrence, without ever coming across as mean-spirited.      That’s as it should be, since there’s certainly enough nastiness and snark to go around. Let the Twitter-verse buzz about Kim Novak, John Travolta’s garbled introduction of Menzel or Midler’s clipped comment after her performance. Inside the Dolby, let the good (OK, maybe just inoffensive) times roll.      As for the 90-minute arrivals show, suffice it to say that bloated exercise felt about 43 minutes too long. Part of that had to with the predictable emptiness of the red-carpet banter courtesy of a “Good Morning America” team that didn’t miss a single opportunity for self-promotion — including a stiff taped bit involving latenight host Jimmy Kimmel.      All told, it was a ho-hum evening, but not an embarrassing one – a long sit, punctuated by occasional moments, and genuine suspense regarding the eventual coronation of “12 Years a Slave.” And if that sounds like a small victory, in Oscar terms, it’s the equivalent of defying gravity. ||||| For the third time in her career, Ellen DeGeneres was asked to host a Hollywood awards ceremony after a tragedy — this time the tragedy being Seth MacFarlane’s Hollywood-savaging Oscars hosting of a year ago. Ellen hosted the twice-delayed Emmy Awards after the September 2001 terrorist attacks and, four years later, after Hurricane Katrina. Tonight she hosted the first Academy Awards since MacFarlane opened the Oscars with “We Saw Your Boobs” and followed it up with a crack about John Wilkes Booth (rather than nominee Daniel Day-Lewis) being the actor who best got into President Lincoln’s head.      “For those of you watching us around the world, it’s been a tough couple of days for us. It has been raining. We’re fine – thank you for your prayers,” DeGeneres joked as she opened tonight’s ABC broadcast — a nod to her deft hosting of the aforementioned Emmy broadcasts, including that twice-postponed ’01 Emmys, which she’d opened with the observation: “What would bother the Taliban more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by Jews” to gales of laughter.      Related: OSCARS: Deadline’s Live Blog      When tonight’s disjointed show finally ended, a minute or two into Monday morning for about a third of the country’s TV viewers who live on the East Coast, DeGeneres had reminded us she’s likeable as all get out, but her improvised bits did not work so well – Amy Poehler and Tina Fey did it much better at the Golden Globes. She’d called Liza Minnelli “sir”, complimented “him” on his great Liza Minnelli impersonation; shamed Harvey Weinstein into putting $200 bucks into Pharrell’s hat, which she was passing around to collect money to pay for the product-placement pizza she ordered for the A-listers in the front rows; pocketed and used best supporting actress winner Lupita Nyong’o’s pizza-collection contribution (a lip gloss); and maybe crashed Twitter shortly after piling about a dozen celebrities into one selfie during the broadcast in an attempt to break the record for most re-tweets (it was pushing 2 million by the time the trophy show was over, causing the Motion Picture Academy to apologize for contributing to the Twitter traffic jam).      Heroes in Hollywood was this year’s theme. “We need heroes now more than ever,” DeGeneres said during the broadcast. “People in the world are going through hard times, and movies offer us an escape. Movies inspires us. I’m not saying that movies are the most important thing in the world ’cause we all know the most important thing in the world is youth,” she snarked, in the first of her costume changes — in a sort of barrister suit minus the wig, which inspired MSNBC show host Ronan Farrow to tweet: “Tomorrow on Ronan Farrow Daily: exclusive interview with Ellen DeGeneres’s cravat.”      Deadline followers on various social-media sites had wildly different opinions about the show. “Death” said one succinct criticism; others cut DeGeneres some slack because they like her a lot; one Twitter user was “completely unimpressed” and asked if Ricky Gervais was available for next year.      As with the Golden Globes, some awards did not get handed out at the Oscars tonight, but let’s remedy that right now:      * Best Guerrilla Upstaging Of A Multimillion-Dollar Product Placement Campaign By Oscar Sponsor Samsung (touting its new Galaxy S5): Lupita’s lip balm which, which, according to Twitter chatter, is Clarins.      * Best Brain Freeze: John Travolta introducing Frozen’s “Let It Go” singer and Broadway’s Wicked star Idina Menzel as “the Wickedly talented Adela Dazeem.” Within minutes a Twitter account had been created for Adela Dazeem which as of posting had 11,000 followers and counting, and was trending.      * Best Acceptance Speech Demonstrating Why Actors Need Directors: Matthew McConaughey’s shout-out to God and himself-in-10-years during his acceptance speech for the Best Actor win.      * Most Revelatory Moment About Celebrity Psychology That We Knew All Along But It’s Nice To Have It Confirmed: Kevin Spacey photobombing Ellen’s selfie with Meryl Streep and other invited A-listers. “My photobombing gets better and better,” Spacey bragged on Twitter. (Spacey seemed like a drunk high schooler crashing a wedding at the Oscars; he got more screen time than any of the night’s nominees, and then showed up on Jimmy Kimmel’s post-Oscar show and took another selfie of himself and Kimmel to see if he could beat Ellen’s re-tweet tally).      * Best Spontaneous Expression Of Joy That Starts Well And Ends Badly: 20 Feet From Stardom cast member Darlene Love bursting out into song that goes on just long enough off key to demonstrate why she’s a backup singer not a headliner.      * Best Thank You That Comes Off As Note To HR Personnel File: The Great Gatsby costumer Catherine Martin thanking Ian Gracie, supervision art director, with, “you rock and you swear a lot.” |||||	– The general feeling this morning? Last night's Academy Awards ceremony was way too long, and host Ellen DeGeneres didn't do nearly as good a job as anyone was hoping: On the Huffington Post, David Macaray offers up three reasons this year's Oscars was "the worst." DeGeneres is one: "She ruined it" by treating the audience like "a daytime studio audience, a TV game show audience," constantly going out into the seats to banter and resorting to "props" like pizza and selfies. The interminable length is another: With five minutes left before the ceremony's scheduled end, six important categories still hadn't been handed out. The last reason? There are simply no surprises anymore: "If 12 Years a Slave hadn't won Best Picture, that would've been the Oscars' lead story. That's what it's come to. Our shock at who didn't win." At the Hollywood Reporter, Tim Goodman is even harsher: The show was "turgid, badly directed, poorly produced," and "so boring, so long, so self-involved." And DeGeneres offered up an "endless string of tired or wince-inducing moments" that ultimately drove the whole thing "sideways into a ditch." Her jokes were "flat," the pizza stunt felt "forced." And the producers didn't help: They "seemed intent to stuff as many useless, time-killing montages into the early and middle sections as possible, making viewers at home continuously glance at that ticking clock." But Brian Lowry thinks a boring ceremony may have been the intent, coming as it did on the heels of last year's song about boobs. This year "was a ho-hum evening, but not an embarrassing one," Lowry writes in Variety. "DeGeneres is in many ways one of the few talents suited to this sort of steadfastly middle-of-the-road take on the Oscars." One of the few moments critics kinda liked? When cast member Darlene Love burst into song after 20 Feet From Stardom won best documentary, but even that wasn't great: At Deadline, Lisa de Moraes calls it the "Best Spontaneous Expression Of Joy That Starts Well And Ends Badly," noting that the song went on "just long enough off-key to demonstrate why she’s a backup singer not a headliner."
summarize: It may look like leftover burnt scraps of a late-summer barbecue, stuffed with melted tyre fillings, but this bizarre black combination is just Burger King’s latest menu option for Japan.      The incinerated-looking buns are darkened with bamboo charcoal, and the same has been used to give the poisonous-looking cheese its melted-tar look. The beef burgers, meanwhile, have added black pepper, and are topped with an onion and garlic sauce mixed with squid ink.      The international chain says it is the third time it has released a goth-like burger (the others had black buns and black ketchup) and diners have so far given them a “favourable reception.”      Strange as they seem, however, Burger King’s Kuro Pearl and Kuro Diamond are not the first black burgers around.

Then there are the regional dishes that prove black foods are more than a gimmick, from the Spanish Arros Negre (a cuttlefish and rice dish) to squid ink risotto, black pasta – and, of course, black pudding.      Black pasta. Photograph: Alamy      While in 2009, jelly-makers Bompas and Parr held an all-black banquet using, among other things, black truffles, blackberries and caviar. The idea, according to Sam Bompas, was based around the fact that “black food is actually a luxury, a way of laughing at death to overcome it”.      It may be an extravagant claim for the purveyors of fast food, but it certainly adds a dash of danger to your burger. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

BK Japan's "Kuro Burger" (or "Black Burger") is apparently hitting restaurants there on Sept. 19, according to promotional images shown on the restaurant's Facebook page. The "goth-like" burger, as the Guardian calls it, will feature beef patties coated in black pepper, black cheese and buns made with bamboo charcoal, and an onion-garlic topping made with (wait for it) squid ink, Narinari.com reports via Kotaku. The chain says it's the third time it has released black-themed burgers and that consumers have generally given them a "favorable reception" in the past, notes the Guardian. Advance buzz on Twitter seems split: Reaction ranges from mildly curious ("hmm id like to try this") and overly excited ("Holy crap!

The burgers will—perhaps predictably—only be around for a limited time, notes Kotaku.
summarize: PROTECTIVE UMBRELLA      Liu Han and his accomplices spent their illegal gains on firearms, knives and vehicles to help offenders escape, hide out and to cheat the law. He awarded bonuses to the lieutenants who did his evil bidding, gave them houses, money and drugs. He bought political capital and built a "protective umbrella" through bribery.      It is not hard to see how the brothers survived successive inquiries during their ten years of lawlessness. Every failed investigation shored up their influence and power until the two were a formidable force in local political, commercial and judicial circles.      Alongside the Liu brothers in the dock are three former local political and legal officials: Liu Xuejun, former political commissar of the Deyang public security bureau's criminal police contingent, Lyu Bin, director of Deyang public security bureau's equipment and finance department, and Liu Zhongwei, deputy chief prosecutor of the people's procuratorate in Shifang City.      According to Liu Wei, aside from financial favors, he would also accommodate the trio at his own club where the four would do drugs and party together. In return, Liu Xuejun buried case files and Liu Han helped him be promoted however he could. Liu Xuejun also ran interference after homicides, while Liu Zhongwei and Lyu Bin provided firearms and ammunition.      The Liu brothers forged a sophisticated network of crooked officials through bribery, helping with promotions and providing drugs. Investigations were interrupted, evidence was destroyed and absurdly light penalties were dished out.      For example, in May 2003, Sun Huajun, a member of Liu Han's circle, was arrested by the police in illegal possession of firearms. He was prosecuted, but quickly reprieved, only 15 days after his arrest.      Civilians in China are banned from possessing guns, ammunition, explosives and certain types of knives. Minor violations lead to jail sentences of three to 10 years. Major violations can lead to the death penalty.      Liu Han is widely connected to government officials in his search for an ever more powerful "umbrella", sometimes meant taking advantage of the contacts between his wife and spouses of those officials.      "Liu Han is extremely generous in his dealings with government officials. He is willing to pay, and he knows how to cater to their likes," said right-hand man Sun.      "Liu Han would take me to dine with them, and offer them gifts such as gold or jade items worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan," said Liu's ex-wife Yang Xue. "Sometimes he would deliberately lose when gambling, just to bribe them."      Yang Xue is also being prosecuted in a separate case.      As a result of Liu Han's growing economic prowess, his connections expanded from Guanghan and Deyang to Mianyang, Chengdu and even Beijing, according to Yang and other core members of the gang.      He gained access to officials at even higher levels when he was elected to the standing committee of the Sichuan provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and spent an enormous amount trying to corrupt them.      Under this "umbrella", Liu Han's organization accessed greater economic interests, and Liu himself obtained a variety of political positions.      He was a member of the Sichuan provincial committee of the CPPCC for three consecutive terms. Right-hand man Sun was a deputy to the Sichuan provincial People's Congress. Liu Wei, a thug in Guanghan, became an Olympic Torch bearer in 2008.      Liu Han's powerful connections gave him certain control over local government appointments and promotions.      In 2000, he proposed a tourist project at Mount Siguniang in Xiaojin County, but the plan was rejected by Ge, a county chief. Ge was swiftly transferred away from Xiaojin and Liu Han's project got underway.      In 2007, a truck owned by Liu Wei's Guanghan gravel business was stopped for overloading. The man who stopped the truck, Lianshan Township party committee secretary Jiao, was demoted and transferred three months later.      According to a Guanghan official who refused to be named, Liu Han wields a lot of power in the promotion of local officials.      "Liu Han has money, connections, guns, and lieutenants willing to kill for him. Everyone is afraid of him. Once he is offended, you either die or lose your job," said Wen Xiangzhuo, a member of Liu's gang.      There was no shortage of people willing to do Liu's bidding. Local officials sought promotion, and gangsters toed the line because Liu could fix their troubles.      For more than ten years, Liu Han's bloc has brought tremendous psychological intimidation to bear on Sichuan society. Victims did not dare voice their concerns. Law enforcement officials turned pale at the mention of his name and kept well out of his way.      Even now, when police investigated in Sichuan, people with inside knowledge trembled and were reluctant to talk. At one victim's house, police went great lengths to persuade the family to cooperate, while they repeatedly demanded the police to keep the visit secret, afraid of Liu Han's retribution, even from behind prison walls.      All these obstacles do not deter the Party and the government. During a meeting on political and legal affairs last month, President Xi Jinping ordered law enforcers to "carry the sword of equality and scales of justice" and to defend social justice and equality, however they could.      Even with Liu's case under intense scrutiny by central authorities, it took a year of painstaking investigation under the direct command of the Ministry of Public Security before the gang was busted and its key members seized, after more than 20 years of alleged evil.      As the news broke, local people celebrated with fire crackers; perhaps a new beginning on a par with the lunar New Year.      "Now that Liu Han and Liu Wei have been arrested, merchants can finally do businesses as they will, and Guanghan will be stable for years to come," said a resident on condition of anonymity.      With the case now before the courts, the truth about the real Liu Han behind the billionaire facade awaits final exposure.      The downfall of the Han gang is a prime example of central authorities' commitment to fight corruption and defend social justice.      The law does not bend to any individual's will or words. ||||| Photo      A Chinese tycoon and his brother have been sentenced to death for murder and running a “mafia-style” gang that engaged in a two-decade crime spree, accumulating a business empire amounting to more than $6 billion.      Liu Han, 48, and his younger brother, Liu Wei, were sentenced on Friday by a court in the central province of Hubei, with the punishment announced on China Central Television. The two were at the apex of a gang of 36 people charged with crimes including intentional injury and the murders of eight people. Three other gang members were also sentenced to death, with the rest handed sentences including life imprisonment and suspended death penalties, the provincial government reported on its news website.      Mr. Liu’s arrest in March of last year had international implications because he was in talks to buy an Australian mining company, Sundance Resources. The deal collapsed the following month. In 2009, his flagship company, Sichuan Hanlong Group, bought a controlling stake in another Australian mining company, Moly Mines. The Sichuan Hanlong Group was also punished, with a fine of almost $50 million, for providing false information to banks to obtain loans and other infractions, the state news agency Xinhua reported on its microblog site.            #Chinese court Fri sentenced former mining tycoon Liu Han to death, 1st trials of 36 mafia-like gang led by Liu. //t.co/CqNaHagyT2 — People’s Daily,China (@PDChina) 23 May 14      Prosecutors painted a picture of two brothers who would stop at nothing to build their wealth, which amounted to 40 billion renminbi, or $6.4 billion, Xinhua reported in February, when the gang was charged. The brothers’ business operations ranged from gambling to construction materials.      “Liu Han and Liu Wei were deeply evil,’’ the People’s Intermediary Court in Xianning said in announcing the sentence. “Their means were extremely cruel, their impact on society was extremely bad.”      Liu Wei, a torchbearer for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is accused of ordering the killings of three people in 2009 at an open-air tea house in his hometown of Guanghan, in the southwestern province of Sichuan, Xinhua reported in February. He went into hiding after the suspects arrested for the killings said he was responsible. Last March, he was arrested, with Xinhua saying he helped his older brother evade capture.      In rounding up the gang members last year, the police said they confiscated three grenades, 20 guns, 677 bullets and more than 100 knives, Xinhua reported in February. The Liu brothers and their associates had fleets of cars including Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and Ferraris, Xinhua said.      While the charges and verdict were extraordinary in themselves, Liu Han’s possible ties to the family of the former Chinese security chief, Zhou Yongkang, raised the profile of the trial. In February, the respected Chinese business magazine Caixin reported that Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhou’s son, Zhou Bin, had a business relationship in Sichuan, where Zhou Yongkang served as the top official from 1999 to 2002. Zhou Bin helped Mr. Liu overcome regulatory obstacles in acquiring a power company, and Mr. Liu had bought a tourism property from Mr. Zhou, the magazine reported. Several other Sichuan business executives and former officials tied to Zhou Yongkang’s family are also facing prosecution.      Zhou Yongkang was detained amid a graft investigation in December, The New York Times reported. Should he be charged and tried, he would be the highest-ranking Chinese leader to be prosecuted for corruption since the Communist Party came to power in 1949.

There was Liu the philanthropist. Liu the political adviser. Liu the charitable.      The other life, however, was darker: Liu the warlord, the murderer, the calculating tactician who would destroy anyone who got in his way.      On Friday, the latter life was in the spotlight in central China, where a court sentenced Liu and his brother to death for leading a “mafia-style” gang that authorities say deployed 36 agents, murdered nine people and amassed $6 billion in two decades. “Liu Han and Liu Wei were deeply evil,” the court said in its sentence. “Their means were extremely cruel, their impact on society was extremely bad.”      The sentence showed the seriousness of President Xi Jinping’s anti-graft campaign as well as the sometimes blurry line between crime and business among some of China’s elite. Since Xi came to power in November 2012, he has charged several high-level officials with corruption and discouraged overt extravagance among party elite.      And it would have been difficult to find a more ostentatious billionaire than 48-year-old Liu, who was once the chairman of Hanlong Group, one of the largest enterprises in southwest China, and came close to buying Australia’s Sundance Resources.      #Chinese court Fri sentenced former mining tycoon Liu Han to death, 1st trials of 36 mafia-like gang led by Liu. pic.twitter.com/CqNaHagyT2 — People’s Daily,China (@PDChina) May 23, 2014      According to China’s state news agency, Xinhua, the tycoon’s “criminal empire has amassed nearly [$6.4 billion] of assets and hundreds of cars, including Rolls-Royces, Bentleys, Ferraris.” Under the subtitle “from petty thug to billionaire,” Xinhua’s report said police discovered 20 guns, 677 bullets, 2,163 shotgun cartridges and more than 100 knives — an unusual cache given the strictness of China’s gun laws.      “Liu Han and his accomplices spent their illegal gains on firearms, knives and vehicles to help offenders escape, hide out and to cheat the law,” the report said. “He awarded bonuses to the lieutenants who did his evil bidding, gave them houses, money and drugs. He bought political capital and built a ‘protective umbrella’ through bribery.”      Most outside observers agree the charges, the press accounts — and now the sentence — are extraordinary. Even more so are Liu’s alleged connections to Zhou Yongkang, China’s powerful former security chief who is rumored to be under investigation for corruption.      Xinhua alleged the mining tycoon, the 148th richest person in China, has been rotten for a long time. Born in 1965, he climbed his way to the top through opportunism, bogus deals and “flagrant crimes and killings.”      “With carrots and sticks, Liu Han established absolute authority in the gang,” Xinhua said. “Blood cleared the path for Liu Han’s businesses and surrounded by a cabal of ferocious gangsters, the wealth of Liu snowballed. … Those who hesitated to kill were expelled.”      By the time he arrived in Australia, he’d already made billions, money seen in the parties he threw, according to Reuters. He wore a diamond-encrusted, Franck Muller watch and ordered bottles of French wine that cost $12,000. On one night, he reportedly spent $100,000 on wine during one meal.      But Chinese investigators, meanwhile, were watching. They first focused on Liu following a brazen, open-air teahouse shootout in Guanghan on Jan. 10, 2009. Xinhua said several men climbed out of a car that rolled up to the front of the establishment and fired 10 shots. As the shooters escaped, three people fell to the ground, dead. “It was so fast,” a witness said. “It was like watching a movie.” Liu Wei was allegedly behind the killings.      And from there, investigators gradually peeled back the many layers of the brothers’ criminality, charges which came to a head in a courtroom Friday morning. The verdict said the brothers and their group had “in an organized fashion obtained financial gains via illegal activities,” “committed murder,” and facilitated “cover-ups and collusion of government employees.”      Liu denied the charges. |||||	– Two Chinese brothers have been convicted of murder and running a "mafia-style" gang over two decades—and they'll pay the price with their lives. Billionaire Liu Han, 48, and his brother were leaders of a 36-person gang charged with at least eight murders, Chinese media report, per the New York Times. Liu owned one of the largest enterprises in southwest China, the Washington Post adds, and the brothers amassed a business empire worth some $6.4 billion in sometimes less than savory ways, it was alleged: Xinhua reports Liu Han "awarded bonuses to the lieutenants who did his evil bidding" and "bought political capital and built a 'protective umbrella' through bribery." The People's Intermediary Court did not mince words in announcing the sentence: "Liu Han and Liu Wei were deeply evil. Their means were extremely cruel, their impact on society was extremely bad." As for the significance and implications of the sentence, the Post notes that it shows "the seriousness of President Xi Jinping’s anti-graft campaign as well as the sometimes blurry line between crime and business among some of China’s elite." BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie adds that Liu Han reportedly has ties to former security chief Zhou Yongkang, and says the case could lead to charges against him. Should a trial come to pass, he would be the highest-ranking leader involved in a political corruption case since the Communist Party took power.

summarize:      A pair of island foxes, which have made a quick comeback from the brink of extinction. (Photo courtesy of Chuck Graham via U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)      The Channel Islands, off the coast of Southern California, are the only home of a species of tiny fox that looks like a plush toy. How the island foxes got there from the mainland is up for debate — maybe with Native Americans, maybe on storm debris. But fossils show they’ve lived on the islands for many thousands of years.      Along the way, these descendants of mainland gray foxes evolved into four-pound “island dwarves” whose size was better suited to survival in their isolated habitat with its slim resources. Though they are omnivores the size of a cat, in this environment they were long the top predators. They ate lizards, birds, deer mice and plants.      [The feds want to launch peanut butter drone strikes to save endangered ferrets]      The foxes’ decline started when 19th-century settlers brought livestock to the islands and some of their pigs escaped. The feral swine attracted golden eagles, which dined on piglets and saw the little foxes as excellent snacks. The petite canines had never evolved defensive instincts, and predator was now prey.      “They have this naive, adorable little personality,” said Christina Boser, the Nature Conservancy’s island fox ecologist. “They’re not really scared of people,” let alone raptors, she said.      The foxes on one island, Santa Catalina, were also ravaged by canine distemper brought by dogs. In this out-of-whack ecosystem, the foxes’ numbers on the four islands plummeted to fewer than 200 by the late 1990s, a drop of 90 percent. In 2004, they were declared federally endangered.      But just 12 years later, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Thursday announced that the foxes of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands had so rebounded that they were being taken off the endangered species list. That makes them the 37th species ever removed from the list due to recovery — and the protagonists of the fastest mammal recovery in the Endangered Species Act’s 43-year history. The Santa Catalina island fox was downlisted to threatened.      “It shows that we can do recovery,” Dan Ashe, director of Fish and Wildlife, said in an interview this week, adding that the Obama administration has delisted 19 species. “Here you have an example of one that, for mammals, is getting off the list in record time due to a lot of collaboration.”            An island fox. (Photo courtesy of Dan Richards/National Park Service)      Ashe was referring to critical comments about the Endangered Species Act, one of which is that many plants and animals seem to be permanent residents on the list. Other detractors say it takes too long for at-risk species to get on the list, a case biologists make in a new study that found the process takes an average of 12.1 years.      [What Harambe’s death means for a critically endangered species of gorilla]      The island ecosystem that facilitated the foxes’ rapid downfall also made their recovery simpler than it might be for mainland species. They were also beneficiaries of intense cooperation between groups including the National Park Service, which manages five of the islands, and the Nature Conservancy, which owns most of Santa Cruz.      The recovery effort involved trapping and captive-breeding the foxes on the islands, which are 12 to 70 miles off coast, so as not to expose them to mainland parasites. Between 2005 and 2006, more than 5,000 feral pigs were killed using helicopters, snipers, traps and dogs, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2007. The predatory golden eagles were trapped and relocated to the mainland. Bald eagles, which had lived on the islands before being wiped out by DDT poisoning, were brought back. (Fortunately for the foxes, those eagles like to eat fish.)      By 2008, more than 230 captive-bred foxes had been released into the wild, Ashe said, and they reproduced magnificently. Today, there are nearly 6,000 foxes on the four islands.            An island fox pup that once might have been a golden eagle’s snack. (A. Little/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)      Boser, who began working on Santa Cruz in 2006, said that there was a time when the traps she set for monitoring purposes hardly ever caught a fox.      “I was out there last week and put down 10 traps and caught nine foxes,” she said. Before, she added, “you took a picture with a fox, because this was a rare thing and this was exciting. Now you’re seeing them on the roads and the fields and all over the place.”      Today, Boser said, the biggest threat is disease. Although visitors are prohibited from bringing dogs to Santa Cruz, “we see dog poo on the beaches,” she said, so all the foxes must be vaccinated against rabies and canine distemper. Dogs are also the reason the Santa Catalina foxes are still listed as threatened — pooches are allowed there, so the chance of another epidemic remains, Fish and Wildlife said.      Boser called the foxes’ comeback “totally exciting,” but she said there’s more to be learned from the animals. Researchers have found that the foxes are the least genetically diverse reproductive species ever studied. Knowing more about how this affects their fitness in an isolated place with so few resources, Boser said, could hold lessons for mainland species that live in island-like habitats, such as the mountain lions of Los Angeles’ Santa Monica Mountains.

(Associated Press)      LOS ANGELES (AP) — Not long ago, foxes native to the Channel Islands off the California coast teetered on the edge of extinction.      They have rebounded to the point where U.S. wildlife officials on Thursday removed three subspecies of island fox from the roster of federally endangered species, hailing their comeback as the fastest recovery of any mammal listed under the Endangered Species Act.      The diminutive foxes that roam San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands were placed on the endangered list in 2004 after their populations were nearly wiped out by golden eagles.      Scientists credited the swift recovery to an effort to relocate predators and breed foxes in captivity so they can be reintroduced to the wild.      "We're ecstatic that we've reached this point so quickly," said Steve Henry, field supervisor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's office in Ventura.      About the size of a house cat, the island foxes — with their gray coats and reddish-brown ears — are only found on six of the eight Channel Islands where they have lived for thousands of years.      Populations have returned to self-sustaining levels ranging from an estimated 700 foxes on San Miguel Island to 2,100 foxes on Santa Cruz Island.      Centuries ago, ranchers and farmers imported nonnative animals such as pigs, cattle and sheep to the islands. Golden eagles migrated after native, fish-eating bald eagles were wiped out by the discharge of chemical DDT off the coast.      The golden eagles preyed on piglets and hunted foxes. By 2000, there were only 15 foxes each on San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands and 55 foxes on Santa Cruz Island.      The wildlife service partnered with the National Park Service, Nature Conservancy and Catalina Island Conservancy to hatch an aggressive plan that included moving golden eagles to Northern California, reintroducing bald eagles to the islands, vaccinating foxes and breeding them in captivity.      The effort was not without controversy. Thousands of pigs were shot and killed, angering animal rights groups. Wildlife officials said eliminating pigs was necessary to force golden eagles to forage elsewhere and help the foxes bounce back.      The islands' remoteness also played a key role in the foxes' resurgence, giving scientists better control over recovery efforts than if they happened on the mainland.      Years ago, "you would not have seen a fox. Now, you go out there and you don't have to wait very long before a fox crosses your path," said Scott Morrison of the Nature Conservancy, which co-owns Santa Cruz Island.      Funding for the yearslong recovery came from public and private sources and included volunteer time. Officials did not have an estimate of the overall cost but said the captive rearing and monitoring portions of the program cost about $20 million.      With the fox delisting, 19 animals and plants have been pulled from the endangered species list since President Barack Obama took office, more than previous administrations, wildlife service director Dan Ashe said.      The last U.S. mammal to be removed from the list in record time was the eastern Steller sea lion in 2013 after more than two decades. Since the Endangered Species Act passed in 1973, 37 species have recovered.      Biologists planned to monitor foxes on the northern Channel Islands by conducting periodic health checks and tagging select foxes with radio collars. Technician Stacy Baker used a tool Thursday to examine the teeth of a 3-year-old female fox on Santa Cruz Island. After giving it a clean bill of health, the fox scampered into the underbrush.      Foxes on Santa Catalina Island — a tourist destination — also are recovering but not as fast as their counterparts on the northern Channel Islands. Their numbers plummeted in the 1990s after an outbreak of canine distemper, likely brought over from the mainland.      Federal officials downgraded the status of the Catalina foxes from endangered to threatened because disease outbreak remains a concern.      ___      Reed Saxon contributed to this report from Santa Cruz Island.      ___      Follow the reporter on Twitter: @SciWriAlicia |||||	– The little island foxes of California are back, maybe for good. Three fox subspecies found only on the state's Channel Islands have made a big comeback since they were placed on the endangered species list in 2004 and have just been removed. No mammal on the list has made a faster recovery, reports AP. The foxes are only the size of house cats and had nearly been eradicated by golden eagles. How that happened illustrates an odd chain reaction: Those carnivorous eagles had been drawn to the islands in the 19th century when settlers brought livestock, the Washington Post explains. They feasted on piglets, then discovered the foxes—which had been on the islands for thousands of years—and all but wiped them out in the ensuing decades. The recovery plan had several components. Wildlife officials first moved the predator golden eagles to Northern California and re-introduced fish-eating bald eagles to the islands. They also bred foxes in captivity for release in the wild. Now an estimated 6,000 of the diminutive critters are back on the islands, up from the perilous figure of under 200 not too long ago. "We're ecstatic that we've reached this point so quickly," says a US Fish and Wildlife Service rep.

She suffered injuries serious enough that she had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital, where she later died with her parents by her side.      Students from the school have said that they believe the fight was over a boy.      "A lot of families were destroyed today," Wilmington Mayor Dennis Williams said.      City spokeswoman Alexandra Coppadge said there was a confrontation in the women's restroom at Howard High.      "Several female students were involved in a physical altercation at approximately 8:15 a.m. this morning, in a main floor girls bathroom, just at the time classes began for the day," the school district said in a statement hours after the attack.      Police said in a statement that officers were called to the high school around 8:20 a.m. Later Thursday afternoon, police said a school resource officer called EMS at 8:18 a.m. for a student with head and stomach pain, and within minutes, the call became a CPR in progress.      Police said the girl had been flown to A.I. DuPont Children's Hospital in critical condition.      An autopsy will be performed Friday and the investigation into the cause of death remains open.      Students who knew about the fight said it stemmed from a dispute over a boy.      Shauntea Bellamy cried as he sat outside the school after learning of the student's death. He worked with her as part of youth outreach programs and said she was set to volunteer in a summer program he organizes.      "It hurts when you know her personally and she's not one of my students who are out there in the streets like that," he said.

Two female students were taken to police headquarters for questioning about the assault.      Counseling services for students and families will be available at the high school in the coming days.      Friends said Amy Inita Joyner-Francis went into the bathroom at Howard High School of Technology around 8 a.m. Thursday. About a half hour later, the 16-year-old was taken out on a stretcher and flown to A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, where she later died.      No one in the state can remember the last time a student was killed inside a Delaware school. Officials from the state Department of Homeland Security, Department of Education, Attorney General's Office nor State Police keep that statistic.      “We know it is happening in the streets,” said the Rev. Sandra Ben, of Praying Ground Community Church in Wilmington. “But now we are talking about violence happening in a place that normally should be a safe haven.”      Police have not released the cause of death for the New Castle girl or any details about what happened inside the restroom. Detectives from the homicide and violent crimes unit interviewed several students considered persons of interest and two female students were taken to police headquarters for further questioning, Wilmington police Chief Bobby Cummings said.      Principal Stanley Spoor said they do not have any reason to believe weapons were used in the attack. School was dismissed late Thursday morning and will resume Friday with a shortened day to provide counseling services for students.      CLOSE Wilmington community members gathered outside of Howard High School of Technology during a vigil for Amy Inita Joyner-Francis, who died after being assaulted in a women's restroom at the school early Thursday morning. Daniel Sato/The News Journal      Hundreds of students, friends, neighbors and community activists attended a vigil outside the school Thursday night.      The crowd quietly reflected as prayers were recited; some in the group could be heard quietly sniffling. Toward the back, a ring of high school students looked on and talked quietly.      “I would have never thought something would have happened in the school,” said Raya Cooper, who has two teenage daughters and a son who graduated from Howard.      CLOSE A bathroom fight left a young girl dead at Howard High School in Wilmington, and on Friday her peers and teachers were forced to face it. Adam Duvernay/The News Journal      City Councilman Nnamdi Chukwuocha said fights among young women are not uncommon. Many programs are focused on young, black men in the city, but Chukwuocha said too often, organizations overlook the needs of young women.      "Some of the worst fights I've seen in the community have been with the females," Chukwuocha said. "We need to address the needs of the young women. As of right now, I don't think we're doing that."

"All I wanted to do with my friend was walk across the stage and get our diplomas," the 16-year-old said. "And now that dream is taken away because she's not there."      A Thursday night debate among Wilmington’s eight Democratic mayoral candidates hosted by The News Journal and WHYY at Howard High was postponed. The debate’s topic was public safety.      "My heart bleeds for the family," said Mayor Dennis P. Williams at a press conference at the high school. "Things like this shouldn't happen."      Dawkins and Kayla Futrell, also 16, said they talked to Amy Wednesday night and said Amy told them she was going into the bathroom on Thursday to “settle the beef.” Though they did not elaborate about the dispute, they did say it did not involve boys.      “This was like the first time that someone died over a fight,” Dawkins said. “Amy is a good girl who gets good grades who stays out of trouble. For them to fight, it’s just wow, a shocker for everybody.”      Nathaniel Kenyatta, a freshman at Howard High, said he is devastated by the loss of his friend who was easy to talk to. They met in their morning HVAC class, he said.      "She was very open," he said. "I feel bad for the people who have known her for years."      STORY: Wilmington mayoral debate canceled after assault      After the press conference, Cummings said he would not say what happened in the bathroom. He said there were no incidents that he knew of in the days leading up to the assault and Howard is not known as a violent school.      Last year, no violent felonies were reported at the school, though 14 incidents of fighting or disorderly conduct were, according to Department of Education. In the previous four years, there were no violent felonies.      School was just starting when the assault occurred and some students were already in class when the chaos broke out.      Kim Jenkins, of Edgemoor, was visiting a friend near the school when the friend received a text from her daughter, who is a student there.      "She said there was a riot at the school and the cops and ambulance all came," Jenkins said.      Police remained at the high school for hours after the attack.      Attorney General Matt Denn said he mentors a student at Howard every week and was supposed to be at the school on Thursday morning. But he was in Dover for a bill signing with Gov. Jack Markell.      "I've dealt with the details of a couple of dozen homicides, and they're all tragedies," Denn said. "But the brutal beating death of a child, allegedly at the hands of another child, in a school is shocking even to those of us whose daily work involves dealing with the aftermath of violence."      Community members are at a loss for what could have prompted this tragedy. East Side community activist Beverly Bell fought back tears Thursday while talking about Amy.      Though Bell doesn't have children or grandchildren at Howard, the 70-year-old said she feels for the parents and families who are now scared for their own children.      Schools must be a safe place, she said, with hall monitors and administrators ready to take action in situations like Thursday's assault.      "We've gotta have people in place to watch over our children," Bell said, "because when a parent sends a child to school, it's not to get a phone call that their child won't be coming home."      Mahkeib Booker, the founder of Black Lives Matter Wilmington, said tensions are high following the killing. Booker, whose daughter attends Howard High School and sat behind the victim in class, said he and the Wilmington Peacekeepers will host a vigil Friday evening.      “We want to keep the peace going into the weekend,” Booker said. “Because retaliation is always on the table in situations like these.”      CLOSE Donna Hope lives one block from Howard High School of Technology, and is a graduate of the school. She said adults should have intervened in the conflict between girls at the school before it turned deadly. Karl Baker/THE NEWS JOURNAL      Superintendent Victoria Gehrt said the death of the sophomore does not reflect negatively on safety in the school.      The high school enrolls about 935 students in grades 9 through 12, according to the state Department of Education, and offers 13 career programs. ​A school resource officer with the Wilmington Police Department is stationed at the school full time, police said.      News of the tragic death also reached downstate to the Legislature where Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington East, said on the floor of the Senate: "This morning we learned that the unimaginable happened to another young person in our state. We learned that another precious life, full of promise and wonder, was taken senselessly. And we learned that it happened at school – a place that should be a sanctuary for our students from the madness of the outside world."      She continued to call upon the Senate and the state to "redouble" efforts in school safety to ensure lives lost do not move from the street to schools.      "Today, we pray for this beautiful young soul and her family. We pray for the Howard High School community," Rose Henry said. "And we pray for a City that has lost too many of its young people at the hands of senseless violence."

According to the News Journal, multiple students are being investigated as persons of interest in the attack, and two girls have been taken to police headquarters. A spokesperson for the mayor's office wouldn't comment on what caused the fight but tells ABC News it wasn't gang-related. Police were called to the school shortly before 8:20am, and the unnamed sophomore was transported to the hospital, where she died. Her cause of death has not been confirmed. "My heart’s broken," NBC quotes mayor Dennis Williams as saying at a press conference. "Things like this shouldn’t happen." Students were dismissed for the day following the incident, and a mayoral debate on public safety that was scheduled for Thursday evening at the high school has been canceled. The school district's superintendent called the student's death an "unbelievable tragedy" while maintaining that Howard is a "safe school." There were seven violent felonies reported at the high school last year after only three total in the previous four years. A fellow student and friend described the victim as "very open." "I feel bad for the people who have known her for years," he tells the News Journal.

The move was an expected response to a vote in the Republican-controlled House Thursday citing Mr. Holder with contempt of Congress. Under the law, it is the responsibility of the U.S. attorney for ... ||||| In this file photo, Attorney General Eric Holder speaks to reporters following his meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 19, 2012. (Susan Walsh/AP)      The Justice Department has told House leaders that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.’s decision to withhold certain documents about a flawed gun operation from Congress is not a crime and he will not be prosecuted for contempt of Congress.      Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole explained the decision, which was expected, in a letter to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). The letter was released publicly Friday, just over a week after President Obama invoked executive privilege to withhold the documents.      In his letter, Cole said the decision not to prosecute Holder conforms to long-standing Justice Department practice in both Democratic and Republican administrations.      In May 1984, Theodore B. Olson, then assistant attorney general, wrote that U.S. attorneys are not required to refer congressional contempt charges to a grand jury or prosecute an executive branch official “who carries out the President’s instruction to invoke the President’s claim of executive privilege before a committee.”      In July 2007 and February 2008, Attorney General Michael Mukasey cited the Olson analysis in letters to House Democratic leaders, informing them that Justice would decline to press charges against White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten and White House counsel Harriet E. Miers, who were held in contempt after failing to appear before the House Judiciary Committee.      “Consistent with this uniform position and practice, the Department has determined that the Attorney General’s response to this subpoena issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform does not constitute a crime, and therefore the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,” Cole wrote.      On Thursday, Holder became the first attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress after he withheld internal deliberative documents that Republican lawmakers demanded as part of an investigation into the “Fast and Furious” gunrunning operation.      The Justice Department’s decision concerns only criminal action, so the House can still pursue civil litigation against Holder. On Thursday, the House voted to authorize civil action, which paves the way for a federal court challenge to Obama’s decision to invoke executive privilege.      Republicans dismissed Cole’s decision and said the U.S. attorney for the District — who technically has the authority to prosecute Holder — should be able to do so, noting that he is already leading an investigation into the possible leak of classified information by Obama administration officials to reporters.      “If he’s neutral enough to independently look for leaks from the administration and not be conflicted, then he has to be equally independent in weighing the statute” approved by the House, said House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who is leading the “Fast and Furious” investigation.      Staff writer Ed O’Keefe contributed to this report. ||||| The Justice Department declared Friday that Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to withhold information about a bungled gun-tracking operation from Congress does not constitute a crime and he won't be prosecuted for contempt of Congress.

(Associated Press)      The House voted Thursday afternoon to find Holder in criminal and civil contempt for refusing to turn over the documents. President Barack Obama invoked his executive privilege authority and ordered Holder not to turn over materials about executive branch deliberations and internal recommendations.      In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, the department said that it will not bring the congressional contempt citation against Holder to a federal grand jury and that it will take no other action to prosecute the attorney general. Dated Thursday, the letter was released Friday.      Deputy Attorney General James Cole said the decision is in line with long-standing Justice Department practice across administrations of both political parties.      "We will not prosecute an executive branch official under the contempt of Congress statute for withholding subpoenaed documents pursuant to a presidential assertion of executive privilege," Cole wrote.      In its letter, the department relied in large part on a Justice Department legal opinion crafted during Republican Ronald Reagan's presidency.      Frederick Hill, the spokesman for Rep. Darrell Issa, said it is regrettable that "the political leadership of the Justice Department" is taking that position. Issa, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman, is leading the effort to get the material related to Operation Fast and Furious.      Although the House voted Thursday to find Holder in criminal and civil contempt, Republicans probably are still a long way from obtaining documents they want for their inquiry into Operation Fast and Furious, a flawed gun-tracking investigation focused on Phoenix-area gun shops by Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.      The criminal path is now closed and the civil route through the courts would not be resolved anytime soon.      "This is pure politics," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.      "Remarkably the chairman of the committee involved here has asserted that he has no evidence that the attorney general knew of Operation Fast and Furious or did anything but take the right action when he learned of it.      "No evidence, so if you have no evidence as he has stated now about the White House and the attorney general, what else could this be but politics?"      More than 100 Democrats walked out of the House chamber to boycott the first of two contempt votes, saying Republicans were more interested in shameful election-year politics than documents.      Republicans demanded the documents for an ongoing investigation, but their arguments focused more on the need for closure for the family of slain Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Two guns identified by the Fast and Furious tracking operation were found near his body after a shootout in Arizona.      Democrats promised closure as well, but said a less-partisan Republican investigation was the only way to get it.      Adding to the emotion of the day, the family of the slain agent issued a statement backing the Republicans.      "The Terry family takes no pleasure in the contempt vote against Attorney General Eric Holder. Such a vote should not have been necessary. The Justice Department should have released the documents related to Fast and Furious months ago," the statement said.      The contempt votes happened on the day that Obama's health care law survived in the Supreme Court, prompting some Democrats to speculate that the votes were scheduled to be overwhelmed by news stories about the ruling.      About five hours after the court ruled, with news sites flooded with information about the health care ruling, the House voted 255-67 to declare Holder in criminal contempt.      A second vote of 258-95 held Holder in civil contempt and authorized the House to file a lawsuit.      In past cases, courts have been reluctant to settle disputes between the executive and legislative branches of government.      The issue became more complicated when Obama invoked a broad form of executive privilege, a legal doctrine designed to keep private certain communications of executive branch agencies.      Issa's committee will consult with the House counsel's office about a court challenge to the administration's decision not to cooperate, spokesman Frederick Hill said.      The documents were written after Fast and Furious was shut down. The subpoena covered a 10-month period from February 2011, as the Justice Department expressed growing concern that the Fast and Furious operation had employed a risky investigative tactic known as "gun-walking." In early December 2011, the department finally acknowledged that the initial denial of gun-walking was in error.      Republicans said the contempt citations were necessary because Holder refused to hand over documents that could explain why the Obama administration took 10 months to acknowledge the gun-walking.      In Fast and Furious, ATF agents abandoned the agency's usual practice of intercepting all weapons they believed to be illicitly purchased, often as soon as they were taken out of gun shops. Instead, the goal of the tactic known as "gun-walking" was to track such weapons to high-level arms traffickers, who had long eluded prosecution, and to dismantle their networks.      Gun-walking long has been barred by Justice Department policy, but federal agents in Arizona experimented with it in at least two investigations during the George W. Bush administration before Operation Fast and Furious. These experiments came as the department was under widespread criticism that the old policy of arresting every suspected low-level "straw purchaser" was failing to stop tens of thousands of guns from reaching Mexico, more than 68,000 in the last five years. A straw purchaser conceals that he is buying guns for others.      Fast and Furious identified more than 2,000 weapons suspected of being illicitly purchased. But agents lost track of many of the guns. Some 1,400 of them have yet to be recovered. ||||| AP Photo Close      White House press secretary Jay Carney said Friday that there is a longstanding precedent against prosecuting Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt — despite a recommendation from Congress.      "It is an established principle, dating back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, that the Justice Department does not pursue prosecution in a contempt case when the President has asserted executive privilege," Carney told reporters.      "The assertion of executive privilege makes the contempt matter moot, if you will. I mean, I’m not a lawyer, so I’m probably not using quite the precise language. But it is my understanding, and I would refer you to the Justice Department, that dating back to the administration of President Reagan that prosecutions will not take place under this -- in this circumstance," Carney said.      The Republican-controlled House cited Holder for contempt Thursday for failure to turn over documents related to a gunrunning operation within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The White House declared the same documents protected under the doctrine of executive privilege earlier this month. Seventeen Democrats crossed the aisle to vote with the GOP, in the first instance of a sitting cabinet member being handed a contempt citation.      That citation is now in the hands of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen — a Justice Department employee appointed by President Obama who answers to Holder.      "Let’s just be clear, as I know all of you recognize, that this is pure politics -- pure politics," Carney said, referring to what he called extensive cooperation between the DOJ and Republicans on Capitol Hill.      UPDATE: In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner's office, the Department of Justice confirms they will not prosecute. |||||	– The House may think Eric Holder is criminally contempt, but the Justice Department thinks the House can go fly a kite. The department informed John Boehner today that it won't prosecute its boss on the contempt charges, reports the Washington Post. The letter was drafted yesterday, the same day the House voted against Holder. The attorney general is in the clear, the letter asserts, because President Obama invoked executive privilege in the spat over documents related to the Fast and Furious case. The matter isn't over, though. The Justice Department action closes the criminal contempt case, but the House also cited Holder for civil contempt, notes AP. That means Darrell Issa and his committee can still go to court to try to get the documents they want, a legal fight that could take years to resolve, notes the Wall Street Journal.
