summarize: AUSTIN (KXAN) — Sabotage or Mother Nature?      That’s what the Landscape Services Department at the University of Texas at Austin is wondering after maroon bluebonnets popped up in the flower bed around the UT Tower this season.      “Recently, the department installed a new landscape and planted a lot of new bluebonnets across the campus, but the UT Tower bed is the only one that the maroon ones showed up,” said Markus Hogue, UT’s irrigation and water conservation coordinator. “Which leads us to believe someone purposefully placed them there.”      While no one has fessed up to planting the maroon seeds in the flower bed, rumors have been circulating that someone at Texas A&M knows something.      Several years ago, A&M researchers were able to develop a maroon bluebonnet.      Even though the flowers are pretty, Hogue says they will start collecting the seeds from the maroon bluebonnets to keep them from spreading. If you head out there now, most of the maroon bluebonnets have faded to a pink.      The rivalry between A&M and UT doesn’t end with the flowers.      At the beginning of the spring season, someone sprayed a weed killer on the LBJ lawn to spell out A&M.      “If they’re planting beautiful flowers, it’s better than killing the grass to spell out A&M,” said Hogue with a laugh.      Maroon bluebonnet to Lady Bird Johnson Royal Blue bluebonnet      While developing the maroon bluebonnet, Texas A&M researchers also developed an even bluer bluebonnet, the Lady Bird Johnson Royal Blue bluebonnet.      “This bluebonnet we found when our researchers were looking for a selection of a maroon bluebonnet, which is especially nice for Texas A&M,” said Daphne Richards, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service horticulture agent. “We saw some really great blue ones in the same field where some really vibrant maroon ones were growing.”      It took years of cross-breeding the bluebonnet with itself to get the genetics to stick. Now, the selection is a richer blue with more flowers.      The flower did so well in state-wide tests that it was designated a Texas Superstar. A Texas Superstar plant must be beautiful, perform well and propagate easily.      To find out where you can see wildflowers, TxDOT has an interactive map where you can see there the flowers are blooming. ||||| UT suspects sabotage after A&M-created; maroon flowers pop up near tower                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Photo: Hiro Horikoshi, The University Of Texas At Austin Image 1 of / 92 Caption Close Image 1 of 92 The suspicious bluebonnets started to fade at the University of Texas at Austin.

Wildflowers, such as Bluebonnets, Drummond Phlox, Indian Blankets, Indian Paintbrush and Mexican Hats are planted by the Harris County Flood Control District for very practical purposes. Aside from beautifying the local landscape, a carpet of wildflowers can offset the first mowing cycle, saving the District's maintenance dollars for other needed projects and preventing tons of cut organic materials from entering our channels. Wildflowers also provide sustainable landscape and wildlife habitat. So, not only does the public benefit in many ways, but so do the creatures that depend on the local waterways for survival.

Maroon bluebonnets are taking over flowerbeds below the school's iconic tower. Officials fear their landscape has been infiltrated by longtime rival Aggies.      "There were just a few at first but now there's much more," said Markus Hogue, program coordinator for UT Irrigation and Water Conservation.      Hogue said his team had planted regular bluebonnet seeds all over the campus. It's only in the beds below the tower that the maroon ones are showing, leading him to believe that they were planted there deliberately.      "When we started seeing the maroon, I started researching it more, (that) led me to believe that it was more likely these seeds were created at A&M and brought over here," Hogue said.      Insert dramatic music here.      Over at the Texas A&M campus, horticulturalists confirmed Thursday that maroon-bonnet seeds were indeed bred by them after researchers spotted a few occurring naturally in the Texas countryside.      "They took red ones and isolated them, and continued to select them until there was only maroon left," said Skip Richter from A&M's agrilife extension center in Harris County.      Richter is just one of thousands of A&M scientists and specialists all over the state, leading some to suggest that they had plenty of opportunity to slip onto the UT campus, perhaps under cover of darkness, to spread their maroon interlopers.      Richter said he didn't know anything about that, but he said it is likely that someone did plant them deliberately.      "Somebody scattered the seed probably," said Richter. "You wouldn't have a bunch of one color sprouting up (otherwise)," he said, undoubtedly smirking.      Bluebonnets also come in white and pink but if they are put with blue ones all would naturally return to blue over time, according to Richter. A Texas flag once created out of different colored bluebonnets has now turned back to blue.      At UT, the opposite is happening. More maroon ones are appearing. It's led to much consternation from some students.      "Some find it cute," said Hogue. "Others say if they get too much they want them removed."      Hogue's team is preparing to stop the rival breed in its tracks by cutting off seed cases with scissors before they can propogate.      At A&M, though, the controversy has led to much hilarity.      Richter said the school also bred special maroon carrots, and is quick to point out that "God chose to put a maroon gene in (the bluebonnet family), but there ain't no orange one." |||||	– There's a devious plot afoot, or, as the Houston Chronicle cheekily puts it, "a scandal of potentially epic proportions." The University of Texas in Austin has noticed some maroon bluebonnets popping up in flowerbeds beneath the UT Tower, a place where only traditional bluebonnets (that is, blue ones) have been planted. So what's behind the strange growth? The leading theory: sabotage, courtesy of Texas A&M, which confirmed it was indeed the one to breed maroon-bonnet seeds. Says the head of the UT team that handles the school's plantings, it's "likely these seeds were created at A&M and brought over here." An A&M horticulturalist says it probably was an intentional planting, but professes to have no knowledge of any such plot. He notes, however, "God chose to put a maroon gene in (the bluebonnet family), but there ain't no orange one." UT can take solace in the fact that when planted with blue ones, white and pink bluebonnets tend to become blue over time, and KXAN notes some of the maroon ones have already started to turn pink. UT plans to further squash the maroon variety by cutting off seed cases to halt the spread. (Click to read about how a flower shortage might have doomed the mighty woooly mammoth.)
summarize: Today is a big day for Yahoo! This is the email that I sent to Yahoos around the world today. Given the interest around our journey to this point, I wanted to share more about today’s announcement. –Marissa            Dear Yahoos,            Moments ago, we announced an agreement with Verizon to acquire Yahoo’s operating business. This culminates a rigorous, thorough process over many months, and yields a great outcome for the company. Today’s announcement not only brings us an important step toward separating Yahoo’s operating business from our Asian asset equity stakes, it also presents exciting opportunities to accelerate Yahoo’s transformation. Among the many entities that showed interest in Yahoo, Verizon believed most in the immense value we’ve created, and in what a combination could bring our users, our advertisers, and our partners.      This is a good moment to reflect on Yahoo’s journey to date.      Yahoo is a company that changed the world. Before Yahoo, the Internet was a government research project. Yahoo humanized and popularized the web, email, search, real-time media, and more.      What really sets Yahoo apart is the shared passion to create great products for our 1B+ users, and in doing so, transforming the world for the better. You can clearly see that spirit, that commitment, that fight in the work we’ve done together over the past few years. We set out to transform this company – and we’ve made incredible progress. We counteracted many of the tectonic shifts of declining legacy businesses, and built a Yahoo that is unequivocally stronger, nimbler, and more modern. We tripled our mobile base to over 600 million monthly users, we invested in and built Mavens from basically zero in 2011 into $1.6B of GAAP Revenue in 2015, we streamlined and modernized every aspect of our consumer products, and, with Gemini and BrightRoll, we dramatically improved our advertiser products. This only scratches the surface of what we’ve achieved… and we all know how much hard work it took to get here.      It’s because of that hard work and resilience, that Yahoo will realize amazing opportunities in its next chapter.      This sale is not only an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo, it is also a great opportunity for Yahoo to build further distribution and accelerate our work in mobile, video, native advertising, and social. As one of the largest wireless and cable companies in the world, Verizon opens the door to extensive distribution opportunities. With more than 100 million wireless customers, a shared view of the importance of mobile and video ad tech, a deep content focus through AOL, Verizon brings clear synergies to the table. And with their aggressive aims to grow global audience to 2B users and $20B in revenue within the mobile-media business by 2020, Yahoo’s products and brand will be central to achieving these goals. Joining forces with AOL and Verizon will help us achieve tremendous scale on mobile. Imagine the distribution challenges we will solve, the scale we will achieve, the products we will build, and the advertisers we will reach now with Mavens – it’s incredibly compelling.      The strategic process has created a lot of uncertainty, but our incredibly loyal and dedicated employee base has stepped up to every challenge along the way. Through the first half of the year, we met our operational goals and overachieved on plan. But, further, there are things that you cannot measure, like the passion of the people behind the products. The teams here have not only built incredible products and technologies, but have built Yahoo into one of the most iconic, and universally well-liked companies in the world. One that continues to impact the lives of more than a billion people. I’m incredibly proud of everything that we’ve achieved, and I’m incredibly proud of our team. For me personally, I’m planning to stay. I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you. It’s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter.      As we work to close this agreement in Q1 2017, it’s more important than ever that we come together as one global team to continue executing on our strategic plan through the remainder of the year. We have delivered the first half of the year with pride, achieving our goals. Now, it is up to us to make Yahoo’s final quarters as an independent company count.      Yahoo is a company that changed the world. Now, we will continue to, with even greater scale, in combination with Verizon and AOL.      Thanks,      Marissa      Important Additional Information and Where to Find It.

Verizon to acquire Yahoo’s operating business            Transaction will create a new rival in mobile media technology reaching over 1B users* with a roster of the world’s most beloved brands      BASKING RIDGE, NJ, and SUNNYVALE, Calif. – July 25, 2016 – Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) today announce they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Verizon will acquire Yahoo’s operating business for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments.      Yahoo informs, connects and entertains a global audience of more than 1 billion monthly active users** – including 600 million monthly active mobile users*** – through its search, communications and digital content products. Yahoo also connects advertisers with target audiences through a streamlined advertising technology stack that combines the power of their data, content and technology.      Lowell McAdam, Verizon Chairman and CEO, said: “Just over a year ago we acquired AOL to enhance our strategy of providing a cross-screen connection for consumers, creators and advertisers. The acquisition of Yahoo will put Verizon in a highly competitive position as a top global mobile media company, and help accelerate our revenue stream in digital advertising.”      Yahoo will be integrated with AOL under Marni Walden, EVP and President of the Product Innovation and New Businesses organization at Verizon.      Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, said: “Yahoo is a company that has changed the world, and will continue to do so through this combination with Verizon and AOL. The sale of our operating business, which effectively separates our Asian asset equity stakes, is an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo. This transaction also sets up a great opportunity for Yahoo to build further distribution and accelerate our work in mobile, video, native advertising and social.”      Mayer added, “Yahoo and AOL popularized the Internet, email, search and real-time media. It’s poetic to be joining forces with AOL and Verizon as we enter our next chapter focused on achieving scale on mobile. We have a terrific, loyal, experienced and quality team, and I couldn’t be prouder of our achievements to date, including building our new lines of business to $1.6 billion in GAAP revenue in 2015. I’m excited to extend our momentum through this transaction.”      Tim Armstrong, CEO of AOL, said: “Our mission at AOL is to build brands people love, and we will continue to invest in and grow them. Yahoo has been a long-time investor in premium content and created some of the most beloved consumer brands in key categories like sports, news and finance.”      Under Armstrong, AOL has invested in and grown global premium brands, including The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget, MAKERS and AOL.com, and market-leading programmatic platforms – including ONE by AOL for both advertisers and publishers.      Armstrong added, “We have enormous respect for what Yahoo has accomplished: this transaction is about unleashing Yahoo’s full potential, building upon our collective synergies, and strengthening and accelerating that growth. Combining Verizon, AOL and Yahoo will create a new powerful competitive rival in mobile media, and an open, scaled alternative offering for advertisers and publishers.”      The addition of Yahoo to Verizon and AOL will create one of the largest portfolios of owned and partnered global brands with extensive distribution capabilities. Combined, AOL and Yahoo will have more than 25 brands in its portfolio for continued investment and growth. Yahoo’s key assets include market-leading premium content brands in major categories including finance, news and sports, as well as one of the most popular email services globally with approximately 225 million monthly active users****. Additional technology assets in the advertising space include Brightroll, a programmatic demand-side platform; Flurry, an independent mobile apps analytics service; and Gemini, a native and search advertising solution.      The deal is subject to customary closing conditions, approval by Yahoo’s shareholders, and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in Q1 of 2017. Until the closing, Yahoo will continue to operate independently, offering and improving its own products and services for users, advertisers, developers and partners.      Verizon will generally issue cash-settled Verizon RSUs for Yahoo RSUs that are outstanding at the close.      The sale does not include Yahoo’s cash, its shares in Alibaba Group Holdings, its shares in Yahoo Japan, Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments, and Yahoo’s non-core patents (called the Excalibur portfolio). These assets will continue to be held by Yahoo, which will change its name at closing and become a registered, publicly traded investment company. Yahoo will provide additional information about the investment company at a future date.

summarize: Citing direct campaigning that created “the appearance of an unfair advantage,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has revoked an Oscar nomination for “Alone Yet Not Alone,” the tune from the faith-based movie of the same name that had been nominated for original song.      The academy said that Bruce Broughton, a music branch executive committee member who wrote the song’s music, had emailed members of the branch during the voting period, a rule violation. No new nominee will be named; only four nominees will be eligible for the Oscar.      PHOTOS: Movie scenes from 'Alone Yet Not Alone'      In a release Wednesday, the academy said the board of governors had made the decision in a vote Tuesday night after concluding that Broughton “had emailed members of the branch to make them aware of his submission during the nominations voting period."      In the statement, academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs said the actions were a perception problem, though she stopped short of saying that it actually had led to the song being shortlisted. “No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one’s position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one’s own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage,” she said.      PHOTOS: Oscars 2014 top nominees | Nominee reactions | Snubs and surprises      When it was announced as one of the nominees two weeks ago, “Alone Yet Not Alone” raised eyebrows among pundits and carping among non-nominated rivals. The song, whose lyrics were written by Dennis Spiegel, came from an independent movie about 18th-century colonists that few had heard of. It has received just a niche release in no more than 11 theaters and taken in only about $100,000. A larger release is planned in June.      The academy has revoked nominees' tickets before due to campaigning-based rule violations, as it did in 2010 for “Hurt Locker” producer Nicholas Chartier after he sent an email asking voters to choose his film over "that $500 million movie," referring to fellow nominee "Avatar." But the revocation of a nomination is extremely rare, if not unprecedented. More shortly.

I indulged in the simplest grassroots campaign and it went against me when the song started getting attention."      "Alone Yet Not Alone"? More like nominated yet not nominated.      In a move with few precedents in the 86-year history of the Academy Awards, the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to disqualify an Oscar nominee prior to the Oscars ceremony itself. "Alone Yet Not Alone," a little-heard tune from a little-seen film of the same name, will not appear on Oscar ballots when the final round of voting begins on Feb. 14. And the Academy will not announce a replacement nominee.      The Academy's board of governors met on Tuesday evening to investigate allegations that have been levied against the surprising nominee since Oscar nominations were announced on Jan. 16. The board eventually concluded that the song's nominated writer, Bruce Broughton, a former governor and current music branch executive committee member, "had emailed [some of the other 239] members of the branch to make them aware of his submission during the nominations voting period," the Academy said in a statement Wednesday.      EARLIER: 'Alone Yet Not Alone' Singer Dismisses Critics of Surprise Nomination      Broughton, who was nominated for the best original score Oscar for Silverado 28 years ago and served on the Academy's board from 2003-12, shared his nomination with the lyricist Dennis Spiegel. Their hymnal song is featured in an independently produced faith-based feature about 18th century colonists struggling to survive in the Ohio Valley. It was performed in the film by Joni Eareckson Tada, a prominent, quadriplegic Evangelical minister.      Moments after the announcement was made, Broughton said in a statement to THR: "I'm devastated. I indulged in the simplest grassroots campaign and it went against me when the song started getting attention. I got taken down by competition that had months of promotion and advertising behind them. I simply asked people to find the song and consider it."      "No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one's position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one's own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage," said Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the Academy president.      According to the Academy statement, "The board determined that Broughton’s actions were inconsistent with the Academy's promotional regulations, which provide, among other terms, that 'it is the Academy's goal to ensure that the awards competition is conducted in a fair and ethical manner. If any campaign activity is determined by the board of governors to work in opposition to that goal, whether or not anticipated by these regulations, the board of governors may take any corrective actions or assess any penalties that in its discretion it deems necessary to protect the reputation and integrity of the awards process.'"      Only a handful of nominations or wins have been revoked throughout Oscar history.      The very first Oscar nominations produced four mentions for Charlie Chaplin for his film The Circus (1928) -- for best production, best director of a comedy picture, best actor and best writing (original story) -- but, perhaps fearing a sweep that would make the debut ceremony unexciting, the Academy decided to take him out of the running and award him an honorary Oscar instead, "For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing The Circus."      Subsequently, the short subject (comedy) nomination for Stout Hearts and Willing Hands (1931) was revoked and replaced with one for another RKO Radio short, Scratch-As-Catch-Can, without any documentation as to why. Dive Bomber (1942), a nominee for best effects (special effects), was replaced by The Sea Wolf on the Oscar ballot; history has recorded no explanation for this substitution. A best writing (motion picture story) nomination for Hondo (1953) was revoked after it was determined that it was not an original work; a replacement nominee was not announced. The nomination for a Bowery Boys comedy that was mistaken for a musical that shared its title, High Society (1956), was removed from the Oscar ballot at the request of the former film's nominees, who acknowledged that their nomination was clearly the result of voter confusion. And, that same year, the screenwriter Michael Wilson was nominated for best adapted screenplay for Friendly Persuasion, but Wilson, as a result of being blacklisted, did not receive screen credit for his work and, thanks to a special Academy by-law in place at the time, precluded the Academy from recognizing him, as well. (The by-law was declared unworkable and abolished in 1959.)      The best original dramatic score nomination for The Godfather (1972) was revoked by the Academy prior to the Oscars when it was determined that it featured portions of Nino Rota's earlier composition for another film, Fortunella (1958); it was replaced on the ballot by the score for Sleuth. A Place in the World (1992), Uruguay's entry for the best foreign language film Oscar, was nominated by the Academy but subsequently deemed ineligible and taken off of the ballot because Uruguay was found to have had less to do with its creation than Argentina. And Tuba Atlantic, after being nominated for and losing the best live-action short Oscar, was subsequently disqualified after it was revealed that it had aired on Norwegian television prior to the Oscar ceremony.      The only film or individual to be disqualified after winning an Oscar, as far as THR has been able to determine, was Young Americans (1967), which won the best documentary feature Oscar but less than a month later was stripped of its win when it was revealed that the film had screened the prior year. The first runner-up, Journey Into Self, was awarded the win the next day.      The remaining four nominees for the best original song Oscar at the 86th Academy Awards are "Happy" from Despicable Me 2, "Let It Go" from Frozen, "The Moon Song" from Her and "Ordinary Love" from Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.      Multiple people associated with some of the other 70 songs that made this year's best original song Oscar shortlist but were not nominated on Jan. 16 have expressed great frustration to THR about the Academy's decision not to elevate another song to the status of a nominee, citing the aforementioned instances in which replacements were named and noting that ballots have not yet been printed and mailed to voters, most of whom now vote online anyway.      Twitter: @ScottFeinberg ||||| What’s next Oscar, a Best Actress nomination for Pia Zadora? After Deadline Hollywood uncovered the story behind a bizarre Oscar nomination for a little-heard song in an unseen film that was curiously written by a former Academy Governor and head of the music branch, the Academy took the highly unusual step today of disallowing the tune from Oscar consideration. This appears to be the most disreputable thing we’ve seen in a serious industry award tabulation since the time when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association got wined and dined and all but bribed by zillionaire Meshulem Riklis to nominate his fetching wife Zadora for Best New Star of the Year award.

Related: How Academy Came Up With Its Most Obscure Nominee – Maybe EVER: Video      Back to Oscars: In a year where some of music’s biggest names contributed songs for movies, “Alone Yet Not Alone,” the title track from a film nobody saw, got a Best Original Song nomination over the likes of Taylor Swift, Coldplay, Celine Dion and many others. Our Pete Hammond detailed how the songwriter — Bruce Broughton, a former Academy Governor and head of the music branch — had more influential friends than some of the music industry’s biggest artists, and that his lobbying of his pals resulted in a nomination over the likes of Lana Del Rey, whose song “Young and Beautiful” was so gorgeously layered by director Baz Luhrmann into a film people actually saw. According to sources, Broughton hired a veteran film music publicist to get attention for the song. But after press releases failed to earn traction, Broughton started making phone calls to colleagues urging them to vote for his song.      This is a huge embarrassment for the Academy, and President Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in a statement today, “No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one’s position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one’s own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage.” No word on whether the Academy will rebuke those voters so willing to vote a nom to a pal, and it seems shameful that the Academy did not give that nom to whatever song got the next-most votes. The disqualification leaves just four songs vying for the statuette.      Broughton is a veteran of the movie and TV music game, with credits stretching all the way back to the original Hawaii Five-O. Along the way he has amassed 10 Emmy Awards and a Best Original Score Oscar nom for the 1985 Western Silverado. Here’s the Academy’s release:       |||||	– A huge embarrassment for the Academy Awards: The song nomination for "Alone Yet Not Alone" from the film of the same name has been yanked after it emerged that its writer—a former Academy governor and current head of the music branch—had been calling and emailing colleagues to get them to vote for his song, Deadline reports. The nomination raised plenty of eyebrows when it was announced, as it came from a little-known faith-based movie about 18th-century colonists that played in just 11 theaters, the Los Angeles Times notes. Songwriter Bruce Broughton insists that he just wanted people to listen to the song. "I'm devastated. I indulged in the simplest grassroots campaign and it went against me when the song started getting attention," he tells the Hollywood Reporter. That isn't a good enough excuse for Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs. "No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one’s position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one's own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage," she said in a statement. To the frustration of other candidates, there will be no replacement nominee, leaving just four songs competing for this year's Oscar.
summarize: While diplomatically inconvenient for the Western powers, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s attempt to get the United Nations to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state has elicited widespread sympathy. After all, what choice did he have? According to the accepted narrative, Middle East peace is made impossible by a hard-line Likud-led Israel that refuses to accept a Palestinian state and continues to build settlements.      It is remarkable how this gross inversion of the truth has become conventional wisdom. In fact, Benjamin Netanyahu brought his Likud-led coalition to open recognition of a Palestinian state, thereby creating Israel’s first national consensus for a two-state solution. He is also the only prime minister to agree to a settlement freeze — 10 months — something no Labor or Kadima government has ever done.      To which Abbas responded by boycotting the talks for nine months, showing up in the 10th, then walking out when the freeze expired. Last week he reiterated that he will continue to boycott peace talks unless Israel gives up — in advance — claim to any territory beyond the 1967 lines. Meaning, for example, that the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem is Palestinian territory. This is not just absurd. It violates every prior peace agreement. They all stipulate that such demands are to be the subject of negotiations, not their precondition.      Abbas unwaveringly insists on the so-called “right of return,” which would demographically destroy Israel by swamping it with millions of Arabs, thereby turning the world’s only Jewish state into the world’s 23rd Arab state. And he has repeatedly declared, as recently as last week in New York: “We shall not recognize a Jewish state.”      Nor is this new. It is perfectly consistent with the long history of Palestinian rejectionism. Consider:      ●Camp David, 2000. At a U.S.-sponsored summit, Prime Minister Ehud Barak offers Yasser Arafat a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza — and, astonishingly, the previously inconceivable division of Jerusalem. Arafat refuses. And makes no counteroffer, thereby demonstrating his unseriousness about making any deal. Instead, within two months, he launches a savage terror war that kills a thousand Israelis.      ●Taba, 2001. An even sweeter deal — the Clinton Parameters — is offered. Arafat walks away again.      ●Israel, 2008. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert makes the ultimate capitulation to Palestinian demands — 100 percent of the West Bank (with land swaps), Palestinian statehood, the division of Jerusalem with the Muslim parts becoming the capital of the new Palestine. And incredibly, he offers to turn over the city’s holy places, including the Western Wall — Judaism’s most sacred site, its Kaaba — to an international body on which sit Jordan and Saudi Arabia.      Did Abbas accept? Of course not. If he had, the conflict would be over and Palestine would already be a member of the United Nations.      This is not ancient history. All three peace talks occurred over the past decade. And every one completely contradicts the current mindless narrative of Israeli “intransigence” as the obstacle to peace.      Settlements? Every settlement remaining within the new Palestine would be destroyed and emptied, precisely as happened in Gaza.      So why did the Palestinians say no? Because saying yes would have required them to sign a final peace agreement that accepted a Jewish state on what they consider the Muslim patrimony.      The key word here is “final.” The Palestinians are quite prepared to sign interim agreements, like Oslo. Framework agreements, like Annapolis. Cease-fires, like the 1949 armistice. Anything but a final deal. Anything but a final peace. Anything but a treaty that ends the conflict once and for all — while leaving a Jewish state still standing.      After all, why did Abbas go to the United Nations last week? For nearly half a century, the United States has pursued a Middle East settlement on the basis of the formula of land for peace. Land for peace produced the Israel-Egypt peace of 1979 and the Israel-Jordan peace of 1994. Israel has offered the Palestinians land for peace three times since. And been refused every time.      Why? For exactly the same reason Abbas went to the United Nations last week: to get land without peace. Sovereignty with no reciprocal recognition of a Jewish state. Statehood without negotiations. An independent Palestine in a continued state of war with Israel.      Israel gave up land without peace in south Lebanon in 2000 and, in return, received war (the Lebanon war of 2006) and 50,000 Hezbollah missiles now targeted on the Israeli homeland. In 2005, Israel gave up land without peace in Gaza, and again was rewarded with war — and constant rocket attack from an openly genocidal Palestinian mini-state.      Israel is prepared to give up land, but never again without peace. A final peace. Which is exactly what every Palestinian leader from Haj Amin al-Husseini to Yasser Arafat to Mahmoud Abbas has refused to accept. Which is why, regardless of who is governing Israel, there has never been peace. Territorial disputes are solvable; existential conflicts are not.      Land for peace, yes. Land without peace is nothing but an invitation to national suicide.      letters@charleskrauthammer.com      More from PostOpinions:      Meyerson: Senate finally stands up to China      Gerson: How Europe threatens the U.S.      Editorial: Bahrain’s repression ||||| To which Abbas responded by boycotting the talks for nine months, showing up in the 10th, then walking out when the freeze expired.

Far from it. The Palestinians have rejected three land-for-peace offers over the last decade, he writes. Why? Because all three deals called for a "final peace agreement that accepted a Jewish state," and that will never happen. "The key word here is 'final,'" he writes. Palestinians want "anything but a treaty that ends the conflict once and for all—while leaving a Jewish state still standing."

The Kenya Electricity Generation Company said in a statement late Tuesday that a monkey climbed onto the roof of the Gitaru Power Station in central Kenya and fell onto a transformer, tripping it.      The company said this caused other machines in the station to trip, resulting in the loss of 180MW from the plant, triggering a national blackout. The statement did not say whether monkey survived.      The blackout lasted more than three hours Tuesday before power was restored.      The company said that its facilities are fenced with an electric fence, and that this was an isolated incident. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The transformer then tripped, resulting in the loss of 180 megawatts of power and triggering a blackout across Kenya.

A nationwide blackout that knocked out lights, severed internet service and paralyzed countless businesses for more than three hours on Tuesday was caused by a monkey, the electricity company announced.      The monkey, which appeared to be of the Vervet species, with a collar of white fur, climbed onto the roof of the Gitaru Power Station and fell or jumped onto a transformer. The transformer tripped, which in turn tripped other machines at the hydroelectric power station, setting off a nationwide blackout, the Kenya Electricity Generation Company, or KenGen, said.

Vervet monkeys, which are usually about two feet long, not including the tail, can be pesky creatures. They can be seen everywhere in Kenya, and they often travel in packs, scampering along power lines, snacking on mangoes in backyards and even sneaking into kitchens through open windows to pinch a banana or two. |||||	– A "rogue" operative caused a nearly four-hour power outage across Kenya on Tuesday, the BBC reports. That agent of blackout chaos: a monkey that fell onto a transformer of the country's leading electric power-generating company, per the AP. In a statement on its Facebook page, accompanied by a photo of the primate perched on the transformer, KenGen (short for Kenya Electricity Generating Company) noted the animal had scrambled its way up the Gitaru power station and onto its roof, subsequently falling onto the transformer and tripping it. This was the trigger for a domino-like effect in which other machines at Gitaru started tripping as well, resulting in the loss of 180 megawatts of power. The ensuing blackout not only shut off the lights across the nation, but also cut access to the Internet and "paralyzed countless businesses," the New York Times notes. "KenGen power installations are secured by electric fencing which keeps away marauding wild animals," the Facebook post reads. "We regret this isolated incident, and the company is looking at ways of further enhancing security at all our power plants." Distressingly, CNN notes, most of the country probably didn't even notice the power went out: Per the World Bank, less than a quarter of Kenya's population has electric access. As for the monkey, tentatively IDed by the Times as a "pesky" vervet, it didn't turn into a Peter Gabriel song: KenGen says it survived its ordeal and has been turned over to Kenya's state wildlife agency. (Could the monkey have been an agent from the Chinese military?)
summarize: Florida Rep. Allen West on Wednesday demanded a recount as his bid for reelection remained too close to call, with the tea party Republican trailing his Democratic opponent by fewer than 3,000 votes.      (See also: 2012 election results map)      Text Size -      +      reset Senate election results: GOP's lesson      Patrick Murphy has 160,328 votes, or 50.4 percent, to West’s 157,782 votes, or 49.6 percent, with 100 percent of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press, which has yet to call the race.      West, who warned before the election of “nefarious actions” by Democrats, suggested a county election supervisor was trying to rig the election.      “Late last night Congressman West maintained a districtwide lead of nearly 2,000 votes until the St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections ‘recounted’ thousands of early ballots,” West’s campaign said in a statement. “Following that ‘recount’ Congressman West trailed by 2,400 votes.”      (Also on POLITICO: No clarity on fiscal cliff after election)      West also said there were “numerous other disturbing irregularities” in St. Lucie County.      “The St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections office clearly ignored proper rules and procedures, and the scene at the Supervisor’s office last night could only be described as complete chaos,” the campaign said. “Given the hostility and demonstrated incompetence of the St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections, we believe it is critical that a full hand recount of the ballots take place in St. Lucie County. We will continue to fight to ensure every vote is counted properly and fairly, and accordingly we will pursue all legal means necessary.”      A call to St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections’ office was met with a full voicemail inbox.      Murphy declared victory shortly after 1 a.m., according to TCPalm.com. West had yet to concede. Murphy’s 0.8 point lead is outside the 0.5 margin that would require a recount in the Sunshine State. If Murphy’s lead remains bigger than 0.5 percentage points, a state elections spokesman told the Miami Herald that there is “no statutory mechanism for a candidate, group or anyone else to have a recount done.”      “Allen West was quite a character to run against,” Murphy said in his victory speech, according to the website. “And I’ll keep it at that, and hopefully that’s the last time I ever need to mention his name, too.”      The Palm Beach Post reports provisional and absentee ballots in Democratic-leaning Palm Beach County still need to be counted. Murphy’s campaign manager told the newspaper the outstanding ballots weren’t enough to overturn the results.      West, a retired Army colonel who left the military after firing off a gun near the head of an Iraqi prisoner, was elected as part of the 2010 tea party wave. As one of the GOP’s few black elected officials on the national level — and as a bombastic and incendiary commentator — West became a frequent cable news guest. He spent $13.8 million, more than any other House member in 2012 but was also a regular star of House Democratic fundraising appeals.      Murphy, a vice president in his family’s construction company, was aided by $3.4 million in super PAC spending. One of those PACs was at least partially funded by Murphy’s family. ||||| Democrats strengthened their hold on the Senate but failed Tuesday to recapture the majority in the House of Representatives they lost two years ago.

(Associated Press)      "Now that the election is over, it's time to put politics aside and work together to find solutions," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who may have a slightly bigger working majority _ but not as big as the filibuster-proof one Obama enjoyed his first two years in the White House.      House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who also gets to keep his job, offered to work with any willing partner, Republican or Democrat, to get things done. "The American people want solutions _ and tonight, they've responded by renewing our majority," he told a gathering of Republicans.      But Boehner also said that by keeping Republicans in control of the House, voters made clear there is no mandate for raising taxes. Obama has proposed imposing higher taxes on households earning over $250,000 a year.      The first post-election test of wills could start next week when Congress returns from its election recess to deal with unfinished business _ including a looming "fiscal cliff" of $400 billion in higher taxes and $100 billion in automatic cuts in military and domestic spending to take effect in January if Congress doesn't head them off. Economists warn that the combination could plunge the nation back into a recession.      Because of extreme election-year partisanship, a resolution of the matter had been put off until a post-election lame-duck session.      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the voters have not endorsed the "failures or excesses of the president's first term," but rather have given him more time to finish the job.      "To the extent he wants to move to the political center, which is where the work gets done in a divided government, we'll be there to meet him halfway," McConnell said.      Democrats now hold a 53 to 47 majority, including two independents who generally vote with them. On Tuesday, they held their majority, picking up Republican-held seats in Indiana and Massachusetts while Republicans snatched a lone Democratic seat in Nebraska.      In Maine, independent former Gov. Angus King was elected to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe. He hasn't said yet which party he will side with _ but Democrats rushed to his cause during his campaign. And after Tuesday's victory, Senate Democratic leader Reid reached out to him by phone.      In one closely watched contest, Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard professor, defeated Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who won the seat in a January 2010 special election following the death of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. At $68 million, it was one of the most expensive races in the country, even though both candidates swore off money from outside groups. "This victory belongs to you," Warren told supporters at a victory celebration.      In another Democratic pickup, Rep. Joe Donnelly won the Indiana Senate seat held for six terms by Republican Sen. Richard Lugar. Lugar lost earlier this year in a GOP primary to tea party-backed state Treasurer Richard Mourdock. The race had been rocked by the Republican candidate's controversial comments that pregnancy resulting from rape is "something God intended."      And Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., fought back a challenge from Republican Rep. Todd Akin, who severely damaged his candidacy in August when he said women who are victims of "legitimate rape" would not get pregnant.      Former Virginia governor and Democrat Tim Kaine won the Virginia Senate race, holding off a challenge from Republican George Allen, who lost the seat in 2006. The seat opened up when Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat, decided not to run for re-election.      And former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon lost her bid for a Connecticut Senate seat to Democrat Chris Murphy despite spending $42 million of her own wealth. It was the second time in two years she has lost a Senate race. The seat had been long held by Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent who caucused with Democrats and was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2000.      In Wisconsin, Rep. Tammy Baldwin defeated former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson.      In the House, both Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California were re-elected, as were other top leaders of both parties, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland.      And while GOP Rep. Paul Ryan lost the vice presidency, he did win another term to his Wisconsin House seat.      Former GOP presidential hopeful Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota was narrowly re-elected.      A party needs 218 seats to control the House. The party mix in the new House will resemble the current one, which Republicans control by 240-190. There are two GOP and three Democratic vacancies. The GOP and Democratic pickups were pretty generally divided.      By early Wednesday, Democrats had defeated 12 GOP House incumbents _ 10 of them members of the huge tea party-backed freshman class of 2010. Republican losers included four incumbents from Illinois, two each from New Hampshire and New York, and one apiece from Florida, Maryland, Minnesota and Texas.      But Republicans picked up nine previously Democratic seats. Their candidates defeated one Democratic incumbent apiece in Kentucky, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania; they picked up one open seat each in Arkansas, California, Indiana, North Carolina and Oklahoma currently held by Democrats who retired or ran for another office.      With almost 90 percent of the 435 House races called by The Associated Press, Republicans had won 227 seats and were leading in nine more. For a majority in the chamber, a party must control 218 seats. Democrats had won 178 seats and were leading in 19 others.      In remarks to Democrats, Pelosi said her party would be "fighting for reigniting the American dream, building ladders of opportunity for people who want to work hard and play by the rules and take responsibility."      In a somber statement, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Republicans "have a period of reflection and recalibration ahead." He added that, "While some will want to blame one wing of the party over the other, the reality is candidates from all corners of our GOP lost tonight."      __      Follow Tom Raum on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/tomraum. |||||	– In a nail-biter of a close race, Michele Bachmann appears to have overcome a strong challenger and held onto her Minnesota House seat, the St. Cloud Times reports.

summarize: OSLO (Reuters) - The ability of Europe's aging forests to absorb carbon dioxide is heading towards saturation point, threatening one of the continent's main defenses against global warming, a study showed on Sunday.      Forests from Spain to Sweden are getting older, packed with trees less good at soaking up the emissions blamed for rising world temperatures, mounting sea levels and increasing numbers of heatwaves and floods, experts said.      Trees are being threatened by more fires, storms and insect attacks, said the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.      Some parts of the continent have also started cutting down some forests, it added.      That all meant Europe should no longer assume its forests would be able to continue absorbing carbon emissions from factories, power plants and cars, at the same rate, it added. Forests currently soak up about 10 percent of Europe's emissions.      "These regrowing forests have shown to be a persistent carbon sink, projected to continue for decades, however, there are early signs of saturation. Forest policies and management strategies need revision if we want to sustain the sink," the Nature Climate Change report said.      Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested saturation point could be reached by around 2030 unless governments took action, said Gert-Jan Nabuurs, of Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands, who led the study with experts in Finland, Switzerland and Italy.      GREEN EUROPE      Europe is in its greenest state for centuries, with forests probably covering the largest area since Medieval times - largely thanks to a rush of planting to rebuild the continent after the ravages of World War Two, said the report.      But data since 2005 showed the growth of those forests was now slowing as their trees got older.      Trees absorb the gas from the air and build it into their trunks, roots and branches as carbon. They lessen their absorption as they grow older and release the stored carbon when they die and rot.      Manmade emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that is released by burning fossil fuels, are very likely to be the main cause of rising temperatures since 1950, a U.N. panel of climate experts says.      Better management could help avert the problem of Europe's aging forests, Nabuurs said. The authors also recommended selective harvesting and more new forests.      Annemarie Bastrup-Birk, a forestry expert who works at the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen who was also an author of that report, said the decline in forest growth was mainly in France and Germany with continued gains elsewhere.      "It's still very regional," she told Reuters, warning that the Nature Climate Change study might be premature in raising concerns about a continent-wide problem.      The European Union plans to cut its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 as part of international efforts to slow global warming. Each nation can count the uptake of carbon in forests towards the total.      An international report on the state of Europe's forests in 2011 said the net annual increase in living tree wood in the European Union slowed to 609 million cubic meters in 2010 from 620 million in 2005.      (Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Andrew Heavens) ||||| Image caption Disturbances, such as wildfires, contribute to the reduction of carbon sequestration in Europe's forests      European forests are showing signs of reaching a saturation point as carbon sinks, a study has suggested.      Since 2005, the amount of atmospheric CO2 absorbed by the continent's trees has been slowing, researchers reported.      Writing in Nature Climate Change, they said this was a result of a declining volume of trees, deforestation and the impact of natural disturbances.      Carbon sinks play a key role in the global carbon cycle and are promoted as a way to offset rising emissions.      Image caption Many of Europe's forests are reaching an age where growth, and carbon uptake, slows down      Writing in their paper, the scientists said the continent's forests had been recovering in recent times after centuries of stock decline and deforestation.      The growth had also provided a "persistent carbon sink", which was projected to continue for decades.      However, the team's study observed three warnings that the carbon sink provided by Europe's tree stands was nearing a saturation point.      "First, the stem volume increment rate (of individual trees) is decreasing and thus the sink is curbing after decades of increase," they wrote.      "Second, land use is intensifying, thereby leading to deforestation and associated carbon losses.      "Third, natural disturbances (eg wildfires) are increasing and, as a consequence, so are the emissions of CO2."      Co-author Gert-Jan Nabuurs from Wageningen University and Research Centre, Netherlands, said: "All of this together means that the increase in the size of the sink is stopping; it is even declining a little.      "We see this as the first signs of a saturating sink," he told BBC News.      Sinking feeling      The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon - essential for life on the planet - is transferred between land (geosphere and terrestrial biosphere), sea (hydrosphere) and the atmosphere.      Carbon sinks refers to the capacity of key components in the cycle - such as the soil, oceans, rock and fossil fuels - to store carbon, preventing it from being recycled, eg between the land and the atmosphere.      Image caption Management techniques, such as coppicing, will help rejuvenate Europe's forests, the study suggests      Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has modified the cycle as a result of burning fossil fuels and land-use change.      Burning fossil fuels has resulted in vast amounts of carbon previously locked in the geosphere being released into the atmosphere.      Land-use change - such as urbanisation and deforestation - has reduced the size of the biosphere, which removes carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.      Dr Nabuurs explained that saturation referred to the point where the natural carbon sinks were unable to keep pace and absorb the additional atmospheric carbon being released by human activities.      He said emissions had risen a lot over the past decade, primarily through the rise of emerging economies in countries such as China, India and Brazil.      The researcher's conclusions offered a more detailed analysis on headline data that forest cover in Europe was continuing to increase. But the paper added that the rate of growth had been slowing in recent years.      The 2011 State of Europe's Forests report, considered to be the most comprehensive study of its kind, showed that trees covered almost half of Europe's land area and absorbed about 10% of Europe's annual greenhouse gas emissions.      However, it added, the rate of growth in the continent's forests ability to sequester carbon was also slowing.      Dr Nabuurs said that the rate of afforestation was slowing because a sizeable proportion of forests were mature stands of trees that were mainly planted in the early part of the 20th Century or in the post-World War II period.      Image caption Forests absorb about 10% of the EU's annual greenhouse gas emissions      "These forests have now reached 70-80 years old and are starting a phase in the life of a tree where the growth rate starts to come down," he explained.      "So you have large areas of old forest and even if you add these relatively small areas of new forest, this does not compensate for the loss of growth rate in the old forests."      However, mature woodlands have been recognised as a key habitat for supporting and conserving biodiversity.      Will this lead to policymakers making a choice between forests' ecological value and their effectiveness at sequestering CO2?      "That is indeed a large challenge," said Dr Nabuurs.      "Old forests in Europe are necessary and we certainly need those forests.      "I think policymakers at a national level and within the EU have to be clear that in certain regions, within valuable habitats, that the focus is on old forests and biodiversity.      "But in other regions, maybe it is time to concentrate more on continuous wood production again and rejuvenate forests again, so then you have growing forests and a continuous flow of wood products.      "This seems to be the optimal way to address both the need for wood products and maintaining a carbon sink in growing forests."      'Real problem'      The study's findings could have implications for EU and member state's climate mitigation efforts to reduce emissions.      "Most European nations, as part of their emissions reduction commitments, can also use forest carbon sinks," Dr Nabuurs observed.      "Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries were voluntarily choosing to take that sink into account.      "But in the next commitment period, forest management will be an obligatory part of reaching the emissions reduction targets.      "For some countries, the sink is a very large part of their emissions reduction commitment so the saturation is a real problem, requiring them to take additional measures, for example in the electricity generation or transport sectors."      As a sizeable proportion of Europe's forest areas are owned by smallholders, the process of changing the age-profile of the continent's tree cover could prove challenging with some owners resisting the idea of increasing wood production and tree harvesting.      Image caption Changes to the climate and the lack of management are reducing forests' resilience to natural disturbances      One potential solution is a pan-European, legally binding agreement on forest management that would look to balance the ecological value of forests against the trees' commercial and climate mitigation value.      Delegates from more than 40 nations have been working on such a framework since 2011.      However, talks stalled in June when negotiators were unable to reach agreement on a number of technicalities.      "This is a very important process where all the European states are working towards a legally binding agreement," Dr Nabuurs commented.      "It is a very important framework in which the member states can devise their own national policies.      "It is obvious that within nations, forest policy is often quite weak. To strengthen this, this agreement is certainly necessary."      Talks are set to resume in the autumn, with the aim of having a draft agreement in place by mid-November for EU forestry ministers to consider. |||||	– Yet more bad news for the climate: Europe's forests are approaching the peak of their ability to absorb carbon and may not be able to suck up the same level of emissions in future, according to a new study. Scientists say that while Europe is at its most forested in centuries thanks to massive post-WW2 planting programs, its trees are getting older and are now more at risk from wildfires and other natural disturbances, the BBC reports. "These forests have now reached 70-80 years old and are starting a phase in the life of a tree where the growth rate starts to come down," the lead researcher explains. "So you have large areas of old forest and even if you add these relatively small areas of new forest, this does not compensate for the loss of growth rate in the old forests." The researchers warn that saturation point could be less than 20 years away unless better forest management is put in place across Europe, reports Reuters.
summarize: SIRTE, Libya—Dozens of families fled Col. Moammar Gadhafi's hometown on Monday as fighters supporting Libya's interim leadership pushed to capture the city and the loyalist forces' few other remaining redoubts.      View Slideshow Reuters Columns of anti-Gaddafi fighters advance towards the front line Monday.      Refugees who managed to get out of the coastal city of Sirte, however, had to clear another hurdle: Anti-Gadhafi fighters from Misrata, while distributing food and water to fleeing families, were pulling suspected loyalists from their ranks.      Residents in passenger cars and pickup trucks packed with mattresses and blankets waited at checkpoints manned by the anti-Gadhafi forces on the highway on the west side of Sirte.      Many refugees said they had to escape through rural back roads after being blocked at gunpoint by Gadhafi supporters holed up in the center of the city. They said some of Sirte's main thoroughfares had been barricaded with sand berms and concrete barriers to prevent residents from leaving and impede the advance of fighters supporting the leaders of the interim government, the National Transitional Council, or NTC.      Ali Omar, who escaped with 27 members of his extended family, said fighters loyal to the transitional government were also approaching from the east, from the direction of the city of Benghazi, and blasting their way into the city.      "The easterners are exterminating everything in front of them," said Mr. Omar, 42 years old, dressed in pajama pants and a polo shirt. He said he and his family had been pinned down by heavy gunfire for more than seven hours on Sunday in their home on Sirte's east side.      Enlarge Image Close Reuters Fighters supporting Libya's transitional government fired at Gadhafi loyalists in a battle near Sirte, Col. Moammar Gadhafi's birth city, on Monday.      As refugees gathered, the Misrata fighters checked their names against lists of suspected Gadhafi loyalists. Some men were arrested while others were told to wait on the side of the road with their families.      "We're going to punish even those that supported Moammar with words," said a bearded fighter to a man who protested his detention. "We are the knights that liberated Libya."      A pro-NTC fighter said his colleagues were following routine security procedures in detaining suspected loyalists.      A frantic elderly woman paced on the highway, pleading with the fighters to release her son. She argued that the family had relinquished Kalashnikov rifles given to them and other loyalist tribes by Col. Gadhafi's regime to fight the rebels. "Give me back my son," screamed the woman, Hawa Gargoum.      The fighter played down the fierce resistance they have faced for weeks in areas such as Sirte and Bani Walid, southeast of the capital,Tripoli.      "Once we get the families out of Sirte, it won't take us three hours," to capture the city, boasted the fighter.      But some families weren't being moved. A group of 140 men, women and children had been trapped for over a week at a mosque close to the Sirte front line, guarded by half a dozen Misrata fighters.      Another group of fighters, hunkered down at a nearby overpass, fired mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades toward a loyalist base beyond the mosque.      The families at the mosquewere among thousands of residents of Tawergha, a small town 25 miles south of Misrata, who were chased out of their homes when pro-NTC fighters captured the town last month.      Misratans accuse their neighbors in Tawergha, which is inhabited mostly by black Libyans, of aiding Col. Gadhafi's troops during their brutalsiege of Misrata this year and committing crimes such as rape.      Misrata's fighters have ransacked Tawergha and set many homes on fire, and have pursued their vendetta with Tawergha's displaced families in every area captured by the pro-NTC force so far.      Fighters from Misrata said they had orders not to allow families from Tawergha to return home. The NTC's head, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, proposed reconciliation between Misrata and Tawergha, but the Misratans have so far refused.      "You will be rewarded by God if you can rescue us," pleaded Najia Saleh, 50, who was huddled at the mosque with six children.      About 5,000 Tawergha natives were stuck in Sirte and thousands more were being held in the Jufra region south of the city, according to several displaced families.      Some of the Tawergha families that managed to leave Jufra over the weekend didn't escape the Misrata fighters when they reached Tripoli. Women from several families that arrived in Tripoli on Saturday said 10 male relatives were arrested by Misrata rebels at a checkpoint south of the city, adding to hundreds others detained since the fall of the capital last month.      "They called us 'mercenaries,' " said Salima Farraj, 34, who said she had two brothers arrested on Saturday.      Write to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com ||||| 1 of 15. Plumes of thick smoke are seen erupting from inside Sirte September 26, 2011.      SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - Intense sniper and artillery fire from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi holed up in Sirte kept fighters with Libya's new rulers at bay in the deposed leader's hometown on Wednesday.      Sirte, one of the last two bastions of support for Gaddafi, is encircled by forces with the interim National Transitional Council (NTC) and under aerial attack from NATO.      NTC fighters have been meeting stiff resistance from Gaddafi loyalists, who have managed to hang on to much of Sirte more than a month after the fall of the Libyan leader's regime.      Lack of coordination and divisions at the front have been hampering their attempts to capture Sirte and Bani Walid, which lies 180 km (110 miles) south of Tripoli.      A commander leading the attack on Sirte said on Tuesday he was in talks with elders inside the city about a truce, but the head of another anti-Gaddafi unit rejected negotiations.      There were clashes at a roundabout 2 km (1.5 miles) east of the center of Sirte, where anti-Gaddafi fighters were pinned down for a second day by sniper and artillery fire.      Forces with the new government brought in two tanks and trucks carrying infantry to try to break through.      Snipers, though, held up the advance, forcing the attackers to take cover behind metal shipping containers.      Medical workers at a hospital in Ras Lanuf, which lies 220 km (137 miles) east of Sirte, said they had received the bodies of six NTC fighters killed in fighting on the city's eastern front. Some 45 fighters were wounded, many from sniper fire.      While the fighting continues, humanitarian organizations have expressed alarm at the worsening situation in Sirte.      "Our main worry is the people being displaced because of the fighting," said Jafar Vishtawi, a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), near Sirte.      GADDAFIS STILL MAKING WAVES      Taking Sirte, 450 km east of Tripoli, would bring Libya's new rulers closer to gaining control of the whole country, something still eluding them more than a month after their fighters seized the capital.      It is likely some members of Gaddafi's family are in Sirte but there is no information about the location of the former ruler himself. He is the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant.      A Syria-based television station that has been broadcasting audio speeches by Gaddafi, reported on Tuesday that the toppled leader had addressed his supporters and urged them to fight in a speech broadcast on a local radio station in Bani Walid.      The report by Arrai television could not be independently verified.      Arrai also broadcast footage of what it said was Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam, dated September 20, rallying his forces at an unidentified location.      "This land is the land of your forefathers. Don't hand it over," Saif al-Islam, shouted to a crowd of followers.      In neighboring Algeria, the government ordered members of Gaddafi's family in exile there to stay out of politics after Gaddafi's daughter Aisha angered the NTC by telling the media her father was still fighting to hold on to power.      Aisha Gaddafi, her brothers Hannibal and Mohammed, their mother Safia and several other family members fled in August.      In a separate development, a Tunisian court of appeal freed Gaddafi's former Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi, who was sentenced to six months in jail last week after he was arrested near the North African country's border with Algeria.      Shortly after the ruling, a source at the Justice Ministry told Reuters that Tunisia had not received any request from the NTC to extradite al-Mahmoudi.      Libya's new rulers received an important boost when exports of crude oil -- the country's only major source of revenue -- resumed for the first time in months.      The head of Libya's port authority said a cargo of crude oil had sailed on September 25 from the port of Marsa el Hariga, bound for Italy. It was only the third cargo to leave Libya since the rebellion against Gaddafi's rule began in February.      "We are working hard to make everything run normally at the ports," Capt. Ramadan Boumadyan said in an interview. "I think everything will be back to normal in a month's time."

One commander told Reuters that an elder from Gadhafi’s tribe had called him to ask for a truce, and safe passage for families out of the city. The commander agreed, but so far fighting has not abated.

The Misrata fighters have also rounded up people from their neighboring town of Tawergha, keeping them captive in a Sirte mosque. They accuse Tawergha of aiding Gadfhafi’s forces in the siege of Misrata, and have ransacked and burned the town.
summarize: On their first day of trading, shares of technology companies Square and Match Group surged. The WSJ's Scott Thurm breaks down the importance of their performance.      Shares of mobile-payments startup Square Inc. and online-dating service owner Match Group Inc. surged in their first day of trading, a welcome relief for the beaten-down market for initial public offerings.      Both stocks closed above the high end of their estimated IPO ranges on Thursday afternoon, despite disappointing Wednesday night with offerings that priced below or at the low end of expectations.      The... ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The long-running gold rush into hot technology start-ups showed signs of faltering on Wednesday, as a much-anticipated market debut had to scale back its ambitions.                              Square — valued in a private financing last year at $6 billion — priced its initial public offering at a level that gave the payments company a valuation of $2.9 billion. The difference between the two may be seen as a sign that the market for venture-backed companies has reached too high.      The shares, which are to start trading on Thursday, were priced at $9 after Square was unable to get demand from investors within the $11 to $13 range it was seeking. The company and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a nonprofit, decided to sell $243 million through the offering, 25 percent less than the $324 million they had been aiming to raise.      The weak I.P.O. pricing raises the pressure on Jack Dorsey, Square’s chief executive. Last month, Mr. Dorsey was appointed chief executive of Twitter, the social media company he co-founded, with some critics questioning whether he would be able to manage two public companies.      Twitter has been flailing in its efforts to build its user base, a situation that demands Mr. Dorsey’s time and attention.      Square is not the first I.P.O. of the so-called unicorns — private companies valued at $1 billion or more — to go public below its latest private valuation. But it is the largest in recent years.      Of 140-plus unicorns, Square ranked among the top 15 percent.      “The unicorn thing has gotten way out over its skis,” said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners. “Square’s I.P.O says people are a little bit less caught up in the prospects of what you can become and are more grounded in what you are.”      Many investors have shifted their focus toward measures like earnings, which Square does not currently have, and away from revenue growth.      That shift in perspective can be seen with mutual funds, which have poured billions of dollars into private companies in recent years.      Lately, a number of funds have been discounting their positions in prized start-ups. While Square was on the road speaking with investors, it emerged that Fidelity had marked down the value of Snapchat by 25 percent. Dropbox, which provides cloud-based file storage, was devalued by BlackRock earlier this year.      From the beginning, Square has had challenges that caused it to face a trying process to go public. Its detractors have long been skeptical of the company’s business model, taking a small percentage of every credit card transaction it processes and splitting it with financial intermediaries, credit card networks and others, making it harder to achieve large-scale profitability.      It also faces a lot of competition from such traditional operators as First Data and PayPal and smaller upstarts like Stripe.      Square is also entering a difficult market for I.P.O.s in general.      Match Group, the owner of a number of dating sites including Tinder, also priced shares in its offering on Wednesday. The company sold 33.3 million shares for $12 apiece, the bottom end of the range it was marketing to investors.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The $400 million I.P.O is the first step in Match’s split from IAC/InterActiveCorp, the media conglomerate whose chairman is Barry Diller. At the I.P.O. price, Match has a market valuation of $2.9 billion.      Like Square, Match faces substantial competition, but it was able to show investors positive net income.      Many tech I.P.O.s this year, such as the software companies Box and Apigee, also priced their deals below those granted in the private markets.      Still, going public at this time may prove to be a highly savvy move by Square.      The lack of tech I.P.O.s this year — representing only 15 percent of the amount raised — enabled Square to capture the attention from investors and get the deal done.      But there is a mounting wave of technology start-ups that may want to go public in the next two years. There are 143 unicorns with a combined valuation of $507 billion, according to CB Insights, a venture-capital research firm.      If all these companies were to float 25 percent of their private valuations through I.P.O.s over the next two years, there would be $63.4 billion in unicorn I.P.O.s alone. That figure is 14 percent higher than the average total volume of I.P.O.s — regardless of sector — over the last two decades, data compiled by The New York Times and Dealogic show.      These statistics show it would be very difficult for the market to absorb such an abundance of tech I.P.O.s, especially at their current, private valuations. Too much supply could cause some unicorns to garner steeper discounts to get investors’ attention, or they might not be able to go public at all — ever.      To its credit, Square has spent the last two years trying to move beyond its core business of payments processing by offering its customers additional services. Square Capital, the company’s merchant cash advance program, has extended more than $225 million to customers since it started last year. The company also sells subscription-based payroll and scheduling services, and most recently introduced an email marketing program for attracting repeat business.      These revenue streams, however, are still nascent areas of potential growth for the company; payments processing still makes up roughly 95 percent of Square’s overall revenues, according to Square’s I.P.O. documents.      On a fully diluted basis, including options and warrants, Square’s market valuation is $3.2 billion, a more-direct comparison to the $6 billion figure achieved in its latest private round.      The lower valuation is especially problematic for Square because when raising private funding, it agreed to what is called a “ratchet,” a way for investors to protect themselves from another round, I.P.O. or sale at a lower price. At $9 a share, the ratchet prompts an additional 10.3 million shares for later investors. These extra shares come at the expense of earlier investors, who see their stakes diluted.      The I.P.O. price was lower than Square’s Series D round, which was sold to Rizvi Traverse and JPMorgan Chase in the middle of September 2012 for $11.01 a share. The Series E of $150 million was conducted in the middle of 2014, and then an addition of $30 million in October 2015, for $15.46 per share to the same investors.      Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase managed the Square offering. The shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SQ. ||||| Shares of Square Inc, the mobile payments company co-founded and still run by Twitter Inc Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, soared as much as 64 percent in their market debut, following a marked-down initial public offering, countering the negative sentiment that has nagged at Silicon Valley startups in recent weeks.      The steeply discounted IPO price, at less than 60 percent of the company's last private valuation, had raised questions about the prospects of other so-called 'unicorns' - startups worth at least $1 billion - that might want or need to go public.      A number of tech IPOs have performed poorly over the past year, and mutual fund investors including Fidelity Investments have been marking down the value of their private tech holdings.      Dispelling some of the gloom, Square's shares jumped to a high of $14.78 in early trading on Thursday and closed at $13.07, booking a 45 percent gain.      The stock pop came after the IPO priced at $9 late on Wednesday, well below the expected range of $11 to $13 and even farther below the $15.46 price of Square's last private financing in 2014. It bucked a difficult stretch for IPOs, which are trading down about 5 percent for the year.      Investors wary of Square's valuation likely waited until the shares landed on the public market to buy, analysts said, and the weak price set on Wednesday created a pile-on Thursday morning that drove the stock higher.      "The IPO buyers have very healthy skepticism about unicorn valuations," said Chris Bulger, managing director of Bulger Partners, a tech advisory firm in Boston.      Despite Square's 42 percent valuation drop from its last private financing round, most backers scored a payday. Investors who bought shares a year ago were protected by a 'ratchet', ensuring they would get a 20 percent return, and early-stage investors bought Square at less than a dollar a share.      “It's still a good game," Bulger said. "Just in the last two rounds you're not getting venture capital-like returns for the risk you are taking."      Square's strong start was followed by a positive debut by online dating empire Match Group Inc, whose shares finished the day up nearly 23 percent.      Tom Donino, co-head of trading at FNY Capital Management, said it is unusual to see a stock trade up so much after pricing below the expected range, as Square's did.      "There's obviously retail and other demand for the stock, but the pricing seems strange," he said. “The fact the stock is now this strong will probably quash" the bearish sentiment around private-company valuations, he added.      Square raised $243 million in its IPO, money the company needs to cover heavy losses. It reported a loss of $131.5 million in the first nine months of the year after losing $117 million in the same period a year earlier, though revenue rose 49 percent to $892.8 million.      The debut comes at a time when slowing global growth and uncertainty about the timing of a U.S. interest rate hike have kept investors on edge.      Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities, said he thought the low price of the offering, which cleared the way for the first-day pop, was a smart move in the current market environment.      “Those particular types of companies - these unicorns that have these crazy valuations - you are going to see some of them become more conservative in their pricing because it makes sense. What they don’t want to do is damage themselves by trying to be so super-aggressive."      DORSEY IN THE SPOTLIGHT      Dorsey, who was celebrating his 39th birthday on Thursday, owns 21.9 percent of Square following the IPO and is the company's biggest shareholder, with a stake now worth almost $930 million.      The high-flying executive is also trying to run Twitter, another company with substantial obstacles to growing profits. Shareholders in both companies have been concerned about Dorsey's dual role.      Square's IPO filings show a net loss of $29.6 million in the second quarter, ballooning to nearly $54 million in the third quarter.      "Square's financials leave much to be desired," said Brian Hamilton, chairman of data firm Sageworks. "But there's still a lot to like here."      Square Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in an interview with Reuters that the company has been investing heavily in new hardware, such as chip-enabled card readers, and building out its lending business, Square Capital.      “The slope of the line is up and to the right in terms of our operating margin," she said. "So we are going to grow but we are going to do it in a disciplined way.”      Friar pointed to the consumer trend of shopping less with cash.      “Still, 40 percent of all commerce is done with cash and check, but slowly that’s eroding. So that’s one big reason for the growth,” she said.      Square, founded in 2009, has built buzz and a substantial customer base with a credit card reader that can turn a mobile device into a payment terminal. It has made its mission to enable any small business to easily accept any form of payment, and also provide them with additional services ranging from lending to payroll management.      But the company faces intense competition in the payments market, with Apple Inc launching its Apple Pay service, Amazon.com Inc exploring in-store payments, and startups such as Stripe Inc entering the fray. Meanwhile big banks and card processors continue to dominate the payment business, and Square has to pay out most of its gross revenues to banks and credit card networks.      Square sold 25.7 million class A common shares in the offering, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. Start Small Foundation, a charitable fund created by Dorsey, sold about 1.35 million shares. The low offering price triggered a 'ratchet' in which late-stage investors get an addition share distribution.

Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and head of the mobile payments company who also turned 39 today, just saw the value of his 69.6 million shares of the company skyrocket along with share of the company on their first day of trading Thursday. Shares of Square jumped $4.07 to $13.07 - taking Dorsey's stake in the company to $910 million.      Dorsey is the largest owner of Square, which is a San Francisco-based company that allows merchants to process credit card payments. Shares were sold to initial investors at $9 a share, which was below the $11 to $13 a share range expected. But Dorsey didn't sell any shares at that price, so he's enjoying the full power of the first day trading. Good move, Jack.      The day's action on Square easily puts Dorsey in the billionaire tech club. Dorsey also owns 21.9 million shares of Twitter (TWTR) which are currently valued at $576 million. Adding that to the Square stake brings Dorsey's worth from just those two companies to $1.5 billion.      Happy birthday indeed.

The latter company—which deals in mobile payments—began trading publicly for the first time Thursday, and shares were trading nearly $4 above the $9 IPO price. Dorsey, who turned 39 Thursday, owns 69.6 million shares, and USA Today calculates his windfall to be $277 million. The strong trading day for Square, combined with other solid debuts from the owner of Match.com and the email security firm Mimecast, is "a welcome relief for the beaten-down market for initial public offerings," notes the Wall Street Journal. On Wednesday, Square's unexpectedly low IPO price led to a spate of worrisome headlines and stories about the state of Silicon Valley, and particularly so-called "unicorns," or startups worth at least $1 billion. "Square's financials leave much to be desired," one industry analyst tells Reuters. "But there's still a lot to like here, and think the success of their debut will say a lot about the current IPO environment."

summarize: In a Friday tweet, President-elect Donald Trump again praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying he was “very smart” for delaying any sanctions against the United States until he took office.      After sending the tweet, Trump even took the unusual measure of “pinning” it, ensuring that would be the first tweet anyone looking at his timeline would see.      Trump’s tweet comes after a long history of praising Putin both during and after the 2016 presidential election, most recently saying that Putin’s criticism of Democrats was “So true!” and that “his thoughts are so correct.”      [Image via screengrab]      —      >>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter      Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Donald Trump is back to fanning the flames of his love affair with Russian president Vladimir Putin.      In a tweet (with no spelling mistakes!), Trump praised Putin's decision to wait on expelling any U.S. diplomats from Russia in retaliation to President Barack Obama's sanctions announced Thursday.      Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016      The Russian foreign minister had made it very clear the country would not take Obama's decision lying down, but then Putin stepped in and told everyone to calm down and wait for Trump's arrival in three short weeks.      This apparently prompted Trump to pull out his favorite megaphone, Twitter. Before Putin's "delay" was announced, Trump on Thursday released a fairly benign statement about meeting with intelligence officials soon. He hadn't tweeted anything about Russian relations and the report of cyberattacks affecting the U.S. election.      Trump even pinned the tweet to the top of his Twitter feed so nobody will miss how Trump "always knew he was very smart!"      The missive was also retweeted by the official U.S. Russian Embassy account. The UK Russian embassy has yet to post a meme about Friday's exclamatory note.

Trump praises Putin over US sanctions – a move that puts him at odds with GOP      Trump praises Putin over US sanctions – a move that puts him at odds with GOP      After the Obama administration’s tough new sanctions against Russia put the president-elect in a vulnerable political position at home, in his own party and abroad, Donald Trump chose to respond in familiar fashion – with praise for Vladimir Putin.      Putin says Russia will not expel US diplomats in tit-for-tat measure Read more      The president-elect has repeatedly spoken approvingly of Putin and called for closer relations with Russia. On Friday, he used Twitter to applaud Putin’s restrained response to the expulsion by the US of 35 diplomats and the closure of two Russian compounds.      Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!      The tweet, like many from Trump that seem calculated to shock and offend, caused a predictable media furore. However, it probably will have done nothing to alleviate the difficult political position in which Trump now finds himself.      The president-elect has been consistently skeptical about the US intelligence consensus that Russia ordered cyber-attacks on Democratic party targets as a way to influence the 2016 election in his favor – the reason for Obama’s new sanctions. At one point, he suggested the culprit might have been China, another state or even a 400lb man in his bedroom.      On taking office in January, Trump might therefore be expected to simply end the Obama sanctions. And as president, he could do so; presidential orders can simply be repealed by the executive branch.      But the situation is not that simple. If Trump did choose to remove the sanctions, he would find himself at odds with his own party. Senior Republicans in Congress responded to the Obama sanctions by identifying Russia as a major geopolitical foe and criticizing the new measures only as a case of too little too late. Some promised a push for further measures in Congress.      Trump may therefore choose not to reverse the new sanctions. If so, he will find himself at odds with the man he so constantly praises.      On Friday, the Kremlin responded to the moves, including the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence operatives and the closing of two Russian facilities in the US, with a shrug. Putin, it seems, is willing simply to wait until Trump moves into the Oval Office. Trump’s tweet suggested he is too.      But such provocative words could not distract the media and public from another domestic concern for Trump – the growing perception that his predecessor has acted to his disadvantage.      “The sanctions were clearly an attempt by the Obama administration to throw a wrench into – or [to] box in – the next administration’s relationship with Russia,” said Boris Zilberman, a Russia expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.      “Putin, in part, saw through that and sidestepped it by playing good cop to [Russian foreign minister Sergey] Lavrov and the [state] Duma, who were calling for a reciprocal response.”      Trump will also face pressure from intelligence agencies, which have concluded that Moscow ordered the election cyber-attacks.      Is Obama using Russia to force a wedge between Trump and his party? | David Klion Read more      “There is now a public record of what Russia did and why they did it,” said Zachary Goldman, executive director of New York University Law School’s Center on Law and Security, referring to a joint Department of Homeland Security and FBI report issued on Thursday.      “Even if the sanctions can be unwound, you can’t make that public statement go away.”      Goldman also noted an international element to the situation facing Trump. It is important to note, he said, that the new executive order enables Obama and his successors to take retaliatory action against efforts to influence elections held by “allies and partners”. Germany and France will hold elections in 2017.      On a call with reporters on Thursday, a senior White House official said the US had “every indication” that Russia would continue to pursue such cyber-attacks.            ‘All Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions’      On the same call, officials expressed confidence that the political risk of appearing to cave in to Moscow would prevent any future administration from unwinding the sanctions.            “If a future president decided that he wanted to allow in a large tranche of Russian intelligence agents, presumably a future president could invite that action,” a senior official said.      “We think it would be inadvisable. As my colleague just said, these diplomatic compounds were being used for intelligence purposes. That is a direct challenge to US national security, and I don’t think it would make much sense to reopen Russian intelligence compounds.”      In his own statement, President Obama said: “All Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions.”      In response, Trump repeated his contention that the issue should be left behind, that Americans should be able to “get on with our lives”. But he did agree to meet intelligence officials next week, to be “updated on the facts”.      In a transition team call on Friday, the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, did not give details of when that meeting would take place or who would attend. No talks were planned with Moscow, he said.      Underlining the challenges awaiting Trump in his own party, most senior Republicans criticized the Obama administration only for acting too slowly.      On Thursday, the Arizona senator John McCain and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham said in a joint statement: “The retaliatory measures announced by the Obama administration today are long overdue.      “But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.”      US expulsions put spotlight on Russia's GRU intelligence agency Read more      The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed, saying: “The Russians are not our friends. And clearly the Obama administration has not yet dissuaded them from attempting to breach our cybersecurity systems, or harass our diplomats in Moscow.”      On Friday, it was reported that McCain, a member of the Senate armed services committee, had scheduled a hearing on foreign cyber threats for 5 January, and called senior intelligence officials to testify.      Analysts were also concerned not with whether the sanctions should have been imposed at all, but rather whether the White House had acted quickly enough, and whether its eventual response was strong enough.      “The sanctions are targeted, not sectoral, and will have a very limited impact,” said Thomas Wright, a fellow and director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institute. “This will not deter Putin from interfering in French or German elections in 2017.”      Though the strength, timing and effect of the new sanctions are contested, Trump faces a bipartisan consensus. Domestically, any attempt to remove Obama’s sanctions against Russia will be a political non-starter. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

summarize: IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Former NFL and Iowa safety Tyler Sash, who died last year at age 27, has been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.      Chris Nowinski of the Boston University-affiliated Concussion Legacy Foundation confirmed the diagnosis on Tuesday night. The New York Times was the first to report the finding.      CTE, which can be diagnosed only after death, has been found in the brains of dozens of former football players. Linked to repeated brain trauma, it is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, impaired judgment, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia.      Sash, who won a Super Bowl during his rookie season with the New York Giants, was found dead at his home on Sept. 8. The Iowa State Medical Examiner's office found he died from an accidental overdose after mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor.      Months after the Super Bowl victory, Sash was suspended for four games in 2012 for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing substances policy by testing positive for Adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The Giants cut ties with Sash prior to the 2013 opener, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the preseason finale against New England.      At Iowa, Sash started 37 games from 2007-10, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in his final season. He bypassed his fourth year of eligibility to enter the NFL draft. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      When the former Giants safety Tyler Sash was found dead at age 27 of an accidental overdose of pain medications at his Iowa home on Sept. 8, his grieving family remained consumed by a host of unanswered questions about the final, perplexing years of Sash’s life.                              Cut by the Giants in 2013 after what was at least his fifth concussion, Sash had returned to Iowa and increasingly displayed surprising and irregular behavior, family members said this week. He was arrested in his hometown, Oskaloosa, for public intoxication after leading the police on a four-block chase with a motorized scooter, a pursuit that ended with Sash fleeing toward a wooded area.      Sash had bouts of confusion, memory loss and minor fits of temper. Although an Iowa sports celebrity, both as a Super Bowl-winning member of the Giants and a popular star athlete at the University of Iowa, Sash was unable to seek meaningful employment because he had difficulty focusing long enough to finish a job.      Barnetta Sash, Tyler’s mother, blamed much of her son’s changeable behavior, which she had not observed in the past, on the powerful prescription drugs he was taking for a football-related shoulder injury that needed surgery. Nonetheless, after his death she donated his brain to be tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated trauma that has been found in dozens of former N.F.L. players.      Photo      Last week, representatives from Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation notified the Sash family that C.T.E. had been diagnosed in Tyler’s brain and that the disease, which can be confirmed only posthumously, had advanced to a stage rarely seen in someone his age.      Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine who conducted the examination, said Tuesday that the severity of the C.T.E. in Sash’s brain was about the same as the level found in the brain of the former N.F.L. star Junior Seau, who committed suicide in 2012 at age 43.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Doctors grade C.T.E. on a severity scale from 0 to 4; Sash was at Stage 2. McKee, comparing the results to other athletes who died at a similar age, said she had seen only one case, that of a 25-year-old former college player, with a similar amount of the disease.      The Sash family, who released the findings, said the outcome brought some clarity to the end of Tyler Sash’s life.      “My son knew something was wrong, but he couldn’t express it,” Barnetta Sash said Monday night. “He was such a good person, and it’s sad that he struggled so with this — not knowing where to go with it.”      She continued: “Now it makes sense. The part of the brain that controls impulses, decision-making and reasoning was damaged badly.”      McKee said that “very classic lesions of C.T.E.” were found in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and in the amygdala. The location of lesions has bearing on symptoms exhibited.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “It helps explain his inattention, his short fuse and his lack of focus,” McKee said.      McKee added: “Even though he was only 27, he played 16 years of football, and we’re finding over and over that it’s the duration of exposure to football that gives you a high risk for C.T.E. Certainly, 16 years is a high exposure.”      An autopsy revealed that the cause of Sash’s death was a lethal mixture of two powerful pain medications, methadone and hydrocodone. A medical examiner called the overdose “accidental drug toxicity,” adding that a recent shoulder dislocation and a history of chronic shoulder pain were “significant conditions” in the death.      Sash, a sixth-round draft pick of the Giants, was primarily a reserve for the team during two seasons, most notably during the team’s 2011 season, which ended with a Super Bowl victory. He played a total of 23 games plus four postseason games and was cut by the Giants weeks before the opener of the 2013 season, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the final game of the preseason.      In 2012, Sash was suspended for four games for violating the N.F.L.’s policy on performance-enhancing substances by testing positive for Adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Sash said at the time that he had used the drug legally under a doctor’s orders to combat anxiety before a public speaking engagement but did not know it was on the league’s banned list.      At Iowa, Sash started 37 games from 2007 to 2010, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in his final season.      Sash came from a football family. His father, Michael, played in college and his brother, Josh, was a good enough high school player that he considered playing in college as well.      Josh Sash, eight years older than Tyler, said his brother sustained at least two concussions in high school, one documented concussion in college and two with the Giants, including one in the Giants’ playoff victory over the San Francisco 49ers that earned the team its berth in the Super Bowl after the 2011 season.      In the San Francisco game, Sash, who was 215 pounds, was blindsided by a brutal and borderline late hit on a punt return by a 281-pound defensive lineman.      “Those concussions are the ones we definitely know about,” Josh Sash said. “If you’ve played football, you know there are often other incidents.”      Experts believe that less severe blows to the head — those not strong enough to cause a concussion — also significantly contribute to the damage that results in C.T.E. These lesser traumas are especially troubling, neurologists say, because they happen frequently in contact sports like football but go undiagnosed.      Josh Sash, who has two young sons, said it would be difficult for him to recommend that his children play football when they grow older. Barnetta Sash, who said she had always loved football, felt similarly.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The N.F.L. has agreed to a court settlement with former players that would compensate them for severe neurological conditions. The settlement is being appealed. Sash’s family would not be eligible for a payment because only the families of players who died and were found to have had C.T.E. before the settlement was approved in April 2015 may receive compensation.      When Tyler Sash returned to Iowa after the Giants released him in 2013, Barnetta Sash said he hid his shoulder injury for some time because he still hoped to sign with another N.F.L. team. Both shoulders had been operated on in college.      “His shoulders were an ongoing problem; he couldn’t sleep on either shoulder,” said Barnetta, who said her son sometimes would go two days without sleeping because of the discomfort.      Tyler received a doctor’s prescription for hydrocodone and awaited doctors’ evaluations about surgery that could repair the shoulder. He worked at jobs doing menial labor but his shoulder was a constant problem, dislocating once as Sash took off his shirt.      In time, the Sash family noticed Tyler’s forgetfulness — he would sometimes repeat himself several times in a conversation. The family told Boston University doctors that Sash had headaches, lost his wallet several times and had trouble doing other routine tasks like composing or reading emails.      “He didn’t quite seem to be the same person he used to be,” Josh Sash said.      Barnetta Sash said Tyler had multiple offers for better-paying or higher-profile jobs.      “He couldn’t focus long enough to do a job,” Barnetta said.      Tyler talked to various people in his circle of friends and family about stories he had read of mental acuity issues, and C.T.E., in former football players.      “He would make comments periodically,” Barnetta said. “He would joke, ‘I’ll be sitting in a nursing home with dementia.’ ”      But Barnetta mainly worried about the pain medications Tyler was taking and felt they were the source of his problems. “We thought the surgery he was going to have would take care of things so he didn’t have to take the medication and we would have our son back,” she said.      Two days before he was found dead, a Sunday, Tyler was at his parents’ house and spent much of the day playing with his nieces and nephews. But he had recently fallen off a ladder and dislocated his shoulder again. His mother and sister popped it back in.      “It must have cracked and snapped 10 times, 20 times,” said Barnetta, adding that Tyler appeared exhausted, which she surmised was from a lack of sleep.      Tyler left his parents’ house Sunday around 9 p.m., making his way to his home in another part of Oskaloosa.      “What I suspect is that he found some methadone from somewhere and he took it to relieve his pain but there are probably special instructions that go with that,” Barnetta said.      The next day, Labor Day, Barnetta went to Tyler’s house, as she often did, to walk his dog.      “I saw him sleeping on the couch,” she said of Tyler. “I was so happy because he had seemed so tired and stressed out.”      She walked the dog, brought it back to the house and quietly closed the door. She returned the next morning, Sept. 8.      “That’s when I found him,” she said. “We think he died Sunday night. He was gone.” ||||| Former New York Giants safety Tyler Sash—who died in September of an accidental painkiller overdose at age 27—had stage 2 chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he died, according to researchers at Boston University. The researchers told Sash’s family that it was rare to see as severe of CTE in such a young brain, coming up with only one example in the hundreds of brains they’ve studied. Stage 2 is the same severity of the degenerative brain disease that former San Diego Chargers great Junior Seau had when he committed suicide at age 43.      The New York Times relays these facts in a harrowing story about Sash’s life after being cut by the Giants, and the toll football took on it. Sash only played for the Giants for two seasons after a standout career at the University of Iowa, but overall he played football for 16 years. He suffered five documented concussions, and likely dozens if not hundreds of the sub-concussive impacts that are increasingly understood to be major contributing factors to brain injuries.      After his NFL career was cut short, Sash returned to Iowa, where he struggled to find work. He was taking painkillers because of chronic injuries to both shoulders, and while the shoulder injuries limited his ability to do manual labor, his inability to focus prevented him from doing any other work. His mother attributed his mental problems—he was forgetful, struggled reading emails, and “didn’t quite seem to be the same person he used to be”—to his regimen of painkillers. But as the examination of his brain makes clear, it was just as injured as his shoulders.

Dr. Ann McKee, the Boston neuropathology chief who led the exam on Tyler Sash's brain, said Tuesday that researchers from Boston University found his CTE ranked at Stage 2, the same level found in the brain of NFL great Junior Seau, who killed himself in 2012. "My son knew something was wrong, but he couldn't express it," Barnetta Sash tells the Times, which notes Tyler Sash had suffered multiple concussions. "Now it makes sense. The part of the brain that controls impulses, decision-making, and reasoning was damaged badly." The AP notes that CTE, which can only be IDed posthumously, is linked to repeated brain trauma and can cause everything from memory loss and impaired judgment to depression. Sash's irregular behavior continued to deteriorate after he was cut from the Giants in 2013 and returned home to Iowa. His mom attributed his issues to strong meds he was taking to ease severe shoulder pain. Even though he was so young to be at such an advanced stage of the disease, McKee notes Sash played football for 16 years. "We're finding over and over that it's the duration of exposure to football that gives you a high risk for CTE," she tells the Times. "Certainly, 16 years is a high exposure." As Deadspin puts it, Sash's brain "was just as injured as his shoulders." (A 25-year-old football player had the "worst CTE" a doctor had ever seen in someone so young.)

"Outstanding work by NEWSWEEK's people has significantly narrowed the losses in the last year and particularly in the last few months. But we do not see a path to continuing profitability under our management."      Graham said the company decided to go public with the news to invite as many potential buyers as possible, and said the sale could be completed within a few months. "Our aim will be--if we can do it--a rapid sale to a qualified buyer," he said. "We're a public company and we have to consider the price offered. But we'll have a second and third criteria: the future of NEWSWEEK and the future of those who work here."      In a later meeting, NEWSWEEK Editor Jon Meacham told the editorial staff that he continues to believe in the mission of the company. Meacham said he would do everything he could to ensure the continuation of the magazine, including personally pitching potential buyers. He also reminded the staff that NEWSWEEK wasn't closed today, but was put on the market.      Graham added, "If anyone should take the blame for this ending, it is me—for not seeing early enough and reacting in the right way to the changes that have come to our industry. But as a former member of this staff, I will always be proud to have been part of NEWSWEEK. And, I will be doing what I can to assist its future and yours."      To that end, NEWSWEEK Inc. Managing Director Ann McDaniel told the staff: "Because we don't have a secret buyer waiting in the wings, because no deal is imminent, some things are unknown. I do hope that you get to stay together as the great team that you are. In case that doesn't happen though, let me make one thing perfectly clear: Any employee, business or editorial, in good standing at the time of the sale, who does not get an offer from the new owner, will get the severance, notice, dismissal and RIF pay described in the contract and in NEWSWEEK's severance policy on the intranet. If you are new to NEWSWEEK, and remain in good standing through the sale, you will get four months of pay."      McDaniel told the staff she was saddened by the news, but that the company has made significant strides in the last year. "Our industry is changing," she said. "NEWSWEEK has changed along with it, and today's announcement reminds us that we must continue to grow, to adapt, to find new ways of serving readers, users and advertisers. I am incredibly proud of what we --really what you--have done in the past year. We are a better magazine, both domestically and internationally. We're a better Web site, and we'll be even stronger after the upcoming launch of our redesigned site. Advertisers like what we are doing and are paying a higher premium for it. Our business processes are better than they have ever been."      NEWSWEEK is an internationally known and respected publication, providing unique news, commentary, and insight into political and social developments in the United States and around the world. The magazine has 1.5 million subscribers in the United States and Canada, publishing 11 editions in more than 190 countries. Newsweek.com attracts 5.1 million unique users. Both the print and digital editions continue to win numerous awards for their journalism.      In a statement, Graham said, "The losses at NEWSWEEK in 2007-2009 are a matter of record. Despite heroic efforts on the part of NEWSWEEK's management and staff, we expect it to still lose money in 2010. We are exploring all options to fix that problem. NEWSWEEK is a lively, important magazine and website, and in the current climate, it might be a better fit elsewhere."      © 2010 |||||	– The Washington Post Company is looking for someone to take Newsweek off its hands, the company announced in a press release today (to the apparent surprise of Newsweek's Tumblr). “The losses at Newsweek in 2007-2009 are a matter of record,” said Donald Graham, chairman of the Post Company. “We expect it to still lose money in 2010. .. Newsweek is a lively, important magazine and website, and in the current climate, it might be a better fit elsewhere.” With a sales pitch that upbeat, it'll sell in no time.
summarize: 'Do not follow me down the road to jihad. Go and get a good education in the West': Osama Bin Laden’s extraordinary instructions to his young children            Osama Bin Laden told his children to live peacefully in the West where they would get a good education, his brother-in-law has revealed.      Zakaria al-Sadah, whose sister is the fifth wife of the Al-Qaeda leader, said Bin Laden did not want his children and grandchildren following in the same path of terrorism like him.      'He told his own children and grandchildren, go to Europe and America and get a good education,' according to an interview with Sadah in The Sunday Times.            Terror: Osama Bin Laden wanted his children to live in west where they would get a good education      Pakistani officials are refusing to release three of Bin Laden's wives and nine of his children who are being held in a tight security compound in Islamabad.      According to Sadah, who was recently reunited with his sister, his children have been left traumatised by the raid carried out by US Navy Seals on May 2 last year which killed Bin Laden.      The children were discovered hiding in Bin Laden's compound in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad.            Sadah, a 24-year-old journalism student, says the children will not eat and have not seen the sun for nine months.            He said the worst affected was his 12-year-old daughter Safiyah, who held the head of her injured mother during the attack.            Protest: Amal, one of three wives, being held in Islamabad      Amal, a 29-year-old Yememi, and the two other wives, Khairiah and Siham, have gone on hunger strike to protest against their imprisonment, according to Sadah.            Sadah, who fears his sister could be charged with committing crimes against Pakistan, thought he would be given permission to take the children back to Yemin when he was asked to visit last November.      But Pakistani officials believe they could be hiding information and have so far refused to issue them with passports.            He said: 'These children have seen their father killed and they need a caring environment, not a prison - whatever you think of their father and what he has done.'      'They have never had a normal life. They do not know what it is like to see the sun and to run around the garden. It breaks my heart to see them.'            The wives are said to have remained loyal to their husband and were openly hostile to the U.S. officials who interviewed them after the raid.      None have been charged with any crime.      Amal, the youngest of the three widows, was shot in the leg as she lunged at Navy Seals to try to protect her husband during the raid.            A photo of sixteen-year-old Hamza Bin Laden, a son of Osama Bin Laden      She was reportedly given the chance years earlier to leave her marriage to the world's most wanted terrorist but chose instead to be 'martyred' by his side telling family and friends that she wanted to 'go down in history.'      She lived in the Abbottabad compound with the two elder wives Khairiah Sabar, a child psychologist, and Siham Sabar, a teacher of Arabic.      Each wife and her children were allotted their own floor and Bin Laden would spend time with each group.      Khairiah, who was reportedly the 'spiritual mother' of the family, had slipped back into Pakistan to rejoin her husband after she had escaped to Iran and the Saudi Arabia.      Siham fled Afghanistan and went into hiding for several years, until she was called to return to the terror leader. ||||| Blair: crush Isis or horror will intensify Tim Shipman, Political Editor TONY BLAIR has called for Britain to step up military action to "crush" Isis or be faced...

"He told his own children and grandchildren, go to Europe and America and get a good education," says Zakara al-Sadah, whose sister was the al-Qaeda chief's fifth wife. For now, Sadah claims, Pakistani authorities are holding nine bin Laden children and three wives—including Sadah's sister—in an Islamabad security compound against their will, reports the Daily Mail via The Sunday Times.

summarize:      (Getty Images)      Actor Alec Baldwin is no stranger to unhappy run-ins with the paparazzi—and earlier on Sunday, he was involved in yet another such altercation. Baldwin told us he was assaulted by a NY Post photographer near his East Village apartment, and called the cops to file a formal complaint against him. But it seems the photographer is planning on accusing Baldwin of using a racial epithet against him. "If you want to paint a picture of me that is a denigrating picture, I've seen that," Baldwin told us. "If you want to put words in my mouth...I've certainly had my moments. But this is not one of them. I don't think I've ever uttered a racial epithet to someone in my lifetime."      Baldwin said he was returning home from the gym when the altercation took place. "This guy was right up in my face as I crossed University Place," he told us, saying the photographer—who may have been following him due to the recent lawsuit against his wife—was acting aggressively. "I get to the other side of the street, and he bumped into me." He believes it was a very deliberate provocation: "He banged into me with his shoulder, because he was right on top of me with the camera," he added. "In my mind, it was deliberate. I've had that happen before. It happens sometimes, because they want to bait you, they want you to do something."      Baldwin noted some of his previous experiences with photographers from The Post and other local dailies, recalling one time around his wedding last summer to Hilaria Thomas when a photographer tripped and sat on a baby in a stroller while trying to get a photo of him. "My wife is pregnant and I'm trying to make sure she has as much peace as possible," he said. "Who knows what these people can do."      So after he got home, Baldwin called the cops; two cop cars and four officers, who he said were nothing but kind and professional, responded and took his complaint. He also tweeted about the experience. The photographer, who was still there at the time, claimed he was a former cop himself, and was able to provide valid ID to prove it. Considering that, Baldwin is perplexed by what happened later: "My publicist has informed me that the "photographer" from the Post is claiming I called him a racial epithet, prior to me contacting NYPD," he tweeted.      He further explained to us: "When they were there, no one made any mention of anything. While police were here, you'd figure that'd be an opportune time for this guy to really attempt to tar me in some way. But there was no mention of anything I said to him, no one said anything about me saying the N-word or taunting him or anything. So it was after the fact. He wants to say I used some racial slur against him."      As he put it in a separate tweet, "Why did the photographer make no mention of this when the cops showed up? Cops make rather good witnesses." We've contacted The Post for comment about the confrontation, but they have not responded as of publication.      Baldwin is clearly frustrated that these kinds of interactions keep happening, although he is not too concerned about people taking the photographer's accusations seriously: "I don't think anyone who knows me would think that was possible."      He had strong words for the newspaper however: "The Post will stop at nothing—that's what The Post is. Their function is to denigrate people, humiliate people, reduce people, make excuses for people who are their political partisans. It's a highly biased, highly politicized group of people. However, I'm stunned that they would resort to that." He concluded, "Even for The Post, this is a new low."      UPDATE: Here's the NY Post's story. ||||| Actor Alec Baldwin allegedly called a black Post photographer a racial epithet, a “crackhead” and a “drug dealer” during a confrontation on an East Village street yesterday morning, prompting police to intervene.      Baldwin had first been approached by a Post reporter while walking his dogs outside his East 10th Street pad at around 10:50 a.m. He was asked for comment on a lawsuit against his wife, Hilaria, involving her work as a yoga instructor.      The “30 Rock’’ star grabbed the reporter, Tara Palmeri, by her arm and told her, “I want you to choke to death,” Palmeri told police, for whom she played an audiotape of the conversation.      He then called G.N. Miller — a decorated retired detective with the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau and a staff photographer for The Post — a “coon, a drug dealer,’’ Miller’s police statement said.      At one point, Miller showed Baldwin ID to prove he’s a retired NYPD cop, which Baldwin dismissed as “fake.”      Cops were called, and Miller, 56, and Baldwin, 54, both filed harassment claims against each other.      Minutes later, Baldwin ranted on Twitter.      “Thank u 2 NYPD officers who came to my home 2day so that I could file a formal complaint against NY Post “photographer’’ who assaulted me,’’ he tweeted.      In another post, Baldwin referred to Miller, for unknown reasons, as “Ralston,” writing, “Moments after I tweet about the Post, Ralston, the ex-crackhead ‘photographer’ shows up at my door w 1 of Murdoch’s nieces in tow.”      He added, “Ralston claims he’s ex NYPD!! That can’t be!!! Ex NYPD don’t become crackhead, ex jailhouse paparazzi!”      The actor eventually removed most of the posts.      Miller also said the actor bumped him in the chest during their tete-a-tete, although Baldwin told cops the photographer “pushed into him,’’ according to the actor’s complaint.      Baldwin said he “asked [Miller] to keep his distance,’’ the complaint said.      But Miller said Baldwin was the one getting “too aggressive,’’ so he showed him his retired-cop ID.      Baldwin called the ID a “fake’’ and added Miller was a “crackhead” and a “drug dealer” who “just got out of jail,” Miller said.      Baldwin also made “disparaging remarks’’ about Miller’s mother, the photographer said.      As oblivious pedestrians walked by, Baldwin told him to “suck my d–k,” Miller said.      Baldwin also walked up to random people — including a dad pushing his child in a stroller — and told them Miller was an ex-con and drug dealer, Miller said.      “He was saying some serious racist stuff,” Miller said. “He said some choice words about my mother, and he was telling people in the street that I’m a drug dealer.      “He could have said a lot of other stuff. But he used all of the stereotypes associated with black people.”      Miller worked for the NYPD for nearly 15 years, spending most of his time in narcotics.      Although both men made police reports, it’s a case of he said-he said because the incident did not happen in the presence of a police officer.      Neither police complaint will go any further, except in possible civil action.      Baldwin’s spokesman, Matthew Hiltzik, called Miller’s accusations “completely false.’’      Baldwin, through Hiltzik, denied making the racist remarks, adding, “That’s one of the most outrageous things I’ve heard in my life.’’      But Baldwin has a history of making inappropriate comments to photographers.      Last June, the day before his wedding, Baldwin shouted to a black photographer on the street, “You gotta back up there Rodney.”      The photographer’s name wasn’t Rodney. |||||	– Is Alec Baldwin going down the Mel Gibson road? A New York Post reporter says that when she approached Baldwin yesterday morning while he was walking his dogs, he grabbed her by the arm and told her, "I want you to choke to death." He then allegedly called a black Post photographer who was with her a "coon," an "ex-con," and a "drug dealer." Reporter Tara Palmeri, who had been asking Baldwin about the yoga lawsuit recently filed against his wife, apparently got the encounter on tape and played it for police. The cops were called, and both Baldwin and the photographer, GN Miller, filed harassment claims against one another. Miller, who the Post identifies several times as a former NYPD detective, claimed Baldwin bumped him in the chest, while Baldwin claimed Miller "pushed into him." Humorous tidbit: The police report also claims Baldwin made "disparaging remarks" about Miller's mother. Baldwin talked to Gothamist about the encounter, calling it a "new low" for the Post and posing the following question about the supposed slur, "Why did the photographer make no mention of this when the cops showed up? Cops make rather good witnesses."
summarize: Virginia bans child marriages: How common are they in the US?      The world’s largest radio telescope China completed Sunday could answer one of mankind’s oldest questions about the cosmos: is there other life out there?      China’s Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, could have the ability to detect alien life, as it searches space for strange objects such as neutral hydrogen, faint pulsars, and low frequency gravitational waves, according to China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency. The telescope, which China hopes is operational by September, will be open to the global scientific community in up to three years.      The magnitude of the $185 million, 500-meter-wide telescope with 4,450 panels attests to the world’s increasing commitment to searching for other life in the galaxy. The discovery that life forms on Earth can survive in the harshest environments, as well as estimates the Milky Way, alone, has thousands of Earth-like planets, has spurred these investments.      “The telescope is of great significance for humans to explore the universe and extraterrestrial civilizations,” Liu Cixin, a science fiction writer, and winner of the 2015 Hugo science fiction award award for his novel, “The Three Body Problem,” told Xinhua. “I hope scientists can make epoch-making discoveries.”      The telescope’s size manifests its abilities to explore 1,000 light years into space. It was built into a natural karst depression in southwest China’s Guizhou province, protecting it from electromagnetic disruption, according to Time Magazine. And it’s circumference is one-mile long.      The telescope is designed to search for disparities in space. It should be able to survey neutral hydrogen in distant galaxies, and detect faint pulsars, improbably dense, small neutron stars that emit radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation. The first extrasolar planets were found around pulsars. The telescope is expected to also be able to better detect low-frequency gravitational waves.      "A radio telescope is like a sensitive ear, listening to tell meaningful radio messages from white noise in the universe. It is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm," Nan Rendong, chief scientist of the FAST project with the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua.      China next plans to debug the hardware and test it. Once the telescope is operational, the country's scientists will have exclusive access to it over the next two to three years, according to Xinhua. After that, the telescope will be available to the global scientific community, just as the current world’s largest radio telescope, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, is now.      The $185 million investment by China, coupled with a $100 million investment by the Breakthrough Prize Foundation last year, is a far cry from how the world previously sponsored searches for alien life, as Pete Spotts reported for The Christian Science Monitor in July 2015      Until now, the hunt for signals generated by intelligent life elsewhere in the universe has operated on a shoestring and, at least early on, was widely seen as quixotic. But evidence on Earth that simple forms of life can thrive in environments hostile to humans, as well as the discovery of thousands of planets orbiting other stars, has added energy to the effort. The discovery of these extrasolar planets has led to estimates that the Milky Way alone holds billions of Earth-mass planets orbiting within their host star's habitable zone – a distance at which liquid water, essential for organic life, can persist on a planet's surface.      That year, the Breakthrough Prize Foundation awarded $100 million to the SETI Institute (Search for extraterrestrial intelligence) for a 10-year search using two large radio telescopes to hunt for radio signals, and an optical telescope to search for laser communications. SETI projects previously ran about $2 million a year.      With all these efforts, the scientific community has little to show or hear from ET. Yet some researchers have said scientists have been looking in the wrong places.      In a study published in the journal Astrobiology in March, researchers suggested scientists look for signals from extraterrestrial life the same way they would search for us — in Earth’s “transit zone,” where the light of the sun starts to dim as an orbiting planet passes by.      In another study published in the Astrophysical Journal in May, researchers suggested looking for alien life around planets with dying stars. The idea behind that is as stars heat up before they die, they could warm frozen planets, supporting alien life.      Others worry about China’s intention for the telescope and the rest of its space program. It has said its space program is for peaceful purposes, but the US State Department has said China’s program could be to “prevent adversaries from using spaced based assets in a crisis,” according to Reuters.      Nevertheless, the telescope is just one step to discovering if the truth about ET is out there.      "Our generation, or maybe the next one after that, has a reasonable chance of finding the answer to this question: Are we alone?" Dan Werthimer, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, told Mr. Spotts for Monitor in July 2015. ||||| PINGTANG, July 3, 2016 (Xinhua) -- The aerial photo taken on July 3, 2016 shows the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Pingtang County, southwest China's Guizhou Province. Installation was completed on the world's largest radio telescope on Sunday morning as the last of 4,450 panels was fitted into the center of the big dish. Scientists will then begin debugging and trial observation of the FAST. (Xinhua/Liu Xu)      GUIYANG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Installation was completed on the world's largest radio telescope on Sunday morning as the last of 4,450 panels was fitted into the center of the big dish.      Hoisting of the last triangular panel to the reflector, which is the size of 30 football fields, began at 10:47 a.m. and lasted about an hour. It was a landmark step for the telescope's planned launch of operations in September.      About 300 people, including builders, experts, science fiction enthusiasts and reporters, witnessed the installation at a karst valley in Pingtang County in the southwestern province of Guizhou.      "The telescope is of great significance for humans to explore the universe and extraterrestrial civilizations," said Liu Cixin, a renowned science fiction writer, at the site.      "I hope scientists can make epoch-making discoveries," said Liu, who won the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel.      Scientists will then begin debugging and trial observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), said Zheng Xiaonian, deputy head of the National Astronomical Observation (NAO) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which built the telescope.      The project has the potential to search for more strange objects to better understand the origin of the universe and boost the global hunt for extraterrestrial life, said Zheng.      Zheng said the radio telescope will be the global leader for the next 10 to 20 years.      In the first two or three years after its completion, the telescope will undergo further adjustment, and during that period Chinese scientists will use it for early-stage research. After that, it will be open to scientists worldwide, said Peng Bo, director of the NAO Radio Astronomy Technology Laboratory.      Scientists can also carry out remote control and observation in other cities such as Beijing, more than 2,000 kilometers from the telescope site, said Peng.      Upon completion, the telescope will dwarf Puerto Rico's Arecibo Observatory, which is 300 meters in diameter. It will also be 10 times more sensitive than the steerable 100-meter telescope near Bonn, Germany, he said.      "Most of the technology and materials are domestically made," said Wang Qiming, chief technologist of the FAST project.      Among the 7 FAST receivers, five were domestically made and another two were co-produced by Chinese, Australian and American institutions.      Work on the 1.2-billion-yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) FAST project began in 2011.      EYE ON THE SKY      Radio telescopes have made major astronomical discoveries, such as pulsars, quasars and cosmic microwave background radiation. Among the 10 Nobel Prizes in physics awarded for discoveries related to cosmology and space, six were attributed to radio telescopes.      "As the world's largest single aperture telescope located at an extremely radio-quiet site, its scientific impact on astronomy will be extraordinary, and it will certainly revolutionize other areas of the natural sciences," said Nan Rendong, chief scientist with the FAST Project.      FAST will enable astronomers to get a jump-start on many scientific goals, including surveying neutral hydrogen in distant galaxies and detecting faint pulsars.      Scientists also expect breakthroughs on pulsars, the highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit a beam of electromagnetic radiation. So far more than 2,000 pulsars have been detected.      "Pulsars can help scientists study gravitational waves," Chen added.      As China joins international efforts in gravitational wave detection, FAST will help improve the chances of detecting low frequency gravitational waves, said Wu Xiangping, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who predicted great breakthroughs in this area in the years ahead.      For ordinary people, perhaps the most exciting goal of FAST is the search for alien life.      In two or three years, scientists could find amino acids, the foundation block of life. There is a great chance that people will someday find life on other planets or galaxies, said Li Di, an NAO researcher.      "FAST's potential to discover an alien civilization will be 5 to 10 times that of current equipment, as it can see farther and darker planets," said Peng Bo.      "THANK THE ALIENS"      It has been more than two decades since Chinese scientists proposed building FAST in Guizhou.      In 1994, site surveying started on geo-morphological features and the distribution of karst depressions, climate, engineering environment, social environment, and radio interference.      Engineer Zhu Boqin worked on the site selection 20 years ago. He recalled that after more than two hours trudging on the rugged mountain road, about 150 kilometers south of the provincial capital Guiyang, he was impressed by the sight of a large, round depression embraced by verdant hills.      It was home to 65 people from 12 families in a closed-off world called "Green Water Village." Lacking electricity, the villagers had a clear view of the starlit sky at night.      Zhu said that though the villagers did not understand the radio telescope, they were excited when scientists explained that they would use it to search for intelligent beings on other planets. Formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, the karst formations create naturally spherical depressions. This saved efforts in digging hollows for the dish, said Li Di.      The three hills around the depression formed an equilateral triangle, creating a perfect holder for the dish, Li said.      The karst formation is also good for draining rainwater and protecting the reflector, Zhu said. Moreover, the surrounding area has "radio silence" as there are no towns within a 5-km radius, and only one county seat within 25 km.      The site was eventually chosen for the FAST Project.      Residents were moved away to towns in 2009, where they enjoy better living standards. Villagers in nearby communities admired their luck, saying they should "thank the aliens."      "I never thought the first time I would move would be to make way for a telescope," said Yang Chaolan, 62, who now lives in a government-funded two-story building in the seat of Kedu Township.      Her son, Yang Tianyou, 29, plans to open a restaurant or supermarket in hopes that growing tourism will bring him fortune.      According to a government plan, 9,110 residents living within five kilometers of the telescope will be resettled in Pingtang County and Luodian County in four settlements by the end of September. ||||| BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Sunday hoisted the final piece into position on what will be the world’s largest radio telescope, which it will use to explore space and help in the hunt for extraterrestrial life, state media said.      The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, is the size of 30 football fields and has been hewed out of a mountain in the poor southwestern province of Guizhou.      Scientists will now start debugging and trials of the telescope, Zheng Xiaonian, deputy head of the National Astronomical Observation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which built the telescope, told the official Xinhua news agency.      “The project has the potential to search for more strange objects to better understand the origin of the universe and boost the global hunt for extraterrestrial life,” the report paraphrased Zheng as saying.      The 1.2-billion yuan ($180 million) radio telescope would be a global leader for the next one to two decades, Zheng added.      The telescope, which has taken about five years to build, is expected to begin operations in September.      Advancing China’s space program is a priority for Beijing, with President Xi Jinping calling for the country to establish itself as a space power.      China’s ambitions include putting a man on the moon by 2036 and building a space station, work on which has already begun.      China insists its program is for peaceful purposes, but the U.S. Defense Department has highlighted China’s increasing space capabilities, saying it is pursuing activities aimed to prevent adversaries from using space-based assets in a crisis. |||||	– Extraterrestrial life could soon join gunpowder and papermaking on the list of great Chinese discoveries. According to Xinhua, the final piece was on Sunday fitted on FAST—the Five-hundred-meter-wide Aperture Spherical Telescope, which happens to be the size of 30 football fields. The installation in Guizhou province in southwest China now has months of tests and debugging ahead before it enters service as the world's largest radio telescope in September, taking the title from the 300-meter Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the BBC reports. Chinese authorities expect the $185 million telescope, which has been under construction since 2011, to lead the global search for aliens and unusual space objects for as many as 20 years to come. "The telescope is of great significance for humans to explore the universe and extraterrestrial civilizations," science fiction writer Liu Cixin told Xinhua after the final panel was fitted on Sunday. "I hope scientists can make epoch-making discoveries." The telescope will be reserved for Chinese scientists for the next two to three years, after which it will be opened up to researchers worldwide, reports the Christian Science Monitor, which notes that China's investment is part of a major stepping up of the search for alien life. The US Defense Department has expressed misgivings about China's broader space ambitions, which include plans to put a person on the moon by 2036, Reuters reports. (More than 9,000 villagers are being evicted because of the project.)
summarize: Zimmerman lawyer: Client convicted by media      (CBS News) Lawyers for George Zimmerman said their client has been convicted by the media for the shooting of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin, and that no crime was committed under Florida's "Stand Your Ground" statute because the neighborhood watch volunteer acted out of fear for his life.      Appearing on "CBS This Morning," attorney Hal Uhrig said that the fatal shooting of Martin on February 26 has been presented by the media as a "rush to judgment story - I guess that started with Johnnie Cochran and the O.J. Simpson case. It's certainly an example here. This case had momentum created by a lot of misinformation."      Uhrig pointed, as an example, to a picture of Martin that shows him apparently as a "12-year-old boy instead of a 6'3" [17]-year-old varsity football player who got into a confrontation with somebody six inches shorter than him."      Complete Coverage: The Trayvon Martin Shooting      When asked by Charlie Rose what Zimmerman would like to tell the public about the events of that night, Uhrig replied, "The short version of that is that he didn't commit any crime. He was where he was allowed to be, not committing a crime, confronted by someone else who started the violent confrontation physically. He was attacked, broke his nose, hit his head into the ground and he defended himself. That's not against the law."      Uhrig said the Florida "Stand Your Ground" statute applied because Zimmerman feared for his life: "One of the points people have said, the force [used against Martin] was too much, even if he broke his nose and slammed his head into the ground. Many people remember the case of Liam Neeson's wife - fell on a little ski slope, hit her head one time on the ground, and died. We're familiar with the shaken baby syndrome: You shake a baby the brain shakes around inside the skull, you can die.      "When someone is pounding your head on the ground, and you've already had your nose broken, you could be in reasonable fear for great bodily harm - which is what the Florida statute calls for - and if you think you're about to lose your life or be seriously injured like that, you're absolutely entitled to take the necessary action to stop it."      "Are you saying that's what Mr. Zimmerman said - he thought he was in fear of losing his life and so he shot Trayvon Martin?" asked Rose.      "I can confirm that without telling you any specific words, that's exactly what he thought," Urhig replied.      Craig Sonner, another Zimmerman attorney, said law enforcement agrees with Zimmerman's decision to stay in hiding, citing threats against his client. In fact, both lawyers confirmed that they have not met with Zimmerman face-to-face, only speaking by phone, though Uhrig said an in-person meeting would happen "fairly soon."      Uhrig explained that procedurally the State Attorney of Duvall County Angela Corey, who was assigned by Florida's governor to the case, will take her time in her investigation and then decide whether or not to take it to a grand jury.      "If she takes it to a grand jury, then at least 12 members of the grand jury would have to vote for either an indictment or what's called a 'no true' bill, which is to say, 'Wow if you look at all the evidence now instead of just listening to the loudest voice in the crowd, it really was not a crime,'" Uhrig said.

SANFORD, Florida "Shaken Baby Syndrome" was cited on Friday in the defense of George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Florida, man who shot and killed unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, in a case that has sparked a widespread public outcry.      Hal Uhrig, a lawyer and former Gainesville, Florida, police officer who recently joined Zimmerman's defense team, cited in a TV interview the brain damage that can seriously injure or kill an infant.      His point, which has been made before, was that Zimmerman contends he shot Martin in self defense and feared for his life after the 17-year-old attacked him and began pounding his head into the concrete pavement of a gated community on a rainy evening in Sanford on February 26.      But Uhrig's choice of words, and use of a recognized sign of child abuse to defend a 28-year-old man who killed a kid, seemed likely to raise more than just a few eyebrows.      "We're familiar with the Shaken Baby Syndrome," said Uhrig on the CBS This Morning program. "You shake a baby, the brain shakes around inside the skull. You can die when someone's pounding your head into the ground."      Apart from saying his client suffered a broken nose, Uhrig did not elaborate on the extent of any injuries Zimmerman actually suffered. But characteristic injuries associated with SBS, as Shaken Baby Syndrome is known, include bleeding in the brain. There are often no visible external signs such injuries have occurred.      Police have not arrested Zimmerman because the use of lethal force in self defense is permitted under the Stand Your Ground law approved by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in 2005.      The lack of an arrest in the Martin case has triggered protests across the United States. A special prosecutor appointed by Governor Rick Scott is investigating to decide whether charges are warranted, amid allegations of racial profiling and initial police bungling of the case.      If it goes to trial, Unrig said he and his fellow defense attorney, would defend Zimmerman under the Stand Your Ground statute.      "He didn't commit any crime," Unrig said on CBS. "He was attacked, broke his nose, hit his head into the ground and he defended himself. That's not against the law."      A USA Today/Gallup poll published on Saturday showed that Americans are deeply divided across color lines in their opinions about Martin's killing.      Seventy-three percent of blacks in the survey said they believed Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, would have been arrested if the person he shot dead was white.      Only 33 percent of whites agreed with that view while the majority of whites polled, 52 percent, said race made no difference in the case.

"People have said, the force was too much even if he broke his nose and slammed his head into the ground," Uhrig said. "We're familiar with Shaken Baby Syndrome. You shake a baby, the brain shakes around inside the skull. You can die." Reuters writes that Uhrig's "use of a recognized sign of child abuse to defend a 28-year-old man who killed a kid seemed likely to raise more than just a few eyebrows." The wire also notes that there are no signs that Zimmerman suffered a brain bleed consistent with SBS. Uhrig also made the strange choice of apparently likening his client to OJ Simpson.

The last three years haven’t provided much enticement for adventurers aiming to scale the world’s highest mountain, mainly because of the massive avalanche in 2014 and earthquake in 2015. Climbing the world’s highest mountain has come under scrutiny, as the death toll since the last decades has inched close to 300 people. More Sherpas have been killed on Everest in the last three years than ever before.      With the world watching, the future of climbing Mount Everest is becoming unclear. It’s currently a big business, as more and more Western and European expedition companies are bringing in clients who pay between $40,000 and $50,000, but costs can even climb as high as $100,000. Yet Sherpa guides and porters get only a little piece of that overall amount and have begun to take a stand demanding a higher cut.      For a look into the future of climbing on Mount Everest, I spoke with Reinhold Messner, the legendary climber and one of the world’s foremost experts in climbing without supplementary oxygen. In 1978 the South Tyrolean, together with Austria’s Peter Habeler, became the first person in the world to climb Everest without supplementary oxygen. Just to prove he wasn’t lucky, he did it again two years later with supplementary oxygen in the first solo attempt on Everest. The climb was defined as one of the most astounding feats in mountaineering history. Messner is also the first person to climb all 14 of the world’s highest peaks above 8,000 meters. Below is an excerpt from an exclusive interview with Messner recently in Vienna, Austria, with the famous climber sharing his concern over the future of climbing on Everest. It has been edited for clarity.      Saransh Sehgal: As summer is soon approaching, climbers are gearing up to make their way to Base Camp. Do you think that the incidents in last three years (the avalanches, earthquake, and the increasing number of deaths) has changed climbing on Everest?      Reinhold Messner: Even though the last year was okay, there will also be deaths this year. It’s logical that if 500 people are going there, some of them will die. Around 10 will die; that’s the number [I would guess].      Climbing has totally changed. Today, climbing is a global issue. This year maybe 200 Indians will go to Everest on the piste [a track of firm snow] and since it is possible that Everest is prepared from the base to the summit, many people can go there. But this is not alpinism, this is tourism. People are buying the possibility to go up the piste on Everest. Everything is prepared: the doctors are there, the guides are there, the icefall doctors are there, and they go up. It’s not every year that they prepare them and if the Sherpas or local guides do not prepare the mountains, nobody goes up. Two years ago when Everest was closed after the avalanche and the Nepalese [government] allowed the Sherpas to prepare Manaslu. So immediately 200 people changed from [climbing] Everest to Manaslu because they had a piste built up there. They [climbers] did not go to Kanchenjunga where nobody had prepared anything.      So climbing on Everest has drastically changed over the past two decades. In your own words: “Now, anyone with enough money can pay a commercial guide service to take them to the top. This isn’t true alpinism.” What’s your take on that?      Climbing Everest is becoming more like a business. But I think a commercial guide is not enough; you need a piste. Most of the commercial guides will not be able to go on Everest without a piste. [When I climbed Everest,] I could not start at midnight because then there was nothing but snow — no trail, nothing. A head lamp does not help because you won’t see anything and at the least one might end up finishing on the south face or the east face of the Everest. Now there is a piste and you can start during midnight and follow the footsteps.      Sherpa climbers face various issues and resentment among Sherpas is increasing each year. What do you think is the real problem and what do you suggest to resolve this?      I think there are two problems regarding the Sherpas. The Sherpas know that they are the key figures for success for their clients and the young Sherpas are beginning to wonder why they [climbers] are coming with foreign organizers. They [foreign organizers] make a lot of money because they sell Everest climbs for up to $90,000 to $100,000. The sherpas do it now for about $30,000, all inclusive. They would like to have the market in their own hands and I think slowly they will be able to do it.      Before it was not a business for the Sherpa people. On my expedition, no Sherpa was able to go out in front one meter; he followed. We went, we put the ladders in, and we did some fixed ropes and they followed, prepared the food, put up the tent, and went back again.      I remember very well I did the whole Lhotse face when preparing for our expedition. Only one of the Austrians helped me and partly I was alone. The Sherpas were following me and they had the ropes. But I went ahead. If I would say, “Now I’m tired, you go ahead,” They would say, “No, we follow on the fixed ropes.”      And, now it’s exactly the opposite. All this is done by the Sherpas. They are very good climbers and they can guide like the alpine guides. The best guides in the Himalayas are Sherpas today. And these organizers need the Sherpas to guide their clients up to the summit. The Sherpas have a lot of experience, they know where things are dangerous and how to behave.      What is your message or advice to climbers wishing to summit Mount Everest in 2017 given the season is soon approaching?      I think they have to be careful. We do not know what is happening and how the Sherpas will make the rope line. But I think now they are climbing again in the center of the icefall. When they had this big avalanche when 16 people died, they were too much on the left side. I was at the base camp and I told them that you’re too much on the left side, because if ice breaks, you’re under it. And this is what happened afterwards. Staying on the left and right side is dangerous. There are deep crevasses which can open and a ladder can break; many other things are possible.      Any special message is not helpful. People are not listening; they only listen if they die there – and then it’s too late. They have the feeling that nothing can happen, but still it’s dangerous. I would say that some non-climbers are starting to climb without some infrastructure. All these people are not able to climb Mount Blanc; they are blindly following this line and they do not know what is happening up there. Often when I give a lecture some young managers come to me and say, “Mr. Messner, I would also like to go to Mount Everest. How do I have to prepare?” I ask them, “Which mountains have you have already climbed up to now?” And they say none of them, and I tell them it’s better to start learning about climbing and start with smaller mountains. And all of a sudden they’re saying, “But my secretary did it last year so I would also like to do it.” (big laugh).      Could you share your special relationship with Tibetan Buddhism?      My approach to Tibetan Buddhism is double.      First, Tibetan culture is a special culture. I’m not a Buddhist but the Milarepa [a famous Tibetan Yogi] is one of the most important mountaineers for me of all time. The European, American, and Japanese world is based on consumption and this is one of the world’s biggest problems today. The world is becoming more and more a consuming world. And the Milarepa philosophy focuses on doing exactly the opposite — that is to live and have a minimalist lifestyle and I truly believe in that.      Secondly, I wish that the Tibetan people would get autonomy. When I was in Brussels I had many contacts with the Dalai Lama and I also went to China to discuss these things but the Chinese were very strict. But you have to know that now there is a small hope. These Tibetan stones and Tibetan art are not mostly bought by the Swiss, the English, or by me. The market is now in Hong Kong and young rich Chinese are paying a fortune to get Tibetan art. That means they respect it and if they come in power they will change their behavior in front of Tibetans. I have hope now that slowly, by discussing the whole issue, it would be possible to give Tibetans their autonomy. And only if the Tibetans become autonomous and can save their culture and their religion will Tibet have more tourism. The Chinese will understand [that] because they always think in money.

(Tashi Sherpa/Associated Press)      British mountaineer Tim Mosedale was descending Mount Everest’s treacherous Khumbu Icefall after a recent acclimatization run when he came across a large group of inexperienced climbers struggling with their gear. One even had his crampons on the wrong feet.      Such big groups, along with climbers trying to work without supplemental oxygen, are creating a potential “toxic mix” on the world’s highest peak this year, Mosedale, who has ascended Everest five times, wrote in a Facebook post April 27.      Nepal is bracing for a busy and potentially dangerous season on Mount Everest after the government issued a record number of permits to foreigners this year — 371, the most since 1953. Add to that the number of Nepali sherpa mountain guides, and the number soars to 800.      Officials said they expect “traffic jam”-like conditions on the icy slopes as mid-May approaches and the mountain’s formidable winds subside a bit, giving climbers a narrow window to try to reach the 29,029-foot summit.      “On average, every climbing season there are about three to four good days with appropriate weather conditions to allow a safe summit climb,” says Ang Tshering Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. With 800 climbers attempting to summit within those few days, things could get problematic, he said.      Meanwhile, Everest Base Camp — the tent city where climbers live for several weeks to acclimatize themselves to the altitude — has continued to grow, with more trekkers and tourists flying in by helicopter for day trips, and some even indulging in champagne breakfasts with a view.            British DJ Paul Oakenfold braved thinning air and freezing temperatures to host the “highest party on Earth” at Everest Base Camp on April 11, playing for about 100 climbers, all in full mountain gear. (Anton Nelson/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)      Safety is a constant topic in the gossip and rumors of the camp, which is home to more than 1,500 volunteer medics, staff members and mountaineers.      “We are of course worried about the high numbers,” said Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, a Nepali guide who has reached the summit of Everest six times and is now leading a team. He spoke by telephone. “Our discussions around base camp are often focused on the same issue: what to do if traffic-related problems occur.”      Last year, he said, he and his clients were delayed four hours on their way to the summit — including an hour waiting at the bottom of the famous “Hillary Step,” the nearly vertical wall of rock and ice named after Sir Edmund Hillary where climbers ascend on fixed ropes, one of the final challenges of the ascent.      At 28,900 feet, this is deep inside the Death Zone, where the thin air and high altitude can be especially dangerous.      Two of his clients eventually lost toes, the sherpa said, because of the chill they suffered during the wait, he said.      Already, one climber this season has died: Swiss rock climber and mountaineer Ueli Steck fell Sunday during a training run on a nearby peak.            Swiss climber Ueli Steck, pictured at the foot of a climbing wall in Wilderswil, Canton of Berne, Switzerland, fell to his death Sunday during a training run near Mount Everest. (Christian Beutler/Associated Press)      Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, a travel risk management firm, said the number of rescues his travel risk management firm has handled this year involving climbers suffering acute mountain sickness has increased by more than 50 percent — 35 total, compared with 20 at the same time last year.      He thinks climbers rushing to beat the crowds before they are acclimatized may be exacerbating the problem.      At higher altitudes, the body receives less oxygen with each breath, so all physical tasks become harder. Symptoms of altitude sickness include confusion, impaired judgment, headaches, nausea and poor balance.      The heavy traffic on Everest is more than an annoyance; the waiting can actually be dangerous, said Kuntal Joisher, an Indian climber who reached the peak in 2016.      “Since you are moving slow and spending a lot of time waiting and standing still, there is a good chance that your body and its extremities would become cold and susceptible to frostbite,” he said. “The other problem is every minute spent waiting and walking behind extremely slow-moving traffic means your precious bottled oxygen is getting wasted.”      Concern over safety issues and environmental damage caused by growing crowds on Everest reached a crescendo in 2012, when a photo by a German mountaineer of a “human snake” of some of the 600 climbers trudging toward the summit on one day attracted worldwide attention. Eleven people died on the mountain that year, including three Nepali guides.      But twin tragedies — the death of 16 sherpas from falling ice in 2014, followed by the earthquake-triggered avalanche in 2015 that killed 18 people — dealt a blow to the industry, which is a huge part of Nepal’s tourism economy.

(Roberto Schmidt/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)      Everest permits alone are bringing in an estimated $4.5 million, with additional income to hotels, guides, porters and transportation companies, said Alan Arnette, a Colorado climber and Everest blogger.      In 2015, the government proposed measures to make climbing safer, including requiring climbers to qualify first on a “smaller,” 21,000-foot mountain, and banning those younger than 18 and older than 75.      But these have to be approved by cabinet vote or by amending existing laws, and that has yet to happen.      “Today, a lot people across the world think that anyone with no skills and experience can climb Everest — that it’s become a walk in the park,” Joisher said.

Synopsis Italian mountaineer and explorer Reinhold Messner has made a career of near-impossible climbs, and is considered one of the greatest climbers in history. On May 8, 1978, Messner completed his ascent of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen—a feat previously thought to be impossible. Additionally, Messner has climbed all 14 of the world's peaks that measure 8,000 meters and up. Messner is also an author, politician and businessman.      Alpine Youth Reinhold Messner was born on September 17, 1944, in Bressanone, Italy. He grew up surrounded by the Dolomites, part of the Italian Alps, in the Villnöss Valley, a primarily German-speaking area, and was introduced to mountaineering by his father when he was just 5 years old. By his teens he had developed into an expert climber and began his conquest of the nearby peaks, favoring a more minimalist style of climbing that involved using only the most essential gear. Advertisement Visit Site Beginning in 1967, Messner studied architectural engineering at the University of Padua. However, he still found time to climb the surrounding mountains—often with his younger brother, Günther—and as his climbing skills increased, he began to feel the lure of the higher peaks. Advertisement Visit Site Advertisement Visit Site      Naked Mountain On June 27, 1970, Reinhold and Günther had just completed an ascent of the Rupal face of Pakistan's 26,660-foot Nanga Parbat—the ninth-highest summit in the world—when Günther began to show signs of altitude sickness. Convinced his brother would not be able to descend the Rupal face, Reinhold began searching for an easier way down. However, during their descent, Günther fell behind, and when Reinhold doubled back to check on his brother, he discovered that Günther had been swept away by an avalanche. After failing to find his brother, Reinhold eventually made his own way down the mountain, losing six toes and several fingertips to frostbite in the process. Compounding his loss, many blamed him for his brother's death, opining that his personal ambitions had compromised his brother's safety. More than 30 years later, when Messner published his version of the events in The Naked Mountain, the controversy was reawakened, with some questioning the veracity of his account.      Over the Mists Despite the tragedy at Nanga Parbat, Messner's passion for climbing continued unabated. In 1974 he teamed up with fellow climber Peter Habeler—who shared Messner's minimalist approach to mountaineering—and together they ascended the Eiger in record-breaking time. The following year, they climbed Gasherbrum I in the Karakoram mountain range without supplemental oxygen, and in May 1978 they tackled Mount Everest, again without the aid of oxygen tanks, making them the first documented climbers to do so. Messner later described his experience: "I am nothing more than a single narrow gasping lung, floating over the mists and summits." Upping the ante and taking his purist approach to climbing to the extreme, in August 1980 Messner decided to go it alone, completing the first solo ascent of Mount Everest without extra oxygen, sherpas or crevasse ladders. He would later chronicle the accomplishment in The Crystal Horizon, just one of the more than 50 titles he has published during his climbing career. |||||	– There are typically just a handful of days each climbing season in which the weather allows climbers to safely ascend Everest, the head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association tells the Washington Post. Which is why pro mountaineers and local officials are worried about the 800 or so climbers expected to make the trip this year, upping the chances for dangerous "traffic jams," the officials say. Some 371 foreigners have been issued climbing permits for 2017—the highest number since 1953, per the Post—with more than 400 Sherpas also set to climb. Experts explain that waiting on the mountain behind other groups isn't just an eye-rolling inconvenience: With each extra minute spent not moving, climbers could fall prey to altitude sickness, risk getting frostbite, or use up too much of the oxygen needed to complete the trip. In a Facebook post last week, UK mountaineer Tim Mosedale said he recently came across some "fairly strange and indeed dangerous activity" on Everest: He describes one climber whose helmet was attached to his backpack rather than on his head and whose crampons were on the wrong feet ("his excuse was that he was in a rush to go to the toilet that morning"). Many people don't seem to realize that even the best mountain climbers can be no match for Mother Nature: Swiss climber Ueli Steck, for instance, died just last week prepping for an Everest climb. "This is not alpinism, this is tourism," sniffs Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner, the first documented climber to reach the top of Everest alone without supplemental oxygen, to the Diplomat.

The list of affected restaurants, to be posted on the company’s site, was not yet available.      “We sincerely apologize to anyone who has been inconvenienced as a result of these highly sophisticated, criminal cyberattacks,” Wendy’s CEO Todd Penegor wrote in a letter to customers.      “We have conducted a rigorous investigation to understand what has happened and we are committed to protecting our customers and keeping you informed.”      The 1,000 restaurants represents less than one in five domestic Wendy’s locations — there are 5,144 franchise-operated domestic units, plus another 582 company-owned locations.      Wendy’s described the security breach as a pair of attacks. The first, according to the company, started at some franchisee locations in late fall, was first reported in January and affected less than 300 locations.      But in June the company said that, during its investigation, it discovered a second malware attack, similar to the first, which affected many more than 300 locations. The 1,000 number is the first quantification of the restaurants affected by the dual attacks.      Wendy’s is offering one year of fraud consultation and identity restoration services to customers who used a payment card at a potentially affected restaurant during the time it might have been affected.      “In a world where malicious cyberattacks have unfortunately become all too common for merchants, we are doing what is necessary to protect our customers,” Penegor wrote. “We will continue to work diligently with our investigative team to apply what we have learned from these incidents and further strengthen our data security measures.”      Wendy’s believes that criminals gained access to point of sale terminals by gaining remote access to the system by using compromised credentials from third party service providers.      That gave the criminals’ access to the central system, enabling them to place malware onto the terminals that read the credit card information.      The company says the attack has only affected franchisee outlets and not the 582 company locations. That’s important because Wendy’s is shifting to a single point-of-sale system, called Aloha, that’s installed at company-owned units.      Wendy’s said it worked with investigators to disable the malware.      Correction: July 8, 2016 This story has been edited to clarify wording on when the attack on Wendy's POS system occurred: The attack did not occur a year ago. A Wendy's spokesman said the earliest evidence of malware present was in October 2015, and this attack was discovered in January 2016.

The hamburger chain said Thursday hackers were able to obtain card numbers, names, expiration dates and codes on the card, beginning in late fall. Some customers' cards were used to make fraudulent purchases at other stores.      Wendy's Co. urged customers to check their accounts for any fraudulent purchases.      The Dublin, Ohio, company first announced it was investigating a possible hack in January. In May, it said malware was found in fewer than 300 restaurants. About a month later, it said two types of malware were found and the number of restaurants affected was "considerably higher."      There are more than 5,700 Wendy's restaurants in the U.S.      Customers can see which locations were affected through the Wendy's website . The company said it is offering free one-year credit monitoring to people who paid with a card at any of those restaurants.      ——————      ONLINE:      Wendy's data breach information: https://www.wendys.com/en-us/about-wendys/the-wendys-company-updates      Wendy's impacted restaurant search: https://payment.wendys.com/paymentcardcheck.html ||||| Image copyright Getty Images      Popular US food chain Wendy's has been hit by a massive cyber attack, the company has confirmed.      The company reported suspicious activity earlier this year, but the scale of the breach is far bigger than first anticipated.      At least 1,025 of its restaurants were targeted - with debit and credit card information stolen.      The company did not speculate how many people may have been affected, though it did say all of the locations were in the US.      Malware - malicious software - had been installed on point-of-sale systems in the affected locations.      The chain said it was confident the threat had been removed, and was now offering help to customers who may have been affected.      Help includes the offer of one year of "complimentary" fraud protection services.      Suspicious activity      In a statement outlining the details of the attack, Wendy's said the malware could have been operational in its restaurants from as early as Autumn 2015.      Suspicious activity was noticed in February of this year. The company went public with this discovery in May - saying it believed around 300 restaurants had been affected.      But with the number rising to more than 1,000, this hack ranks among one of the most significant in US history.      The Wendy's hack bears some similarity to the attack on Target in 2013. In that breach, around 40 million customers' details were stolen via malware installed on point-of-sale computers.      Wendy's has blamed a third-party for the intrusion, saying a "service provider" that had remote access to the till systems was compromised.      The company did not say who that service provider was, nor did it explain why it had remote access to the tills of 1,025 of the firm's 5,700 restaurants.      The company has set up a page for customers to check if a restaurant they bought food from has been affected.      'Hungry for burgers'      Security researcher Graham Cluley said it is unlikely that many of those affected will be aware they are at risk.      "For most of us it's not a red letter day if we go to somewhere like Wendy's," he said.      "And people won't have registered which one they went to and where they were in the country when it happened."      He also predicted that while the breach may be embarrassing for the firm in the short term, the company would most likely recover quickly.      "I think the average guy on the street has a fairly short memory when it comes to a data breach.      "When you have the choice of walking to Wendy's which is five yards away, or you walk somewhere else 200 yards away. I think you'll just go to Wendy's.      "I'm pretty sure people will just be hungry for burgers again."

summarize: Alcoholism vaccine will give drinkers an immediate hangover if they drink even a small amount of booze            The vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year      It sends a message to the liver not to express genes that metabolize alcohol      Trials on mice begin next month with human tests planned for November            A vaccine being developed in Chile will give anyone who drinks alcohol and immediate hangover      A new vaccine will give anyone who drinks even a small amount of alcohol an immediate and very heavy hangover.      Scientists from the University of Chile have spent a year designing the drug in a bid to tackle the growing problem of alcoholism in the country.            The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol.            Normally, the liver turns alcohol into the hangover-causing compound called acetaldehyde which is then broken down by a metabolising enzyme.      If someone who’s been vaccinated tries to drink alcohol, they will immediately experience severe nausea, accelerated heartbeat, and general discomfort.      Once the vaccine has been administered it cannot be reversed.      A preclinical trial using mice to determine the correct dosing is due to begin next month with researchers hoping to begin tests on human subjects in November.      The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol      Dr. Juan Asenjo, director of the university's Institute for Cell Dynamics and Biotechnology said while the vaccine is not a cure-all, it could provide an important first step.      He told the Santiago Times newspaper: 'People who end up alcoholic have a social problem; a personality problem because they’re shy, whatever, and then they are depressed, so it’s not so simple.      Clanger: The hangover vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year      'But if we can solve the chemical, the basic part of the problem, I think it could help quite a bit.      'In Chile, according to the most recent 2011 study from the World Health Organization, one in 15 men have an alcohol use disorder.            Dr Asenjo belives the vaccine has the potential to help millions of people worldwide.      He added: 'If it works, it’s going to have a worldwide impact, but with many vaccines one has to test them carefully. I think the chances that this one will work are quite high.'      Inspiration for the vaccine came from the far East, said Asenjo, where between 15 and 20 pwer cent of Japanese, Chinese or Koreans have a mutation which inhibits the breakdown of alcohol in their bodies.      The idea of using drugs to combat alcoholism is not new.      Disulfiram, which was developed almost a century ago works in a similar way blocking the enzyme from breaking down alcohol, thus intensifying the body’s negative response.      However users often find the effects so unpleasant they simply stop taking the pills.             ||||| Splitting headaches and waves of nausea – a drinker’s worst enemy – may soon provide alcoholics with an unlikely rescue from a crippling addiction. A preclinical trial for the Universidad de Chile’s alcoholism vaccine, set to break ground in February, will use mice to determine dosing.

The vaccine works by telling the liver not to express genes that metabolize alcohol—but a scientist involved in the study warns it's no cure-all. "People who end up alcoholic have a social problem, a personality problem because they’re shy, whatever, and then they are depressed, so it’s not so simple," he tells the Santiago Times. But solving the chemical aspect of alcoholism "could help quite a bit." The vaccine is scheduled to undergo a preclinical trial on mice next month before being tested on people in November. It resembles an old drug called Disulfiram, which was so awful that people simply stopped taking it. But the new vaccine would last for 6 solid months upon injection.
summarize: In his laboratory in Harbin, China, Professor Xiaoping Ren is working on the extreme edge of science: performing head transplants on mice. Video: Max Duncan. Photo: Gilles Sabrié for The Wall Street Journal      HARBIN, China—Xiaoping Ren stood up after 10 hours hunched over an operating table and looked proudly at his patient, a small black mouse with a new brown head.      When he took a ventilator off the tiny creature’s throat, the head began breathing spontaneously with its new body. An hour later, the body twitched, and, a few hours after that, the mouse opened its eyes, Dr. Ren recalls.      Since... ||||| Xiaoping Ren has performed over 1,000 head transplants on mice - and wants to move on to monkeys      Controversial Chinese surgeon Xiaoping Ren has made his name by transplanting mice heads onto different bodies.      The creatures don't live longer than a few minutes but Dr. Ren has been able to create Frankenstein-like mice with heads that are a different colour from their bodies.      Now he wants to begin chopping up monkeys in order to get closer to an actual human head transplant.      According to the WSJ, which shadowed the surgeon during a 10-hour transplant operation, he is “hoping to create the first head-transplanted primate that can live and breathe on its own, at least for a little while.”      Xiaoping Ren Xiaoping Ren has performed head transplants on over 1000 mice      Animal rights organisations have blasted the Chinese doctor and his methods.      "It is deeply disturbing that a researcher has been allowed to subject more than 1,000 mice to these cruel and medically absurd experiments," a spokesperson for Animal Aid told Mirror Online.      "There is no way in which a surgical procedure that allows a mouse, or even a monkey, to survive for a few minutes is likely to translate into concrete benefits for human patients," they said.      "Even if the surgery was developed so that mice or primates were kept alive for longer, fundamental differences between species mean there is no guarantee that humans would experience the same results.      "If individual people want to volunteer to participate in such research, then they are free to make an informed decision, but animals should not be forced to suffer in these pointless and macabre experiments."      Experts meanwhile have likewise branded the work ridiculous - citing that human head transplants are controversial and a long way from being medically possible.      They could offer a new life for paralysed or quadriplegic patients, but the ethics of the procedure are incredibly complex.      Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Centre said the bodies of head transplant patients “would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they’d go crazy.”      He added: “It’s not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else.”      Dr Hunt Batjer, president elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, added: “I would not wish this on anyone.      “I would not allow anyone to do it to me as there are a lot of things worse than death.” |||||	– A head transplant may sound like something out of a horror movie, but Dr. Xiaoping Ren has completed about 1,000 on mice. This summer, he'll attempt his first such procedure on a monkey in a case that will be closely watched. Ren, who worked in the US for more than 15 years, may conduct the experiment in his native China, where he has worked since 2012 with the government's strong support and $1.6 million in grants, as Beijing seeks to become what the Wall Street Journal calls a "scientific powerhouse." Such a test may not even be possible in America, where other controversial Chinese research has met with harsh criticism. An animal rights group tells the Daily Mirror Ren's mice experiments alone are "cruel and medically absurd." In China, those concerns take a backseat to hopes that human head transplants can one day help those with spinal-cord injuries, cancer, and other diseases. But first, "we have to make an animal model with long-term survival," says Ren, 53. Mice with transplanted heads have survived for at most a day. Ren, who will collaborate with another surgeon interested in human head transplants, first makes a clean cut to detach the donor head from its body, while the head of the body to be donated is separated at midbrain so the heart can remain beating. Blood vessels from the donor body are then attached to the recipient head using silicone tubes before the head's spinal nerves are connected. The bone from the connecting vertebrae is rebuilt with pins, screws, and plates, then the blood vessels, muscle, and skin are joined with microscopic sutures. When Ren turns his procedure to monkeys—long-tailed macaques, specially—he will aim to connect just 10% to 20% of 100 billion spinal-nerve fibers—enough to allow the monkey to breathe and move muscles voluntarily. Should Ren eventually reach the "next frontier" with human transplants, a much higher percentage of connections will be needed. (Think the idea is crazy? You're not alone.)
summarize: The White House is partially lifting the lid of secrecy on its counterterrorism campaign against al-Qaida in Yemen and Somalia by formally acknowledging for the first time that it is conducting lethal attacks in those countries.      FILE - In this June 14, 2012 file photo, President Barack Obama speaks in Cleveland. The White House is partially lifting the lid of secrecy on its counterterrorism campaign against al-Qaida in Yemen... (Associated Press)      The White House's semiannual report to Congress on the state of U.S. combat operations abroad, delivered Friday, mentions what has been widely reported for years but never formally acknowledged by the administration: The U.S. military has been taking "direct action" against members of al-Qaida and affiliates in Yemen and Somalia.      The report does not elaborate, but "direct action" is a military term of art that refers to a range of lethal attacks, which in the case of Yemen and Somalia include attacks by armed drones. The report does not mention drones, which are remote-controlled, pilotless aircraft equipped with surveillance cameras and sometimes armed with missiles.      The report applies only to U.S. military operations, including those by special operations forces _ not those conducted by the CIA.      "In all cases we are focused on those al-Qaida members and affiliates who pose a direct threat to the United States and to our national interests," Pentagon press secretary George Little said after the report's release. "This report contains information about these operations owing to their growing significance in our overall counterterrorism effort."      The report does not provide details of any military operations in either Yemen or Somalia. It merely acknowledges they have happened. Killings of terror suspects overseas are acknowledged by the administration, but it does not mention the involvement of drones. The CIA and military have separate drone fleets.      The decision by President Barack Obama to declassify the existence of the counterterror actions in those two countries amounts an incremental move toward greater openness about the use of U.S. force overseas. It does not reflect any change in the intensity or basic character of the U.S. campaign to defeat al-Qaida.      A previous step in the direction of greater official transparency came in April when the White House's counterterrorism chief, John Brennan, made the first formal confirmation that the U.S. uses armed drones against terrorists. But he did not mention their use in specific countries.      The new information in Friday's report comes amid outcries from some in Congress about leaks to the news media about details of classified activities such as the existence of a White House "kill list" of targeted al-Qaida militants. The accusation, mostly by Republicans, is that the White House has orchestrated the leaks to improve Obama's re-election chances, an allegation the president has rejected as "offensive" and "wrong."      Three administration officials who briefed The Associated Press on the decision to declassify the existence of the military's counterterrorism campaigns in Yemen and Somalia said Obama determined that the time was ripe, in part because the U.S. has built closer relations with the Yemeni government and with governments interested in eliminating extremist elements in Somalia. Somalia has not had a fully functioning government since 1991.      The officials said the declassification of further details in future reports to Congress would remain under White House review.      Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the White House is required to report to Congress every six months on U.S. combat operations abroad. Friday's report includes a secret attachment with classified details, which was not released publicly.      The last report, on Dec. 15, 2011, made no mention of Yemen or Somalia. Instead it said that in relation to efforts against al-Qaida, the U.S. was working with partners "with a particular focus on countries within the U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility," which is a broad swath of territory that includes the entire Middle East and Central Asia.      Friday's report was more explicit. It said that in Somalia the U.S. military has worked to counter the terrorist threat posed by al-Qaida and al-Qaida-associated elements of a militant group called al-Shabaab.      "In a limited number of cases, the U.S. military has taken direct action in Somalia against members of al-Qaida, including those who are also members of al-Shabaab, who are engaged in efforts to carry out terrorist attacks against the United States and our interests," it said.      It said the U.S. military also has been working closely with the Yemeni government to "operationally dismantle and ultimately eliminate" the terrorist threat posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP.      It called AQAP "the most active and dangerous affiliate of al-Qaida today."      "Our joint efforts have resulted in direct action against a limited number of AQAP operatives and senior leaders in that country who posed a terrorist threat to the United States and our interests," the report said.      ___      Robert Burns can be followed on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/robertburnsAP ||||| WASHINGTON — Opening the window just a little further into his secret war on terrorists, President Obama publicly acknowledged for the first time on Friday that United States military forces had taken “direct action” against groups affiliated with Al Qaeda in Somalia and Yemen.      In a letter to Congress, Mr. Obama said American forces had engaged in “a limited number” of operations against members of the Shabab in Somalia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, arguing that both posed a terrorist threat to “the United States and our interests.”      He gave no further details in the unclassified letter, which accompanied the latest update to lawmakers under the War Powers Act about military operations around the world. More details about the scope of the operations were included in the classified section of the report, administration officials said.      The disclosure formally confirmed what had long been known here and abroad, that the American war on Al Qaeda has spread far from the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it began more than a decade ago. In the past, officials acknowledged helping Somalia and Yemen battle extremists without confirming that American forces were sometimes involved in the fight.

The report concerned only US military operations, not the CIA, notes AP. "Going forward," said a Pentagon press secretary, "the American people should know that we will do what is necessary to defend our country against those who would threaten us." The unclassified part of yesterday's letter contained no details about the "limited number" of actions the US had taken, although more details were reportedly in the classified section. “While any voluntary disclosure is welcome, this is not much of a breakthrough,” said the head of a group critical of government secrecy. “The age of secret wars is over. They were never a secret to those on the receiving end.”
summarize: MOUNTAIN VIEW -- In a world with self-driving cars, Google envisions the inevitable: accidents involving pedestrians.      But the firm is exploring an unusual solution. Think flypaper.      The company received a patent Tuesday describing a way to reduce pedestrian injuries in an accident with a robotic vehicle. The impact of the crash, Google suggests, would expose a coating that glues the person to the front of the car.      "The adhesive layer may be a very sticky material and operate in a manner similar to flypaper, or double-sided duct tape," the patent said.      In its patent, Google acknowledged that robot cars will hit pedestrians -- until the technology gets to the point that the vehicles can "avoid all accidents."      This diagram from a patent granted May 17 to Google shows how a pedestrian hit by a self-driving car would remain stuck to the front of the vehicle with glue, theoretically to prevent further injuries from being carried along and then thrown. (U.S. Patent Office)      Today, when a car runs into a pedestrian, it often carries the person along until the driver brakes, throwing the victim from the vehicle, possibly leading to further injury as they hit the road or some other hard surface, or get hit by another car, the patent said. But that doesn't have to happen.      "The front region of the vehicle may be coated with a specialized adhesive that adheres to a pedestrian, and thus holds the pedestrian on the vehicle in the unfortunate event that the front of the vehicle comes into contact with the pedestrian," the patent said. "The adhesion of the pedestrian to the vehicle may prevent the pedestrian from bouncing off."      An eggshell-like layer covering the adhesive would protect the sticky surface during everyday driving, but shatter in an accident to reveal the glue.      Advertisement      Google isn't the first to think about new ways to protect pedestrians from cars. Two major car companies have come up with systems of their own. Some European Jaguar models use small explosive charges to push the car's hood up several inches in a collision with a person, softening the victim's impact. In Volvo's V40, a "pedestrian air bag" deploys along the base of the windshield, where struck pedestrians often suffer head injuries.      The Google patent comes at a time of rising pedestrian traffic fatalities, with preliminary data suggesting a 10 percent increase nationally last year from 4,884 deaths in 2014, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. Distracted driving, and more cars on the roads, are probable factors behind the increase, said association spokeswoman Kara Macek.      A Google spokeswoman said the existence of a patent doesn't necessarily mean a new product is coming. "We hold patents on a variety of ideas," she said. "Some of those ideas later mature into real products and services, some don't."      Stanford School of Law professor and autonomous car expert Bryant Walker Smith praised Google -- once he stopped laughing about the patent.      "The idea that cars should be safe for people other than the ones in them is the next generation of automotive safety," Smith said. "Manufacturers have gotten remarkably good at protecting the occupants of the vehicle, but there's been much less attention to protecting the people outside. I applaud anybody for thinking, as they should, about people outside of the vehicle."      But, Smith said, Google's patent highlights a problem central to safety engineering: solutions create their own concerns. Air bags save lives but can cause injury or death, for example, and seat belts sometimes keep people restrained when they'd be better off ejected, he said.      "If you had a pedestrian stuck on a car that then crashed into something else, that could be worse than if the pedestrian was thrown to the side or thrown over the car. It could also be better. It's very dependent on the chaos of the situation," Smith said. "The history of progress is replacing one set of problems with another set of problems and just really hoping that your new set of problems in aggregate is less than your original problem."      As for removing a pedestrian stuck on a car's hood, the patent included an option to use a "releasable adhesive" that would allow the person to be unstuck "after a period of time."

But crashes do still happen, and when they do, Google apparently has a backup plan: human flypaper.      Yesterday, Google was awarded a patent that proposes placing a strong adhesive on the hood of its autonomous cars. This way, pedestrians or cyclists who happen to find themselves being struck by a Googlemobile would be protected from what’s called “secondary impact.” This is the part of a crash when a person is thrown back off the moving vehicle, usually hitting the roof of the car, the hard surface of the street, or another car. It’s also the part that often causes the most serious injuries.      The patent was filed back in 2014 and seems to be designed as a temporary solution to keep the humans around the self-driving cars safe as autonomous technology improves:      Advertisement      While such systems are being developed, it must be acknowledged that, on occasion, collisions between a vehicle and a pedestrian still occur. Such safety mechanisms may become unnecessary as accident-avoidance technology is being further developed, but at present it is desirable to provide vehicles with pedestrian safety mechanisms.      As for what kind of glue Google is planning to smear across its hoods, it’s described in the patent as having some kind of “eggshell”-like coating over the main adhesive layer so the car doesn’t drive around scooping up insects and other small animals like actual flypaper.      Where the adhesive would be applied, according to Google patent number 9340178      But would this even work? A single collision with a sticky hood is better from a physics standpoint, according to Rebecca Thompson, head of public outreach for the American Physical Society.      Advertisement      “Getting hit by a car once is much preferable to getting hit by a car and then the ground and then another car,” said Thompson. “Cyclists wear helmets not as much to prevent their head’s impact with the car as much as their head’s impact with the ground when they fall.”      Turning cars into giant glue traps is certainly a feature that could have urban applications beyond autonomous vehicles. If it proves to be a good idea—and it still has to be proven—it could be applied to all potentially dangerous moving objects. “This is essentially a variation on an external airbag, which on its face seems like a good idea for a low-speed vehicle as a backup safety measure,” said Gabe Klein, former head of DC’s and Chicago’s departments of transportation, who now advises mobility-related investment funds and startups. “Why not consider it for non-autonomous vehicles?”      But it’s not a flawless idea, said Thompson. With a pedestrian or cyclist stuck to the front of a car, the car might have trouble moving to safety—or it might drag the human’s legs or arms under the car, inflicting new injuries. But she also points out a benefit for regular cars: having a person stuck to the hood might prevent a human driver from fleeing the scene. That would definitely cut down on hit-and-runs.      Advertisement      A lot of other automakers are thinking about how to mitigate pedestrian injuries in crashes. Nissan’s “pop up engine hood” uses tiny explosives to slightly raise the hood of the vehicle once it senses an impact to help stop pedestrians from hitting their heads. Google’s patent for pedestrian safety glue is especially creative, but a similar goal might be achieved using vehicle-to-person (V2P) tech, said Dan Sturges, a transportation designer and adjunct professor at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit. “Given their role with Android OS, they could have the world’s smartphones telling pedestrians when they are at risk of getting hit. So, use Google tech to avoid pedestrian-to-car accidents by using their pervasive tech.”      Of course, as a Google rep told the Mercury News, this doesn’t mean we’ll see the human flypaper idea come to life. It’s just another way that shows how Google is thinking about helping its robots to keep more humans alive on our streets.      [US Patent Office via Mercury News] |||||	– If you're unlucky enough to be hit by one of Google's self-driving cars, the company wants you to stay glued to the front of it, according to a patent that's dated May 17—not April 1. The patent describes an adhesive layer that "may be a very sticky material and operate in a manner similar to flypaper, or double-sided duct tape," designed to prevent pedestrians from further injury, the San Jose Mercury News reports. The technology, which will also work on ordinary cars, will bring both the vehicle and the pedestrian to a "more gradual stop than if the pedestrian bounces off the vehicle," the patent states. The sticky stuff will be under an eggshell-like layer so it won't end up covered in insects during everyday vehicle use. The idea sounds like it has the potential to prevent injuries, American Physical Society spokeswoman Rebecca Thompson tells Gizmodo. "Getting hit by a car once is much preferable to getting hit by a car and then the ground and then another car," she says. "Cyclists wear helmets not as much to prevent their head's impact with the car as much as their head's impact with the ground when they fall." A Google spokeswoman declined to say whether the company really plans to introduce the system to its fleet. The company holds patents "on a variety of ideas," she says: "Some of those ideas later mature into real products and services, some don't." (Glue may not be much help if you're hit by one of the self-driving big rigs a former Google engineer is working on.)

Nineteen elk, mostly calves, were found dead several days ago at a feeding ground near Bondurant, a town southeast of Jackson, said John Lund of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. A contractor delivering feed to the herd discovered the dead animals.      Lund said wildlife officials are concerned because wolves usually eat what they kill or come back later to feed.      The pack suspected of killing the elks has nine wolves, he added.      There are about 1,100 elk in the area, he said, and about 7% of the population has been lost to wolves this winter. ||||| Stock image of a gray wolf. (Photo: mlharing, Getty Images/iStockphoto)      Nineteen elk were killed by wolves earlier this week in what’s being called a “surplus kill,” according to Wyoming wildlife officials.      Wolves killed seventeen elk calves and two adult cows near Bondurant, Wyo., according to John Lund the Pinedale regional wildlife supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.      It’s not unusual for wolves to kill one or two elk a night, but to have 19 killed in one night “is fairly rare,” he said.      Lund said a surplus killing is when an animal kills more of its prey than it can eat and then abandons the surplus.      "We’re not sure what triggers surplus killing, because in many cases predators will kill with the intent to eat, but in this case something triggered and they went crazy and just took down each elk and moved on to the next,” he said.      He said over the past winter, wolves in the area have killed at least 70-75 elk, which is a "significant" number.      "Based on what we’ve seen in this elk herd, likely [the deaths] will impact our hunting season and hunter opportunity," he said.      Because the wolves are federally protected, Wyoming wildlife managers can not take measures on a local level to curb their populations, even if they are killing high numbers of elk, he said.      He notes that the federal government typically refrains from managing the wolf populations unless they are killing livestock.

"We did an eight-year study, and we looked at elk feed grounds. What we found is that generally wolves did not kill what they did not eat,” he told the outlet.

"They went crazy and just took down each elk and moved on to the next," the game and fish department's John Lund says. Killing that many elk in one night is unusual for area wolves, who typically stick to one or two kills per night. According to the Casper Star-Tribune, the carcasses of the elk herd were found at a feeding ground Tuesday. Lund tells CNN officials are concerned because wolves usually eat their kills or at least come back to feed later. The carcasses have been left out incase the wolves do eventually come back, but that's unlikely as humans have now touched the carcasses. Ken Mills, a biologist with the game and fish department, tells the Star-Tribune sport killings can be triggered by an increased vulnerability in prey, due to anything from snow to disease. “They’re like a person living day to day, getting enough to survive. When prey is vulnerable, they don’t have that mechanism to stop,” Mills says. “Killing is how they survive. If someone is barely making it day to day and they walk into a buffet, they’re going to eat like it’s a buffet.” Lund estimates about 7% of the area's 1,100 elk have been killed this winter—well above normal. That will likely have an impact on hunting season, but the state's hands are tied. Wolves, which are federally protected, can be legally killed if they're attacking livestock but not wild game.
summarize: Image copyright PARKS VICTORIA Image caption The damaged footprint with missing toe sections      Vandals have partially destroyed a 115-million-year-old dinosaur footprint in a national park in Australia.      Palaeontologists first discovered the imprint of the theropod dinosaur in a tidal rock platform in Flat Rocks, Victoria in 2006.      The area is a famous dinosaur fossil area where thousands of fossil bones and teeth have been found.      Authorities believe the vandals used a hammer to chip away at the three-toed mark which is about 30cm-wide.      "It looked like somebody had taken to it with either a hammer or a rock, and had broken off sections of the toes," Parks Victoria ranger Brian Martin told the BBC.      They left the "freshly broken" pieces scattered around the rock platform, he said.      You might also like:      An official leading a school group to the area last week discovered the damage.      Mr Martin said the perpetrators deliberately targeted the imprint, which had been left uncovered for public enjoyment.      "They would need to know exactly where it is to find it, many people quite easily walk right past it," he said.      Image copyright PARKS VICTORIA Image caption The dinosaur footprint before the damage      State authorities said they were disheartened by the damage.      "The significance of the footprint is that it represents a moment frozen in time when a meat-eating dinosaur stood on that spot and left an impression of its foot," Parks Victoria said on Wednesday. ||||| Vandals use hammer to damage 115-million-year-old dinosaur footprint near Inverloch      Updated      To the untrained eye it does not look like much.      But in the coastal rocks near Inverloch, south-east of Melbourne, a meat-eating dinosaur left its mark 115 million years ago.      The footprint, frozen in time in the Bunurong Marine Park at Flat Rocks, is recognised as a site of international significance.      But last month, park rangers discovered vandals had taken a hammer to the footprint at the Dinosaur Dreaming site, one of the few polar, or ice-age, dinosaur sites in the world.      "We took a school group out there and we noticed the deliberate damage," Parks Victoria ranger Brian Martin said.      " The rock there is reasonably hard so it looks like it's been hit with a hammer and pieces of the rock around the edge of the footprint have been broken away," Mr Martin said.      When the dinosaur footprint was first discovered in 2006, palaeontologists from Museum Victoria and Monash University decided it should be left where it is so visitors could see it in its natural state.      They made a silicon rubber mould of the print.      "It is so disappointing. The footprint has been there for hundreds of thousands of years and it's a popular, significant site," Mr Martin said.      "For someone to damage it intentionally, you'd have to have a rough idea of where it is because seaweed grows on the rock platform and it looks like a normal rock until you look closely and see the outline of the footprint."      Broken pieces of the footprint have been retrieved from the tidal area.      "Hopefully technicians at Museum Victoria will be able to restore the footprint to some degree," Bunurong Environment Centre education officer Mike Cleeland said.      The type of dinosaur that left the print has not been identified.      Researchers have found evidence the area was roamed by at least six different types of carnivorous dinosaurs.      It has yielded more than 6,000 bones and teeth of small dinosaurs, mammals, birds, turtles and fish, according to Parks Victoria.

Officials say they were "disheartened" to discover the vandalism at the famous Flat Rocks site in Victoria state. "It looked like somebody had taken to it with either a hammer or a rock, and had broken off sections of the toes," Parks Victoria ranger Brian Martin tells the BBC. Martin says the vandals left freshly broken pieces of rock scattered around the tidal rock platform. The site, which dates from a time when Australia was still connected to Antarctica, is one of the only polar dinosaur sites ever discovered. The footprint was discovered in 2006, and officials say it was left uncovered so that visitors could have the thrill of standing where a meat-eating dinosaur stood millions of years ago. "For someone to damage it intentionally, you'd have to have a rough idea of where it is because seaweed grows on the rock platform and it looks like a normal rock until you look closely and see the outline of the footprint," Martin tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Authorities say they may be able to restore the footprint to some degree, using the broken pieces of rock and a rubber mold taken by paleontologists in 2006. (Scientists in Alaska have discovered what they say is one of the world's great dinosaur track sites.)
summarize: Wondering what Google's flagship I/O Conference announcement this week should look like? Wonder no longer. It's a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, and it's set to hit Australia in July.      Update: Turns out that this leak was spot on. The Google Nexus 7 built by Asus is a reality, with all the specifications listed here revealed days before this morning's I/O keynote by Gizmodo Australia. Check out the Nexus 7 and read how it all unfolded in our live blog.      Gizmodo Australia has today viewed a training document detailing exactly what's going to be in the new tablet and how much it's going to cost.      As rumoured, Google's going to announce a 7-inch, Nexus-branded tablet called the Nexus 7. According to the leak, it's built by Asus, with a 1.3Ghz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, GeForce 12-core GPU and 1GB of RAM with two different storage variants: 8GB and 16GB.      The Nexus tablet will also feature NFC and run Google Wallet (probably only in the US) and Android Beam.      The screen is an IPS display with a 178-degree viewing angle, running a resolution of 1280x800. The device will also sport a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera. The battery will also give you nine hours worth of operation.      The 8GB model will set you back $US199 and the 16GB will cost $US249. No word in the document on local prices.      The leaked document also says that the device will be the first to run Jelly Bean, the new version of Android. Details are scarce on Jelly Bean, but the slides tell us that Google will handle operating system updates from now on, which could address the fragmentation problem. We aren't sure if this statement means that Google will handle all handset updates from Jelly Bean onwards, or if it just means it will handle it for the Nexus 7 going forward. Based on the various arrangements with other manufacturers and telcos around the world, it's likely to be the latter. We'll know more come Google I/O.      Update: The document says that the Nexus 7 will run Android Jelly Bean, but makes no mention of the version number. We understand that the device will be version stamped with Android 4.1, rather than leaping ahead a generation and stamping it as 5.0. Wired had suggested after spotting a leaked benchmark that this would be the case.      Rumours about Google working on a Nexus-branded tablet with Asus have been swirling for a while. Even as far back as May, a report emerged of a super cheap Tegra 3-powered device was coming at the Google I/O developer event, which is now only days away.      The first clue was when Asus demonstrated the awesome cheap and wonderfully cheerful Eee Pad MeMO 370T at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, before delaying the unit indefinitely.      Since then, rumours about a home-grown tablet from Google have been few and far between, but this is the first time we've seen anything official regarding specs.      Apple has already played its announcement cards around iOS 6, Microsoft has announced Surface and Windows Phone 8, and Google risks being left behind without its own bespoke tablet product. June is one hell of a month to be following what's new in tech.      Priced at sub-$US200, the Google's Nexus 7 will become Amazon's biggest problem post-launch, threatening the market share of the hugely successful Kindle Fire. The Fire runs a highly modified version of the Android operating system and prevents users from wandering outside the customised Amazon environment. The Nexus brand, however, has always been associated with the purest form of the Android operating system Google has to offer, meaning that it's likely going to be a better experience. Google is also banking on the fact that the screen is better than the Fire's, with a higher resolution and 10-point touch capability.      Of course, this could all prove to be an elaborate fake. We've seen them before and we'll see them as long as there's a rabid tech-loving public that will queue up around the block for value this good.      We'll bring you the news as we hear it about this tablet, and if it really is the Nexus 7, I'm looking forward to this year's Google I/O. Follow Gizmodo Australia on Twitter for further updates. ||||| Computerworld - A $199 Nexus 7 tablet from Google would raise the stakes for Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble's Nook tablet, which sell at a similar price and screen size.      But since the 7-in. touchscreen device is reportedly a quad-core tablet with other costly hardware, the Nexus 7 might also in some ways compete with the popular Apple iPad or perhaps the Microsoft Surface tablets unveiled last week. The iPad starts at $499; pricing for the Surface has not yet been announced.      To offer high-end features at a low cost with the Nexus 7, Google seems to be acknowledging that the Android strategy of having third-party companies make tablets hasn't worked. And that means Google must take aggressive pricing steps to make up the difference.      "If Google wants to jump-start the Android tablet market, which has been weak to date, then a low-priced, high-quality device could do that," said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates. "Google certainly has an incentive to make the Android tablet a competitive product in the market, and maybe driven more by wanting to capture a bigger share of the pie, than by supporting its OEMs (Original Equipment Makers)."      Google could be subsidizing the Nexus 7 to the tune of hundreds of dollars per tablet, some analysts said. Even so, "getting revenues is the name of the game for Google, and right now the OEMs are driving very little revenue to them on Android-based tablets," Gold said.      The big payback to Google from selling a $199 tablet would come from the sales of apps and the ads that Google sells for its search tool, analysts noted. "Considering that the tablet ecosystem war is getting heated now with Microsoft having a bigger role, Google might feel the need for a more aggressive [pricing] strategy," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner.      She said that 40 million iPad sales in 2011 at a cost of $499 or more show there's room for Android sales, especially at lower prices. "You would think that 40 million would not seem impossible for the combination of all the vendors supporting Android," she said.      IDC said iPads accounted for 59% of tablet sales globally in 2011. Among Android tablets, Samsung had 6.3% of the market, and Asus took 2.5%. Amazon had 6.9% of the market with its Android variant and Barnes & Noble had 4.9%.      "Google has to be more than a little frustrated that the first mainstream hit Android tablet is the Kindle Fire," said Tom Mainelli, an analyst at IDC. "Google is desperate to get some market traction for Android tablets and the Google ecosystem that supports them." |||||	– Google is jumping into the tablet market with the Nexus 7, a 7-inch tablet that starts at $199 and runs on a new Android operating system, Gizmodo Australia reports. One caveat: The following is based on a leaked training document that "could prove to be an elaborate fake," the website admits. That aside, the Asus-made tablet will have 1280 x 800 resolution, a front-facing camera, and a 1.3Ghz quad-core Tegra 3 processor. The price: $199 for the 8GB model and $249 for the 16GB model. Details on the new OS are scarce so far, but it's called Jelly Bean. Market analysis is already coming in, with experts saying the low-priced tablet could compete with both the high-end iPad and lower-end Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble Nook, ComputerWorld reports. "A low-priced, high-quality device" could also "jump-start the Android tablet market, which has been weak to date," says one. And if Google is subsidizing each tablet with hundreds of dollars, as some analysts say, profits could come from apps and advertising.
summarize: London (CNN) Charlie Gard, the terminally ill baby at the center of a bitter legal battle that has garnered global attention, is to have his life support treatment withdrawn.      A UK High Court judge has ruled that Charlie should be moved from Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) to a hospice , where he will "inevitably" die within a short period.      "We deeply regret that profound and heartfelt differences between Charlie's doctors and his parents have had to be played out in court over such a protracted period," a GOSH spokesperson said in a statement.      "It has been a uniquely painful and distressing process for all concerned," the spokesperson said, adding: "Every single one of us wishes there could have been a less tragic outcome."      Charlie's parents said in a statement they have been denied their last wish.      "Most people won't ever have to go through what we have been through, we've had no control over our son's life and no control over our son's death," said Charlie's mom, Connie Yates, in the statement released Thursday.      The timing of the move and the location of the hospice are private, according to Judge Nicholas Francis's court order.      Charlie suffers from mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare degenerative condition which has left him with irreversible brain damage and a loss of motor skills.      Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Yates, clashed with doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where Charlie has been cared for since October, over whether to stop treating him.      In its statement, issued Thursday after Judge Francis's order came into effect, the hospital praised the pair for tirelessly advocating on behalf of their son, adding: "nobody could fault them for doing so."      The GOSH statement said its staff had "tried absolutely everything to accommodate their final wishes," including "exploring the unprecedented step of delivering intensive life support away from a hospital intensive care unit."      "We will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children's hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time," it added.      "This is a very special place who will do all they can to make these last moments as comfortable and peaceful as possible for Charlie and his loved-ones."      Fight for experimental treatment      But they remained in dispute with the hospital over when and where the 11-month-old should die      The couple had hoped to bring their son home for his final days , but gave up on that wish earlier this week. After having a change of heart over the hospice, his family then asked the court for permission to continue artificial ventilation for a period of some days at the end-of-life facility.      But his doctors opposed this, arguing that hospices focus on supportive care in the final stages of illness, and are not usually set up to accommodate keeping an infant in Charlie's condition alive.      GOSH said it had "moved heaven and earth" to fulfill the parents' wishes, but said that no intensive care pediatric doctor in the country was able or willing to supervise his care at home. And despite being given more time, the family were also unable to find a suitable pediatrician to help them.

"I'm shocked that after all we've been through they won't allow us this extra time," said the statement from Yates.      The court order revealed that Gard and Yates continued to pursue avenues for bringing their son home, even after the final court hearing in the case on Thursday.      "We just want some peace with our son, no hospital, no lawyers, no courts, no media, just quality time with Charlie away from everything to say goodbye to him in the most loving way," Yates said. ||||| Judge approves plan under which critically ill 11-month-old boy will have life support withdrawn shortly after he leaves hospital      Charlie Gard’s parents have been unable to fulfil their wish to have him kept on life support systems for a “significant” period of time after he is moved to a hospice, Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh) has said.      Connie Yates and Chris Gard had hoped that they would be able to spend “a week or so” in a hospice with their son before he was moved off a ventilator. But Gosh said that would require a 24/7 intensive care team and a high court judge gave Charlie’s parents until noon on Thursday to source one.      Mr Justice Francis laid out an alternative – default – position, which would involve a shorter time in hospice, if they were unsuccessful.      Charlie Gard’s parents show the strength of human love | Giles Fraser Read more      A Gosh spokeswoman said: “Sadly, as the judge has now ruled, there is simply no way that Charlie, a patient with such severe and complex needs, can spend any significant time outside of an intensive care environment safely.      “The risk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie’s life is an unthinkable outcome for all concerned and would rob his parents of precious last moments with him.      “As the judge has now ruled, we will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children’s hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time.”      Charlie’s parents had issued a plea on Wednesday evening for a paediatric intensive care consultant to come forward to help them spend “some peaceful time with our baby boy”.      The alternative timetables for Charlie’s death were agreed on Wednesday, with members of the press and public excluded, and they remain confidential.      Francis’s order, made public on Thursday, states: “In the absence of agreement between the guardian and Gosh and the proposed intensive care treating team for provision of intensive care in a hospice setting for an extended period of a few days, by 12noon 27 July 2017, it shall be lawful and in the best interests of Charlie … for artificial ventilation to be withdrawn after a period set out in the confidential annexe.”      Before the members of the press and public were excluded on Wednesday, Francis said that in the absence of an intensive care team being found by the parents, Charlie would “be transferred to a hospice and extubated [have his tube removed] shortly thereafter”.      Victoria Butler-Cole, the lawyer for Charlie’s guardian, had earlier referred to the choice being between Charlie spending a period of hours or days on the ventilator when transferred out of hospital.      After the terms of the order were agreed in private on Wednesday, as the press and public were allowed back into the court room, Yates sobbed angrily: “I don’t want to be in the same room as him,” words said to be aimed at the judge. She also said: “What if it was your child?” and: “Hope you’re happy with yourself,” before leaving the court in tears.      She and her husband, who was absent from court on Tuesday and Wednesday to spend time with their son, originally said it was their “last wish” for Charlie to die at home but reluctantly gave up on that hope in the face of opposition from Gosh.      On Monday, Charlie’s parents abandoned their fight to allow him to be flown to the US for experimental treatment for mitochondrial disease, having determined it was no longer viable because of muscular atrophy he had suffered while the case went through the courts.      But the case unexpectedly returned to court on Tuesday as Gosh and Charlie’s parents once again found themselves at odds, this time over where he should spend his final hours. |||||	– In what was one of their final wishes for their son's life, Charlie Gard's parents say they wanted to spend "a week or so" in hospice with him before he would be taken off life support, the Guardian reports. A judge denied that possibility Thursday. A British high court ruled Charlie can't be kept on a ventilator for a "significant" amount of time in hospice as that would require around-the-clock intensive care. Instead, the baby will be moved to hospice and "inevitably" die shortly, according to CNN. "We've had no control over our son's life and no control over our son's death," says Connie Yates, Charlie's mother. Charlie has irreparable brain damage due to a rare degenerative condition.
summarize: Jennifer Garner wants a divorce from Ben Affleck sooner rather than later.      In August, Affleck and Garner reached a divorce settlement, more than a year after they filed papers to end their marriage, and a source told E! News at the time that it would be filed in court after the actor gets out of rehab. He began his treatment, his third inpatient stint, that month after an alcohol addiction relapse. On Thursday, Affleck revealed on Instagram he has completed 40 days in rehab and will remain in outpatient care.      On Thursday, it was revealed that days earlier, a Los Angeles court approved a request Garner had filed to have a retired judge, who remains a member of the California State Bar, to be appointed as a temporary judge to oversee the divorce case. This is expected to accelerate the process, as the document states that the judge's appointment will expire on March 1 or upon entry of the final divorce settlement, whichever occurs first.      Garner, Affleck and the retired judge all signed the document in late September, while a Los Angeles court judge signed off on the request on Monday. ||||| Ben Affleck spoke out after completing another stint in rehab.      The actor, 46, posted a text image to his Instagram to thank everyone who has supported him on Thursday afternoon. He confirmed that he had completed a 40-day stay at a treatment center and said he is currently in outpatient care.      “Battling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle,” he wrote. “Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family. So many people have reached out on social media and spoken about their own journeys with addiction. To those people, I want to say thank you.”      “Your strength is inspiring and is supporting me in ways I didn’t think possible,” he continued. “It helps to know I am not alone. As I’ve had to remind myself, if you have a problem, getting help is a sign of courage, not weakness or failure.”      Affleck checked himself into rehab in August after his estranged wife Jennifer Garner, 46, helped stage an intervention for him.      His pals told Page Six at the time that he had been in a bad place after his breakup with “SNL” producer Lindsay Shookus.      “Alcoholism has a huge impact on not just the person, but also their family,” his brother Casey told “Entertainment Tonight” a month later. “So, I think for his kids’ sake and for their mom, and for himself, he’s trying to do the work and get it together. Ben is an addict and an alcoholic. Most of my grandparents are alcoholics. My father is an alcoholic, as bad as you can be, and he’s been sober for about 30 years. I’ve been sober for about six years. Ben is trying to put it together, and it can be a very hard thing to do. He has the kind of resources and time, luckily, to take the time and go to a good facility.”      This was Affleck’s second rehab stay since 2017. |||||	– Ben Affleck says he has completed a 40-day stint in rehab for alcohol addiction and is now in outpatient care—but because battling addiction is a lifelong struggle, "one is never really in or out of treatment." "I am fighting for myself and my family," the actor says in an Instagram post, thanking family, colleagues, and fans, especially those who have reached out with their own stories of addiction. Affleck checked himself into rehab in August for his second stint in two years after estranged wife Jennifer Garner staged an intervention, reports Page Six. Garner, who has three children with Affleck, has now filed papers that will speed up the divorce process, E! Online reports.
summarize: ISTANBUL A member of a Turkish leftist group that accuses Washington of using Turkey as its "slave" carried out a suicide bomb attack on the U.S. embassy, the Ankara governor's office cited DNA tests as showing on Saturday.      Ecevit Sanli, a member of the leftist Revolutionary People's Liberation Army-Front (DHKP-C), blew himself up in a perimeter gatehouse on Friday as he tried to enter the embassy, also killing a Turkish security guard.      The DHKP-C, virulently anti-American and listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Turkey, claimed responsibility in a statement on the internet in which it said Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was a U.S. "puppet".      "Murderer America! You will not run away from people's rage," the statement on "The People's Cry" website said, next to a picture of Sanli wearing a black beret and military-style clothes and with an explosives belt around his waist.      It warned Erdogan that he too was a target.      Turkey is an important U.S. ally in the Middle East with common interests ranging from energy security to counter-terrorism. Leftist groups including the DHKP-C strongly oppose what they see as imperialist U.S. influence over their nation.      DNA tests confirmed that Sanli was the bomber, the Ankara governor's office said. It said he had fled Turkey a decade ago and was wanted by the authorities.      Born in 1973 in the Black Sea port city of Ordu, Sanli was jailed in 1997 for attacks on a police station and a military staff college in Istanbul, but his sentence was deferred after he fell sick during a hunger strike. He was never re-jailed.      Condemned to life in prison in 2002, he fled the country a year later, officials said. Interior Minister Muammer Guler said he had re-entered Turkey using false documents.      Erdogan, who said hours after the attack that the DHKP-C were responsible, met his interior and foreign ministers as well as the head of the army and state security service in Istanbul on Saturday to discuss the bombing.      Three people were detained in Istanbul and Ankara in connection with the attack, state broadcaster TRT said.      The White House condemned the bombing as an "act of terror", while the U.N. Security Council described it as a heinous act. U.S. officials said on Friday the DHKP-C were the main suspects but did not exclude other possibilities.      Islamist radicals, extreme left-wing groups, ultra-nationalists and Kurdish militants have all carried out attacks in Turkey in the past.      SYRIA      The DHKP-C statement called on Washington to remove Patriot missiles, due to go operational on Monday as part of a NATO defense system, from Turkish soil.      The missiles are being deployed alongside systems from Germany and the Netherlands to guard Turkey, a NATO member, against a spillover of the war in neighboring Syria.      "Our action is for the independence of our country, which has become a new slave of America," the statement said.      Turkey has been one of the leading advocates of foreign intervention to end the civil war in Syria and has become one of President Bashar al-Assad's harshest critics, a stance groups such as the DHKP-C view as submission to an imperialist agenda.      "Organizations of the sectarian sort like the DHKP-C have been gaining ground as a result of circumstances surrounding the Syrian civil war," security analyst Nihat Ali Ozcan wrote in a column in Turkey's Daily News.      The Ankara attack was the second on a U.S. mission in four months. On September 11, 2012, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three American personnel were killed in an Islamist militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.      The DHKP-C was responsible for the assassination of two U.S. military contractors in the early 1990s in protest against the first Gulf War, and it fired rockets at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul in 1992, according to the U.S. State Department.      It has been blamed for previous suicide attacks, including one in 2001 that killed two police officers and a tourist in Istanbul's central Taksim Square. It has carried out a series of deadly attacks on police stations in the last six months.      Friday's attack may have come in retaliation for an operation against the DHKP-C last month in which Turkish police detained 85 people. A court subsequently remanded 38 of them in custody over links to the group.

Armed with six kilograms of TNT - enough to blow up a two-story building - and a hand grenade, Sanli, killed himself and a Turkish security guard in the brazen attack, which has been labelled an act of terror by U.S. officials.      As the U.S. flag flew at half-staff today and security at the embassy was heightened, details about the 40-year-old assailant emerged.      Sanli was not linked to al Qaeda, rather he was a member of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C. He had spent five years in prison on terrorism charges after he was arrested in 1997 for alleged involvement in attacks on two official buildings in Istanbul.      But he was released in 2001 after being diagnosed with a brain disorder that he suffered during a prison hunger strike that killed dozens of inmates.      He fled Turkey after he was freed but managed to come back 'illegally' using a fake ID, Turkish officials said. It wasn't clear how long before Friday's attack he returned to his home country.      DHKP-C, which has claimed responsibility for assassinations and bombings since the 1970s but has been relatively quiet in recent years. Compared to al Qaeda, it has not been seen as a strong terrorist threat.      Sanli's motives were still unclear. But some Turkish government officials have linked the attack to the arrest last month of dozens of suspected members of the group in a nationwide sweep.      Scroll down for video      Terrorist: Sanli, pictured, spent five years in prison on terrorism charges after he was arrested in 1997 for his alleged involvement in attacks on two official buildings in Istanbul      Speculation has also abounded that the bombing was related to the perceived support of the U.S. for Turkey's harsh criticism of the regime in Syria, whose brutal civil war has forced tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to seek shelter in Turkey. But Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied that.      Sanli was diagnosed with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and released on probation in 2001, following the introduction of legislation that allowed hunger strikers with the disorder to get appropriate treatment.            The syndrome is a malnutrition-related brain illness that affects vision, muscle coordination and memory and that can cause hallucinations.      Sanli fled Turkey after his release and was wanted by Turkish authorities. He was convicted in absentia in 2002.      Half-staff: The U.S. flag at the embassy flies at half-staff a day after a suicide bomber attack, in Ankara, Turkey      Heightened security: Turkish security officers stand outside the US Embassy a day after Sanli targeted the building      On Saturday, a street in front of the security checkpoint where the explosion knocked a door off its hinges and littered the road with debris was blocked off. Police vehicles were parked in streets surrounding the building.      The guard who was killed was standing outside the checkpoint. The U.S. ambassador on Saturday attended his funeral in a town just outside of Ankara. A Turkish TV journalist was seriously wounded and two other guards had lighter wounds.            The White House was quick to declared the bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Ankara an 'act of terror' on Friday as Westerners in Turkey were warned to be vigilant.            Sanli detonated his stash of TNT outside the embassy in the Turkish capital at 1.15pm local time, killing a guard and himself.            Turkish officials blamed the attack on domestic leftists but U.S. officials were not immediately clear who was responsible.

Didem Tuncay, 38, a television journalist who was reportedly at the embassy to get a U.S. visa, was said to be 'seriously wounded' but not in a life-threatening condition.      T wo other guards sustained lighter wounds in the blast, Turkey's interior minister, Muammer Guler, told reporters. He said they 'were standing in a more protected area.      He also blamed the attack on a domestic left-wing militant group but did not explain why.            The group, DHKP-C, has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States but had been relatively quiet in recent years. The explosion occurred inside the security checkpoint at the side entrance to the U.S. embassy, which was being used by staff.

Two were killed in the blast outside the U.S. embassy, local television reported      Scene: People stand outside the entrance of the US embassy in Ankara where the blast killed two security guards Police and ambulances swarmed the area and authorities immediately cordoned it off. TV footage showed the embassy door blown off its hinges. The windows of nearby businesses were also shattered by the power of the blast, and debris littered the ground and across the road. The inside of the embassy did not appear to be damaged. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack demonstrated a need for international cooperation against terrorism and was aimed at disturbing Turkey's 'peace and prosperity.' 'But we will stand firm and we will overcome this together,' he said. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy thanked Turkey for 'its solidarity and outrage over the incident.' The embassy building is heavily protected and located near several other embassies in Ankara, including that of Germany and France. The Hurriyet newspaper said staff at the embassy took shelter in 'safe room' inside the compound soon after the explosion. Damage: Turkish police begin the search for clues at the scene of the blast Leftist group: Sanli belonged to the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C Aftermath: Phones were not being answered at the embassy 'We can confirm a terrorist blast at a check point on the perimeter of our embassy compound in Ankara, Turkey, at 1.13pm local time,' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in Washington. 'We are working closely with the Turkish national police to make a full assessment of the damage and the casualties, and to begin an investigation,' she said on Friday.      Turkish police were examining security cameras around the embassy. Forensics: Police forensic experts work on the site of a blast outside the US Embassy in Ankara Suicide: Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has confirmed the explosion was a suicide attack Security: Turkish police secure the area after an explosion in front of U.S. Embassy in Ankara U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey have been targeted previously by terrorists. In 2008, an attack blamed on al-Qaida-affiliated militants outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul left three assailants and three policemen dead. Elsewhere, terrorists attacked a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11 last year, killing U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The attackers in Libya were suspected to have ties to Islamist extremists, and one is in custody in Egypt.      Checkpoint: The bomb exploded near the security checkpoint at the entrance of the visa section of the embassy      The blast went off in the Turkish capital Ankara (marked on map) Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the attack 'in the strongest terms,' and said Turkey and the U.S. will get the U.K.'s full support as they seek to hold those responsible to account. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, speaking to reporters during a visit to Belgrade, Serbia, said he was saddened that the attacked had occurred in Turkey. 'We have always shown great sensitivity to the protection of foreign missions and we will continue to do so,' he said. Homegrown Islamic militants tied to al-Qaeda have also carried out suicide bombings in Istanbul, Turkey's bustling commercial center. In a 2003 attack on the British consulate, a suspected Islamic militant rammed an explosive-laden pickup truck into the main gate, killing 58 people, including the British consul-general. Turkey is also being deeply affected by the brutal civil war in neighboring Syria, and has become a harsh critic of President Bashar Assad's regime there. The war has left at least 60,000 people dead so far, according to the U.N., and Turkey is sheltering tens of thousands of Syrian refugees. The first of six Patriot missile batteries being deployed to Turkey to protect the country against attack from Syria was just declared operational and placed under NATO command. Others are expected to become operational in the coming days.      VIDEO Chaotic scenes after suspected suicide bomber kills two in Turkey |||||	– DNA tests confirm that Marxist revolutionary Ecevit Sanli perpetrated the bombing attack at a US embassy in Ankara, Turkish officials said today. Sanli killed himself and a guard in the attack. A member of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Army-Front, Sanli served five years for his role in attacking two official buildings in 1997 but was released with a brain disorder after taking part in a hunger strike, the Daily Mail reports. He fled the country in 2003 and re-entered Turkey using false documents. An image of Sanli wearing an explosives belt and black beret appeared on the Army-Front's website beside the message, "Murderer America! You will not run away from people's rage." The site took responsibility for the embassy attack and warned that Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan is also a target, Reuters reports. The group wants Washington to remove Patriot missiles from Turkey before they become operational on Monday. Turkey accepted the missiles as part of a NATO plan to defend Turkey against spillover from Syria's civil war.
summarize: Damon Singleton offers an unequivocal apology for using gay slurs on Twitter, talks about his love of gay family members and hopes this mistake doesn't linger with him.      Earlier this week Ball State linebacker Damon Singleton used some homophobic slurs in some tweets to a friend of his. Nothing to march on Washington over, but still off-color and potentially offensive.      Singleton reached out to Outsports and asked us for the opportunity to make amends, as he truly felt bad about what he had done. We encouraged him to share his thoughts in a statement, and this is what he wrote:      "I want to first start off by saying that I am sorry to all those who were offended by my tweets to my friend. It was never meant to harm anyone. Me and my buddy were just joking around with each other and I can see where people took offense to that. I have no bad feelings toward gays or anything. I have gay family members and it does not bother me. I hope this all gets cleared and people will stop writing articles about me saying I am homophobic. I will never treat anyone different. I learned my lesson about using those words on social media and its a great learning experience. I hope this changes everyone's mind. I would be grateful if you guys would take down these tweets and articles about me. I am truly not a bad guy and I don't want this resting on me for the rest of my life. Thank you everyone."      Singleton's statement reflects what we at Outsports have said over and over: The use of homophobic language by athletes does not usually reflect some deeper anti-gay sentiment. This is the language they have grown up using, and they don't even realize it's wrong. We need to correct the language, because it is hurtful to gay youth. But when they offer apologies and explanations like Singleton has hear, we need to encourage them to learn from it and accept the apology.      Apology accepted, Damon.

summarize: House Republican leaders plunged into damage control mode Monday after a brutal budgetary assessment of their Obamacare replacement threatened to upend Senate GOP support and armed their critics on the left.      Speaker Paul Ryan’s team quickly pinpointed rosier elements of the report by the Congressional Budget Office, from cost savings to lower premiums. But the bottom line — that the number of uninsured Americans would climb by 24 million within a decade — threatened to upend the GOP leadership’s fragile efforts to unite congressional Republicans around the plan.      Story Continued Below      “Can’t sugarcoat it. Doesn’t look good,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). “The CBO score was, shall we say, an eye-popper.”      Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas sought to distance the Senate from the House bill, saying “we expect to do better” than the results that CBO showed.      “The House is going to continue to work on the bill to try and build support for it. But until they do, there’s not much for the Senate to do,” Cornyn said. Asked about conservative predictions this bill can’t pass the Senate, he said: “It’s premature to talk about that.”      That’s to say nothing of centrists spooked by the CBO results. Though conservatives have been the most vocally resistant to the plan so far, the new figures underscore the danger that moderate Republicans who hail from states that embraced Obamacare’s massive Medicaid expansion face if they support the bill. This contingent of House Republicans has been mostly muted about the bill so far and has been viewed by leadership allies as likely to fall in line.      The CBO score is a new obstacle for Republicans hoping to coalesce around a health care vision.      “I’m concerned about the Medicaid population. That’s the biggest part of the coverage for Ohio,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who has emerged as a protector of his state’s decision to expand Medicaid.      Late Monday, one House Republican — Virginia Rep. Rob Wittmann — announced that the would be opposing the health care bill even though he supports repealing Obamacare.      "After reviewing this legislation and receiving the Congressional Budget Office score today, it is clear that this bill is not consistent with the repeal and replace principles for which I stand," he said in a statement. "I do not think this bill will do what is necessary for the short and long-term best interests of Virginians and therefore, I must oppose it."      Portman, a budget wonk who has been wary of the House plan, argued that the CBO didn’t take into account all the flexibility that the House bill would allow for. But he did not sound like he was closer to publicly supporting the proposal.      Democrats, sensing the danger for Republicans, are already threatening to make the eye-popping number of uninsured people a fixture of the health care debate on Capitol Hill. Deep cuts to Medicaid and a spike in premiums for older Americans are also certain to become fodder for critics of the plan. And many of the positive aspects of the report — like an estimated 10 percent decline in premium growth over a decade — were quickly overshadowed by the brutal estimate of the uninsured.      “Every single House Republican owns this catastrophic bill and should be prepared for backlash at the ballot box, particularly given the anticipated loss of coverage for 14 million people as early as next year,” said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Tyler Law.      House leaders, meanwhile, made the case that the budget assessment was good news.      Ryan immediately praised it and said in a statement that it “confirms” that the GOP plan — titled the American Health Care Act — “will lower premiums and improve access to quality, affordable care.”      “If you read this entire report, I’m pretty encouraged by it. It actually exceeded my expectations,” Ryan said Monday evening on Fox News.      A top aide, Brendan Buck, wrote a series of tweets that pointed to more positive aspects of the report. He highlighted an estimated 10 percent reduction in premium growth by 2026, the elimination of Obamacare’s taxes to the tune of $883 billion and the bill’s potential to reduce the deficit.      Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) argued that the CBO’s score was incomplete because it does not include parts of the GOP plan not included in the current repeal bill. Republicans have long said their replacement would take place in three phases: the repeal bill itself, moves by the Health and Human Services Department to deregulate the insurance industry and additional health care bills that would allow people to purchase insurance across state lines.      “The Congressional Budget Office has not yet analyzed our entire proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare, and today’s score reflects only a portion of the actions we will take to roll back red tape, free markets and empower consumers,” Walden said.      President Donald Trump’s top health adviser, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, said administration officials “strenuously disagree” with the report. Republicans have noted that the CBO predicted more people would be covered by Obamacare in its assessment half-decade ago; those forecasts, however, came up short.      But those reassurances appeared to do little to calm senators’ nerves.      “We’ve got work to do here,” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who had raised concerns about the bill’s effect on Medicaid.      Asked about the 24 million increase in the number of Americans CBO says could be uninsured in 2026, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said: “Naturally, I’m concerned.”      Price will visit with Senate Republicans on Tuesday to explain how the Trump administration can help mitigate the problems some centrists have with the GOP health care plan. But Republican leaders said that in at least one respect, the effort to cobble together a majority to pass the bill got easier: convincing conservatives.

And a lot of the opposition seemed to come from people who thought there wasn’t enough reform in terms of spending,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, a former House leader and now No. 5 in Senate leadership. “In terms of coverage, we need to get a better sense of what Health and Human Services can do.”      Still, the Missouri Republican admitted that the CBO number was “troublesome” to the party’s efforts.      Even aspects of the report that Republican leaders praised included potential pitfalls. Though the report found premium growth that would decline on average by 10 percent over the course of a decade, it also emphasized that those reductions would disproportionately benefit younger people, while older Americans could see sharp spikes.      A likely snow day for Congress on Tuesday is all but certain to keep attention trained on the mounting challenges for Republicans working to pass their Obamacare replacement. ||||| Non-partisan budget office says replacement for Affordable Care Act would leave millions uninsured but reduce federal deficit by $337bn in first 10 years      As many as 24 million Americans risk losing health coverage over the next decade under the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.      The report predicts a dramatic loss of healthcare coverage over the next decade if Congress enacts the Republican healthcare proposal, which has faced criticism from across the political spectrum and from nearly every sector of the healthcare industry.      An estimated 52 million people would be uninsured in 2026, compared with the 28 million who would lack insurance that year under the current law, according to the report. President Donald Trump, who supports the Republican plan, has promised that his plan would provide “insurance for everybody”.      The congressional analysts estimate that the Republican healthcare proposal could reduce the federal budget by $337bn over 10 years, with the largest savings coming from cuts to the federal Medicaid program and “Obamacare” tax credits for people who buy insurance individually.      Republicans were bracing for an unfavorable accounting from the budget office on Monday, as the bill, called the American Health Care Act, faces intensifying opposition from conservatives, Democrats, consumer interest groups and nearly every sector of the US healthcare industry.      Reacting to the report, health and human services secretary, Tom Price, said the CBO score is “just not believable” and the White House “strenuously” disagrees with its conclusion. He said the analysis only accounted for one phase of the three-pronged plan, which the White House believes would cover more Americans than the report estimated.      The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said the report confirms that his plan will “lower premiums and improve access to quality”, indicating that Republicans intend to press ahead with the legislation despite the sizable loss of coverage.      “Our plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage,” Ryan said in a statement. “It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down.”      But Senator Susan Collins called the report a “cause for alarm” and urged her colleagues to slow down and revisit the replacement plan.      “This is an extremely important debate with significant implications for millions of Americans,” the Republican said. “We need to spend the time necessary to get this right.”            In the run-up to the publication of the CBO report, many Republicans began casting the expected drop in coverage as a consequence of having more choice.      “The one thing I’m certain will happen is CBO will say, ‘Well, gosh, not as many people will get coverage,’” Ryan said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “You know why? Because this isn’t a government mandate.”      The report also concluded that barring Planned Parenthood from receiving federal dollars would amount to $234m less in Medicaid spending over 10 years. But about a third of those savings, the report warned, would be wiped out by unintended pregnancies caused when low-income or rural women lose access to contraceptive services. Planned Parenthood receives Medicaid reimbursements for providing STI and contraceptive services, but not abortions, to low-income patients at no cost.      In addition to increased spending on births, the report found, there would be unpredictable costs associated with the children, who could qualify for Medicaid and other federal programs.      Democrats, who had criticized Republicans for rushing the bill through key House committees before the CBO score was released, seized on the report’s findings and called on Republicans to drop the bill.      “The CBO report should be a knockout blow for Republicans in Congress,” the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters during a joint press conference with the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, on Monday. “They should heed this warning and turn back from their plan that would be a disaster for the country.”            Pelosi echoed Schumer. “In terms of insurance coverage it’s immoral, in terms of giving money to the rich at the expense of working families it is indecent and wrong,” Pelosi said, adding: “I hope that they would pull the bill. It’s really the only decent thing to do.”      “It is abundantly clear why congressional Republicans wanted to rush their healthcare bill through committee during two middle-of-the-night markups – they know it is a fundamentally bad deal for Americans,” said the House Democratic caucus chairman, Joe Crowley of New York.      “Donald Trump’s ‘insurance for everybody’ pledge was a big fat lie,” the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, said in a statement.      The ACHA seeks to radically transform and cut Medicaid, one of America’s largest social safety nets; end requirements for Americans to purchase healthcare; allow insurance companies to charge the old five times more than the young; expand tax-free health savings accounts; cut taxes that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy; and shrink subsidies that benefit the middle class.      At the same time, it allows insurance companies to levy a 30% surcharge on anyone who does not have insurance for more than two months, meant to incentivize people to keep insurance.      Repealing Obamacare: the healthcare people can least afford to lose Read more      When the ACA was passed, it sought to insure all Americans and standardize health benefits. The law passed consumer protections, expanded Medicaid to single adults and established subsidized marketplaces for individuals to buy insurance.      Though the GOP plan would scrap many of the existing law’s critical provisions, it keeps a handful of its most popular ones: a requirement that insurers cover the sick, allowing young people to stay on their parents’ health insurance, and a ban on lifetime coverage caps.      During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump touted a replacement plan that would “cover everybody”.      Earlier on Monday, Trump invited a group of people – referred to by the administration as “victims of Obamacare” – to the White House to share their recount their negative experiences with the healthcare law.      Among those Trump heard from during the listening session was a cattle rancher who said the increasing healthcare rates are hurting her family business and a stay-at-home mom who was forced to re-enter the workforce because the increase in the premium for their family insurance was unaffordable. Trump promised the table that the Republican plan would ensure “access for everyone”, a departure from his earlier promise to create universal healthcare.      However, that access would come with a price for some groups, the CBO predicted. Changes in the Republican bill could cause monthly costs for older, poorer Americans to rise dramatically. For example, a 64-year-old earning $26,500 a year would have annual out-of-pocket costs increase by $14,600, from $1,700 a year under current law.      By contrast, young people could see annual costs drop. A 21-year-old earning the same amount of money would pay just $1,450 out-of-pocket, a $250 decrease from current law.      With the GOP having only a two-vote majority in the Senate, the bill needs to bring warring factions together to pass, assuming Democrats uniformly oppose the bill. Yet conservatives remain staunchly opposed to the legislation in its current form, dubbing it “Obamacare lite”.      Heritage Action for America, one of the most influential conservative opponents of the Republican healthcare law, cast doubt on whether the bill has enough votes to pass the House.            “The biggest fear I have – what keeps me up at night – is that Republicans pass a healthcare bill that keeps the fundamental architecture of Obamacare,” Michael Needham, the CEO of Heritage Action, told reporters on Monday. “Then, in 2020 or 2024, the American people look at the mess and vote in a Democrat who says the answer is single-payer healthcare.”      “I would say to my friends in the House of Representatives with whom I serve: ‘Do not walk the plank and vote for a bill that cannot pass the Senate and then have to face the consequences of that vote,’” Tom Cotton, a Republican senator for Arkansas, told ABC. “If they vote for this bill, they’re going to put the House majority at risk next year.”      Trump supporters in the heartland fear being left behind by GOP health plan Read more      Equally as blunt, Rand Paul, a Republican senator for Kentucky, said of Ryan’s plan: “He will not have the votes.”      A handful of GOP senators have criticized the bill for not protecting Medicaid beneficiaries, and two Republican senators have objected to the provision stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funding.      House Republicans have pressed ahead quickly with the bill, which was unveiled last week. The healthcare plan was approved by two key House committees last week after all-night debates and despite objections from Democrats, who argued that it was critical to know the findings of the CBO report first. The proposal will next head to the House budget committee.      A preliminary assessment from the ratings agency S&P Global suggested between two million and four million people who are insured through the individual insurance market under the healthcare law could lose coverage, as well as between four million and six million people who are currently enrolled in Medicaid.      At the same time, as debate on the ACA has heated up its popularity hit a historic high in February, according to findings from the Pew Research Center and the latest Kaiser Health Tracking poll. The result is the highest level of support for the law in the 60 tracking polls Kaiser Health has conducted since 2010.      Molly Redden contributed to this report ||||| The Republican health care plan being considered by Congress will significantly increase the number of uninsured people, but save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. Here are the key findings from the report.      The number of uninsured will grow by 24 million in 10 years.      While President Trump promised “insurance for everybody,” the C.B.O. projects that if the Republican plan took effect today, 14 million more people would be uninsured next year, and by 2026, the number of uninsured would be about double what it is today.      That means that in 10 years, the number of uninsured Americans would be closer to what it was before the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health law, took effect.      Number of uninsured under the Republican plan      Before Obamacare 57 million In 2026 52 million Now 27 million Projected 2013 2016 2020 2026 Before Obamacare 57 million In 2026 52 million Now 27 million Projected 2013 2016 2020 2026 Before Obamacare 57 million In 2026 52 million Now 27 million PROJECTED 2013 2016 2020 2026      Several main changes under the Republicans’ proposal would cause fewer people to have insurance.      It would substantially cut funding for Medicaid, which covers low-income Americans, and reduce the value of tax credits that individuals use to buy health insurance, pricing many out of the market.      It would also repeal the individual mandate, which requires all Americans to obtain health insurance if they can afford it, or else face penalties.      The mandate, which many Republicans criticize, was created to keep insurance affordable for those who are older or sick.      Without the mandate, many healthy people are expected to drop coverage, driving up prices for those who need it most, and ultimately causing even more people to drop out of the individual market.      To calculate how many people would be uninsured under the Republican plan, the C.B.O., a nonpartisan agency of economists and statisticians, also had to estimate what would happen if the Affordable Care Act were not repealed.      Number of uninsured if the current health law is not repealed      The report concluded that after 10 years, the Republican plan would create 24 million additional uninsured people — the difference between the number of uninsured under the proposed plan and the number if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed.      The plan would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over 10 years.      The Republican plan would save the federal government $337 billion by 2026, with the largest savings coming from cuts to Medicaid spending as well as reduced spending on tax credits for middle-income insurance buyers.      Projected cumulative change in deficit under the Republican plan      +$56 billion $0 -$42 billion -$100 -$165 billion -$200 -$300 billion In 2026 -$337 billion 2017 2019 2022 2024 2026 +$56 billion $0 -$42 billion -$100 -$165 billion -$200 In 2026 -$337 billion -$300 billion 2017 2019 2022 2024 2026      The savings would have been substantially larger, but Republicans would also eliminate about $600 billion in taxes imposed under the Affordable Care Act, including taxes on investment income, prescription drugs and indoor tanning.      14 million fewer people will be enrolled in Medicaid in 10 years.      The largest group of people to be affected by the Republican plan would be those with Medicaid coverage. Most of the declines would start in 2020, when the changes to the program would take effect.      Number of people who would lose Medicaid coverage under the Republican plan      0 -4 -8 -9 million -12 In 2026 -14 million -16 million 2017 2020 2022 2024 2026 0 -4 -8 -9 million -12 In 2026 -14 million -16 million 2017 2020 2022 2024 2026      Under the current health care law, 31 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid to cover low-income Americans without children, a group that previously found it difficult to afford insurance.      Several states that expanded their Medicaid programs could reverse course if the Republican plan became law.      The Republican plan does not repeal the expansion but would reduce funding for enrollees who gained access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.      The G.O.P. plan would also limit funding for all enrollees by giving states a fixed sum per enrollee, rather than making an open-ended commitment to provide funding based on need.      Republican leaders have long argued that fixing federal funding for Medicaid would ultimately produce significant savings in the federal budget, and the C.B.O. estimates that changes to Medicaid would decrease direct spending by $880 billion over 10 years.      Premiums will rise by 15 to 20 percent in the first couple of years, but decrease in 2020.      Republican lawmakers cite rising premiums as a main reason for repealing the Affordable Care Act.      The C.B.O. estimates that after an initial rise in average premiums, there would be an overall decrease beginning in 2020. By 2026, average premiums would be about 10 percent lower than under the current law.      But the change in premiums would be significantly different, depending on age, because the Republican plan calls for charging more for older Americans than allowed under the current law.      One of the biggest reasons premiums will go down is because insurance will become expensive for older people, causing them to leave the market, improving the risk pool.      Under the Republican plan, the premium for a typical low-income 64-year-old, after subsidies, would jump to $14,600 a year, from $1,700 a year, but rise slightly for a 40-year-old with the same income.      Net premium for a single individual with annual income of $26,500      Age Under Obamacare Under new plan 21 years old $1,700 $1,450 40 years old $1,700 $2,400 64 years old $1,700 $14,600      While premiums have risen under the current law, it shielded many Americans from increases because a majority of those buying insurance through the marketplaces received tax subsidies from the federal government. The subsidies were on a sliding scale according to income, to help offset some of the costs for middle-income Americans.      The Republican plan, however, changes the way premium subsidies are calculated: they would be distributed by age, instead of income.      That means that middle-income Americans earning just above the cutoff for Obamacare subsidies would get substantially more help paying for their health insurance.      Net premium for a single individual with annual income of $68,200      Age Under Obamacare Under new plan 21 years old $5,100 $1,450 40 years old $6,500 $2,400 64 years old $15,300 $14,600      But experts say that tax credits for those earning more won’t have a meaningful effect in reducing the number of uninsured because most high-earners are already insured anyway.      7 million fewer people will be covered by their employers.      About two million fewer people will be covered through work in 2020 under the Republican plan. By 2026, that number will be seven million, according to the C.B.O.      That’s largely because fewer employers would offer coverage with the repeal of the employer mandate, which required large employers to offer affordable health insurance. ||||| Senate Republicans are showing fresh signs of concern about a House bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare after an analysis projected that tens of millions would become uninsured under the legislation.      GOP senators stressed that they were still digesting the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis but signaled that they expect the House bill will likely need to be changed in light of the report.      “At the end of the day we should pause and try to improve the product in the light of the CBO analysis rather than just rejecting it,” Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGOP lawmaker wants to force vote on bill protecting DACA recipients GOP chairmen: Comey may have cleared Clinton before interviewing her North Korea turns up the heat on Trump MORE (R-S.C.) told reporters.      The CBO is projecting that under the House repeal and replace plan, the number of uninsured people would grow by 14 million in 2018, with that number rising to 24 million in a decade.      Sen. John McCainJohn Sidney McCainMcCain urges USDA to delay catfish inspections The Hill's 12:30 Report Book tours are testing ground for 2020 race MORE (R-Ariz.) said he would wait until the House finishes changing the legislation to make a final decision, but said he was “always” concerned about individuals losing their health insurance.      “I'm concerned more ...[about] what the House bill will do to Arizona especially since they expanded Medicaid,” he said.      The CBO found that the spike in the number of uninsured Americans would largely be tied to the proposed changes to Medicaid. The House bill both ends the extra federal funds for the expansion of Medicaid and caps overall federal spending for the program, both of which CBO says would lead to people losing coverage.      Pressed if he thought the House bill was dead on arrival in the upper chamber, McCain suggested that he was waiting to see what changes are made.      "I'll have to wait until the House finishes ... before I make a judgement."      House GOP leadership is pushing legislation, known as the American Health Care Act, that would dismantle core provisions of ObamaCare, including the Medicaid expansion, and put in place a new tax credit to help people buy insurance.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump and Republicans have to make the tax code great again Mnuchin: More tax details coming shortly Federal debt increase wasn't what Americans had in mind when they voted GOP MORE (R-Ky.) said late last week that senators would have the chance to amend the legislation before it gets a final vote in the Senate, but that has done little to quell public criticism of the bill from his caucus.      In a Monday evening statement, he said, “The takeaway from today’s announcement is clear: the Congressional Budget Office agrees that the American Health Care Act will ultimately lower premiums and increase access to care."      He dinged the CBO report as "incomplete" and said it "only considers one piece of our three-prong approach."      "And because this CBO report paints only a third of the picture, its statistics on coverage are obviously premature," he added.      But Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsThe Memo: Trump allies say he needs a GOP scalp Maine’s GOP governor: Collins ‘unlikely’ to win gubernatorial primary Veteran launches Dem congressional bid in Maine MORE (R-Maine) said the CBO's findings should be a "cause for alarm" for lawmakers.      "It should prompt the House to slow down and reconsider certain provisions of the bill," she said in a statement. "We need to spend the time necessary to get this right."      Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is pitching an alternative ObamaCare repeal and replace bill with Collins, told reporters on Monday that the CBO score is “awful.”      The CBO analysis drew an immediate wave of criticism against the House bill from congressional Democrats.      Reacting to the office’s analysis, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersSanders returning to Colbert next week The Hill's 12:30 Report Democrats need a roster like the Patriots to make waves in 2018 MORE (I-Vt.) told reporters that under the House legislation “thousands of Americans will die.”      But top Republicans showed no signs of backing away from the bill, which is still considered the main vehicle for ObamaCare repeal and replacement.      Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanTrump to cut pay raises for government workers Trump and Republicans have to make the tax code great again Mnuchin: More tax details coming shortly MORE (R-Wis.) touted the analysis’s findings that the House bill would decrease premiums, reduce the deficit and provide tax relief.      “I recognize and appreciate concerns about making sure people have access to coverage," he said in a statement. "[O]ur plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford."      Sen.

So when you give people the freedom to choose what they think is good for them and their family, then some of them are going to choose not to buy it,” he said.      Some Republicans, as well as Trump officials, publicly questioned the legitimacy of the CBO’s past findings in the wake of its report on the House bill.      Graham, however, argued that his GOP colleagues should spending time reviewing and trying to address the the budget office’s findings.

Updated 8:03 p.m. ||||| (Sarah Parnass,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)      House Republicans’ proposal to rewrite federal health-care law would more than reverse the gains the Affordable Care Act has made in the number of Americans with health insurance, while curbing the federal deficit, according to a widely anticipated forecast by congressional analysts.      The analysis, released late Monday afternoon by the Congressional Budget Office, predicts that 24 million fewer people would have coverage a decade from now than if the Affordable Care Act remains intact, nearly doubling the share of Americans who are uninsured from 10 percent to 19 percent. The office projects the number of uninsured people would jump 14 million after the first year      But the GOP legislation, which has been speeding through House committees since it was introduced a week ago, would lower the deficit by $337 billion during that time, primarily by lessening spending on Medicaid and government aid for people buying health plans on their own.      The report predicted that premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in the first year compared with those under the Affordable Care Act but 10 percent lower on average after 2026. By and large, older Americans would pay “substantially” more and younger Americans less.      The 37-page report provides the most tangible evidence to date of the human and fiscal impact of the House GOP’s American Health Care Act. It also undermines President Trump’s pledge that no Americans would lose coverage under a Republican remake of the Affordable Care Act, which was enacted by a Democratic Congress in 2010.      View Graphic What’s next for the Obamacare replacement bill      The report’s arrival produced starkly different tacks from the White House and Capitol Hill — with top aides to the president immediately seeking to discredit it while the House’s Republican leaders praised the report for reinforcing their argument that the plan curbs federal spending and gives Americans the freedom to be insured or not — their choice.      “Just absurd,” was the way Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, responded to the forecast, while Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said, “The CBO report’s coverage numbers defy logic.”      House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), meanwhile, said in a Fox News interview that the report “exceeded” his expectations, and he jumped on its prediction of a smaller deficit to try to assuage the chamber’s most conservative members, many of whom oppose the idea of new tax credits to help some Americans buy coverage on their own.      Declaring that the plans would usher in “the most fundamental entitlement reform in a generation,” Ryan said the legislation “is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down. That’s what this report shows.”      Despite that sales pitch, early signs emerged Monday night that the Congressional Budget Office report was not helping to solidify GOP support. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) announced he would oppose the bill.      “I do believe that we can enact meaningful health care reforms that put the patient and health care provider back at the center of our health care system, but this bill is not the right answer,” he said in a Facebook post.      Wittman’s stance could represent a new front of dissent among House Republicans. A six-term member who leads a House Armed Services subcommittee and represents a district that favored Trump by 12 percentage points, Wittman is neither a hard-right firebrand nor a wary moderate from a Medicaid expansion state. Rather, he is the sort of mainstream conservative that Ryan is counting on to toe the party line and pass the bill.      The release of the analysis marks the beginning of a new phase in the debate over the week-old health-care bill, which is moving through the House despite opposition from many Republicans, Democrats and major sectors of the U.S. health-care industry.      Democrats used the report’s findings to continue excoriating the House GOP plan. “The CBO score shows just how empty the president’s promises, that everyone will be covered and costs will go down, have been,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “This should be a looming stop sign for the Republicans’ repeal effort.”      The analysis predicts that the number of people without health coverage would rise to 52 million by 2026, compared with 28 million if the Affordable Care Act remains intact. That erosion would mean that about 1 in 5 U.S. residents would be uninsured by 2026 — compared to 1 in 10 uninsured now and 1 in 6 who were uninsured before the Affordable Care Act was enacted.      The reduction in the number of insured people would result from three factors. A provision rescinding the penalty imposed on the uninsured could prompt many Americans to drop their health plans. After that, tax credits that are less generous than current subsidies could make insurance unaffordable to more people. Finally, some states may undo the expansion of their Medicaid programs.      [The GOP’s dramatic change in strategy to pass its health-care law]                  The conservative House Freedom Caucus did not immediately respond to the report. Moderate Republicans expressed concerns about the number of people who would lose coverage, foreshadowing possible problems for the legislation if it reaches the Senate.      “These kinds of estimates are going to cause revisions in the bill, almost certainly,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).      “I don’t think that the bill that is being considered now is the bill that ultimately will be the one that we vote on in the Senate.”      In its current form, the House GOP proposal would administer Medicaid by giving each state a fixed amount of funding per person in the program rather than covering a fixed percentage of its Medicaid costs, no matter how high. The plan would also replace the Affordable Care Act’s federal insurance subsidies with age- and income-based tax credits, which would involve considerably less spending, the report shows.      While the deficit would be lower, the legislation also would reduce federal revenue by $592 billion by 2026 by repealing several taxes that the Affordable Care Act created to help pay for more people to get insurance — notably taxes on high-income Americans, hospitals and health insurers.      “They are implementing the biggest transfer of wealth in our history,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters Monday. “In terms of insurance coverage, it’s immoral. In terms of giving money to the rich at the expense of working families, it is indecent and wrong.”      The White House has spent the past week engaged in a charm offensive aimed at bringing conservatives on board, as well as an effort to discredit the Congressional Budget Office before it released numbers.      The Affordable Care Act has increased coverage by 20 million to 22 million — almost half of those through the insurance markets the law created for people who cannot get affordable coverage through a job, and the rest through an expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia.      On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said Republicans “obviously” want to “improve those coverage numbers.”      But Cornyn noted that, by eliminating the penalty for violating the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most Americans carry insurance, “some people are going to make the decision not to buy it.”      The elimination of that penalty would account for the immediate increase in the uninsured.      The estimates projected a significant drop in Medicaid enrollment. Next year, the forecast says, about 5 million fewer people would be on Medicaid. By 2026, the program’s rolls would shrink by nearly 15 million — almost 1 in 4 of the 68 million currently in the program.      The Congressional Budget Office also predicted substantial disparities in the effect the legislation would have on insurance premiums for younger versus older consumers.      If the GOP plan is enacted, a 21-year-old making $68,200 would pay an average of $1,450 for a year’s worth of insurance premiums after the new tax credits, compared with $5,100 under the current law.      On the other hand, the cost of a year’s worth of premiums would stay about the same for a 64-year-old at the same income level. For a 64-year-old making $26,500, the cost would rise sharply, from $1,700 to $14,600.      (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)      Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) criticized the plan’s approach to the elderly.      “I’m not an attack person — you know that,” he said. “I don’t just attack because you’re on the other side of the aisle. But how can you look at yourself and say, ‘Okay, I’ll help the person who needs help the least, the wealthiest people, with more tax cuts, because I’m going to be taking away from the elderly population?’ ”      The analysis also forecast a reduction in the number of Americans who get insurance through their employers, in part because the new tax credits would be available to people with higher incomes than with the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies. Some employers would also drop coverage, the Congressional Budget Office projected.      Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician and strong Affordable Care Act critic in the Senate, sounded apprehensive about the report’s implications.      “President Trump said that he wants as many people covered as under Obamacare,” Cassidy said. “He said that health care should be affordable. If there’s 14 million people losing insurance, of course it’s concerning. I try to avoid hyperbole and adjectives, but it’s concerning.”      Abby Phillip, Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report.

As some moderates backed away from the plan, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said White House officials "strenuously disagree" with the "not believable" CBO report, which predicts that 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance a decade from now if the House health care plan replaces the Affordable Care Act. A roundup of coverage: House Speaker Paul Ryan went for a glass-half-full approach and highlighted the report's prediction of a smaller deficit, the Washington Post reports. The bill is about "giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford," Ryan said. "When people have more choices, costs go down." Top Republicans showed no sign of backing away from the bill after the report, though some GOP senators expressed deep misgivings, the Hill reports. Sen. Bill Cassidy called the CBO score "awful," while others said they would wait for the House's final version. Sen. Lindsey Graham said the chamber would work to improve the House product, not reject it. Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi held a joint press conference and called for the House bill to be dumped, the Guardian reports. "In terms of insurance coverage it's immoral, in terms of giving money to the rich at the expense of working families it is indecent and wrong," Pelosi said. House Republican Rob Wittman said he's opposing the House bill because of the CBO report. "It is clear that this bill is not consistent with the repeal and replace principles for which I stand," he said in a statement posted on Facebook. "I do not think this bill will do what is necessary for the short and long-term best interests of Virginians and therefore, I must oppose it." The New York Times takes a look at the report's findings and at who will be most affected by the House health bill. Those most likely to lose health insurance under the plan are low-income people without children who gained Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Vox has six charts explaining the CBO report, which it describes as "devastating" for the GOP health care plan.
summarize: Justin Bieber can't go a full week without getting himself into another controversy -- and this time, it has nothing to do with Mariah Yeater. There's a new Mariah making headlines with the Biebs, and her name is Mariah Carey.      In the duo's new music video for "All I Want For Christmas" -- a newer version of Carey's 1994 megahit, off Bieber's newly-released "Under the Mistletoe" album -- Carey shows off her post-pregnancy body in a sexy Santa Claus outfit, while Bieber and his friends shop for holiday gifts, like high-top kicks and Nintendo DS'. Then Bieber becomes some sort of Willy Wonka/Santa hybrid as people rush into the store with their golden tickets, only to be showered with gifts from the teen superstar.      Of course, it gets weirder from there. Throughout the video, Carey, 41, and Bieber, 17, share more than a few flirty looks, and some parents are not so pleased -- just look at these comments -- with Bieber getting cozy with the pop icon. We're sure it won't stop Beliebers from constantly playing it in their parents' cars from now until Christmas day.      Take a look at Bieber's latest controversy below.             ||||| Tonight, NBC aired its annual Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting special. It was boring! Well, except for the part where Justin Bieber debuted the music video for his duet with Mariah Carey of "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Superfestive!)." Because what the hell?      OK, so first of all, can we please discuss the fact that Carey spent the majority of the video dressed in a slutty Santa costume, dancing seductively in front of a green screen that was made to look like an artificial stone wall panel? Because what was that? Oh, and what was with Bieber spending its entirety standing atop some tacky riser in the middle of an abandoned Macy's, singing emphatically to... nobody?      What does it all mean? If your guess was, "The 17-year-old seemingly still prepubescent boy, singing all emphatically atop his riser, was doing so to woo the object of his affection, that being the 41-year-old slutty Santa green screen dancing lady, and vice versa," then congratulations/you're just as weird as the people who thought up the concept for this music video. ||||| This is how many of you will choose to interpret the "Superfestive!" remake of "All I Want for Christmas If You," and, frankly, Vulture hears you. It is not so much that Justin Bieber's remix is bad — It's not! It can't be! This song is bad-proof! — it's just that it feels particularly unnecessary, given the wonder that is the original. And when Justin is singing his verse, it's hard not to wish Mariah Elf were singing instead. Eventually, she chimes in again, and there's a nice bit toward the end with the two of them and a sleigh and a holiday puppy (even Bieber's harmonizing is kind of fun in that section, especially the "Shout" riff). There's also plenty of "Mariah sexily dancing against a fake wall," even though she has to split screen time with the Biebz. One final question: Is Bieber wearing a plaid "shircket" (shirt + jacket)? Discuss. ||||| We've never really had a problem with Justin Bieber. We may not get it, but the kiddies have their music and we have ours. So why has the Bieb launched a campaign to traumatize everyone who's old enough to remember the '90s? First he convinced Boyz II Men to make a ridiculous video with him, and now he's released a Macy's commercial disguised as a Mariah Carey duet — though we used that term loosely because it sounds like Bieber is just wailing over the old recording of the song. Hope you enjoyed listening to the original for the last 17 years, because this version is all you'll be hearing while doing your holiday shopping.      Earlier: Here's That Justin Bieber/Boyz II Men Holiday Tune You Didn't Ask For |||||	– Justin Bieber teamed up with Mariah Carey for a new version of her '90s holiday classic, "All I Want for Christmas Is You," and the results are just about as bad as you'd expect. A sampling of the reactions: "Why has the Bieb launched a campaign to traumatize everyone who's old enough to remember the '90s?" moans Margaret Hartmann on Jezebel. His Boyz II Men video was bad enough, but "now he's released a Macy's commercial disguised as a Mariah Carey duet—though we used that term loosely because it sounds like Bieber is just wailing over the old recording of the song." "It is not so much that Justin Bieber's remix is bad—It's not! It can't be! This song is bad-proof!" writes a forgiving Amanda Dobbins in New York. "It's just that it feels particularly unnecessary, given the wonder that is the original. And when Justin is singing his verse, it's hard not to wish Mariah Elf were singing instead." On Gawker, Matt Cherette calls the video "life-ruining," and wonders what in the world was up with the fact that Carey spent most of it "dressed in a slutty Santa costume, dancing seductively in front of a green screen that was made to look like an artificial stone wall panel." Not surprisingly, the Huffington Post adds, some parents are less-than-pleased with the flirting between 17-year-old Bieber and 41-year-old Carey in the vid.
summarize: "This was quite sudden, and it was also something that was going to separate the relationship that we had, and that was a big blow to me. By that I mean the relationship that each and every day, we work together," he said. "When I discussed her boyfriend, I stated that I wished I could be better at accepting it right now but I probably needed a bit of time." ||||| (CNN) Rep. Patrick Meehan said in an interview Tuesday with the Philadelphia Inquirer that while he had developed deep "affection" for a former staffer and saw her as a "soul mate," he never pursued a romantic relationship with her, contrary to her claims.      Meehan's comments to the Inquirer are his most extensive since The New York Times reported Saturday that the Pennsylvania Republican had used thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to settle a sexual misconduct complaint against him by a former aide.      In the Inquirer interview, Meehan also said he still plans to seek re-election.      Meehan told the Inquirer he had "developed an affection" for his aide "in a way in which I was struggling to make sure that I would never put that into our professional relationship."      He expressed his feelings to the woman and later that night wrote her a letter by hand, according to the Inquirer.      Meehan, according to the Inquirer, said he never wanted a romantic relationship with the former staffer and that he remained loyal to his wife.      He told the Inquirer that he had told the woman he was "a happily married man and I was not interested in a relationship, particularly not any sexual relationship, but we were soul mates. I think that the idea of soul mate is that sort of person" with whom you can "go through remarkable experiences together."      Alexis Ronickher, the attorney for Meehan's accuser, told CNN that his comments were a "gross violation of the agreement" between her client and him.      "At this time, my client sees this as a continued breach of the confidentiality agreement," Ronickher told CNN. "She continues to prize her privacy and is not going to breach. What she will do is cooperate with the Ethics Committee investigation and provide any and all information she can. She's right now reviewing what legal actions and remedies are available to her."      The House Ethics Committee announced Monday that it had opened an investigation into Meehan in response to The New York Times report.      The chairman and ranking member of the House Ethics Committee said Monday that the panel had begun looking into allegations that Meehan "may have engaged in sexual harassment and misused official resources, namely his Member's Representational Allowance." They also noted that Meehan himself had written to the committee to ask that it review the allegations.      The former aide accused Meehan of making unwanted romantic advances toward her and growing hostile when she didn't reciprocate, according to the Times, which cited people familiar with her time in the office.      The former aide initiated a complaint with Congress' Office of Compliance, began working from home and ultimately left her job, the Times reported. She later reached a confidential settlement paid from Meehan's congressional office fund.      Meehan told the Inquirer on Tuesday that he would repay the public funds used to settle the case if the House Ethics Committee's investigation finds that he harassed the woman. However, according to the Inquirer, Meehan described the payment as "severance" rather than a "settlement."      Meehan had been a member of the House ethics panel but was removed by House Speaker Paul Ryan on Saturday. Ryan also told Meehan he must repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle the case.      The allegations against Meehan surfaced the same week that a bipartisan group of House lawmakers unveiled a long-awaited plan aimed at tackling the way workplace complaints -- including sexual harassment -- are handled on Capitol Hill. Part of that legislation would hold lawmakers personally liable for settlements. |||||	– Rep. Pat Meehan admits that he told a much younger aide that he saw her as a "soul mate" and handled it badly when he found out she had a serious boyfriend—but he denies that his actions count as sexual harassment, even though his office secretly settled with her for thousands of taxpayer dollars last summer. The Pennsylvania Republican tells the Philadelphia Inquirer that he developed an "affection" for the longtime aide and confessed his feelings for her when he found out about her new relationship. He says he told her "that I was a happily married man and I was not interested in a relationship, particularly not any sexual relationship, but we were soul mates." Meehan, 62, says he defines "soul mate" as a "sort of person that you go through remarkable experiences together." Meehan gave the Inquirer a copy of an emotional letter he wrote to the aide. He admits that "in hindsight," he should have realized it could make a subordinate uncomfortable to receive such a letter from a superior—but in his office, they're all "Team Meehan." He says the hostility the former aide complained she experienced was not because she didn't reciprocate his feelings, but because he was stressed out by ObamaCare negotiations. Her lawyer tells CNN that Meehan's comments are a "gross violation" of their confidentiality agreement and she plans to continue protecting her privacy by not breaching it. Meehan has been removed from the House Ethics Committee, which is investigating the allegations.
