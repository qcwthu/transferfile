summarize: Mars thigh bone photo explained by NASA ... maybe (OK, definitely)      "No bones about it," says NASA, that supposed thigh bone discovered by the Mars Curiosity rover is just a rock.      The space agency killjoys – who easily could've just issued a "no comment" and kept chuckling to themselves in the Johnson Space Center breakroom while the believers keep believing – cleared up the whole mess by dropping some science on their skeptics.      "If life ever existed on Mars, scientists expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes," NASA said on its Mars Science Laboratory website. "Mars likely never had enough oxygen in its atmosphere and elsewhere to support more complex organisms. Thus, large fossils are not likely.

RELATED: Mystery lights over Houston keep people talking about UFOs ||||| A rock spotted by NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars may look like a femur bone, but is actually just a weathered Martian rock formation.      A photo from NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars set the Internet abuzz this week with claims that the robot had found a "thigh bone" on the Red Planet. But not so fast. That so-called bone? Just a weathered Martian rock, NASA says.      The erroneous bone claim first appeared on a UFO blog and was quickly picked up by media outlets. So much so, that NASA released Curiosity's "thigh bone" Mars rock photo with a science explanation on Thursday (Aug. 21).      In the photo description, NASA officials wrote that while "this Mars rock may look like a femur thigh bone," it is not the fossilized remains of a mysterious Martian. "Mission science team members think its shape is likely sculpted by erosion, either wind or water."      The Curiosity rover has found evidence that Mars was once a habitable place in the ancient past, but there is no evidence that creatures large enough to leave a bone behind ever existed on the planet.      "If life ever existed on Mars, scientists expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes," NASA officials wrote in the photo description. "Mars likely never had enough oxygen in its atmosphere and elsewhere to support more complex organisms. Thus, large fossils are not likely."      There is a long tradition of seeing shapes in Mars rocks that don't reflect reality. The phenomenon in which the human brain perceives faces, animals or other shapes that aren't really there is known as pareidolia.

Then in 1976, a photo from NASA's Viking 1 orbiter revealed a formation that gained fame as the " Face on Mars ." Later observations by NASA and European spacecraft showed no face, just a large rock feature, proving the face was just a trick of shadow and light.      Since the "Face on Mars," photos from Mars orbiters and rovers have captured shapes resembling a lizard, a rat and even a jelly donut — all of them just illusions or strange rock formations on the Red Planet.

An image caught by the rover's MastCam on August 14 shows a collection of rocks, half buried in dust. One in particular stands out. It looks quite a bit like a femur bone from a thigh.      This is all it takes to get alien fanatics excited about the possibility of fossilized alien remains on Mars. However, an alien femur on Mars is no more real than the uneaten jelly doughnut on the Red Planet or the infamous monument to Elvis.      NASA said Thursday its science team members expect that the rock was shaped through erosion caused by wind or water. NASA knows how images of odd objects can stir up the public imagination, so the space agency gives this preemptive statement: "If life ever existed on Mars, scientists expect that it would be small simple life forms called microbes. Mars likely never had enough oxygen in its atmosphere and elsewhere to support more complex organisms. Thus, large fossils are not likely."      The thigh-bone-looking rock actually looks different from a regular human femur. It's crooked, rather than straight, which only feeds the imagination when it comes to alien anatomy. Chalk this up to the human tendency to try to make sense out of random shapes. |||||	– Sorry, ET lovers: That "fossilized thigh bone" spotted on Mars this week was really just (can you bear the tension) a rock, NASA says. "No bones about it!" writes the agency on its website. "Mission science team members think its shape is likely sculpted by erosion, either wind or water." The Houston Chronicle calls NASA scientists "space agency killjoys" for explaining that any life in Mars' history likely existed at the microbial level, owing to a lack of oxygen to support complex life forms. And CNET notes that the rock was too crooked to be a thigh bone anyway. But today's alien enthusiasts aren't the first to dream: Astronomers claimed to see canals on Mars in the 1800s, and fans interpreted a "face" amid the light-and-shadow play of a 1976 photo of the planet's surface, Space.com reports.

The 105-page lawsuit, filed in Orange County by District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, alleges five pharmaceutical companies spent millions of dollars to convince the public that drugs meant only for short-term use by cancer patients should be taken for chronic pain.      The marketing campaign changed prescription opioids from a niche drug to an $8 billion industry by 2010 and contributed to more than 16,000 overdose deaths that same year, putting profits above health, the suit states.      The rise in highly addictive painkillers also created an atmosphere where doctors made life-and-death decisions based not on science but on hype, the suit states.      Rackauckas, in an interview Wednesday, likened the pharmaceutical companies to the tobacco industry. “What we’re after is to make these companies stop the practice of false advertising and false claims that these drugs are benign,” he said. “The effort is to require them to be truthful.”      Filed after an extensive series of Register columns over three years blaming much of the epidemic on drug companies, the lawsuit names Purdue Pharma, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Janssen Pharmaceuticals – a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, Endo Health Solutions, and Actavis, as well as affiliated companies.      All the companies are accused of false advertising, unfair competition and creating a public nuisance. Teva, Endo and Actavis could not be reached for comment.      Robyn Frenze, with New Jersey-based Janssen, responded, “We’re committed to responsible promotion, prescribing and use of all our medications. At this time, we’re reviewing the case.”      Purdue Pharma of Stamford, Conn., issued a similar response, “We have not received the complaint from the local authorities, nor had the opportunity to review it. When we do, we will respond accordingly.”      The lawsuit earned applause from several Orange County parents who have lost children to prescription drug overdoses.      “It’s always been my opinion that Big Pharma is the head of the snake,” said James Kennedy, whose son, Joey, died from an overdose. “They flood the market with a very powerful opiate that shouldn’t be prescribed but for a very small portion of patients. The whole organization is designed for profit, not for healing.”      Jodi Barber, whose son, Jarrod, 19, also overdosed, declared, “This could be a major break in the epidemic.”      Pushing drugs like Vicodin, Opana and Oxycontin, the pharmaceutical companies appealed to doctors and consumers that the dangers of opioids were untrue and that the compassionate treatment of pain actually required opioids, according to the suit.      “They overstated the benefits of using opioids long-term to treat chronic non-cancer pain, promising improvement in patients’ function and quality of life,” said the suit. “(They) dismissed or minimized the serious risks and adverse outcomes of chronic opioid use, including the risk of addiction, overdose, and death.”      Slick campaigns – born in marketing offices and not supported by science – sold the opioids for long-term pain, said the suit.      “The result has been catastrophic,” said the suit.      According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription opioids contributed to 16,651 overdose deaths nationally in 2010 – more than twice as many deaths as heroin and cocaine combined. It caused more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. In Orange County alone there is an opioid-related death, on average, every other day.      For every death, CDC reports, more than 30 people are treated in emergency rooms.      “The United States is now awash in opioids,” states the suit. In 2010, 254 million prescriptions for opioids were filled in the U.S. – enough to medicate every adult in America around the clock for a month, the suit states. Twenty percent of all doctor visits result in the prescription of an opioid, nearly double the rate in 2000. Opioids are now the most prescribed class of drugs, said the suit.      While Americans represent 4.6 percent of the world’s population, they consume 80 percent of the world’s supply of opioids, according to the suit.      With the prescription drug epidemic came a rise in heroin use as addicts looked for a cheaper high.      “It is hard to imagine the powerful pull that would cause a law-abiding, middle-aged person started on prescription opioids for a back injury, to turn to buying, snorting, or injecting heroin, but that is the dark side of opioid abuse and addiction,” the suit says.      Pharmaceutical firms, according to the suit, “unleashed the epidemic” by downplaying the risks and exaggerating the benefits of opioids over other drugs, shifting medical convention.      “Defendant Cephalon, for example, marketed its opioid, Fentora, for chronic non-cancer pain even though it was approved only to treat cancer pain,” said the suit. “What makes this effort particularly nefarious – and dangerous – is that unlike most other prescription drugs, opioids are highly addictive controlled substances.”      The companies deceptively engaged a patient base that – physically and psychologically – could not turn away from their drugs. Many were not helped by the drugs, but were profoundly damaged, the suit said.      This is not the first time that the drug companies have gotten into trouble.      In 2007, Purdue settled criminal and civil charges for misbranding OxyContin, agreeing to pay the United States $635 million – one of the largest settlements with a drug company for marketing misconduct. Still, Purdue had national annual sales of OxyContin between $2.47 billion and $2.99 billion for the last five years, the suit said.      In 2008, Cephalon pleaded guilty to a criminal violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for its misleading promotion of Actiq and two other drugs and agreed to pay $425 million.      Contact the writer: tsaavedra@ocregister.com |||||	– The makers of strong painkillers like OxyContin have created a "population of addicts" with a "campaign of deception" about the risks the drugs carry, two California counties charge in a lawsuit filed on behalf of the whole state. Orange and Santa Clara counties are suing five large makers of opium-like painkillers, accusing them of using false advertising and misleading practices, reports the Los Angeles Times. The counties say the drug makers caused an epidemic of addiction and overdoses by marketing drugs meant for short-term pain relief to people suffering chronic pain, and used methods similar to those of tobacco companies to "conceal their deceptive marketing and conspiratorial behavior." The lawsuit seeks compensation for damage caused by the drugs and a court order forcing to companies to give up revenue based on allegedly misleading ad campaigns. The main goal is "to stop the lies about what these drugs do," says the district attorney in Orange County, where there is a painkiller-releated death every other day, according to the lawsuit. "It’s always been my opinion that Big Pharma is the head of the snake," a father whose son died from an overdose tells the OC Register. "They flood the market with a very powerful opiate that shouldn't be prescribed but for a very small portion of patients. The whole organization is designed for profit, not for healing."

"The current patient gown, with the ties in the back, reinforces a power imbalance between patients and caregivers," Dr. Mark Smith, head of the MedStar Institute for Innovation, tells the New York Times, which details a new incarnation of hospital attire created by Care+Wear. The company, which worked with Parsons School of Design students, found itself faced with a challenging task: Design a comfortable hospital gown that provides more coverage for the patient while still allowing medical staff easy access to insert IVs and check vitals. The result, which retails for $45 on the Care+Wear website, is a cotton-polyester innovation that opens in the front and comes together via a system of snaps and ties that allows different parts of the body to be exposed when needed. Perhaps surprisingly, the hospital gown niche is a relatively untapped market for designers, and it's a big one: CDC stats note 140 million people ended up in the ER in 2014, and hospitals need up to five times that number of gowns for an adequate supply, says Care+Wear CEO Chaitenya Razdan. The gown's backside box pleat (image here) is especially catching people's attention, functioning "like a giant skirt slit that you can open up to have full access," per the company's products chief. The new gown will see an initial test run at one of MedStar Health's Maryland hospitals, expanding to its other nine locations if the gown is a hit.

summarize: WASHINGTON — When patients in South Dakota seek help for serious but manageable disabilities such as severe diabetes, blindness or mental illness, the answer is often the same: With few alternatives available, they end up in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, whether they need such care or not.      In a scathing rebuke of the state’s health care system, the Justice Department said on Monday that thousands of patients were being held unnecessarily in sterile, highly restrictive group homes. That is discrimination, it said, making South Dakota the latest target of a federal effort to protect the civil rights of people with disabilities and mental illnesses, outlined in a Supreme Court decision 17 years ago.      The Obama administration has opened more than 50 such investigations and reached settlements with eight states. One investigation, into Florida’s treatment of children with disabilities, ended in a lawsuit over policies that placed those children in nursing homes. With its report Monday, the Justice Department signaled that it might also sue South Dakota.      While the administration has received widespread attention for investigating police abuses and supporting the rights of gay and transgender people, the Justice Department has also steadily made these cases part of its civil rights agenda. The government says that those efforts have allowed more than 53,000 Americans with disabilities to leave institutions or avoid them altogether. It is a small number compared with the 250,000 working-age people who are estimated to be needlessly living in nursing homes, but advocates say the federal campaign has had significant effects. ||||| This collaborative project is an extension of the 2016 End of Term project, intended to document the federal government's web presence by archiving government websites and data.

As it relates to employment, Title I of the ADA protects the rights of both employees and job seekers. The ADA also establishes requirements for telecommunications relay services. Title IV, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), also requires closed captioning of federally funded public service announcements.      While the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) does not enforce the ADA, it does offer publications and other technical assistance on the basic requirements of the law, including covered employers’ obligation to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified job applicants and employees with disabilities. For a quick overview of the ADA read “The Americans with Disabilities Act: A Brief Overview.”      In addition to the U.S. Department of Labor, several other federal agencies have a role in enforcing, or investigating claims involving, the ADA:      Two agencies within the U.S. Department of Labor enforce parts of the ADA. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has coordinating authority under the employment-related provisions of the ADA.

Visit the Laws & Regulations subtopic for specific information on these provisions.      DOL Resources on the ADA ||||| Following a comprehensive investigation, today, the Justice Department released its findings that South Dakota unnecessarily relies on nursing facilities to provide services to people with disabilities, in violation of the community integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C.      South Dakotans with disabilities do not have a meaningful choice to receive the services they need in their own homes and communities. The ADA and the Olmstead ruling require states to make services available to people with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, regardless of age or type of disability.      The department’s findings, detailed in a letter to South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard, follow an investigation into the state’s system of care for people who receive services and supports in nursing facilities. The department found that thousands of people who rely on South Dakota for needed services must live in nursing facilities to receive those services, isolated from their communities. With access to adequate home- and community-based services, these individuals could instead live in their homes and communities.      “Regardless of their age, people with disabilities deserve privacy, autonomy and dignity in their everyday lives,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Our findings reveal how South Dakota’s current system of long-term care violates federal law and fails to give people with disabilities the choice to live in their own homes and their own communities. South Dakota officials have expressed their desire to provide meaningful opportunities for people with disabilities to receive home- and community-based care, and we look forward to working with South Dakota to build a more effective, more efficient and more just service system for all.”      An analysis of South Dakota’s current spending and national data shows that South Dakota – which has one of the highest nursing facility utilization rates in the country – may even realize cost savings and be able to serve more people by increasing the state’s use of home- and community-based services. The state funds the placement of about 3,400 people in nursing facilities through Medicaid at any given time, and approximately 5,500 people over the course of one year.      Nursing facility residents in South Dakota range in age, and include many older adults and almost 450 people under the age of 65. In addition to older adults with age-related disabilities, many of these individuals have disabilities they were born with or acquired at a young age, such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and amputations due to diabetes or mobility impairments due to an accident.      The findings letter examines the widespread impact of the state’s nursing facility system. For example, one 51-year-old man told the Justice Department that he had entered the nursing facility to recover after a leg amputation, but had been trying to leave the nursing facility for months, without help.      The department’s findings letter includes the following key conclusions:      Thousands of people who need long-term care have no choice but a nursing facility because South Dakota does not adequately arrange for community-based services or identify residents appropriate for transition.      Many people who rely on state services do not know that they could choose community-based services instead of a nursing facility because the state has not informed them of or offered them these services.      South Dakota spends more than 80 percent of its long-term services budget on nursing facilities but could rebalance these funds to prioritize home- and community-based services.      Most residents have physical disabilities, chronic illnesses or cognitive disabilities and need some assistance with some day-to-day tasks, rehabilitative therapy or nursing –services that the state can provide in community-based settings rather than in institutions.      People with similar needs to those living in South Dakota’s nursing facilities successfully receive services at home in other states, and even in South Dakota. The state already offers many of the services people will need to live in their own homes and can increase community capacity and address service limitations to ensure all individuals can choose these services instead of nursing facility placement.      People with disabilities living in rural and frontier areas of the state, including those living on reservations, have particular difficulty accessing services in their homes and communities.

South Dakota Findings Letter |||||	– The Justice Department may be gearing up to sue the state of South Dakota after a report released Monday found thousands of people with disabilities that could potentially be managed at home are being relegated to nursing homes or other long-term-care facilities instead, the New York Times reports. This most recent probe (the Times says there have been more than 50 around the country) is part of federal efforts to cut down on the 250,000 or so disabled people under the age of 65 "unfairly" placed in nursing homes—what a 2013 Senate committee report says flouts the Americans With Disabilities Act and violates a Supreme Court ruling made nearly two decades ago. "Regardless of their age, people with disabilities deserve privacy, autonomy, and dignity in their everyday lives," the head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division says in the report. One 73-year-old tells the Times some nursing homes are nothing more than "warehouses," with the paper noting patients are often kept from cooking their own meals or going out with friends unless they're signed out—"like a kid," another resident says. The 1999 Supreme Court case anchoring this civil rights dilemma, Olmstead vs. LC, ruled that, under the ADA, people with disabilities have a right to receive help without being segregated from the rest of society. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard—who was sent a 35-page letter from the DOJ outlining his state's violations and calling for "corrective action," per Disability Scoop—tells the Times in a statement he agrees with federal efforts in theory but struggles with implementation because of the many rural communities in his state.

WASHINGTON The scandal involving former CIA Director David Petraeus widened on Tuesday as U.S. defense officials said they were looking into "flirtatious" e-mails between General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and a woman at the center of the affair.      Defense Department officials said they were sifting through 30,000 pages of email and other communications between Allen and Jill Kelley, a Florida socialite whose complaints about harassing messages led to the discovery of Petraeus' affair with his biographer.      The revelation threatens to fell another of the U.S. military's biggest names after Petraeus' surprise resignation last week. It also complicates President Barack Obama's efforts to wind down the war in Afghanistan and reorganize his national security team following his re-election.      A senior defense official told Reuters the emails between Allen and Kelley were seen as potentially inappropriate because they were "flirtatious" in nature, not because they dealt with sensitive information. Allen has denied that the two had a sexual relationship, officials said on condition of anonymity.      Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Allen, a four-star Marine Corps general, would stay in his job for the time being, and the White House said Obama still had faith in Allen's ability to command U.S. troops in Afghanistan.      But asked how Obama saw the unfolding scandal at a time when his priorities include impending "fiscal cliff," Press Secretary Jay Carney said: "I certainly wouldn't call it welcome."      Obama suspended plans to transfer Allen to Europe, where he was to be the top commander of U.S. and allied forces in the region.      Both Allen and the official due to replace him in Afghanistan, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before they can take their new posts in February.      Top lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee said they would go ahead with a confirmation hearing for Dunford on Thursday. Allen's appearance was canceled.      Allen had just submitted recommendations on what role the United States should play in Afghanistan after most American combat troops withdraw by the end of 2014.      The investigations raised questions about how top U.S. officials in sensitive national security posts allowed themselves to become so personally involved with the women.      Kelley, 37, is a fixture in military circles in Tampa, Florida, where she was a volunteer social liaison at MacDill Air Force Base, home to the U.S. Central Command. She and her husband, surgeon Scott Kelley, became friends with Petraeus when he was stationed there from 2008 to 2010.      Her complaints about harassing emails from the woman with whom Petraeus had an affair, Paula Broadwell, prompted an FBI investigation that ultimately disclosed Petraeus' involvement with Broadwell.      People close to Petraeus say he had no romantic relationship with Kelley, but Broadwell may have seen her as a rival.      Both Petraeus and Allen had recently intervened in a bitter custody battle on behalf of Kelley's twin sister. The men wrote letters in September to the District of Columbia Superior Court in support of the twin sister, Natalie Khawam, as she sought more visitation rights with her son, court papers showed.      Officials suggested they were concerned by the volume of communications between Allen and Kelley over the past two years, rather than the possibility that the two shared classified material or engaged in an extramarital affair.      "We are concerned about inappropriate communications. We are not going to speculate as to what is contained in these documents," one official said.      Details on content of the emails were not revealed.      The FBI referred the case to the Pentagon on Sunday and Panetta directed the Defense Department's Inspector General to handle the investigation. Panetta also informed lawmakers who oversee military affairs.      FBI RAID, SHIRTLESS PHOTOS      FBI agents searched the Charlotte, North Carolina, house of Broadwell late Monday in a sign that the case involving Petraeus was not fully closed.      Agents entered the house carrying boxes at around 9 p.m. (0200 GMT Tuesday) and emerged four hours later, carrying away what appeared to be two computers and about 10 boxes.      Broadwell's family was not at home at the time.      U.S. officials had said in recent days that their investigation was largely complete and that prosecutors had determined it was unlikely they would bring charges in that case, which started when Kelley contacted an FBI agent in Tampa about harassing emails from an anonymous source.      That FBI agent, who has not been identified, came under scrutiny himself after it was discovered he had sent shirtless photographs of himself to Kelley "long before" this investigation, a law enforcement official told Reuters.      The FBI agent, who alerted an FBI cyber squad to the Broadwell case, apparently became frustrated at the pace of the investigation and complained to a member of Congress about it, the official said.      The emails between the two women were of a "childish", jealous nature and showed some one-upmanship of trying to come across as being more important to Petraeus, the official said.      Lawmakers and others have questioned whether Broadwell, who co-wrote a biography of the decorated former general, obtained classified information from him or another source.      Panetta had earlier said Petraeus did the right thing by stepping down, given the security concerns, but he was saddened by the end of the retired general's distinguished career.

John Allen, White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday as lawmakers in both parties expressed bewilderment at the conduct of the country’s top four-star commanders and demanded answers.      Carney said Obama continues to back Allen for the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe, following a statement from the National Security Council earlier in the day that the general’s nomination was being placed on hold, “pending an investigation.” Allen’s confirmation hearings with the Senate Armed Services Committee, initially slated for Thursday, will be postponed until the Department of Defense completes the investigation.

Allen,” Carney told reporters. He added that the president “thinks very highly of Gen. Allen.”      In his first comments about the ongoing revelations that led to the resignation of Petraeus as CIA director, Carney said: “The president was certainly surprised when he was informed about the situation regarding Gen. Petraeus. … His thoughts and prayers go out to both Gen. Petraeus and Holly Petraeus.”      (PHOTOS: General David Petraeus’s career)      Carney’s comments came hours after reports surfaced that Allen, a four-star general who commands U.S. forces and the NATO International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, allegedly exchanged, from 2010 through 2012, between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of emails — possibly of an inappropriate nature — with Jill Kelley, the Tampa volunteer who reportedly received harassing emails that were eventually traced back to Petraeus’s former mistress, Paula Broadwell. Petraeus stepped down over his affair.      Other reports say that Allen and Kelley had exchanged a few hundred — not thousands — of emails over several years, primarily about “routine stuff.” CNN reported that there was no inappropriate relationship between the two and that they had never been alone together in the same room. An Associated Press report on Tuesday said a senior defense official called the emails between Allen and Kelley “flirtatious.”      (Also on POLITICO: Petraeus affair timeline of events)      “The president first became aware on Friday after the Department of Justice notified White House counsel that there may be an issue associated with Gen. Allen’s nomination,” Carney said, adding that Obama learned Monday evening that the issued had been referred to the Defense Department’s inspector general, Carney added.      Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a pre-taped interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that she believes Petraeus will eventually testify in front of her committee about the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Petraeus was initially scheduled to appear there this week, but when he stepped down from his CIA post, the acting director took his place.      (Also on POLITICO: 10 facts about Jill Kelley)      “Well, I believe he will,” Feinstein said according to a transcript, when asked whether Petraeus will discuss Benghazi before the committee. “I think he’s a responsible person. And I believe he will come. And so we are going to try to set that up today, because his view, as someone who was actually there…I think that’s important for us to hear.”      A spokesman for Feinstein told POLITICO that Petraeus would not testify Thursday, but could appear before the committee Friday. ||||| At the request of Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, President Obama has put Gen. John Allen's nomination to be the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) on hold pending an investigation by the Inspector General of the Defense Department, the White House confirmed Wednesday.      "At the request of the Secretary of Defense, the President has put on hold his nomination of Gen. Allen as SACEUR pending the investigation of Gen. Allen's conduct by the Department of Defense IG," National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. "The president remains focused on fully supporting our extraordinary troops and coalition partners in Afghanistan, who Gen. Allen continues to lead as he has so ably done for over a year."      Allen, who is married, is being investigated for allegedly sending emails to a Tampa woman at the heart of former CIA director David Petraeus' downfall. Under certain circumstances, adultery is a crime under military law.      The White House also urged Congress to act quickly on Allen's replacement as head of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, saying that the situation should not stop Congress from considering the nomination of Gen. Joseph Dunford for that post. |||||	– David Petraeus' sex scandal just got a lot bigger. The Pentagon has revealed that it is investigating Gen. John Allen, the top US commander in Afghanistan, for allegedly sending "inappropriate communications" to Jill Kelley, Petraeus' other other woman. The FBI referred the matter to the Pentagon on Sunday, Leon Panetta tells the AP. Allen, who is married, will remain as commander of the International Security Assistance Force. But Politico reveals that his nomination to be NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe has been placed on hold, at Panetta's request. A senior Pentagon official says 20,000 to 30,000 pages, mostly emails, from Allen's communications with Kelley between 2010 and 2012 are under review. He wouldn't comment on their contents, but Reuters reports that the volume alone is enough to raise eyebrows: an exchange of an average of 30 pages of communication daily. "Even if the notes were short, such intense interaction might have consumed a lot of Allen's time," it notes. Echoed Ret. Gen. James Marks on CNN this morning, "That’s a heck of a lot of time behind the computer sending notes to a party planner, from a senior officer who has, obviously, a bunch of things on his plate." The Pentagon official says "Gen. Allen disputes that he has engaged in any wrongdoing in this matter."
summarize: (CNN) -- A fast-moving brush fire burning just south of Reno, Nevada, on Thursday prompted evacuations, closed a major highway and led the governor of Nevada to declare a state of emergency.      The more than 3,000-acre fire began burning around 1 p.m. Thursday in North Washoe Valley, according to a press release from county officials. At least 10,000 people have been evacuated. There was no containment on the blaze, said Nancy Leuenhagen, Washoe County press Iinformation officer.      Video from CNN Reno affiliate KOLO showed dark smoke plumes, fueled by heavy wind and dry vegetation, pushing toward U.S. Highway 395. A 12-mile stretch of the highway remained closed late Thursday, according to Dan Lopez of the Nevada Highway Patrol.      Several flights at the Reno airport have been canceled or diverted, CNN affiliate KTVN reported.      "Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been and are being affected by this fire," Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said in a statement. "Declaring a state of emergency ensures that every resource from the local, state and federal level is available to assist."      The Nevada Division of Forestry and the Department of Public Safety were aiding local firefighters and emergency personnel, Sandoval said. The National Guard was on standby and the state of California was also providing assistance, according to the governor's website.      About 12 families displaced by the fire were receiving assistance at an evacuation shelter at a local high school, said Karli Epstien, Red Cross press information officer.      CNN's Nigel Walwyn and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report. ||||| Wind gusts of up to 82 mph pushed a fast-moving brush fire south of Reno out of control Thursday as it burned several homes, threatened dozens more and forced about 10,000 people to evacuate their neighborhoods.

Winds gusting up to 82 mph pushed a fast-moving brush fire... (Associated Press)      Reno Fire Chief Michael Hernandez said more than 230 firefighters were battling the blaze, which had grown to nearly 5 square miles within hours.      Hernandez confirmed "several" homes had been destroyed. He said he didn't know the exact number but told reporters "the news is not good."      There were no immediate reports of any deaths or injuries.      A Reno television station reported at least 10 homes had burned since the fire broke out about 12:45 p.m. along U.S. Highway 395.      Washoe County officials declared a state of emergency a few hours later, and Gov. Brian Sandoval followed with a statewide declaration.      A five-mile stretch of U.S. 395 was closed as the strong winds pushed the flames north toward Reno along the base of the hillsides, Washoe County sheriff's Deputy Armando Avina said. Heavy smoke reduced visibility to zero.      By nightfall, the fire had burned to the city's southern outskirts. Flames were visible 10 miles away in the downtown casino district.      "It's moving at a very fast rate," Avina said. "The winds are extremely powerful in this area."      The winds died down after nightfall and rain started falling, much to the delight of fire crews.      Deputies went door to door asking people to leave their homes in Pleasant Valley, Old Washoe Valley and Saint James Village, Avina said. They evacuated about 300 students from Pleasant Valley Elementary School.      Erika Minnberry, 28, said she didn't become concerned at first because smoke from the fire appeared far enough away.      "Probably 30 minutes later, it was up to our house because of the high winds," she said. "I felt pure survival adrenaline. When we drove away, the smoke was so thick, we could barely see ahead of us. Now I feel anxiety. I couldn't find my two cats at the time and I hope they're OK."      KRNV-TV reported that 10 homes had burned, including a half dozen in the Washoe Valley Estates neighborhood. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported explosions could be heard in the area.      Firefighters had zero containment of the blaze and were concentrating on using crews and trucks to protect homes in the path of the flames, Hernandez said.      He estimated firefighters had saved about 1,000 structures and said another 80 to 120 firefighters were expected to arrive on scene before midnight.      "To say we are in the thick of battle is an understatement," he told reporters.      Martinez said the fire was "almost a carbon copy" of a huge wild fire on the edge of the Sierra foothills that destroyed 30 homes in southwest Reno in November.      "It is a wind-driven event and a combination urban-wildland fire," he said.      Like in that fire, Martinez said, strong winds and dry conditions helped fuel the latest blaze. The Reno area had gone a winter-record 56 days without any precipitation until light snow fell earlier this week.      More wet weather was forecast Friday, and snow was forecast Friday night. But high winds were expected to continue, with gusts up to 40 mph.      The strong winds that blew over the Sierra ahead of the winter storm caused delays earlier Thursday in Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Reno, where he was two hours late to give a speech at Galena High School on the south end of town.      The air smelled of smoke at the school, which sits on the Mount Rose Highway leading to Lake Tahoe. Biden told the audience about 25 minutes into his speech that he was cutting his remarks short because of the fire.      Martinez conducted his 5:15 p.m. briefing at the high school, which was evacuated along with surrounding neighborhoods shortly afterward.      The flames, up to 40 feet high, raced through sage brush, grass and pines in an area where small neighborhoods are dispersed among an otherwise rural landscape. Washoe County animal services officials were helping round up horses and other livestock for evacuation.      The American Red Cross opened an evacuation center at Damonte High School, where the children from the elementary school were taken.      Trooper Dan Lopez said U.S. 395 was closed from the south end of Reno at Mount Rose Highway, or state Route 431, to the north end of Washoe Valley near the Bowers Mansion. Northbound traffic was being rerouted back to Carson City about 15 miles to the south.      Winds gusts of up to 82 mph were reported within a few miles of the fire, and a gust of 122 mph was recorded atop Slide Mountain, which is between the fire and Reno at the Mount Rose ski resort.      ___      Associated Press writers Martin Griffith in Reno and Sandra Chereb in Carson City contributed to this report. |||||	– A fast-moving brush fire south of Reno has burned several homes and forced around 10,000 people to be evacuated from their neighborhoods.

Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's 17-year-old daughter Tallulah Belle was arrested on Friday night after cops in Hollywood spotted the girl and two other underage friends exiting a car holding bottles of alcohol, according to TMZ.            Since Tallulah -- who was charged with alcohol possession -- is a minor and can't be cited and released without parents being notified, she had to call Daddy.            Willis must have been busy -- or too angry to deal with his youngest daughter's bad behavior -- because mom Moore showed up at the police station to spring Tallulah and take her home.            Last month, the teen was photographed in a bra and jean shorts and lighting a cigarette at Coachella Music Festival. A tattoo was also noticeable on her hip.            And when she was just 15, Tallulah drank wine and smoked at her sister Scout's birthday party.            Partying certainly runs in the family.            Moore went to rehab in 1985 for cocaine and alcohol dependencies.

The National Strategic Computing Initiative will attempt to build the first ever exascale computer, which would be more than 30 times faster than today's fastest supercomputer, according to an executive order issued Wednesday.      The initiative will primarily be a partnership between the Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and National Science Foundation, which will be designing supercomputers primarily for use by NASA, the FBI, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Homeland Security, and NOAA. Each of those agencies will be allowed to provide input during the early stages of the development of these new computers.      The primary task of the initiative is "accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system," the order said. For context, it is believed that an exascale computer might be capable of mimicking the human brain, something impossible with current technology.      As of June, the fastest supercomputer in the world is China's Tianhe-2, a computer that runs at 33.86 petaflops, which means it can perform 33.86 quadrillion floating point operations per second. The US has the second fastest supercomputer, a machine at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory that runs at 17.6 petaflops. Earlier this year, Intel and Cray won a $200 million contract from the federal government to build a 180-petaflops computer by 2018.      Obama's initiative seeks to create the world's first exaflop computer, capable of running at 1,000 petaflops or higher.      The initiative will be responsible for "establishing, over the next 15 years, a viable path forward for future high performance computing systems even after the limits of current semiconductor technology are reached (the 'post Moore's Law era')," the executive order stated.      "The NSCI is a whole-of-government effort designed to create a cohesive, multi-agency strategic vision and federal investment strategy, executed in collaboration with industry and academia, to maximize the benefits of high performance computing for the United States," it said.      This new focus on supercomputing doesn't come out of left field. Last year, the Department of Energy released a report recommending the creation of the NSCI and suggested that the government spend $3 billion developing an exaflop computer.      "Computational problems and data centric problems are coming together in areas that range from energy, to climate modeling, to healthcare. This shift dictates the need for a balanced ecosystem for high performance computing with an undergirding infrastructure that supports both computationally-intensive and data centric computing," that report said. "As we move to the era of exascale computing, multiple technologies have to be developed in a complementary way, including hardware, middleware, and applications software."      There is no timeline for the NSCI to create an exascale computer, however the order requires the NSCI to be set up within 90 days of today and will require the NSCI to release annual reports about its progress, starting one year from today. Exciting times! ||||| President Barack Obama has signed an executive order authorizing the creation of new supercomputing research initiative called the National Strategic Computing Initiative, or NSCI. Its goal: pave the way for the first exaflop supercomputer—something that's about 30 times faster than today's fastest machines.      Supercomputers are at the heart of a huge number of important scientific and defense research projects. They're used by aerospace engineers to model planes and weapons, and by climatologists to predict the the near-term impact of hurricanes and the long-term effects of climate change. Researchers involved in the White House's Precision Medicine initiative believe exaflop speed supercomputers could aid the creation of personalized drugs, while the European Commission's Human Brain Project hopes they will help unlock the secrets of the human brain.      Several government agencies, most notably the Department of Energy, have been deeply involved in the development of supercomputers over the last few decades, but they've typically worked separately. The new initiative will bring together scientists and government agencies such as the Department of Energy, Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation to create a common agenda for pushing the field forward.      The specifics are thin on the ground at the moment. The Department of Energy has already identified the major challenges preventing "exascale" computing today, according to a fact sheet released by the government, but the main goal of the initiative, for now, be to get disparate agencies working together on common goals.      It's hard not to see the initiative as a response to China's gains in supercomputing. Earlier this month TOP500, an organization that ranks supercomputers by performance, announced that China's 33.86 petaflop Tianhe-2 is still the fastest supercomputer in the world. The US still has more computers on the TOP500 list than any other country in the world, but researchers have worried for years about falling behind China.      An exaflop is about 1,000 petaflops, and would represent a massive leap forward in computing power. But creating an exaflop computer is about more than just finding a way to build faster hardware. Creating applications that can take advantage of such an architecture is a challenge in its own right. NCSI will also prioritize the creation of supercomputers that can handle vast quantities of rapidly changing data. ||||| EXECUTIVE ORDER      - - - - - - -      CREATING A NATIONAL STRATEGIC COMPUTING INITIATIVE      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to maximize benefits of high-performance computing (HPC) research, development, and deployment, it is hereby ordered as follows:      Section 1. Policy. In order to maximize the benefits of HPC for economic competitiveness and scientific discovery, the United States Government must create a coordinated Federal strategy in HPC research, development, and deployment. Investment in HPC has contributed substantially to national economic prosperity and rapidly accelerated scientific discovery. Creating and deploying technology at the leading edge is vital to advancing my Administration's priorities and spurring innovation. Accordingly, this order establishes the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI). The NSCI is a whole-of-government effort designed to create a cohesive, multi-agency strategic vision and Federal investment strategy, executed in collaboration with industry and academia, to maximize the benefits of HPC for the United States.      Over the past six decades, U.S. computing capabilities have been maintained through continuous research and the development and deployment of new computing systems with rapidly increasing performance on applications of major significance to government, industry, and academia. Maximizing the benefits of HPC in the coming decades will require an effective national response to increasing demands for computing power, emerging technological challenges and opportunities, and growing economic dependency on and competition with other nations. This national response will require a cohesive, strategic effort within the Federal Government and a close collaboration between the public and private sectors.      It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance its scientific, technological, and economic leadership position in HPC research, development, and deployment through a coordinated Federal strategy guided by four principles:      The United States must deploy and apply new HPC technologies broadly for economic competitiveness and scientific discovery. The United States must foster public-private collaboration, relying on the respective strengths of government, industry, and academia to maximize the benefits of HPC. The United States must adopt a whole-of-government approach that draws upon the strengths of and seeks cooperation among all executive departments and agencies with significant expertise or equities in HPC while also collaborating with industry and academia. The United States must develop a comprehensive technical and scientific approach to transition HPC research on hardware, system software, development tools, and applications efficiently into development and, ultimately, operations.      This order establishes the NSCI to implement this whole-of-government strategy, in collaboration with industry and academia, for HPC research, development, and deployment.      Sec. 2. Objectives. Executive departments, agencies, and offices (agencies) participating in the NSCI shall pursue five strategic objectives:      Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs. Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing. Establishing, over the next 15 years, a viable path forward for future HPC systems even after the limits of current semiconductor technology are reached (the "post- Moore's Law era"). Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development. Developing an enduring public-private collaboration to ensure that the benefits of the research and development advances are, to the greatest extent, shared between the United States Government and industrial and academic sectors.      Sec. 3. Roles and Responsibilities. To achieve the five strategic objectives, this order identifies lead agencies, foundational research and development agencies, and deployment agencies. Lead agencies are charged with developing and delivering the next generation of integrated HPC capability and will engage in mutually supportive research and development in hardware and software, as well as in developing the workforce to support the objectives of the NSCI. Foundational research and development agencies are charged with fundamental scientific discovery work and associated advances in engineering necessary to support the NSCI objectives. Deployment agencies will develop mission-based HPC requirements to influence the early stages of the design of new HPC systems and will seek viewpoints from the private sector and academia on target HPC requirements. These groups may expand to include other government entities as HPC-related mission needs emerge.      (a) Lead Agencies. There are three lead agencies for the NSCI: the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The DOE Office of Science and DOE National Nuclear Security Administration will execute a joint program focused on advanced simulation through a capable exascale computing program emphasizing sustained performance on relevant applications and analytic computing to support their missions. NSF will play a central role in scientific discovery advances, the broader HPC ecosystem for scientific discovery, and workforce development. DOD will focus on data analytic computing to support its mission. The assignment of these responsibilities reflects the historical roles that each of the lead agencies have played in pushing the frontiers of HPC, and will keep the Nation on the forefront of this strategically important field. The lead agencies will also work with the foundational research and development agencies and the deployment agencies to support the objectives of the NSCI and address the wide variety of needs across the Federal Government.      (b) Foundational Research and Development Agencies. There are two foundational research and development agencies for the NSCI: the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). IARPA will focus on future computing paradigms offering an alternative to standard semiconductor computing technologies. NIST will focus on measurement science to support future computing technologies. The foundational research and development agencies will coordinate with deployment agencies to enable effective transition of research and development efforts that support the wide variety of requirements across the Federal Government.      (c) Deployment Agencies. There are five deployment agencies for the NSCI: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These agencies may participate in the co-design process to integrate the special requirements of their respective missions and influence the early stages of design of new HPC systems, software, and applications. Agencies will also have the opportunity to participate in testing, supporting workforce development activities, and ensuring effective deployment within their mission contexts.      Sec. 4. Executive Council. (a) To ensure accountability for and coordination of research, development, and deployment activities within the NSCI, there is established an NSCI Executive Council to be co-chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Director of OSTP shall designate members of the Executive Council from within the executive branch. The Executive Council will include representatives from agencies with roles and responsibilities as identified in this order.      (b) The Executive Council shall coordinate and collaborate with the National Science and Technology Council established by Executive Order 12881 of November 23, 1993, and its subordinate entities as appropriate to ensure that HPC efforts across the Federal Government are aligned with the NSCI. The Executive Council shall also consult with representatives from other agencies as it determines necessary. The Executive Council may create additional task forces as needed to ensure accountability and coordination.      (c) The Executive Council shall meet regularly to assess the status of efforts to implement this order. The Executive Council shall meet no less often than twice yearly in the first year after issuance of this order. The Executive Council may revise the meeting frequency as needed thereafter. In the event the Executive Council is unable to reach consensus, the Co-Chairs will be responsible for documenting issues and potential resolutions through a process led by OSTP and OMB.      (d) The Executive Council will encourage agencies to collaborate with the private sector as appropriate. The Executive Council may seek advice from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology through the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and may interact with other private sector groups consistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.      Sec. 5. Implementation. (a) The Executive Council shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, establish an implementation plan to support and align efforts across agencies in support of the NSCI objectives. Annually thereafter for 5 years, the Executive Council shall update the implementation plan as required and document the progress made in implementing the plan, engaging with the private sector, and taking actions to implement this order. After 5 years, updates to the implementation plan may be requested at the discretion of the Co-Chairs.      (b) The Co-Chairs shall prepare a report each year until 5 years from the date of this order on the status of the NSCI for the President. After 5 years, reports may be prepared at the discretion of the Co-Chairs.      Sec. 6. Definitions. For the purposes of this order:      The term "high-performance computing" refers to systems that, through a combination of processing capability and storage capacity, can solve computational problems that are beyond the capability of small- to medium-scale systems.      The term "petaflop" refers to the ability to perform one quadrillion arithmetic operations per second.      The term "exascale computing system" refers to a system operating at one thousand petaflops.      Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:      the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.      (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.      BARACK OBAMA |||||	– If something called the National Strategic Computing Initiative sounds like a big deal, that's because it is. The White House yesterday announced an executive order from President Obama describing the NSCI plan, a joint effort of the Department of Energy, Defense Department, and the National Science Foundation, Motherboard reports. Those agencies will design supercomputers for the FBI, NASA, Homeland Security, the NOAA, and the NIH. But it's a supercomputer of all supercomputers Obama is eyeing most enthusiastically, an "exascale" unit with the power to run 30 times faster than the existing fastest supercomputer. Supercomputers are currently used for a variety of applications, including weapon and plane modeling and for predicting the long-term effects of climate change. Future uses could include creating personalized drugs and gaining access to "the secrets of the human brain," reports Wired. The president wants this uber-computer to operate at more than 1,000 petaflops; a computer running at 1 petaflop has the ability to perform 1 quadrillion arithmetic operations per second, per the executive order. To put this in context, the two fastest supercomputers in the world—China's Tianhe-2 and the supercomputer at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory—run at 33.86 petaflops and 17.6 petaflops, respectively. (We can't wait for the cookbook that will come with this exascale computer.)

(Samim Aktar)            Farakka: A homemaker in Murshidabad's Lalgola has lodged a police complaint, accusing her husband and in-laws of getting her right kidney removed in exchange for money on the pretext of an appendicitis operation at a Calcutta nursing home two years back.      Rita Haldar, a 28-year-old homemaker, lodged the complaint with the Farakka police on February 2, naming her husband Biswajit Sarkar, mother-in-law and brother-in-law.      When the woman had complained of an abdomen pain two years ago, Sarkar discussed the matter with his mother and brother and took her to Calcutta for treatment.      "Before going to the doctor in Calcutta, we had put up at a relative's house. I was given soft drink at the home, after which I felt drowsy. We went to a nursing home to consult the doctor who told me that I needed immediate operation for appendicitis. The next day, I was operated on," said Rita.      After a few months, the homemaker started feeling unwell. "I went to Siliguri to visit a cousin. I started having a lower back pain and visited a doctor at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) who prescribed an ultra-sonography. The USG revealed my right kidney is missing. I was shattered," said Rita.      The woman who has an 11-year-old son underwent another USG at a nursing home in Malda and confirmed that her right kidney was missing.      Both the USG reports say: "Right kidney not visualised." The Telegraph is in possession of the two reports.      The USG reports also revealed that Rita's left kidney had become enlarged. "Doctors at the NBMCH told me that there was infection in the left kidney," said Rita.      Inspector-in-charge of Farakka, Udayshankar Ghosh, said: "We suspect the involvement of a racket. A case was registered under provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act. We have also charged three persons with attempt to murder and bride torture."      Contacted, her husband, Sarkar, a trader, said his wife had donated a kidney to a person from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. "She had even signed a consent letter," he added.#      Asked how he had got in touch with the Raipur person, he disconnected the phone.      Told about her husband's claim that she had donated her kidney, Rita said: "I knew nothing about this. I was definitely drugged and don't remember signing any paper." ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The victim alleges she had her kidney removed without her knowledge      An Indian woman's husband and brother-in-law have been arrested after she told police they stole one of her kidneys in lieu of a dowry.      Local media report that the West Bengal woman's husband arranged an appendicitis surgery when she was suffering stomach pain two year ago.      Late in 2017, two separate medical examinations revealed she was in fact missing one of her kidneys.      She alleges that her husband had frequently made demands for a dowry.      The payment of dowries - traditionally paid from a bride's family to a husband's - has been banned in India since 1961.      Speaking to Indian media, the alleged victim, Rita Sarkar, said she had been the victim of domestic abuse over the dowry issue for many years.      "My husband took me to a private nursing home in Kolkata, where he and the medical staff told me that I would be fine after removing my inflamed appendix through surgery," the Hindustan Times quoted her as saying.

"I then understood why my husband implored me to keep quiet about the surgery," she told the Hindustan Times.      "He sold my kidney because my family couldn't meet his demand for dowry."

When she complained of stomach pain two years ago, Rita Sarkar, 28, says her husband arranged a visit to a private nursing home in Kolkata, where the couple stayed with one of his relatives, per the BBC. Sarkar—who claims her husband abused her for years with demands for a dowry, though dowries are banned in India—says she was given a drink that made her feel drowsy, per the Telegraph of India. Later, a doctor at the nursing home "told me that I needed immediate operation for appendicitis," Sarkar says. "The next day, I was operated on." Months later while visiting family, she developing lower back pain and visited a hospital, where an ultrasound showed an infection in her left kidney. Her right kidney, however, was gone. "I was shattered," Sarkar tells the Telegraph. "I then understood why my husband implored me to keep quiet about the surgery," she adds, per the Hindustan Times. "He sold my kidney because my family couldn't meet his demand for dowry." Sarkar filed a police complaint on Friday naming Biswajit Sarkar, as well as his brother and mother. While the mother is reportedly on the run, the two men were arrested Monday and face charges including attempted murder and organ trafficking, reports the Hindustan Times. A police rep says they "suspect the involvement of a racket," adding "a special team has been formed to investigate." Reached by the Telegraph, Biswajit Sarkar said his wife had donated a kidney willingly and "even signed a consent letter." But Rita Sarkar says "I was definitely drugged and don't remember signing any paper." (This is part of a larger issue.)
summarize: Story highlights Lawyer says squalor concealed children from father for years      Lawyer for the woman arrested says she is the mother      Three infants were discovered dead in squalid Massachusetts home      Police had to search the house in hazmat suits      It was a shocking and gruesome discovery: three dead infants found in a Massachusetts home so squalid that police officers had to search it in hazmat suits.      Now, days later, as investigators continue to search through what the Worcester County District Attorney's Office describes as the home's "deplorable conditions (such as) massive insect infestation, mounds of used diapers and feces," a picture is beginning to emerge of the family that lived inside.      And it's a picture so deranged, so unfathomable to a reasonable mind, that even a lawyer for the accused calls the situation "completely inexplicable."      Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths. The 31-year-old pleaded not guilty to charges of concealing an out of wedlock fetal death, two counts of permitting substantial injury to a child, intimidation of a witness, cruelty to an animal and violating an abuse prevention order, according to Tim Connolly, a district attorney spokesman.      Whether or not Murray is the mother is not known by authorities for certain at this point, but her attorney assumes that she is. "My expectation is that it will be confirmed that they were indeed hers," Keith Halpern told CNN.      Murray lived in the now-condemned single family home with her longtime boyfriend, Ray Rivera, and the couple's children. Just how many children lived with them in the vermin-infested 1,150-square-foot home, however, depends on which parent you ask: of the four living children that the state removed from the home on August 28, Murray told investigators that Rivera, 38, only knew about two of them.      The other two -- a 3 year old and an infant, according to Halpern -- were apparently not only born in secret but lived hidden from their father amid mountains of garbage under the same roof.      Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said.      "It is a mystery to me how Mr. Rivera could have failed to notice (the) numerous pregnancies (of) the woman with whom he shared a bed," said Halpern. "It's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him, and he didn't know about it."      CNN was unable to reach Rivera or members of his family Sunday evening. He has not been charged with any crime, and there is no public record of physical abuse.      'Prisoner of her own fear'      Halpern said that while his client's explanation "is not based in reality," the situation Murray came to be in was the result of fear, not malice. "She was terrified of the pregnancies being discovered," said Halpern. "She was terrified of the two younger children being discovered. Why? I don't know the answer to that."      Whether based in reality or not, Halpern said Murray was "a prisoner of her own fear" and suggested it was that fear that explains the three infants found dead in her home. "Try to imagine the state of mind of a woman who attempts to hide a pregnancy, go into labor and deliver children -- at least twice, but presumably five times -- on her own."      "I feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children," he said. "I don't think there will be a determination that they were killed."      Though Halpern said he has yet to consult with a pathologist, he said it is not clear if they were ever alive to begin with or if they were all stillborn.      Abuse suspected in 2007      The state's removal of the four living children at the home last month was the result of the filing of what's called a 51A report in Massachusetts, according to Alec Loftus, a spokesman for the state's office of Health and Human Services. A 51A can be filed by any citizen with reason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected.      This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman. Cayenne Isaksen said such a report was previously received in 2007, but that "it was unsupported and therefore no case was opened."      For now, Isaksen said DCF has Murray's four children in its care and is focused on "ensuring (their) safety and well-being and providing them with the proper medical care, support and services they need," she said. Connolly said that the family caring for them has no public statement to make at this time.      Murray's case was adjourned to October 14. Investigators, meanwhile, remain at the scene digging through the squalor.      "Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.

(Associated Press)      Erika Murray, 31, faces charges including fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child. Not guilty pleas were entered for her on Friday.      Four other children, ages 13, 10, 3 and 6 months, were removed from the Blackstone home by the state's child welfare agency about two weeks before a police search revealed the remains of the infants, officials said.      Murray's court-appointed lawyer, Keith Halpern, said his client was placed in a treatment center at the state prison for women in Framingham that provides additional protection for those who could pose a suicide risk. Halpern has said repeatedly that he believes his client suffers from a mental illness, though he has not speculated on the nature of her condition.      "It's kind of obvious that many things going on in her head were not real," he said.      Expanding on comments made in an earlier Associated Press interview, Halpern said Monday he was skeptical whether forensic testing of the infants' remains could conclusively determine whether the babies were stillborn or died after birth. He maintained that he was hopeful the tests would reveal that no physical harm was inflicted on the infants to cause their deaths.      The autopsies are being conducted by the state medical examiner.      No birth records existed for the two youngest living children, and Halpern previously said he believed Murray secretly gave birth to those children because her boyfriend didn't want any more kids than the two they already had.      The boyfriend, Ramon Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains. Authorities have not commented on whether he was the father of any or all of the babies.      John Guilfoil, a spokesman for Blackstone police, said Monday that Rivera was charged with cultivating and possession of marijuana, stemming from an initial police visit to the home after a neighbor reported finding a baby covered in feces.      Guilfoil said Rivera was not home at the time and was not arrested. It wasn't immediately known if Rivera had an attorney.      Public records show the home was owned by Kristina Rivera, of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, who is believed to be related to Ramon Rivera.      William Walsh, chairman of Blackstone's health board, said crews hoped to finish decontaminating the house by Tuesday and removing debris that, according to officials, included mounds of dirty diapers.      The town already incurred cleanup costs of more than $20,000, and the bill could reach $30,000, Walsh said.      Kristina Rivera had been served notice that the home was condemned but had not yet contacted town officials, he said, adding that a tax lien could be placed on the property to help the town recover cleanup costs.      "This was so horrific that I don't think a homeowner could put their hands around even how they would attempt to clean this property," Walsh said.      A phone number for Kristina Rivera could not be located. |||||	– Erika Murray may or may not be the mother, but an investigation into the squalid conditions of her vermin-infested home in Massachusetts last week has unearthed a tragic discovery: the bodies of three deceased infants. That discovery comes on the heels of one made in late August, when state welfare agents removed four living children (ages 13, 10, 3, and 6 months) from her and her boyfriend Ray Rivera's 1,150-square-foot home—and her boyfriend claims to have only known about the existence of the older two, reports CNN. Murray, 31, is currently being held in a prison treatment unit for inmates at risk of hurting themselves, reports the AP, while her attorney says she was a "prisoner of her own fear" and that it's "kind of obvious that many things going on in her head were not real." Though Murray has yet to be charged with homicide, she is facing a raft of charges that range from concealing an out-of-wedlock fetal death to two counts of allowing substantial injury to a child; she has pleaded not guilty to all. The Boston Globe reports that the deceased babies' genders, ages, and causes of death have yet to be determined. The house, which is on the same street as the police and fire headquarters, was initially visited in late August when a neighbor saw the crying 6-month-old covered in feces. The town of Blackstone has since spent more than $20,000 in cleanup efforts, digging through piles of dirty diapers, insect infestations, and the mystery of just how many people, dead or alive, were in the house. (In other grim news, a hoarder in Arizona managed to conceal her mother's dead body for four years.)
summarize: This week, convenience-store chain 7-Eleven announced it would begin carrying its own budget brand of beers, dubbed Game Day. The news made me do a double take, nearly causing me spit out the sublimely hoppy Stone IPA I was drinking. Was 7-Eleven angling to be my low-cost craft-beer salvation?Mmm...not exactly. As expected, the decision was driven less by a desire to sell great brews than the bottom line. Beer purchases in convenience stores dipped 4 percent last year, according to research group SymphonyIRI -- nearly double domestic beer sales' 2.2 percent decline.But the silver lining is that purchases of sub-premium beers (Keystone Light, Natural Light) actually ticked up. Customers haven't stopped drinking. They just want to pay less for a buzz.Sometimes this gambit pays off, such as the medal-winning Mission Street pale ales and IPAs that California's Firestone Walker brews for Trader Joe's. But brand-wise, Trader Joe's sits on a slightly more elevated plane than a convenience store selling unnaturally glistening, endlessly rotating hot dogs.Would you buy budget beer from 7-Eleven? Spill it in the comments. ||||| Quick, what's the third-largest beer retailer in the U.S.? Chances are you didn't know it's 7-Eleven.

(Associated Press)      The launch, happening this month at stores nationwide, aims to take advantage of the current economic downturn _ a long, cold one for beer sales.      "We're really working back from the customers' needs," said Dan Skinner, 7-Eleven category manager for alcoholic beverages. "They're looking for exceptional quality at a value price."      Game Day beer follows the introduction of the Yosemite Road private-label wines in 7-Elevens last year. The idea of the home of Slim Jims and Slurpees turning sommelier had some scoffing. But Skinner said the launch has gone well, with the wines holding the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in the chain's wine sales.      Whether people are ready for 7-Eleven suds remains to be seen.      Al Everett, a web developer in the Washington, D.C., area who blogs about beer at hop-talk.com, is a craft beer enthusiast who wasn't sure what to make of Game Day.      "If I was tailgating before a game, I'd certainly consider it," he said. "It's probably not something that I would have regularly." Still, he was curious. "I'll certainly keep an eye out for it."      Game Day comes in two varieties. Game Day Light is 3.9 percent alcohol by volume and 110 calories per 12 ounces. Game Day Ice is 5.5 percent alcohol and 155 calories. The price is between $6.99 and $8.99 for a 12-pack, depending on local taxes and distribution costs, and 24-ounce singles are available for between $1.49 and $1.89.      The beer is being made by the 150-year-old City Brewery in La Crosse, Wis., one of the country's largest contract brewers.      The move comes as beer sales have softened _ it turns out beer may be recession resistant, but it is not recession proof.      What happened is that customers have been buying more below-premium and budget beers. Premium beers still dominate, with volume at 1.5 billion cases in 2009, or about half of all beer sold domestically, according to data cited by 7-Eleven from The Nielsen Company and other sources, but sales were down compared to 2008.      Or, as TV's lager-loving Homer Simpson might put it, "D'oh!"      The plan at 7-Eleven is to capitalize on market conditions.      "We can give premium beers a run for their money," said Skinner, adding that Game Day performed well in taste tests, including among suppliers of premium beers.      This is 7-Eleven's second attempt at beer. In 2003, they introduced Santiago, meant to compete with imports like Corona, but ultimately unable to gain much of a foothold.      This time around, chain officials expect their focus on high value in a down economy will work.      Beverage analyst Benj Steinman was intrigued by 7-Eleven's plans, but not convinced they'll work.      "My attitude to it basically is _ show me," he said. "Private label hasn't worked in beer so far." Steinman, editor of New York-based Beverage Business Insights, notes that Game Day "is a new wrinkle and 7-Eleven is very serious about its effort." But he says store-brand beers have to overcome brand loyalty as well as the fact there already are a number of different price points for beer.      "I'm not ruling it out. I just say, 'Show me'," he said.      ___      On the Net:      7-Eleven: http://www.7-eleven.com      Hoptalk: http://hop-talk.com |||||	– After quaffing your Burger King mimosa, be sure to leave room for a 7-Eleven beer.

summarize: EXCLUSIVE - A Racine teenager says she went nine months having no idea she was pregnant.      That is until she unexpectedly gave birth at home on Tuesday morning.      Racine Police sent the 17-year-old girl and child to the hospital.      The teenager said she was using the bathroom and a baby fell into the toilet.      The newborn is in the NIC-U at Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare.      Braeley Pettigrew said she had been sick.      Around 3:30 got up to use the bathroom.      She thought she was having a tough bowel movement, looked down and saw a baby boy in the toilet.      She became scared and she cut the umbilical cord and wrapped the baby up.      She told her mom someone left it outside on the porch.      Her mom called police who she said quickly noticed blood on her clothes.      “I never thought I would be having a baby at 17, but my first instinct was to get him out of the toilet and wrap him up to keep him warm,” said Braeley Pettigrew.      The teenager told police she made up the story about the abandonment because she was afraid her mom would be upset.      She told the truth after her mom sent her a text message showing support.      According to police, Braeley Pettigrew doesn't face any charges.      After deciding to keep him, she named the baby Kayden.      The family said they planned to go on college visits during spring break. They said Pettigrew has a good GPA and plays high school basketball.      She still has plans to finish high school and go to college. PLEASE SEE FULL VIDEO BELOW.      If you would like to help this family please email them at Braeley21@gmail.com.

Then she started to panic, police say, per the Journal Times. After cutting the umbilical cord and wrapping the infant to keep him warm, the 17-year-old high school student told her mother that the boy had been abandoned on their door step in Racine, Wis., reports WDJT. Her mother quickly called police. Authorities arrived around 3:15am but soon noticed blood on Braeley's clothes. She and the child were taken to a nearby hospital in good condition and, after receiving a supportive text from her mom, Braeley admitted to lying about the birth for fear her mom would be mad. "I never thought I would be having a baby at 17, but my first instinct was to get him out of the toilet and wrap him up to keep him warm," she says. She plans to keep the boy she's named Kayden and attend college in the fall.
summarize: Aubrey Peters, 16, of Noblesville, was killed Sunday December 8, 2013, when Jacob Travis McDaniel, 20, discharged a gun he thought was unloaded. (Photo: Yearbook Photo Courtesy of WTHR)      Two years after Aubrey Peters was hailed as a hero for helping save two children who fell through ice on Morse Reservoir, grieving teens gathered near that scene Monday night to remember the teenage girl who died this past weekend in what is believed to be an accidental shooting.      Hundreds gathered on the shoreline of Morse Beach Park in Noblesville at a candlelight vigil to remember Peters, 16, who died Sunday after a man shot her with a handgun he thought would be empty, court documents say.      Jacob Travis McDaniel, 20, Noblesville, was charged Monday afternoon with reckless homicide in the death of Peters.      Students from Noblesville and nearby high schools paid tribute to Peters, who was a junior at Noblesville High School, by releasing balloons beneath a tree so their tethers would tangle in branches and become suspended in the freezing air.      Joe Hodson, Peters' boyfriend, was surrounded by friends as he walked away from a row of candles along the water. He used his finger to write a message in the snow: "JH + AP forever."

(Photo: Rob Goebel/The Star)      Peters' tragic death shook many of the students who braved 20-degree temperatures for the impromptu vigil. Those who knew Peters spoke of her positive energy, her nonjudgmental personality and her willingness to help those she didn't know.      In 2010, that giving nature was on display when Peters helped save two girls who fell into ice-covered Morse Reservoir. Others at the vigil described her talent for art, particularly portrait drawings.      Hodson, an Indiana University freshman, said the world was cheated by Peters' death.      "Aubrey gave her all into everything. As her boyfriend, I know that.      "This should not have happened to her. She did not deserve to die. ... She is the kind of person meant to change the world, not die at the age of 16 due to some negligence with a handgun."      McDaniel appeared Monday in Hamilton Superior Court, where he also was charged with pointing a firearm. According to a probable cause affidavit, McDaniel, Peters and two other men were in McDaniel's house in the 8200 block of River Run Place about 11:20p.m. Sunday when the shooting occurred.      According to the affidavit, McDaniel was showing Peters and the two other men a shotgun and a handgun. Dajuan Williams, one of the men, told police that "McDaniel tried to get Aubrey to hold the gun, but she didn't want to."      At that point, Williams told police, McDaniel ejected the magazine from the gun, pointed the weapon at Peters, took the safety off and pulled the trigger.      McDaniel apparently thought the gun was empty, the affidavit said, but when he pulled the trigger, a round fired.      "Aubrey clutched her chest and said, 'What just happened?'" the affidavit said. Williams told police that while he attempted to help Peters, McDaniel gave the men a story to tell police.      "McDaniel then stated, 'The story is the gun fell off the table and went off,'" the affidavit said.      Police arrived shortly after the shooting, and officers tried unsuccessfully to revive Peters until medics arrived, said Noblesville Police Lt. Bruce Barnes. Peters was taken to St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.      After interviewing witnesses, police arrested McDaniel, Barnes said.      McDaniel's bond was set at $15,000. A pretrial hearing was set for Feb. 21. The reckless homicide charge is a Class C felony punishable by two to eight years in prison. Pointing a firearm is a Class D felony punishable by six months to three years in prison.      The apparently accidental fatal shooting was the second in as many days in the Indianapolis area. On Saturday, a 3-year-old boy in a Northside home pulled a loaded gun off a kitchen counter and shot himself in the head, police said.      Marion County prosecutor's officials said Monday they didn't know whether charges would be filed in that case.      Call Star reporter Bill McCleery at (317) 444-6083.

CBS affiliate WISH      NOBLESVILLE, Ind. - Aubrey Peters, an Indiana teenager who helped to save two children after they fell into an icy reservoir in 2010, was killed Sunday in a shooting in an Indianapolis suburb.      Peters, 16, was pronounced dead at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis late Sunday after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest inside a home in Noblesville, police said.      Noblesville Police Lt. Bruce Barnes said officers arrived at the home shortly before 11:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a person shot. He said they found Peters there unresponsive.      Police questioned three other people who were inside the house and arrested Jacob McDaniel, 20. He was being held in the Hamilton County Jail on Monday.      According to CBS affiliate WISH, McDaniel is charged with reckless homicide and pointing a firearm in the shooting death of Peters.      No one answered a call to the home where the shooting occurred Monday.      The American Red Cross of Greater Indianapolis honored Peters in 2011 for helping to save two young girls who had fallen through the ice on Morse Reservoir the year before.      Peters, then a seventh-grader, told investigators she heard the screams of 7-year-old and 4-year-old sisters and alerted her grandparents and called 911. One girl reached shore safely, but Peters' grandfather pulled the other out and resuscitated her.      Peters told WISH at the time that seeing the girls struggle in the water was "terrifying."      "It was like watching someone die and I hated it," she said.      Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Gregson recalled honoring Peters Monday and lamented her death.      "She stood out — they always do when they're younger," Gregson told WRTV. "Any time there is a senseless death, it just breaks your heart." |||||	– An Indiana teenager honored for saving two young lives with an act of heroism has had her life taken away by what appears to have been an act of incredible stupidity. Court papers say Aubrey Peters, 16, was shot dead Sunday night by a friend who was showing off his firearms, the Indianapolis Star reports. After she refused to hold a handgun, 20-year-old Jacob Travis McDaniel removed the magazine, pointed it at her, and pulled the trigger, apparently unaware that there was still a round in the chamber, an affidavit states. After shooting Peters in the chest, McDaniel allegedly tried to persuade two other people present to tell police that she had been killed when the gun fell off a table. He has been charged with reckless homicide and pointing a firearm. When she was 13, Peters was honored by the Red Cross for helping save two sisters, ages 4 and 7, who had fallen through the ice on a reservoir. "She stood out—they always do when they're younger," a Red Cross spokeswoman tells CBS. "Any time there is a senseless death, it just breaks your heart."
summarize: Story highlights "It feels amazing to be free from a binary sex classification," Oregon resident says      Legal experts believe it is the state's first such ruling      (CNN) Army veteran Jamie Shupe, who identifies as neither male nor female, can legally be considered nonbinary, a judge ruled.      In what legal experts believe is Oregon's first such ruling, Judge Amy Holmes Hehn said Friday that the Portland resident's sex has been changed from female to nonbinary.      "It feels amazing to be free from a binary sex classification system that inadequately addressed who I really am, a system in which I felt confined," Shupe said.      Shupe was assigned the gender of male at birth, but started transitioning to a female in 2013, more than a decade after retiring from the military as a sergeant first class, Shupe said.      Shupe, who lived in Pittsburgh at the time, said transitioning to a female was the only option available then.      Read More ||||| An Oregon judge ruled Friday that a transgender person can legally change their sex to "non-binary" rather than male or female in what legal experts believe is a first in the United States.      Multnomah County Circuit Court Judge Amy Holmes Hehn legally changed 52-year-old Jamie Shupe's sex from "female" to non-binary.      Nancy Haque, a co-executive director for Basic Rights Oregon, called the ruling a "momentous day for genderqueer Oregonians."      "It's really exciting for the courts to actually recognize what we know to be true: gender is a spectrum," Haque said. "Some people don't identify as male or female."      Shupe, an Army veteran who retired in 2000 a sergeant first class, began transitioning in 2013 while living in Pittsburg. Shupe knew then that neither male nor female fit. Shupe chose "Jamie" as a new first name primarily because it is a gender-neutral name. Shupe prefers to be called "Jamie," rather than by a pronoun.      "I was assigned male at birth due to biology," Shupe said. "I'm stuck with that for life. My gender identity is definitely feminine. My gender identity has never been male, but I feel like I have to own up to my male biology. Being non-binary allows me to do that. I'm a mixture of both. I consider myself as a third sex."      But female or male were the only legal options Shupe saw then. Shupe chose female, but female never felt right. In April, Shupe and lawyer Lake Perriguey filed a petition with the Oregon court to legally change Shupe's sex.      Oregon law allows a court to change a person's legal sex if a judge determines the person has undergone surgical, hormonal or other treatment related to a gender transition. The law does not require a note from a doctor.      Shupe brought letters from Oregon Health & Science University, as well as the Veterans Affairs hospital, anyway.      "The sexual reassignment has been completed," Hehn wrote in the ruling. "No person has shown cause why the requested General Judgment should not be granted."      Officials at the national Transgender Law Center said they are unaware of any similar court victories in the United States. A high court in France last year allowed a resident to register as gender neutral. Attorneys at New York's Sylvia River Law Project told The Daily Dot that some cities and states have IDs that allow residents not to declare a gender.      "A growing number of countries already recognize nonbinary genders, but as far as we know this is the first ruling of its kind in the U.S.," Legal Director Ilona Turner said in a written statement. "Other states and agencies should consider following suit to ensure that nonbinary members of our community have access to identity documents that reflect who they are, just like everyone else."      But, Haque said, there is still work to be done. Basic Rights Oregon is working with "public and private systems" across the state to offer people designations beyond male or female. Oregonians cannot list "non-binary" on a driver's license or state-issued identification card, for instance. Others have been denied medical services, Haque said, because their gender identities don't conform to existing norms.      "It's a huge barrier to being able to live your life, to having a driver license, to employment, to having records about your life, transcripts, all of those things," Haque said. "In all the ways our lives are gendered in ways they frankly don't have to be, it can be a barrier for people whose identities aren't easily put in a box."      Haque said her organization increasingly hears from non-binary people. Last month, the Gresham-Barlow School District agreed to build gender-neutral bathrooms and pay an elementary school teacher $60,000 after the non-binary teacher complained of more than a year of harassment from coworkers after asking to be called "they" rather than "he" or "she."      Shupe said Friday's win was "liberating."      "I'm not under pressure anymore to conform to either thing," Shupe said.      -- Casey Parks      503-221-8271      cparks@oregonian.com; @caseyparks ||||| It's a brand new day for nonbinary, genderqueer, transgender, and gender nonconforming people all over the nation.      In a historic move sure to challenge federal policy, an Oregon circuit court ruled on Friday that a resident could legally change their gender to nonbinary.      The Daily Dot spoke—in an exclusive first interview—with Jamie Shupe, the Portland, Oregon, resident and Southern Maryland native who requested the gender identity change.      "Male and female are the traditional categories, but they fail to properly categorize people like me. So I challenged that," said Shupe.      Shupe's petition for sex change, as the court calls it, was filed on April 27. With the help of Portland attorney Lake James Perriguey and armed with two letters from primary care doctors (shared privately with the Daily Dot) stating that Shupe's gender should be classified as nonbinary, the case was made.      Multnomah County Circuit Court      Shupe, who prefers not to use gender pronouns altogether, uses the honorific 'Mx.' and is an Army vet who began a gender transition in 2013 at age 49. Assigned a male gender at birth, Shupe initially petitioned to change their gender from male to female, then from female to nonbinary.      As far as legal experts are aware, the Oregon court decision is the first time a court in the U.S. has ruled that nonbinary is a legal gender.      The Daily Dot spoke with attorneys at the Transgender Law Center, who noted the historic nature of the case.      "As far as we know, this may be the first ruling of its kind in the U.S.," said Transgender Law Center's Legal Director Ilona Turner in an email to the Daily Dot. "This is an important step toward ensuring that nonbinary members of our community have access to identity documents that reflect who they are, just like everyone else."      Mik Kinkead, a staff attorney at New York's Sylvia Rivera Law Project, called the Oregon court's decision "wonderful news."      "To my knowledge, many cities and a few states have options where an ID card does not need to declare a gender (such as the NYC ID card or the NYS Benefits card)," Kinkead told the Daily Dot in an email, "but I have never heard of a system where someone's nonbinary gender is actually affirmed on the card itself."      Sasha Alexander, SRLP's membership director, also celebrated the news.      "Many trans, gender nonconforming, and intersex (TGNCI) people identify as nonbinary or along a gender fluid spectrum, but due to the nature of ID documents and discrimination, many of us have no way to see our gender identity reflected so this is amazing news," Alexander said in an email.      At the moment, it's unclear how the court's decision will play out in terms of identity documents. Shupe told the Daily Dot their "first goal is to tackle the Oregon DMV." But even if the state agrees to issuing a nonbinary driver's license, federal identity documents currently only allow for male or female gender markers.      In 2014, over 64,000 people signed a petition asking the White House to legally recognize nonbinary genders—but the petition was without success. However, according to the website Nonbinary.org, other countries already federally recognize genders other than male and female—including Australia, Denmark, Nepal, and New Zealand.      Shupe described being "literally tearful" on Friday when the court issued the judgement.      "This is incredibly humbling to be the first person to accomplish this," Shupe told the Daily Dot. "I hope the impact will be that it opened the legal doorway for all that choose to do so to follow me through. We don't deserve to be classified improperly against our will."      Update 4:10pm CT, June 10: Added more comments. |||||	– In what may be a first-of-its-kind ruling in the US, an Oregon court ruled Friday that Portland resident Jamie Shupe is officially and legally neither male nor female but non-binary, Jezebel reports. According to the Oregonian, the 52-year-old Army veteran was assigned the male gender at birth but never felt that fit. Neither did female, though Shupe began transitioning in 2013. "My gender identity has never been male, but I feel like I have to own up to my male biology," Shupe says. "Being non-binary allows me to do that. I'm a mixture of both. I consider myself as a third sex." Shupe's attorney tells CNN Oregon law allows people to have their gender legally changed if they can provide proof of treatment in connection with a transition, but doesn't specify gender has to be changed to either male or female. The Daily Dot calls Friday's ruling "historic," and the co-executive director of Basic Rights Oregon says it's a "momentous day for genderqueer Oregonians." Shupe, who avoids gender pronouns in favor of just being called Jamie, was "literally tearful" when the ruling was made. "I hope the impact will be that it opened the legal doorway" for others, Shupe tells the Daily Dot. "We don't deserve to be classified improperly against our will." While the ruling could be a step toward changing federal policy, the next step for Shupe is working with the DMV to get a driver's license that specifies "non-binary." Nepal, Australia, Denmark, and other countries already officially acknowledge non-binary genders; Germany now offers this option at birth.

Family members had to move away an army of waiting reporters so Rubi Ibarra Garcia could attend a Mass in La Joya community, central Mexico.      She was celebrating her 15th birthday - a traditional coming-of-age party in Mexico known as "quinceanera".      About 1.2 million people had earlier vowed to attend the party.      However, the father later said the idea had been to invite neighbours and friends only - while stressing he would not turn anyone away.

Rubi Ibarra Garcia, a teenager in Mexico, had an overwhelming 15th birthday party when thousands showed up to take part in the celebration at the small village of La Joya, San Luis Potosi State, Mexico on Monday.      Weeks before the quinceañera, her father, Crescencio, created a Facebook event and video that was originally intended specifically for the family’s neighbors and friends. However, what Crescencio didn’t realize was that he set the invite to “public” instead of “private.”      “We invite you on December 26 to our daughter Rubi Ibarra Garcia’s quinceañera in La Joya,” Crescencio Ibarra said in the 45-second clip, adding, “Everyone is cordially invited.”      The invite quickly went viral, with 1.2 million RSVPs, 978,000 shares and #XVdeRuby trending on social media. Mexican airline Interjet even offered a 30-percent discount off flights to attend.      On the day of her birthday, Rubi took to Facebook to speak to all those who were going.      “To all those who have already arrived I ask you to please do not despair because in truth we are many people and we are just seeing how to speed things up,” the birthday girl wrote on Monday. “I just ask for your patience so that we can all enjoy this party.”      At 1:30 p.m. PST, the Ibarra family hosted an exclusive mass held at the Iglesia de Guadalupe, according to NBC News. Next on the birthday agenda were a mid-afternoon lunch for the family followed by a horse race with a 10,000 peso prize.      And at the quinceañera, which marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood, guests sat at tables, dressed in white and red linens, near vendor and party tents while enjoying dinner, desserts and dancing.      Feliz Cumpleaños, Rubi! |||||	– They braced themselves for the possibility of more than a million guests, but in the end, Rubi Ibarra Garcia's family only had to deal with thousands who showed up for the 15-year-old's birthday party in La Joya, Mexico. It all started when her dad, Crescencio Ibarra, put up a Facebook invite and video for Rubi's Dec. 26 quinceañera, originally intended just for family and friends—but he set the invite to "public" instead of "private," leading to at least 1.2 million RSVPs, People reports. But Ibarra took his online gaffe in stride and vowed not to turn away anyone who showed up, reports the BBC, and on Monday, there were dozens of tents and food-laden tables waiting for both expected guests and party crashers. Monday afternoon, as the crowds flocked to what People called Rubi's "overwhelming" event, someone posting in the birthday girl's name wrote on Facebook: "Hello! To all those who have already arrived I ask you to please do not despair because in truth we are many people. … I am only asking for patience so that we can all enjoy this party which was made for you all." The BBC notes that the party seemed to largely go off without a hitch, though Ibarra seemed "exasperated" by the media at one point and warned he'd cut the party short if reporters didn't back away from his daughter, who was decked out in a fuchsia ruffled gown and tiara. There was one notably unexpected and tragic outcome: Ibarra had arranged for a horse race during the celebration, with a nearly $500 prize, and the owner of one of the horses was killed when he got too close to the galloping action.
summarize: By Elizabeth Cohen      CNN Senior Medical Correspondent      Yesterday I flew to Port-au Prince along with a team of medical doctors from the University of Miami. As the sun set and we made our descent, I asked the physician on the plane with the most experience working in Haiti, Dr. John MacDonald, what to expect.      “Expect Gettysburg,” he said.      “What?” I asked.      “Expect Gettysburg,” he repeated. “You know, the kind of medicine they practiced in the Civil War.”      Once I arrived, I saw what MacDonald meant.      While doctors here aren’t anesthetizing patients with liquor the way they did in the Civil War, the care at the makeshift hospital I’ve been reporting from is certainly rudimentary. An hour ago, I watched University of Miami trauma surgeon Dr. Enrique Ginzburg amputate a woman’s foot without general anesthesia, using only a local anesthetic and sedation. The nurse stood by his side, sterilizing surgical instruments in an open pan of soapy water.      Some 250 severely injured patients have been treated at this facility on the United Nations compound near the airport. Almost all of them have orthopedic injuries and open wounds. In a modern hospital, doctors would do surgery to clean the wounds and give intravenous antibiotics. Here, they receive only oral antibiotics and morphine for the pain.      “This is so frustrating,” MacDonald told me. “I wish we could do more.”      So far, three patients out of the 250 have died, but doctors fear that number could go up dramatically. MacDonald explains it takes about six or seven days after a wound occurs for septicemia to set in – that’s a blood borne infection that can quickly shut down the body’s major organs. It’s been three days since the earthquake happened. The clock is ticking.      Editor's Note: Medical news is a popular but sensitive subject rooted in science.

For badly injured victims of Haiti’s massive earthquake and the crews who rescued and treated them, the early days have been all about survival.      “From a patient’s point of view, you’ve got about 48 hours,” said Dr. Jerry L. Mothershead, a Norfolk, Va., emergency room physician and a disaster response consultant. “A few might make it longer.”      But in the days and weeks ahead, public health experts say Haiti can expect new rounds of health problems to emerge and worsen, challenging even the best efforts of a global humanitarian response.      Thousands of deaths likely will be added to the estimated toll of 50,000 as infections from untreated or poorly treated injuries set in, said Dr. Thomas Kirsch, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Refugee and Disaster Response. Victims crushed beneath falling buildings and other debris would have required the skills of entire trauma teams in a developed nation. In Port-au-Prince, medical crews are running short on staff, pain medication and bandages.      “Haiti has no surge capacity at all,” said Kirsch, who is also the national physician adviser for the American Red Cross and a veteran of hurricanes and the Sept. 11 terror attacks. “The issue now is the lack of resources.”      Even as foreign medical crews begin to make their way into the capital city hit hardest by the magnitude-7 quake, more basic problems loom in a nation that has long struggled with poverty and hunger, said Dr. Curtis E. Cummings, an associate professor in Drexel University’s School of Public Health and an expert in public health readiness.      “A destroyed infrastructure means no clean water or food,” he said. “There are already high levels of diarrheal disease, respiratory disease and malnutrition. Bad will go to very much worse.”      Mild illnesses pose deadly threat      Outbreaks of cholera, dysentery and other illnesses are expected to skyrocket. With people congregating in refugee-like conditions, mingling at aid sites, contagious diseases will spread rapidly. Even simple illnesses like colds and flu — including the H1N1 swine flu, now the dominant strain — could threaten immune-compromised people.      “Those are the things in refugee camps that nail people,” Mothershead said. “What they need is water, plastic sheeting and moving the porta-potties away from where the people are.”      After the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia, acute cases of diarrheal illness in Thailand nearly doubled from the previous year, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Wound infections jumped, including a scourge of hard-to-treat drug-resistant infections. And some people developed a disabling or deadly type of pneumonia called "tsunami lung," caused by swallowing saltwater.      Earthquakes pose different dangers. Tens of thousands of victims in Haiti have suffered crush injuries, which harm victims not only through the initial trauma, but also later, when damaged muscles pour toxins into the bloodstream, often leading to kidney damage.      The situation is especially dire for children, who make up an estimated 40 percent to 50 percent of the Port-au-Prince population. They're smaller and more vulnerable to injury than adults, but they also suffer faster from dehydration, blood loss and shock. Their immature immune systems also make it harder to fight back against illness and infection than adults, health experts said.      In the meantime, medical teams on the ground will continue to grapple with the aftermath of early triage, which postponed treatment for those whose injuries may have been serious, but not life-threatening.      Victims with arm or leg fractures, for instance, wouldn't have been a top priority, Cummings said. But the untended wounded remain ripe for infections and shock and they're more vulnerable to other illness.      It’s a no-win choice for health workers who have to make hard decisions about who gets care — and who doesn’t.      In a catastrophic situation, doctors will exclude “expectant” patients — people they know are going to die — and they’ll defer care for survivable injuries. That reserves life-saving effort for the worst injured with the best chance of surviving.      “We have only so many resources. We have to look at who we can save here,” said Cummings.      Rescuers and public health officials shouldn't spend much time worrying about the health risk of the corpses piling up on the city's streets, Cummings added. Contrary to common belief, dead bodies don't spread disease, especially when they've likely died of trauma and not infection.      "They're just not the problem people think," he said.      Intervening in a disaster of such magnitude — whether it’s a massive earthquake in a country of nearly 9 million, the series of hurricanes that slammed Haiti last year, or the tsunami in Indonesia — is not for the inexperienced, Kirsch and Mothershead emphasize.      Help is needed, but it must be the right kind      Volunteer crews of doctors, nurses and other health workers are clamoring to fly to Haiti, motivated by compassion, adrenaline or even a sense of adventure, said Kirsch.      “You take all these rich Westerners who want to fly down there and help,” Kirsch said. “They become more a burden than they are help.”      Organizers on the ground in Haiti are calling for trained surgeons with experience in battlefield or disaster conditions. Medical crews with little training in working in developing nations would do better to send money — and stay home, Kirsch said.      In past catastrophes, Kirsch saw well-meaning volunteer medical crews show up, only to become overwhelmed by rugged demands of the job and the lack of resources for their own comfort.      “The best way to help is to give money to the experts who know what the needs are," he said. "That’s the way you help the world.” |||||	– The death toll from the Haiti earthquake, which currently stands at 50,000, is certain to rise as the country's shattered infrastructure keeps medical professionals and relief workers from reaching people who need their help. "There are already high levels of diarrheal disease, respiratory disease and malnutrition," a public health expert tells MSNBC. "Bad will go to very much worse." Particularly dangerous for injured survivors of earthquakes are crush injuries and broken bones, which can quickly lead to massive infections. Children, with their immature immune systems, are especially vulnerable. What's more, doctors are confronting battlefield-type conditions—from a century and a half ago. "Expect Gettysburg,” CNN medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen quotes an experienced doctor warning as they arrived. "You know, the kind of medicine they practiced in the Civil War."
summarize: Russia denounced those sanctions in a blunt rejoinder on Friday evening, posted on the Foreign Ministry website. The statement said that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had spoken by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry and warned that “hasty and ill-considered steps” to impose sanctions on Russian officials “would inevitably backfire on the United States itself.”      Russia’s Interfax news agency reported that Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Kerry would soon meet again. A senior State Department official traveling with Mr. Kerry, who was flying back to Washington after a trip to Europe and the Middle East, confirmed that Mr. Kerry had spoken with Mr. Lavrov, but that it was unclear when they would meet again.      The Russians also sent menacing economic signals to the financially ailing interim central government in Kiev, which Russia has refused to recognize. Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, which supplies Ukraine with most of its gas, warned that it might shut off supplies unless Ukraine paid $1.89 billion owed to the company.      “We cannot deliver gas for free,” Russian news agencies quoted Gazprom’s chief executive, Alexei Miller, as saying.      Video      Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine for nearly two weeks in January 2009, causing severe economic problems for Ukraine and for other European customers who were dependent on supplies delivered through Ukraine.      Valentina I. Matviyenko, the chairwoman of the upper house of the Russian Parliament, the Federation Council, compared the planned referendum in Crimea to Scotland’s scheduled vote on whether to become independent from Britain. She did not mention that the national government in Britain had agreed to hold a referendum, while the Ukrainian government has not.      The speaker of the Russian lower house, Sergei Y. Naryshkin, echoed Ms. Matviyenko’s remarks. “We will respect the historic choice of the people of Crimea,” he said.

On Friday, a delegation of lawmakers from Crimea arrived in Moscow to lay the groundwork for joining Russia, strongly supported by senior lawmakers.      In another telling sign of Russian government support, the Crimean delegates were cheered at an officially sanctioned rally in central Moscow that was shown at length on Russian state television, with songs and chants of “Russia, Moscow, Crimea.” News agencies quoted the police as saying 60,000 people attended.      Even if the referendum proceeds, it was unclear what would happen next, given the wide gap between the positions of Russia and the West — most notably between Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama, who spoke for an hour by phone on Thursday night.

According to the White House, Mr. Obama urged Mr. Putin to authorize direct talks with Ukraine’s new government, permit the entry of international monitors and return his forces to the bases that Russia leases in Crimea.      In a statement, the Kremlin offered a starkly different account of the phone call, emphasizing Russia’s view that the new government in Kiev had no authority because it was the result of what Mr. Putin called an anticonstitutional coup last month that had ousted Viktor F. Yanukovych, the pro-Kremlin president.      The official Russian account of the phone call went on to say that the current Ukrainian leadership had imposed “absolutely illegitimate decisions” on the eastern and southeastern regions of the country, where pro-Russian sentiment is widespread. “Russia cannot ignore appeals connected to this, calls for help, and acts appropriately, in accordance with international law,” the statement said.      In the United States, Mr. Obama was taking a wait-and-see attitude. He spoke by phone to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has been reluctant to pursue muscular sanctions against Russia because of the deep and interwoven economic relationship between the two countries. He headed to Florida for a speech on education and then a weekend off with his family, but aides promised he would be monitoring the crisis.      Video      “We’re hopeful that in the next few days, we’ll get greater clarity about whether or not the Russians are willing to take some concrete steps toward this offramp here,” said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman.      In Kiev, anti-Russian sentiment was hardening. The Right Sector movement, a nationalist group that was important in the deadly protests last month that drove Mr. Yanukovych from power, announced that its leader, Dmytro Yarosh, would run for president. Andriy Tarasenko, chairman of its local branch, also said the group was prepared to fight, in Crimea and elsewhere, “if the Kremlin tramples on us further.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      With Washington and Moscow trading heated accusations of hypocrisy on the issue of respecting state sovereignty, validating Crimea’s secession would carry pointed political risks for Mr. Putin, given longstanding demands for independence from Russia by its own similarly autonomous republics in the Caucasus, including Dagestan and Chechnya.      Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia, noted the parallel in a sharp post on Twitter. “If Russian government endorses Crimean referendum,” Mr. McFaul wrote, using abbreviations needed for a 140-character limit, “will they also allow/endorse similar votes in republics in the Russian Federation?”      The West, which has insisted that the Ukrainian people are entitled to decide their future without interference from Russia, faces similar challenges as it seeks to explain why the people of Crimea should not necessarily decide their own fate.      The United States and its European allies typically support self-determination, but have opposed independence for regions within their own borders, like Scotland in Britain or Catalonia in Spain.      There was no sign on Friday that Russian armed forces were relaxing their tight clench on the Crimean Peninsula, with military bases surrounded and border crossings under strict control. There were news reports late Friday that pro-Russian militants had smashed through the gates of a Ukrainian Air Force base in the port of Sevastopol housing 100 Ukrainian troops, but that no shots had been fired. There were also reports that a number of Ukrainian journalists had been beaten by masked attackers and were missing.      For the second consecutive day, an observer mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the 57-member organization that includes both Ukraine and Russia, was prevented from entering Crimea at a checkpoint blocked by armed men.      Astrid Thors, an envoy from the group who had gone to Crimea earlier in the week, said in a telephone interview from Amsterdam that she had faced noisy, threatening crowds chanting pro-Russian slogans during her visit and had been forced to leave. Ms. Thors, the group’s high commissioner for national minorities, said she could have experienced the sort of predicament faced by a senior United Nations diplomat, Robert H. Serry, who was chased out of Crimea by gunmen earlier this week.      “There was a risk the same could happen, that our movement could be hindered by the crowds,” Ms. Thors said. “We took precautionary principles. We shortened our stay.” ||||| U.S. Knew Of 'Imminent' Move In Crimea, Top Official Says      Enlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Victoria Burke/AP Lauren Victoria Burke/AP      Senior U.S. officials were warned of imminent Russian military action in Crimea about a week before the troop movements that have sparked a major international crisis over Ukraine, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency tells NPR.      "I think for easily seven to 10 days leading up to the Russian troops as we see them now in the Crimea, we were providing very solid reporting ... where we move from one level of a condition of warning, which I would just describe ... as sort of moderate to one where we believe things are imminent," Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn tells Morning Edition in an interview airing Friday.      Related NPR Stories      Barely a week after the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine accused Russia of sending troops into Crimea, a predominately Russian-speaking autonomous enclave that is home to the Kremlin's Black Sea Fleet. The action, which Moscow has yet to officially acknowledge, has pushed relations between Russia and the West to their lowest level in years.      Flynn, responding to criticism that the U.S. intelligence community was caught off guard by the Kremlin move, tells NPR's David Greene that U.S. intelligence is watching "some of the naval activities up around the key bases."      "We saw what has been referred to as an exercise inside of Russia, and we're paying very close attention to any additional activities of some of their key military forces," Flynn says.      Flynn also discusses Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked classified information and is now living in Moscow to avoid treason charges in the U.S. He says there's an ongoing debate in the intelligence community that asks: "What kinds of information did he touch, did he take — what do we know?"      The U.S. Army lieutenant general says he's most concerned that Snowden might have stolen sensitive information about intelligence and operational capabilities, technology, weapons systems and war plans.      "Does that knowledge get into the hands of our adversaries — in this case, of course, Russia?" Flynn says.      "We have to assume the worst case and then begin to make recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks for what has been compromised," he says. "We are going to be dealing with this for many, many years, everything from changing how we operate, changing some of the procedures, techniques and tactics that we use." ||||| Sevastopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian troops reportedly smash open the gates of a Ukrainian base. Russia's navy traps Ukrainian ships. Armed men refuse to allow military observers to enter Ukraine's Crimea region.      The crisis in Ukraine took on a decidedly military flavor Friday as tensions flared between Moscow and Kiev over control of Crimea, even as the world's diplomats said conflict could be avoided.      Crimea, a self-governing peninsula in southern Ukraine with an ethnic Russian majority and strong cultural ties to Russia, has become the epicenter of a battle for influence between Moscow, Kiev and the West since Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was pushed out of office by protesters who were angered over his rebuff of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of one with Russia.      In the days since Yanukovych was ousted, thousands of Russian troops have surrounded military bases and key infrastructure sites, and they have taken control of border crossings.      At the same time, a political battle has been playing out between the two countries, with Russia's Parliament on Friday giving its defiant support to Crimean lawmakers who want to see their region split from Ukraine and join Russia.      Complete coverage on the Ukraine crisis      Political moves      The lawmakers' unanimous call for a vote on separation prompted howls of outrage Thursday in the United States and Europe and the threat of sanctions, including asset freezes, visa bans and travel bans.      The delegation from the Crimean Parliament, which said it would put the decision to a public vote on March 16, headed to Moscow on Friday and got a very different reaction.      Valentina Matvienko, speaker of Russia's upper house of Parliament, told the Crimean delegation it would "support and welcome" any decision made by the Crimean people to become a part of Russia.      Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk condemned talk of a split.      "I want to warn separatists and other traitors of the Ukrainian state who are trying to work against Ukraine, any of your decisions taken is unlawful, unconstitutional, and nobody in the civilized world is going to recognize the results of the so-called referendum of the so-called Crimean authorities," he said Friday.      Russia has denounced Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities.      Putin has insisted he has the right to use military force in Ukraine if necessary to protect ethnic Russians in Crimea.      But Ukrainian officials say no threat exists, and Putin is using it as a pretext to control the region.      Map: How Ukraine is divided      U.S. President Barack Obama set out a potential solution to the crisis when he spoke to Putin on Thursday, the White House said.      The proposal includes direct talks between Kiev and Moscow, the withdrawal of Russian forces, international support for elections on May 25, and the presence of international monitors to "ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected, including ethnic Russians," Obama said.      Crimean threat?      What has mostly been a peaceful standoff in Crimea, with virtually no sign of Ukrainian military movement, appeared to take a turn on Friday when pro-Russian forces smashed open the gates of a Ukrainian base near Sevastopol that controls airspace in southern Ukraine, Vitaly Onishenko, a deputy commander at the base, told CNN.      Ukraine's military spokesman initially said the forces were Cossacks, akin to Russian paramilitary troops, but Onishenko later dismissed that claim and said the forces were Russian and wore military uniforms with no insignia.      Ukrainian troops refused to surrender and barricaded themselves inside a control room, Onishenko said.      Outside the base, self-styled Crimean defense forces, similar to local militias, attacked journalists, he said. At least one person, believed to be a journalist, was injured and taken to a hospital, he said.      The standoff at the base eventually ended with the Russian-speaking forces pulling back to the outside of the base, Onishenko said.      Ukrainian authorities also reported that the Russian Black Sea Fleet sank a second of its own, old ships at the entrance to Lake Donuzlav, an inlet on the western coast of Crimea that is home to a Ukrainian naval base. Viktor Shmihanovsky, vice commander of the base, told CNN that several Ukrainian naval ships are now trapped inside.      Unidentified armed troops also have blocked unarmed European military observers from entering the country for the second straight day.      Masked men carrying rifles and wearing camouflage uniforms stopped the 43 observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a regional security organization, at a checkpoint separating the mainland from the Crimean peninsula, CNN's Matthew Chance said.      One man, speaking in Russian, said: "I've been ordered by the government of Crimea not to let anyone in."      Live: Ukraine crisis updates      And in signs that the pro-Russian Crimean authorities are clamping down on dissent within the peninsula, at least two Ukrainian channels, 1+1 and Channel 5, have been blocked from broadcasting. The head of 1+1 told CNN that Russian state TV outlet Channel One is now broadcasting on its frequency.      A Bulgarian freelance journalist and his colleague also were assaulted while filming in Simferopol, the regional capital. The journalist told CNN he was wrestled to the ground, and a gun was put to his head.      The incident was captured on surveillance footage and aired on a Ukrainian TV channel, Hromadske TV.      The standoff has also prompted neighboring countries and their allies to boost military defenses, with the United States beefing up its number of fighter jets in Lithuania and Poland.      The USS Truxton, a guided-missile destroyer, was also heading to the Black Sea to join in pre-planned military exercises with Romanian and Bulgarian forces.      Asset freezes, visa bans      Meanwhile, as the West seeks to put the diplomatic squeeze on Russia, European Union nations said they'll suspend some talks with Russia and have threatened travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of a planned EU-Russia summit.      French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told French public radio Friday that tougher measures are planned if Moscow doesn't act to de-escalate the situation.      "And if another attempt is made, then we would enter into something completely different -- that is to say serious consequences for the relations between Europe and Russia," he said.      Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned against sanctions, saying in a statement that they would "inevitably boomerang" on the United States.      But there's help on hand for the fledgling government in Kiev.      Ukraine's new government and the EU have agreed to revive a trade deal and an aid package that could bring $15 billion to Ukraine.      The International Monetary Fund is also ready to help, the head of the agency's European section said. NATO is willing to help Ukraine's military "modernize and strengthen," Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN's Becky Anderson on Friday.      Such aid is desperately needed.      The Russian gas company, Gazprom, has not received any payment from Ukraine in February, according to the company's CEO, the Russian state news agency Itar-Tass, reported Friday.      CEO Alexey Miller said Gazprom cannot give Ukraine gas for free, Itar-Tass reported.      In Crimea: 'We will protect our land from Western extremists'      Paralympic protest      Ukraine's Paralympic team sent just one member to participate in the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in the Russian city of Sochi, said Dmitry Bulatov, Ukrainian minister of sports and youth.      The decision to boycott the ceremonies, with the exception of a single flag bearer, was made unanimously by the team, he said.      "This is how our team expresses protest against aggressors and occupants entering our land," Bulatov said.      Official delegations from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Canada and Poland earlier announced plans not to attend the Games. Athletes from those countries will still compete.      Muslim minority fears for safety      Russian speakers make up about 60% of Crimea's population of more than 2 million, but around a quarter are Ukrainian and 12% are Crimean Tatar, a predominately Muslim minority. Neither of the latter two groups would welcome a switch to Russian control.      A CNN crew met with Crimean Tatars in the town of Bakhchisaray amid fears for their safety that have reminded some of past oppression under the Soviet Union.      Many spent years in exile -- in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan or other Soviet republics -- after the Soviet Union deported them for supposedly collaborating with Adolf Hitler.      "It is not legal," one elderly man said. "We are the original nation of Crimea. Our Khan state was here. Russia left us with no rights.      "We don't want to be with Russia, we want to be with Ukraine," he said.

CNN's Tim Schwarz in Kiev, Alla Eshchenko in Moscow, Bharati Naik, Jason Hanna and Ursin Caderas also contributed to this report. ||||| Russia is already paying a heavy price for intervening in Ukraine, Western officials said Thursday.      Tumbling stock markets and a big currency devaluation are delivering a blow to its faltering economy.      "So far we've seen a major impact on the Russian economy and the Ukrainian economy, and some financial impact on countries that border that area," said European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. "The impact on the Russian economy is severe."      Russia's central bank was forced to jack up interest rates to 7% from 5.5% on Monday in a bid to stabilize markets and counter the impact of a near 10% decline in the value of the ruble this year.      Russia earns more from exports than it pays for imports, thanks to its role as a leading world energy supplier.      But it does buy food, clothing, medicines, machinery and transportation equipment from major trading partners such as Europe and China, and a weaker currency will make those imports more expensive.      The ruble has stabilized this week, but it still is one of the world's weakest currencies so far this year.      Shares in Russia's leading companies have fallen 7% since the start of this week, and are now down 11% in 2014. That compares with a 3% decline across emerging markets.      A senior U.S. government official said on Thursday that Russia's "fragile economy" was suffering each day as a consequence of the country's actions on the international stage.      Related: EU offers $15 billion in aid to Ukraine      "We believe Russia has already paid a cost in seeing its stock market contract and its currency fall," he said, speaking shortly after the U.S. imposed a visa ban on some Russians and Ukrainians.      President Obama also signed an executive order laying the groundwork for further sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for the crisis in Ukraine.      "We intend to impose costs on Russia for this intervention," the U.S. official added.      Russian gross domestic product grew by about 1.3% last year compared to 3.4% in 2012 -- one of the sharpest slowdowns in emerging markets. Many forecasters were expecting a slight upturn in 2014 but the standoff over Ukraine could make for a much weaker outcome.      Rating agency Fitch said rising inflation, higher interest rates and a draining away of foreign capital were increasing the risk of a slowdown.      "Capital flight could accelerate, particularly if the threat of economic and financial sanctions increased. While not our base case, were such sanctions to materialize, the potential impact on growth and investment could lead us to review our sovereign rating on Russia," it added.      Related: Who would suffer from Russian sanctions      European Union leaders said Thursday that Russia should begin talks with Ukraine in the next few days, and make progress quickly. If that doesn't happen, they stand to face limited sanctions.      Leaders also threatened tougher measures if the crisis deepens, but they are hoping to avoid a trade war with Russia and the damage that would cause to the slow eurozone recovery.      Draghi said the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on the eurozone had so far been muted, and may have helped reduce the borrowing costs for some countries on the periphery.      "If anything, there have been (money) flows into the eurozone which narrowed the (bond) spreads of some of the stressed countries," he said.      But the crisis had the potential to cause serious damage, Draghi added.      "The geopolitical risks in the area could quickly become substantial and generate developments that are unforeseeable and potentially of great consequence."      -- CNNMoney's Alanna Petroff contributed to this article. |||||	– A delegation from Crimea's parliament visited Moscow today, where they got a warm reception and assurances that Russia would back their secession play. "If the people of Crimea decide to join Russia in the referendum, we ...will certainly support this decision," Valentina Matvienko, the chair of Russia's upper house said, according to the Wall Street Journal. The speaker of the Duma agreed, saying Russia would "respect the historic choice of the people of Crimea." Both leaders are close allies of Vladimir Putin, the New York Times points out. EU leaders warned yesterday that any further Russian Federation moves "would lead to additional and far-reaching consequences," CNN reports, and President Obama has already imposed some punitive measures. But Matvienko brushed such considerations aside, saying, "We have no rights to leave our people when there's a threat to them. None of the sanctions will be able to change our attitude." In other news: Sanctions aren't the only pain Russia is suffering. Russia's stock market has fallen 7% this week, CNN points out, and the ruble is in free-fall, which will force Russia to pay more for the food, clothes, and medicine it imports from Europe and China. The US knew Russia's military would make a move in Crimea about a week before it happened, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency tells NPR, saying it was tipped off by naval movements and "what has been referred to as an exercise inside of Russia." The Kremlin has released its own account of the Putin-Obama phone call. In addition to disagreeing about the cause of the conflict, Putin told Obama that the US-Russian relationship was too important to "be sacrificed for individual—albeit rather important—international problems."
summarize: Despite countless cries of outrage and shrieks of horror from left-wing activists, radical environmentalists and the mainstream media, President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office unquestionably should be judged a rousing success.      Let’s start with the economy. After eight years of sluggish economic growth, $10 trillion of additional national debt, and the imposition of crushing, incomprehensible regulatory schemes under the Obama administration, Trump has implemented a series of reforms that have reignited the American economic engine and set the nation back on the right course.      The number of workers employed full-time has risen by 1.3 million since Trump was elected in November, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the five months prior to Trump’s victory, the economy only added 958,000 full-time jobs.      Spurred by Trump’s commitment to reducing the toll taken on businesses by Obama-era regulations, investors seem more confident than they’ve been in well over a decade.      From October 2014 to October 2016, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by a meager 2.49 percent. Since October 2016, just prior to Election Day, the market has steadily risen more than 11 percent and has hit all-time highs, padding American retirement accounts along the way.      Consumer confidence has also increased dramatically under the Trump administration; it’s now at its highest level since December 2000.      Other major issues indirectly related to the economy have improved as well. For instance, the number of people crossing illegally into the United States has plummeted.      The number of immigrants caught crossing the border illegally in March, about 12,000, was 72 percent lower than the number reported in December, said Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.      Trump has also called for cutting costs at bloated federal agencies, proposing in his budget to slash spending by at least 20 percent at the departments of Justice, Labor, Agriculture and State. He’s also called for a 31 percent reduction at the out-of-control Environmental Protection Agency.      On the energy and infrastructure front, Trump has been just as active and effective.      In February, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management sold drilling rights on 278 parcels of federal land for $129.3 million, the largest lease sale in four years.      And, following executive orders from Trump to review and rescind unnecessary and unjustified limits on energy production on public lands, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke ended the Interior’s moratorium on issuing new coal leases and directed Land Management to rescind regulations limiting hydraulic fracturing.      Trump also reversed Obama administration policies blocking the completion of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. The result: The Dakota Access pipeline was swiftly completed, and oil now flows through it today. Work is expected to soon begin on the Keystone XL.      Keeping his promise to miners, Trump’s early energy actions have paid job dividends in coal country.      Economist Stephen Moore notes that since Trump’s election, the mining sector, which has been plagued for years with layoffs, has added 35,000 jobs.      Additionally, the two largest coal companies in the United States, Peabody Energy and Arch Coal, which had previously been forced into bankruptcy in part by Obama’s climate policies, are once again viable.      Perhaps most importantly, Trump successfully filled the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s Supreme Court seat with one of the most highly qualified, well-respected federal judges considered for the nation’s highest court in recent decades, Justice Neil Gorsuch.      Like any presidential administration, team Trump has faced multiple challenges and setbacks in its first 100 days. But considered in its entirety, Trump’s presidency thus far has been wildly successful and a substantial improvement over the largely ineffectual and reckless Obama administration.

That’s the only way to understand President Trump’s first 100 days — as a breaking from and often a breaking of the Obama presidency, one every bit as turbulent as what’s encountered by a sailing ship going from calm seas into a hurricane.      Trump’s first 50 days were a jumble of ups and downs, mostly downs. But beginning with the flawless testimony of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his subsequent confirmation under rules that will speed the way for future Supreme Court nominees, the Trump turnaround began and gained an almost uninterrupted momentum. The president’s directive to strike Syria after it apparently rained sarin poison on babies and toddlers was a defining moment, reinforced by using the “mother of all bombs” in Afghanistan and dispatching an armada of weaponry toward North Korea (no matter how indirect a route the ships took to arrive there).      All along, a legislative legacy was passing beneath the noses of Manhattan-Beltway media elites who could not be bothered to learn the wide-ranging implications of the baker’s dozen of Congressional Review Act measures that passed the House and Senate by simple majorities and were signed into law by Easter. This is a legislative outpouring not exceeded in substantive impact by any modern president except Franklin Roosevelt, though others have seen more statutes passed. Yet because regulatory rollback bores or confounds journalists, these new laws were discounted or simply dismissed.      In fact, a law passed under the little-used Congressional Review Act not only repeals an existing regulation but also bars the affected agency from acting in the same area without explicit legislative approval. These measures will therefore reverberate for decades, whether by hamstringing public funding of abortion at the state level; narrowing the reach of environmental regulators over “waters of the United States ”; or slapping down the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on hunting in Alaska.      Trump’s Cabinet appointees, meanwhile, represent the most conservative collection of the modern era, and his national security team 2.0 (with H.R. McMaster taking the place of Michael Flynn as national security adviser) is at least the equal of any that has served since the end of the Cold War. Trump’s sometimes loose campaign rhetoric on national security has been realigned with governing realities, underscored by assessments of how badly damaged the past eight years left the country. President Barack Obama’s legacy is easily summarized in eight words: “leading from behind,” “red line,” “JV ,” Aleppo and Libya.      Sure, there have been big fumbles and stumbles, especially at the start: the first executive order on immigration; the use of “so-called” in referring to a federal judge (never appropriate or prudent); branding journalists, no matter how biased, the “enemy of the American people.”      Of continuing concern are the administration’s refusal to release White House visitor logs, West Wing staff intrigues and the glacial pace of appointments, particularly the absence of Republicans at the Pentagon and the failure to move swiftly on filling appellate court vacancies. All these are unforced errors that have combined to deny Trump the accolades that would have been forthcoming had his accomplishments not been so interlaced with pratfalls.      Trump’s most significant setback — the collapse of the repeal and replacement of Obamacare — is not yet a conclusive defeat. And a spate of executive orders has set the stage for regulatory relief across the federal government. Could Trump have done better? Of course. But what he has done is without question of historic and lasting impact.      On the political front, there is the slight but ongoing shuffle to the center — a very good thing so long as the judicial picks remain originalists and the military rebuilding robust. In office, Obama moved left, left and then more to the left. Trump has begun his presidency by casting off his moorings to the hard right while keeping true believers such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the forefront and the rhetoric of jobs, jobs, jobs constantly resounding.      This a politically potent combination, and the drop-off in protest marchers between the Jan. 21 and April 15 rallies and the disappointments to Democrats in the Kansas and so far Georgia special elections — Jon Ossoff’s best shot at actually winning Georgia’s 6th Congressional District seems to have come and gone — telegraph that it is working. Progressives’ complaints are increasing both in number and decibels, and their energy veering wildly leftward, much to the delight of Republicans who worry about the downside potential of November 2018.      Trump has been adapting and learning in his own, always unique and often far-too-unnecessarily-divisive way. Just imagine what the next three and two-thirds years can bring — if he minimizes the errors of the first 100 days and repeats the parts that have been greeted with broad-based conservative applause. ||||| On the campaign trail, Donald Trump made bold economic promises for his first 100 days in office.      Now, as his 100th day nears on Saturday, it’s clear President Trump won’t be able to keep many of them. The most noteworthy perhaps is his pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare, which failed when he couldn’t bring Republican lawmakers to consensus.      Tax reform certainly won’t be passed before the 100-day mark, even if a rough outline is revealed Wednesday.      “Voters will recall that Trump had promised large tax cuts for the middle class, as well as tax deductions for childcare and eldercare—a proposal championed by his daughter, Ivanka. The President also backed away from a promise to call China a “currency manipulator” on day one.      But that’s not to say Donald Trump has completely reneged on his pledges to voters. Here are seven economic promises he did keep in the first 100 days.      1. Pulling out of TPP      It took only a matter of days for the President to fulfill this promise. On his third full day in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The pact, which was negotiated by President Obama’s administration but never approved by Congress, had included 12 nations bordering the Pacific including Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, and others.      Critics on both the right and left argued hard that the deal would hurt U.S. manufacturers and could displace American jobs. Even Hillary Clinton, who had supported the agreement while serving as secretary of state in the Obama administration, argued against TPP on the campaign trail.      By the time Trump won the election, it was a surprise to no one that TPP would not be ratified by Congress. And now, without the U.S. involvement, the behemoth trade deal is essentially dead.      2. Hiring freeze on federal workers      In another one of Trump’s first actions as President, he followed through on a campaign promise to freeze hiring of federal workers.      The goal was to reduce the federal workforce through attrition, but it’s unclear yet if the impact has been significant. The White House lifted the freeze in mid April, with budget director Mick Mulvaney noting that the administration was replacing it with a “a more surgical plan” to reduce federal jobs.      “It does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly,” Mulvaney said.      3. Ban on lobbying by former administration officials      Indeed, Trump did pen an executive order banning executive branch officials from lobbying the U.S. government after they leave office. The restriction lasts five years, which is longer than the prior two-year ban imposed by President Obama.      The directive also imposes a lifetime ban on former White House officials lobbying foreign governments.      Trump had also promised to restrict congressional officials from lobbying the U.S. government for five years. As PolitiFact notes, federal lawmakers are already bound by law from engaging in lobbying activities for one to two years. Trump would have to convince Congress to override or amend that law if he wants to change the rules.      4. Refuse the $400,000 annual president’s salary or only take $1      President Trump gave his entire first-quarter salary, totaling $78,333, to the National Park service. Although his critics dismissed it as a publicity stunt, the gesture does fall in line with Trump’s campaign promise to refuse his presidential pay.      “It’s not as easy as you’d think” to give money to the government, Trump’s press secretary Sean Spicer noted earlier this month, after he handed over a ceremonial check to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.      5. Lift roadblocks on the Keystone Pipeline      As promised, the Trump administration approved the construction of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline. The State Department issued a permit to TransCanada on March 24, clearing the way for its construction after the Obama administration had blocked it.      However, the pipeline will not be required to use American-made steel as Trump had originally promised.      6. Lift restrictions on the energy industry      Last month, President Trump signed a sweeping executive order rolling back several of former President Obama’s signature environmental regulations.      The executive order immediately ended a moratorium on new leases for coal mining on federal land and initiated a formal review of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The review is the first step in a more lengthy process aimed at repealing or changing the rule, which is aimed at combatting climate change.      7. For every one new regulation, two will be repealed      When Trump met with business leaders during his first week in office, he told them his administration could cut regulations “by 75%, maybe more.”      Along with that goal, Trump signed an executive action on Jan. 30, ordering that for every one new regulation issued, federal agencies must identify two existing regulations to be eliminated Most regulations have to go through a lengthy review and comment process before they can be revoked, so the progress of his measure is difficult to measure at this stage in the game. ||||| Says he created "over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month."      On April 25, the White House launched a web page to promote President Donald Trump’s achievements in his first 100 days. Featured prominently near the top was a graphic that touted job gains on Trump’s watch.      The graphic said, "Over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month."      Is that accurate? Not exactly.      'Over 500,000 new jobs'      The number of new jobs does exceed 500,000 if you include the monthly job reports from January, February, and March -- the most recent three months for which data has been released. The net gain in jobs over that period was 533,000.      However, there’s a problem with Trump claiming credit for all 533,000 jobs -- namely, the January report isn’t based on job gains that occurred on his watch.      "The jobs report is a snapshot reflecting conditions in the calendar week or pay period that includes the 12th of the month," said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. Since Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, "the information in the January report preceded President Trump's first 100 days," Kolko said.      Using just the two months on his watch -- February and March -- the U.S. economy created 317,000 jobs, not 500,000.      A fair approximation, Kolko said, would be to include job growth reported in the February, March, and April reports. But the April jobs report hasn’t been released, so we don’t know the final number yet.      For the sake of comparison, overall job creation under Trump actually hasn’t been turbo-charged yet. The average monthly gain for February and March -- the two months for which we currently have data for Trump -- was 158,500.      By contrast, the average monthly gain for Obama’s final full year -- January 2016 to December 2016 -- was 187,000. Here’s a chart showing monthly job gains since January 2016.      "Job gains so far this year are not exceptional by the standards of job growth in the recent past," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. "My assessment is that not much has happened so far in the job market, in either a favorable or unfavorable direction, since the start of the year."      We’ll also add our usual caveat that that no president deserves full credit or full blame for economic performance on their watch, since no president is powerful enough to singlehandedly shape the economy. Other forces, from technological advances to developments overseas, can have significant effects.      'A surge in female employment last month'      As for the "surge" in female employment, there is evidence in the statistics, but it’s not clear how significant or durable the increase is.      The number of employed women rose by 475,000 between February 2017 and March 2017. That’s bigger than all but one month-over-month increase in 2016, when Obama was in office, and it followed a January-to-February increase of 319,000.      There’s uncertainty, however, about what, if anything this means.      For starters, most economists warn that it’s vastly preferable to draw conclusions from more than one month. One month’s statistics could be thrown off balance by random quirks; this shortcoming would dissipate if you looked at a longer run of months.      In addition, the month-to-month data for men’s and women’s employment tends to bounce around -- a lot. During the final full year of Obama’s presidency, the monthly change in women’s employment ranged from a decline of 179,000 to an increase of 487,000, and the monthly change in men’s employment ranged from a decline of 94,000 to an increase of 402,000.      This is part of why economists favor a different Bureau of Labor Statistics measurement for month-to-month changes in employment -- a survey of company payroll records, rather than of households. The payroll-survey data did not vary as widely under Obama in 2016 -- it ranged from a gain of 43,000 to a gain of 291,000. Indeed, the payroll data showed a gain of 98,000 jobs in March, which doesn’t align at all with the supposed 475,000-job increase for women seen in the household survey.      It’s also worth noting that the March gain for women was partially offset by a loss of 5,000 jobs for men.      "We’ll have to wait a while longer before knowing whether the big March employment gains for women are significant or sustainable," Burtless said. "Most informed observers agree that the month-to-month and even two-month employment changes recorded in the household survey seem awfully variable compared with the numbers in the employer survey."      Our ruling      Trump said he created "over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month."      Actually, he can stake a claim for a boost of 317,000 jobs at most, not 500,000 -- and that comes with the usual caveats about how much credit presidents deserve for job growth during their tenure. Meanwhile, the data does show a two-month surge in female employment, but it’s too soon to know whether this is a lasting achievement or just statistical noise.

During the first 100 days of the Trump administration, we have seen a president following through on his promises.      ADVERTISEMENT      While you will surely hear the naysayers on TV and radio badmouthing this administration, what matters most are the actions we are seeing that will improve the lives, security, jobs and economic opportunity for hardworking Americans across the country.      First, let’s look at the numbers. President Trump has enacted more bills in the first 100 days than any president in a half century.      Enacted 28 bills into law – rolling back excessive and job-killing Obama-era regulations;      Signed 25 Executive Orders – approving Keystone XL pipeline and eliminating wasteful government bureaucracy;      Driven illegal border crossings to a 17-year low – restoring the rule of law and deporting criminal aliens;      Oversaw creation of over 500,000 new jobs – restoring confidence in American jobs and encouraging investment in U.S. economy: and      Confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court – first time to happen in the first 100 days since 1881.      So, what does this mean to you and your family? It means better job opportunities, fewer hidden taxes, more freedom and safer communities.      When it comes to jobs and the economy, your family is better protectedafter the first 100 days of this administration. In Congress, we have worked with President Trump to actually rollback excessive and expensive regulations that drive up the cost of everything – including your electricity bills, grocery bills, mortgages and even the cost of putting money aside for your retirement. The Obama administration never saw an aspect of your life that they did not want to “improve” with Washington intervention.      Those days of big government intervention are over and we are now on a path to restore economic freedom and personal responsibility.      Putting the safety and security of the American people first has been a top priority for President Trump. Our communities are safer as the new administration is deporting criminal aliens and improving vetting for those who seek to enter the U.S. from terrorist hotspots. Illegal border crossings have dramatically dropped under President Trump – cutting the flow of illegal drugs and foreign gang members.      The American people should be very encouraged by the president’s efforts to restore America’s standing on the world stage – sending a starkly clear signal to brutal dictators around the world through his decisive military strike on Syria in response to their use of chemical weapons. On former President Obama’s watch, North Korea was allowed to enhance their nuclear and missile technology and the flawed Iran nuclear deal enabled the Iranian regime to continue their weapons and missile technology programs. Those days are over as President Trump has redirected America’s strength to putting the security of the American people and our allies first.      This is only the start, but we are moving in a strikingly different direction than the malaise days of the Obama era.      The ObamaCare experiment has been a dismal failure for most Americans as they are paying thousands of dollars more in premiums and deductibles. ObamaCare is in a death spiral and we are working to repeal and replace that law with legislation that restores healthcare freedom and affordability.      The underachieving economy of the Obama years will continue to be replaced with strong growth in jobs and higher wages, particularly as we cut taxes for working families and businesses. This, combined with the end of overregulation, will lead to robust economic growth not seen since the Reagan years.      Liberal elites don’t like what they see. But like me, President Trump does not work for them. We are fighting to improve the lives of hardworking Americans – and the first 100 days are a great start.

He was the senior national security correspondent for the Daily Beast and covered national security and intelligence for the Washington Times, the New York Sun and UPI. Read more opinion SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email      Before Donald Trump won the election in November we were warned: He is a Russian stooge. He is a fascist. He will upend the protocols and traditions that make governing possible. This is not normal.      Now that we are approaching the 100-day mark, it's worth noting that the president is defying the expectations of his resistance. And while there is plenty to oppose in Trump's young presidency, he is neither the Siberian Candidate nor the second coming of Mussolini.      Let's start with Russia. The FBI is still investigating whether and how his campaign may have colluded with Moscow's efforts to influence the presidential election. And yet in terms of actual policy, Trump has settled on a much tougher line with Russia than how he campaigned or in his first few weeks.      In the first month of Trump's presidency, there were legitimate concerns he would attempt a grand bargain with Russia. He boasted that it was an asset that Russian president Vladimir Putin liked him. And he went out of his way to spare Putin from the harsh criticism he reserved for just about everyone else.      But there has been no reset. In fact it's fair to say that Trump has been much kinder to China, Russia's traditional Asian rival. Trump ended any chance for the multilateral trade deal with China's neighbors known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He dropped his threat to revisit the One-China Policy that requires the U.S. not to recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. More recently, he has said he won't pursue China for currency manipulation, and tells us he is pleased by China's cooperation against North Korea during the current nuclear crisis.      Instead, Trump is treating Russia in practice the way he promised in the campaign to deal with China. His government has supported Montenegro's membership into NATO. Russia not only opposed this, but in October Russian agents were involved in a failed coup against the country's prime minister who supported Montenegro's accession to the treaty organization, according to a Montenegrin prosecutor.      The Trump administration last week rejected a request from Exxon-Mobil to get a waiver to explore energy exploration in the Black Sea with a Russia concern, despite the fact that he chose Exxon-Mobil's chief executive officer, Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state. You may remember him as the guy who won the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013.      Then there was the decision this month to fire 59 tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airbase, following the Syrian gas attack on rebel populations. Those strikes against Russia's only real client state in the Middle East caught Moscow by surprise, and further unraveled the relationship the Kremlin had hoped to reset with Trump. A few days after the missile strike, Trump's White House released a dossier calling out Russia's own fake news about the Syrian gas attack.      Now, U.S.-Russian relations are cratering. Both sides say they are at a historic low point. Russian bombers in the last week have been flying into Alaskan airspace, testing Trump's resolve. Meanwhile, one of America's top generals just suggested Russia was arming the Taliban in Afghanistan. If Trump is a Russian mole, it looks like a very long con.      This gets to the second resistance narrative about Trump, that he is an authoritarian or fascist in waiting. To be sure, Trump during the campaign gave his critics something to work with on this front. He at times encouraged his supporters at rallies to do violence to protesters. He promised to bring back waterboarding "and much worse," for terrorists captured on the battlefield. He campaigned on banning Muslims from entering the country and he promised to build a wall on the Mexican border. More recently, Trump has cozied up to the strong men ruling Egypt and Turkey. His semi-endorsement of the far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is part of this theme as well.      All of that is alarming. That said, real fascists are much better at consolidating power and implementing an agenda. On this score, Trump has been no Caesar. The courts have rebuked him twice on the much-modified travel ban that would apply to Muslim-majority countries. His first effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed miserably. He has yet to offer an infrastructure spending bill, tax reform or a plan to build the wall.      An added irony is that the bete noir of the anti-Trumpists, senior strategist and former Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, is currently out of favor. Trump's new inner circle is comprised of people like the investment banker Gary Cohn, the kind of globalists the president campaigned against. The other set of advisers are retired or serving generals like National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who is seen as a check on the nationalist ideologues that so worry most of Trump's opposition.      Traditionally, fascism is the marriage of corporate and military elites with an authoritarian leader. For Trump's White House, however, his corporate and military advisers are steering Trump to a more traditional presidential agenda.      None of this is to say Trump is doing a great job. He has shown himself to be entirely unfamiliar with the intricacies of policy. His hostility to the press is dangerous and counterproductive. Trump continues to say outrageous falsehoods and is prone to extreme hyperbole. He has failed to address in a meaningful way the many conflicts of interest posed by his business empire.      But these flaws have not yet posed an existential threat to the republic. He has obeyed the courts, even as he has derided their decisions on twitter. He has reversed himself on Russia. And slowly but surely, he has begun to resemble something less menacing and more normal than his foes predicted.      ( Corrects retirement status of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster in 12th paragraph of article published April 25. )      This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

LISTEN:      She said she found the idea of giving a simplistic letter grade to the Trump administration annoying, preferring to say President Trump is doing “very well.”      “Remember, those of you who maybe still aren’t aboard the Trump Train but know that the Trump movement had to be ushered in, in order to get rid of the status quo that was harming America, keep doing your ABCs and remember what that was: it was Anybody but Clinton,” she said. “So stick with your little alphabet analogy there. Those who are asking for a grade of this administration, just keep remembering it could have been Clinton.”      Palin applauded Marlow’s point that arguing over the fine points of Trump’s policy, and even dealing with some disappointments, should be vastly preferable for conservatives over fighting for their political lives – and even basic constitutional freedoms, like free speech – under a Clinton presidency. She suggested imagining what sort of Supreme Court justice would currently be taking the late Antonin Scalia’s place under President Hillary Clinton.      Marlow noted that Palin has been “quite critical in recent days” of President Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.      “She said, ‘Common Core now doesn’t exist’ or something, and you went buck wild on her,” Marlow recalled.      “I sure did!” Palin cheerfully agreed. “She said that, in fact, Common Core hasn’t really existed for the past couple of years. I would ask, do these politicians, do these elitist bureaucrats, do they even send their children or grandchildren, are they in public schools? When our kids and our grandkids come home and we sit down with them each night, still to this day, and we work with them on their homework, the Common Core curriculum is alive and not well in the classroom.”      “If the leader now of the education sector of our country would deny that Common Core is in existence, she needs to try to tell that to our really, really great public school teachers, who still have to explain and kind of apologize to the public school parents – I’m one of them – as to why the curriculum is as confusing and burdensome and less freeing for our teachers, who know what our students need best, as do the parents. Good schoolteachers still have to explain to us that under Common Core, these requirements are quite burdensome and nonsensical,” she said.      She accused DeVos of being “really out of touch” for denying all of this was happening.      Palin followed up with some of the highlights of Trump’s first hundred days, beginning with the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.      “I’m extremely thankful – we all should be – that he’s in there now,” she said.      She also praised Trump’s commitment to change President Barack Obama’s “lead from behind” foreign policy, “which made the world a less safe place to be.”      “Trump quashed that. He said no more leading from behind. America is that ‘beacon of hope.’ We are a country … of just this perfect storm, if you will, with the natural resources to be developed, with the manpower, and with the intellect, and with the patriotism, the unity that a country needs in order to be so successful, to be great and to be a leader that other countries would wish to emulate. America has all that, and we can put it into play for the greater good of the world by leading, and not leading from behind, which is kind of Orwellian-speak,” said Palin.      “Leading again on the global stage and the Supreme Court pick, those are two specifics – but Alex, we need to make sure to remind our friends, our supporters, people who are really tuned in to what’s going on today and get frustrated under any administration. Maybe they’re frustrated with what Trump does, some of the wrinkles that are certainly part of the agenda that we’ve witnessed,” she suggested.      “We can never put our faith and our hope in man, in any one man, certainly not a politician,” Palin counseled. “Man is fallible. We’re going to be disappointed if we put all of our hope and faith in one man – a politician, a government that cannot make us happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise. We need to look at the bigger picture here, as you suggested in your opening.”      Another highlight of the first hundred days for Palin was the “quote-unquote massive tax cut proposals that will come from the White House.”      “I’m extremely happy about that. That’s another promise fulfilled,” she said. “We know that to allow us to be solvent and sovereign, we need to see jobs created. The way that jobs are going to be created and people will be productive again in this country is for tax cuts that will really benefit the middle class, especially the working class. More jobs will be created with tax cuts, so I’m excited about that coming down the pike.”      “We have to cut taxes,” she stressed. “Look at that corporate tax rate we have that is, what, second highest in the developed world? Our corporate tax rate certainly is one of the job creation prohibiters that we’re suffering under. So that has to be done, and certainly people with our income taxes, we realize it’s taxation without representation. The government is taking from us the fruits of our labor, and we’re not receiving the services in return that are on par with the amount that they’re taking from us. It’s a given: taxes must be cut in this country, and I would think that everybody knows that.”      “But as for it then contributing to an accumulation of debt – you’re right: it’s semantics, and it’s bogus,” Palin said to Marlow’s point that the left controls the language of tax reform and treats tax cuts as an expensive indulgence that must be “paid for” somehow.      “It doesn’t have to result in accumulation of debt,” she argued. “We can’t just hand that over to those in government who hold the purse strings and keep spending more and more money that we do not have. We need to ratchet down the size of government. This government overreach in every area of our life that’s getting more and more expensive, we can’t just swallow that and say, ‘Oh, well, that’s just the way it is, and wow, we’re going to have to take more money from the people in order to pay for growing government.’”      “It always killed me when I was a city council member, I was a mayor, I was a city manager, I was a governor, and I would watch every 12 months when the government’s budget was due. I’d either help craft it, or it would come across my desk. I would always ask the bureaucrats and the politicians creating these budgets, ‘What’s going on here? Just because 365 days have passed, you just automatically inherently believe that the budget amount has to increase? Why? Are people getting more for the money that you’re taking from them? Has the population grown that much?’” she recalled.      “In each level of government, it’s just so inherent that oh, you know, government grows; that’s just the way it is. It doesn’t have to,” Palin contended.      Marlow asked Palin about the “war on free speech” conducted by masked thugs at universities, prominently including Berkeley, where he was once a student.      “Well, first, it blows me away that you’re from Berkeley. Talk about not drinking the Kool-Aid!” Palin said with a laugh.      “These Berkeley students, bless their hearts, they’re hypocrites on steroids,” she said on a more serious note. “It is amazing to me and anybody else with just an ounce of common sense in their veins to ever be able to believe that those who preach tolerance and diversity, and we’re gonna embrace diversity – but Heaven forbid you say something that might hurt our little snowflakey feelings. You know, we’ll melt there down in Berkeley if you say something that we can’t agree with!”      “In the end, they’re the most intolerant people if they are going to protest someone who is a bastion of free speech. Ann Coulter is on their side! When they are spewing the free speech rhetoric, she’s saying, ‘Exactly! And here, let’s exercise it! Let me prove to you, you guys prove with me, that we’re all for free speech!’ And yet, they’re so blinded by their hatred for anybody who does not agree just down the line with them on everything that they will not tolerate Ann Coulter speaking her mind,” said Palin.      Marlow advised President Trump to resist advice about “moderating” his positions to secure the approval of left-wingers who will never stop hating him – something Palin is well positioned to understand, as the target of an unprecedented campaign of left-wing vilification in 2008.      “Amen. Preach it, brother,” Palin agreed. “President Trump needs to realize he can’t win them over. You cannot. He can learn from our mistakes, those of us who have been in that position on a much smaller scale. We have tried to win them over, and it doesn’t work. It bites you in the butt, and it harms those who you have promised to serve.”      “Right on, too, in talking about the big tent,” she said to Marlow’s defense of an ideologically diverse Republican Party. “You know, most of us, we come from big-tent families. Our social circles even, and our communities, they’re big tents, and really, we’re better off for it. Talk about diversity and learning from other people’s perspectives that are shared and all that – that’s all great.”      “But no, when you are leading an agenda that people have put blood, sweat, and tears forth, to make sure that agenda finally is given an opportunity to be made manifest so that our lives can be made better, you have to surround yourself with people who are obviously going to help the cause and not hurt the cause,” she added.      “You cannot surround yourself, one, with a bunch of yes-men. That certainly harms the cause. You will never grow as a leader. You have to be growing as a leader as your constituents will be growing along with you. So you can’t have a bunch of yes-men. Those of us who have been in business and been in politics certainly recognize that,” said Palin.      “But also, you have to have those who at least will share your vision. Maybe some of the idiosyncrasies, maybe some of the details in how you’re going to get there, you can argue some of the ways to do that, but the vision has got to be the same,” she emphasized.      “Now, do globalists, do big government professional politicians who are in it for a season, not a reason – they’re in politics for a job, for a career, for the money, for the power – do they share the vision of average, hard-working, patriotic Americans who want government out of our lives so that we can be trusted as individuals to run our businesses the way that we know best and to raise our families the way that is best for our families?” Palin asked.      “Government, faceless bureaucrats, they don’t know how to do that. They keep screwing it up. Well, globalists and big government people, some in office today under Trump, they believe in that garbage of big government knowing best. That is the antithesis of the vision that those on the Trump Train have, and that Trump Train roared through this country so powerfully, so loudly and adamantly, that there was no stopping it. That’s why I wasn’t surprised when Trump won,” she contended.      “So those who don’t share that vision, who are there, quote-unquote, serving our president and the vision, the mission that he is on, that is shared by the majority of the voters – it’s frustrating to us because we do want to sound that warning bell that you can’t win them over. They’re certainly stuck in their ways, and if they give you lip service that they’re there with you – those are the yes-men that we don’t need around our president,” Palin advised.      In parting, Palin suggested a mission for Marlow: “I wish you would take the opportunity to get down to Berkeley and speak with your alumni. Go down there and talk to the folks down there about what tolerance really is and how healthy diverse opinions really can be. Talk about the Second Amendment. You would be one, Alex – well, they’d probably get really wee-weed up about it – but you could be a great spokesperson for the cause.”      Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.      Listen to the full audio of the interview above. |||||	– The first 100 days are just about under President Trump's belt, and there's plenty being said online about his performance—and much of that analysis is enthusiastically positive. Some of the standouts in that category: (Or click here to see a roundup of negative reviews.) Republican Rep. Brian Babin of Texas enthuses at the Hill that "we're off to a great start" under Trump, who he says has issued and enacted dozens of executive orders and bills, created 500,000 jobs, and put Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. "We are moving in a strikingly different direction than the malaise days of the Obama era," he says. With this Trump presidency we've experienced a "sea change," Hugh Hewitt writes for the Washington Post, adding that conservatives should break out the bubbly. Hewitt concedes there were initial "fumbles," "stumbles," and "a jumble of ups and downs," but he says Trump has since found his footing, especially after Gorsuch, the strike on Syria, and dropping the "mother of all bombs" on Afghanistan. "Just imagine what the next three and two-thirds years can bring," Hewitt writes. "A rousing success" is how Justin Haskins and H. Sterling Burnett describe the first 100 days for Trump in the Sun-Sentinel. They tout reforms Trump has jump-started to "reignite the American economic engine," as well as the sharp decline in illegal immigrants coming into the US since he took office—a "wildly successful" presidency so far. On the Americans for Tax Reform site, Justin Sykes praises Trump's first months as a "boon for US energy," listing the 10 executive orders Trump has already signed that "will boost US energy independence and growth." Fortune lists the seven economic promises it says the president has kept, including pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and getting rid of obstacles to the Keystone XL pipeline. Eli Lake writes that Trump has disproved the "Russian stooge" and "fascist" labels that have been hurled his way, noting at Bloomberg View that the president has begrudgingly adhered to court decisions (even if he has insulted them) and that "US-Russian relations are cratering." "Slowly but surely, he has begun to resemble something less menacing and more normal than his foes predicted," he writes. Sarah Palin wouldn't give a letter grade to Trump during a Breitbart interview Thursday, but she did offer he's doing "very well." She also told conservatives who may still have their doubts to "keep doing your ABCs"—i.e., remind themselves that the mission for this presidency was "Anybody But Clinton." One of the most glowing reviews of all sees little to no need for improvement, and it comes courtesy of Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs. On Fox Thursday, Dobbs said Trump has "worked his tail off" and called his performance "pretty close to perfect." Hannity nodded: "Everything he could do on his own he's doing."
summarize: It will never be confused with "New Year's Rockin' Eve," but for one small North Carolina town, the annual possum drop is one fine way to start the new year.      The families living in Brasstown, N.C., take part in festivities beginning two hours before midnight. Local church choirs belt out hymns and there's a tribute to war veterans. Clay Logan, the man behind the festivities, summed up the event: "good, clean, family fun."      ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT      "Hunters must afford wild animals the same right Patrick Henry yearned for: 'Give me liberty, or give me death!' " - Judge Fred Morrison, in his ruling      "We didn't think too much into it," he said. "We figured a lot of other animals were already being used, like the groundhog, for other events, and we wanted to start our own tradition."      The event was conceived 21 years ago, and what started out as a small family gathering grew into a town attraction that draws more than 2,000 spectators.      That streak, however, may come to an end after a recent court ruling. A judge ruled Tuesday that a state agency didn't have the authority to issue a permit for the event.      "Citizens are prohibited from capturing and using wild animals for pets or amusement," Judge Fred Morrison wrote in his ruling. "Hunters must afford wild animals the same right Patrick Henry yearned for: 'Give me liberty, or give me death!'"      People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had sued the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, which issues the permit for the event, saying it's illegal and cruel. The commission has 30 days to appeal Morrison's decision to Superior Court. A spokesman said the agency will decide whether to appeal after reviewing the 18-page ruling.      Logan, for his part, says the ruling is unfair. He said the possum is well fed and cared for by a veterinarian. During the event, it is placed in a plexiglass cage and lowered for 10 seconds. Shorty thereafter, the animal is turned loose into nearby woods, he said. A new possum is used each year, in part, because of their short life spans. A 3-year-old possum is considered old, he said.      Logan said the possum drop will continue in some form, although he won't break the law. This challenge by PETA marks at least the third time that someone has challenged the drop, he said.      Logan didn't meet the requirements for a captivity license or permit, so the commission circumvented its duty and invented a new permit called a "temporary possession and release permit," the judge said.      The judge wrote that although the commission claims to have issued such permits in the past, it produced no evidence to prove that it had. The temporary permit allowed Logan to keep the possum for several weeks and to exhibit the animal before it was released.      Logan's sportsman license only allowed him to take the animal, not possess and exhibit it, Morrison wrote. He was in possession of a wild-captured animal from at least Dec. 15, 2011, through Jan. 1, 2012, Morrison said.      PETA was pleased with the ruling. "Compassionate citizens can now look forward to a kinder celebration at Clay's."      Logan appears to be keeping a sense of humor about the whole thing, saying, “We’re not optimistic or pessimistic, we’re opossum-istic.”      Fox News' Edmund DeMarche and The Associated Press contributed to this report ||||| "One man's road kill is      another man's icon" Asheville      Citizen-Times "...But I actually spend a moment considering      whether to buy the lite      or regular variety."

summarize: As Californians grapple with the Gov. Brown’s mandatory water reductions, the question is being asked, what is the responsible use of water during a drought of this magnitude?      As a company with a century-long history of operations in California and more than 1,500 employees across the state, Nestlé Waters welcomes the dialogue about our company’s water use in California. Some are understandably curious about our operations and the sources of the water we bottle.      I know some believe that drought conditions should bring the bottling of water to an end. Experts on water use who have studied the issue have recognized, however, that bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought.      Nestlé Waters operates five California bottling facilities, using a total of 705 million gallons of water per year. To put that amount in perspective, this is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses.      We adhere to all local, state and federal regulations regarding our operations, all of which are in good standing, including our permit to transmit water in the San Bernardino National Forest. Recent accounts have inaccurately described our permit as “expired.” Like several hundred other special permit holders in the San Bernardino National Forest — and some 3,000 nationwide — whose permit is under review, our permit remains valid and, according to federal law, “does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency.”      Regardless of the fact that we are a small water user, everyone should be part of the solution, including Nestlé Waters. There is a need for greater transparency as well as comprehensive and balanced oversight of all water users. We take our role as a water steward seriously and support conservation efforts to safeguard the long-term environmental sustainability of California.      We know there is more to do and we strive for high standards and best practices for our operations. That is why we are implementing a top-to-bottom review of our drought contingency plans, actively seeking new ways to improve our operations in California to save water across Nestlé facilities, as we have done globally.      We agree that how California manages its groundwater supplies is of critical importance. Water use regulations should exist to both protect the health of environmental habitats and to ensure fairness to all users.      In light of the governor’s mandatory water reductions of 25 percent in communities across the state, we at Nestlé Waters are doubling down on our drought-mitigation efforts. Our largest plant is Silver LEED-certified, and we have made investments in all our facilities to further reduce water use. Our latest conservation measures include a waste-water recovery project expected to save annually 25 million gallons of water. We supported the recent water bond to improve infrastructure and protect and restore watersheds and ecosystems and we believe that California’s new groundwater management legislation is a step in the right direction. This legislation takes an important step forward; however, we must be diligent in its implementation and pursue timely improvements in both measurement and oversight to ensure the sustainability of California’s groundwater basins.      Advertisement      Which still raises the question, how should bottled water be viewed among conversations around the use of California’s water resources?      Whether from the bottle or the tap, using water for human hydration is one of its highest uses. There is a real need to have the right water at the right time at the right place.      The reality is demand for bottled water is higher than it has ever been, in large measure because people are looking for healthier alternatives to juices, soft drinks and in some cases, beer and wine. On top of that, the production of these beverages requires two to eight times as much water as bottled water, and that does not include the additional water necessary to grow the ingredients in those products.      As a company with a California heritage of more than 100 years, we understand that what we do matters; we care about the impact and contribution we make. We are committed to being a good steward of water resources and engaging in a thoughtful dialogue on the role of water in California’s unparalleled environment and economy.      Tim Brown is chairman, president and CEO of Nestlé Waters North America. ||||| California is in the third year of what may be the worst drought in 400 years, and its citizens are being fined for wasting water on their own lawns. Meanwhile, Nestlé, which owns a bottling plant on the reservation of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, is pulling undisclosed amounts of water from the ground -- and they're doing it legally.      Nestlé is exempt from local water agencies, so they don't need to reveal how much water they're taking. But the water agency estimates that they're taking an average of 244 million gallons of water a year. This water is purified and sold as bottled water under the Nestlé Pure Life label.      With the scarcity of water as it is, Nestlé should show more compassion for poor communities. They are significantly contributing to the area's water shortage. The water they pumped last year alone would have been enough to supply 400 homes. Clean water should be a basic right, not a priviledge afforded to the wealthy! Please sign the petition to urge Nestlé to stop stealing water from California's poorest communities! ||||| Join KPCC's AirTalk with host Larry Mantle weekdays for lively and in-depth discussions of city news, politics, science, the arts, entertainment, and more. Call-in number: 866-893-5722      “Absolutely not. In fact, if I could increase it, I would.”      This was the answer Nestlé Waters North America CEO Tim Brown gave when Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, asked him whether he would ever consider moving his company's bottling operations out of California during an interview on Wednesday with Larry Mantle on AirTalk.      "If I stop bottling water tomorrow," said Brown, "people would buy another brand of bottled water. As the second largest bottler in the state, we’re filling a role many others aren’t filling. It’s driven by consumer demand, it’s driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate. Frankly, we’re very happy [consumers] are doing it in a healthier way.”      As the Golden State wheezes its way through a historic drought, criticism for bottled water companies operating factories here has been harsh. Just over a week after a Mother Jones investigation, Starbucks announced that it would be moving bottling operations for its Ethos Water brand from California to Pennsylvania because of severe drought conditions. A day before the Mother Jones story broke, Brown wrote an op-ed in the San Bernardino Sun on why the bottled water industry isn't contributing to the drought.      On Tuesday, Nestlé said that it is investing $7 million on technology and upgrades that would turn its Modesto milk factory into a “zero water” by extracting water from the milk production process and using it in factory operations.      “We have these cooling towers [for milk] that use water,” says Brown. “Previously, that would have been fresh water that we would’ve drawn out of the municipal supply. Now, we can use our own water that had come previously from the milk. That water, normally, would’ve gone into the waste stream. Now it can be reused or recycled.”      Brown says Nestlé outfitted its factory in Jalisco, Mexico with the "zero water" technology last year and doing so at the Modesto factory will save almost 63 million gallons of water annually. He added that they've found another 26 million gallons they could save a year at Nestlé USA plants in Bakersfield and Tulare.      "That's adaptation," says Brown. "Regardless of whether we were in the bottled water business or not, we would need to be doing things like this to operate in a water-scarce environment."      Famiglietti, who teaches Earth system science at UC Irvine in addition to being NASA JPL's top water scientist, says Nestlé has a strong reputation when it comes to environmental stewardship. But he says bottling water still takes 30 to 50 percent more water than turning on the tap, and he's concerned companies like Nestlé or Starbucks might be using and bottling thousands of acre-feet of water in California.      Famiglietti warns that while it may not seem like much, it's more than a drop in the bucket.      “An acre-foot [nearly 326,000 gallons] is enough water to supply an entire family for a year. So, in this time when we’re being asked to flush our toilets less and less, we have to ask the question: Is this really an environmentally, ethically correct thing to be doing right now?”      Still, Nestlé’s Brown says being water-conscious extends far beyond the bottled water industry.      “Everybody in every facet of water in California has to find better design, better use, better ways to be more efficient. We have to look at design and how we touch water in a water scarce environment. There’s been 17 droughts in the last 48 years. We’re in this one, there will be more, and we all have to look at how water is going to move throughout the state.”      The upgrades to Nestlé's Modesto plant are expected to be finished by the end of 2016. Nestlé Waters North America has five bottled water facilities in the state of California, and its brands include Arrowhead, Pure Life, Poland Spring, and Deer Park.      Meanwhile, as the drought here in California trickles on, Famiglietti suggests that the greater problem lies not in the bottled water industry or even in the drought.      “I think that we also have, with the greater water crisis here that we face in California, a human behavior problem. We need to change our behavior with respect to water and our understanding of how much water we actually have available to us, not only in California, but around the country.”      Guests:      Jay Famiglietti, hydrologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a professor of Earth System Science at UC Irvine      Tim Brown, CEO of Nestlé Waters North America ||||| Nestlé boss says he wants to bottle more water in California despite drought      The boss of Nestlé Waters has said the company wants to increase the amount of water it bottles in California despite a devastating drought across the state that has triggered demonstrations at the corporation’s bottling plant.            Tim Brown, chief executive of Nestlé Waters North America, said the company would “absolutely not” stop bottling in California and would actually like to “increase” the amount of ground source water it uses.            Asked in a local radio interview if Nestlé would consider following Starbucks’ lead and stop bottling water in California during the drought, Brown said: “Absolutely not. In fact, if I could increase it, I would.            “The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water,” Brown said in a discussion with a Nasa hydrologist on 89.3 KPCC radio. “People need to hydrate. As the second largest bottler in the state, we’re filling a role many others are filling. It’s driven by consumer demand, it’s driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate. Frankly, we’re very happy they are doing it in a healthier way.”      Brown admitted that Nestlé currently wastes about 30% of the 700m gallons of water a year it draws from the ground in California. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to reduce water waste at its bottling plants in Bakersfield and Tulare by 12%.            More than 82,000 people have signed a petition calling on Nestlé to stop bottling from a spring in southern California, and protesters armed with plastic pitchforks have blocked the entrance to a Nestlé plant in Sacramento.            Despite the protests, Brown said: “We feel good about what we’re doing delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California.”            Starbucks has announced plans to stop sourcing its bottled water from California after embarrassing revelations that its “water conservation” Ethos brand bottled water was sourced from the drought-stricken state.            “It seems hard to imagine, but more than 1bn people on our planet can’t get clean water to drink,” Starbucks says on its website. “Ethos® Water was created to help raise awareness about this terrible crisis and provide children with access to clean water.” Five cents from the sale of each Ethos bottle, which costs about $2, goes towards Starbucks’ Ethos Water Fund supporting water, sanitation and hygiene education programs across the world.            The company said it would move Ethos production to Pennsylvania for the duration of the drought. “We are committed to our mission to be a globally responsible company and to support the people of the state of California as they face this unprecedented drought,” John Kelly, Starbucks’ senior vice-president of global responsibility and public policy, said last week.      Walmart, which also bottles water in California, has refused to move its production out of the state. “The drought in California is very concerning for many of our customers and our associates,” a spokesman said. “We share those concerns and are tracking it closely. Our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We have and continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers who count on us across California.”            Sustainability charity Food & Water Watch has called for a moratorium on all water bottling across the state. “It’s the worst drought we’ve seen in a long time, and it’s irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that’s supposed to be a public resource,” a spokesman said. “We’re calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.”       ||||| WASHINGTON, DC and VEVEY, CH – May 12, 2015 – Nestlé is investing in innovative technology to help reduce the amount of water it uses in California at the five water bottling plants and four facilities where food or petcare products are manufactured.      “Technology we have already deployed successfully elsewhere in the world to help address the challenges of water scarcity will improve our water use efficiency, relieving pressure on California’s water resources,” says Nestlé’s Head of Operations José Lopez.      Last year in Mexico, Nestlé opened its first ‘zero water’ plant, which extracts all the water it needs from milk used to manufacture dairy products.      Work is underway to transform the Nestlé USA milk factory in the city of Modesto into a ‘zero water’ factory, meaning the plant will not use any local freshwater resources for its operations.      The project should save nearly 63 million gallons (238,000 cubic meters) of water each year, equivalent to 71% of absolute withdrawals in 2014.      Around $7 million has been invested in the project which is due to be completed by the end of 2016.      At the Nestlé USA factories in Bakersfield and Tulare savings of more than 26 million gallons (100,000 cubic meters) of water each year have been identified, potentially reducing the plants’ absolute annual withdrawals by 12% compared to 2014 levels.      And planned investments this year in conservation measures to reduce the amount of water used in Nestlé Waters’ bottling plants in California are projected to save 55 million gallons of water (208,000 cubic meters) a year, a reduction of nearly 8% compared to 2014 levels.      Further measures to reduce potential water wastage at these plants are under consideration, and as these are identified there will be further updates.      Technological solutions      Nestlé uses a phased approach to reduce water in its factories.      First, engineers look for ways to optimize the processes.      Second, they look for opportunities to reuse the water, for example using cooling water in vacuum systems.      In the third phase, such as in the zero-water factory, they deploy innovative methods to extract water from raw materials and then recycle it.      In California Nestlé will apply a methodology called ‘Water Target Setting’ which not only identifies opportunities to reduce water usage but also the most appropriate technology to be implemented.      This approach has been used in more than 80 factories worldwide, identifying opportunities to reduce water usage by 10%-30% depending on the location.      For example at a Nestlé factory in the UK an anaerobic digestion system which converts solid and liquid sewage waste into clean water and natural gas has reduced the plant’s water footprint while at the same time cutting the amount of greenhouse gases emitted, and reducing solid waste significantly.      Going further      Nestlé is carrying out assessments of its facilities in California as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational performance and the impact of its plants on the watersheds in which they operate.      The state of California uses nearly 50 billion cubic metres (13 trillion gallons) of water a year, of which Nestlé’s nine plants use less than 4 million cubic metres (1 billion gallons).      “Our water bottling operations in California have come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks,” says Mr Lopez.      “We are focused on how to adapt our bottling and our manufacturing operations, and our supply chain, to make them more resilient and more resistant to drought conditions,” he says. “We will test innovative solutions, prove they are efficient and effective and will share what we learn with others.”      The World Resources Institute is helping Nestlé to better understand water risks to the company’s food and bottled water manufacturing operations in their localities and to identify water stewardship opportunities.      Work is also underway to implement the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) international standard in each of Nestlé’s nine California factories, within two years.      The standard is a set of rigorous criteria for how water should be managed in a way that is environmentally, socially, and economically beneficial.      These efforts represent Nestlé’s long term commitment to the state of California.      Water use reduction targets      Globally, Nestlé has already cut its total water withdrawal in absolute terms by almost one-third over the past 10 years, and has publicly committed to do more.      It aims to reduce its withdrawal per tonne of product by 40% by 2015, compared to 2005.      It currently has 376 water-saving projects underway in its factories worldwide, which are projected to save around 1.84 million cubic metres of water this year.

In fact, despite demonstrations and a slew of online petitions (like this, this, and this) aimed at getting Nestlé to stop what it's doing, the company would, in a perfect world, boost the 700 million gallons of water it now uses. "If I could increase it, I would," says Tim Brown, who heads Nestlé Waters North America, in an interview with radio station KPCC. "The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water. We feel good about what we're doing, delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California," he said, per the Guardian. (In the same interview, NASA JPL's top water scientist points out that bottling water requires as much as 50% more water than turning on the tap.) Brown says Nestlé wastes some 30% of the groundwater it draws from the state, but the company this week announced plans to cut that figure by 12% at its Bakersfield and Tulare bottling facilities—two of five in the state—for a savings of 26 million gallons. That isn't nearly enough to help combat "the worst drought we've seen in a long time," says charity Food & Water Watch. "It's irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that's supposed to be a public resource," a rep says. "We're calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit." In an editorial for the San Bernardino County Sun in late April, Brown argued that "bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought" and noted that the 700 million gallons Nestlé uses "is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses." (Another big company is similarly under fire.)
summarize: Suspect in Starbucks robbery may sue man who stopped him      A man credited with stopping a robbery of a Starbucks in July might now be sued by the suspect, over wounds the would-be robber received from the Good Samaritan.      Ryan Flores, 30, is facing charges for second-degree robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, stemming from a robbery of a Fresno Starbucks. Flores was arrested after he allegedly tried to rob a barista with a fake gun and wearing a Transformers mask — and in the process, he was subdued by a customer and stabbed with his own knife.      Cregg Jerri, 58, was that customer, and he intervened in the attempted robbery by hitting Flores with a chair from behind. Flores pulled out a knife and fought back, with the two men wrestling over the weapon. Jerri sustained a stab wound to the neck, but was able to take the knife away, and stab Flores an apparent 17 times during the fight.

Image 1 of / 29 Caption Close Suspect in Starbucks robbery may sue man who stopped him 1 / 29 Back to Gallery      Flores's mother, Pamela Chimienti, described Jerri's actions as "excessive force" and told KSEE that Flores planned to file a lawsuit.      "The guy, in my opinion, went from a Good Samaritan to a vigilante," Chimienti told the broadcast news station. "Stabbing somebody that many times, it doesn't take that many stab wounds to get somebody to succumb to you."      Video of the robbery later went viral and showed the encounter between Jerri and Flores, and the fight that resulted in injuries for both men.      Flores's father, Mark Flores, told the Fresno Bee, "I understand he (Ryan Flores) robbed the store but (Jerri) stabbed my son 17 times."      Ryan Flores, currently in Fresno County Jail, did not directly confirm or deny the lawsuit, and instead told the newspaper that he's taking things "one step at a time."      "I don't like to judge people," Flores said, "but that's a lot of stab wounds."      Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer, who initially praised Jerri's actions in thwarting the robbery, reportedly called the idea of Jerri being sued "ludicrous." Legal analysts commenting on the case expressed doubt that the lawsuit would go anywhere, saying that "unreasonable malice" would be difficult to prove. ||||| The alleged bandit who wound up with 17 stab wounds after his attempt to rob a Fresno Starbucks was interrupted by a customer thinks the citizen went overboard in thwarting the robbery, but lawyers say those allegations would be a tough sell to a jury.      Ryan Michael Flores, 30, readily admitted in a jailhouse interview that he was wrong to pull a fake gun and then a knife while masked during the July 21 robbery gone bad at the coffee shop near Herndon Avenue and Highway 99.      But Flores says he was simply trying to get away after Cregg Jerri, 58, smacked him over the head with a chair. As the fight went to the floor, Jerri managed to get control of Flores’ knife and the younger man was stabbed repeatedly. Jerri was also seriously injured – slashed in the neck, and he received six staples after the confrontation.      Flores is charged with second-degree robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. He remains in Fresno County Jail.      SIGN UP      Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP!      In a news conference, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer praised Jerri as a hero who stepped up to stop the crime. No one else in the Starbucks at that moment was hurt.      But Flores’ parents, Pamela Chimenti and Mark Flores, say Jerri’s actions were a clear case of excessive force, that Flores nearly died in the emergency room, and that Jerri should be charged with committing a more serious offense than their son.      However, Ty Kharazi, an attorney called on to represent Jerri, as well as Fresno attorney William Schmidt, who works on excessive-force cases, say the chances of Jerri facing penalties are slim. Jerri could not be reached for comment.      Differing views      Chimenti said her son nearly died twice while in intensive care from stab wounds in his torso but was revived. She described the wounds he received as “kill strikes.”      “Once you have somebody down, you can’t keep stabbing them,” she said.      Said Mark Flores:      “I understand he (Ryan Flores) robbed the store but (Jerri) stabbed my son 17 times.”      Mark Flores believes Judge Wayne Ellison supported his view that Jerri used too much force in stopping the crime because during an August court hearing, Ellison advised Jerri to “get a lawyer.” But Kharazi says Mark Flores misunderstood Ellison’s intent, which was to ensure Jerri’s interests were protected.      “The judge was trying to watch out for” Jerri, said Kharazi.      Added Kharazi: “He (Flores) pulled a gun, the (cashier) starts laughing at him. The he pulls a knife and (Jerri) was hitting him with the chair. (Flores) turns and stabs Jerri … My client is a good Samaritan.”      Schmidt said a bystander “does have the right to use lethal force in self-defense, or the defense of others.      “However, there is no blanket liability,” added Schmidt, who said anyone considering legal action against such a bystander would have to show that person displayed “unreasonable malice” in his actions. Schmidt agreed establishing that in court would be an uphill climb.      In the jail interview, Flores was more ambivalent about seeking legal recourse for his injuries.      “I’m taking it one step at a time.” he said. “I don’t like to judge people, but that’s a lot of stab wounds.”      Flores is resigned to remaining behind bars for some time in the attempted robbery. He said a lung wound and a facial injury sustained in the fight linger, but he has largely recovered.      Flores said he was something of a celebrity at the jail because video of the Starbucks fight went viral on social media.      “It was on Worldstarhiphop,” said Flores, who wore a Transformers Optimus Prime mask during the botched heist.      “Everybody in here knows me,” he added somewhat ruefully. “There are a lot of jokes.”      ‘No money and bills’      Flores said he has never been in jail before and that a dependence on drugs, which began when he was prescribed opioids following a motorcycle crash, contributed to his robbery attempt.      The day of the robbery, he said he was high on methadone as well as a Xanax derivative and alcohol (Xanax is used to treat anxiety and panic disorders). He was short of cash for his wife and 2 ½-year-old son when he grabbed the fake gun and jumped into his pickup. As usual, he was carrying the knife.      “I was stressed. No money and bills,” he said.      He drove around aimlessly for about 30 minutes before winding up at the Highway 99 and Herndon intersection, where he first thought of robbing a 76 gas station. But he didn’t want to take money from the owner of the business. Then his thoughts turned to the Starbucks, which he reasoned was part of a corporation and therefore no one would personally suffer a loss.      “It was pretty spontaneous.”      A video of the incident shows Jerri seated at a table reading from a tablet as Flores enters and makes demands. Then Jerri jumps up, grabs a chair and slams it on Flores. A fight ensues and Flores stabs Jerri in the neck. Jerri gets hold of Flores’ knife and stabs him.      Flores denies intentionally stabbing Jerri, and says it happened when his hand flew back in the scuffle.      Then, he lost control of his knife.      “He just started stabbing me,” said Flores, who says he remembers saying, “I have a son, please stop.”      Flores remembers getting back in his truck and driving to Fruit and Ashlan avenues, where citizens spotted the bloody man and called police. He woke up in Community Regional Medical Center. Police interviewed him in the hospital and booked him for the robbery. He was taken to jail a few days later.      Flores said it would be unfair for him to face additional time for causing great bodily harm because all that was on his mind during the fight was escape.      “I’m willing to do a year, a year and a half,” he said. “But not two or four years.” |||||	– A California man who tried to rob a Starbucks armed with a knife and a fake gun is now planning to sue the man who stopped him, according to his parents. Ryan Flores, 30, was stabbed repeatedly with his own knife in a fight with customer Cregg Jerri, 58, who hit him in the back with a chair as he threatened a barista in the attempted robbery in Fresno, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. "The guy, in my opinion, went from a Good Samaritan to a vigilante," Flores' mother, Pamela Chimienti, tells KSEE. "Stabbing somebody that many times, it doesn't take that many stab wounds to get somebody to succumb to you." She says her son had 17 stab wounds, lacerations, and defensive wounds. Jerri was slashed in the neck before getting the knife away from Flores and needed six stitches. Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer says Jerri was not charged in connection with the incident and the idea of suing him for allegedly using excessive force is "ludicrous." Flores, who wore a Transformers mask during the attempted robbery, was charged with second-degree robbery and assault with a deadly weapon and has been in jail since the July incident. "I'm taking it one step at a time," he tells the Fresno Bee. "I don't like to judge people, but that’s a lot of stab wounds." (Earlier this month, a Taco Bell worker in Cleveland fatally shot an armed robber.)
summarize: Anthony Diaz, 13, died after he was shot on Chicago's Northwest Side. His family said it all started with a Facebook post.Family members said Diaz and his two older sisters, ages 15 and 17, snuck out of their home in Chicago's Belmont Cragin neighborhood around 10:30 p.m. Sunday. They said he went to back them up in a fight with some other girls over disrespectful comments made over a neighborhood gang."She was dissing our gang. We came, we fought. They just got out of hand. They jumped all of us and they ended up shooting my brother," Jennifer Sosa said.Police said the 13-year-old boy was walking in a group near the intersection of West Grand Avenue and North McVicker Avenue when someone opened fire, wounding Diaz in the chest.The victim's stepfather, Ralph Otero, got a call from the boy's sister, saying Diaz had been shot. The boy was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he later died."He had good grades. He never gave us any headaches. He was not a troubled kid," Otero said of his stepson, a Burbank Elementary student."He was a handsome kid. Very smart. I love him with all my heart, I don't know what I'm going to do without him," said Laura Otero, the victim's mother.Ortero says the Department of Children and Family Services took three of the family's teenage girls away Monday morning."For their safety, they did it for their safety," Otero said. "We agreed as parents trying to look out for their safety."Otero said the family just moved to the neighborhood in November from an area near North Kostner Avenue and West Armitage Avenue so they could live a safer life. Diaz's sister told ABC7 Eyewitness News that the fight just wasn't worth it."I'm speaking on behalf of Anthony with the family's permission and Anthony wasn't gang-related," said Irma Cornier, a family friend. "Anthony was a good kid. He was an honorable kid."A principal at Burbank Elementary School said Diaz had just transferred in a few weeks ago, but described him Monday as "a pretty bright child."A vigil was held Monday night at the corner of Grand and McVicker where Diaz lost his life. The family is urging the shooter to surrender to police."If you have the guts to do this, you should have the guts to face the consequences," Ralph Otero said.Police are investigating what started the fight. They said the boy recorded the altercation on his cell phone, but it's unclear what that recording shows. No one is in custody.Diaz's family is now offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. ||||| Anthony Diaz told his stepfather he wouldn’t be long as he followed his older sisters down the block for a confrontation fueled by Facebook postings. By the time a worried Ralph Otero woke his wife, the 13-year-old boy lay dying on the street, shot several times by a gunman who stood over him and kept firing, according to police and family.      “It would never cross your mind that something like this would happen,” Otero said at his home in the 2100 block of North McVicker Avenue on the Northwest Side. “... We don’t really know what happened.”      Anthony’s sisters, 16 and 17 years old, had left the house about 10 p.m. Sunday to meet girls the older sister had been feuding with on Facebook, Otero said. Anthony chased after them.      The young teen was using his cellphone to record fighting when someone shot him, Chicago police said. Otero said Anthony’s two older sisters witnessed the slaying and told police that the gunman stood over Anthony after the first round and fired a few more times. Police said the boy was shot several times at close range.      Back at the house, Otero said he was nervous about the kids leaving the house and woke up their mother. “I said, ‘Look, they’re going in and out, I don’t know what’s going on. But I don’t like the idea of them stepping out that late,’” he said. As the mother was getting up, one of the daughters called with the news.      “(Anthony’s mother) was telling me, ‘They shot Anthony, they’re telling me they shot Anthony.’ So when I got there, he was already laying on the ground,” Otero said. “And the paramedics were working on him.      “When I got there,” Otero added, “I knew it would be bad. ... They said they shot him over seven or eight times. They came right next to him, and I guess when he fell, they came and kept on shooting.”      Laura DeDomenico and Ralph Otero, parents of slain Chicago teen Anthony Diaz, attend a vigil at the spot where he was killed and ask the shooter to surrender to police.

(Terrence Antonio James, Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS      Police, who said the shooting occurred at 6000 W. Grand Ave., found at least four shell casings in the snow near Anthony’s body. Officers also found the boy’s phone and were able to access its videos, police said.      Anthony was pronounced dead around 11:30 p.m. at Mount Sinai Hospital, authorities said.      Police were interviewing witnesses Monday, including Anthony’s family.      “I loved him with all my heart,” the boy’s mother, Laura DeDomenico, told reporters. “I don’t know what I’ll do without him.      “The rest of my life, until I die, I will cry,” she added. “A part of my heart is missing.”      Otero said the family had just moved out of what he considered a dangerous neighborhood at Kostner and Armitage avenues.      “We just moved there in November,” he said. “Better area, better area for the kids and better atmosphere.”      Anthony was one of six children and attended Burbank Elementary School. He loved sports, and Otero said he and Anthony had watched the Bulls game earlier Sunday.      “He liked basketball. He was athletic,” Otero said. “He had good grades. He would give us a headache here and there but not as much as the troubled kids. He was not a troubled kid.      “I don’t know what to say. I’m a preacher. I always tell them, I always pray for them, I always. ... But hey, if they don’t want to follow you, you can’t make them follow you. I don’t force nobody into nothing.”      Anthony was known as a quiet and obedient boy.      “He was a great kid,” said Rosemary Rodriguez, a close family friend. “He was a good boy. He came from a good family. His mother is very hardworking. He loved basketball and never did nothing to bother anybody.”      After the shooting, three children were removed from the home and placed with relatives under a safety monitor plan, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Children and Family Services.      The family is now being investigated for allegations of neglect.      In the meantime, Anthony's family is planning his funeral and a memorial vigil, said Elvin Guzman, pastor at Tabernacle of Faith and Victory Church in Humboldt Park, where the family attends.      “It is not easy for them,” he said. “They’ve lost a young son, and it is not nice.”      Guzman said this is not the first time Anthony’s older sisters have gotten into altercations that started over Facebook. But Anthony, he said, was an innocent victim who was just following after his older siblings.      Earlier Sunday, a 20-year-old man was shot about 5:58 p.m. in the 3400 block of West 28th Street in the Little Village neighborhood on the Southwest Side, according to Chicago Police Department News Affairs Officer Ana Pacheco. The man was walking there when an offender came out of an alley and fired shots. The victim sustained a gunshot wound to the arm and a graze wound to the stomach, police said, and was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, where his condition was stabilized.      A man, 20, was shot about 3:55 p.m. Sunday in the 4600 block of West Harrison Street in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in good condition with an arm wound, police said. Additional details about that shooting weren't available.      A 22-year-old man accidentally shot himself about 3:40 p.m. Sunday in the 8900 block of South Morgan Street in the Gresham neighborhood. He suffered a leg wound and was taken to Little Company of Mary Hospital in good condition, police said. ||||| A 13-year-old Chicago boy who was shot to death Sunday night had sneaked out of his home with his sisters to confront someone over posts on Facebook, according to a family member. NBC Chicago's Katie Kim reports. (Published Monday, Feb. 9, 2015)      A 13-year-old Chicago boy who was shot to death Sunday night had sneaked out of his home with his sisters to confront someone over posts on Facebook, according to a family member.      Anthony Diaz and two of his sisters, ages 15 and 17, left their Northwest Side home in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood at about 10:35 p.m. to confront someone over Facebook posts, said Anthony’s stepfather, Ralph Otero, 47. He said the teens got jumped and somebody pulled out a gun.      Chicago police said the boy was walking with a group in the 6000 block of West Grand Avenue when someone walked up and opened fire, striking him in the left side of his body. The bullet exited through his chest.      Otero and his wife were sleeping when they got a call from Anthony’s 17-year-old sister saying he had been shot.      "I saw him lying on the ground about a block away from our house," Otero said.      The boy was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. The Cook County medical examiner’s office could not confirm the death.      The shooting happened near the family’s home. Otero, an evangelical preacher, said they moved to the neighborhood in November from Kostner and Armitage. Anthony was one of six siblings.      "We just moved there from a bad area because it’s supposed to be better, and this is what we got," Otero said.      "He’s a good student, he’s not a gangbanger. He didn’t give us any headaches," Otero said. He said Anthony, who went to Burbank Elementary School, loved basketball and watched the Bulls game Sunday evening.      "This is unbelievable," Otero said.      No one was in custody in connection with the shooting as of midday Monday, but police said they have Diaz's cell phone, which may have video of the incident, as well as surveillance video from a nearby business.      A $1,000 reward was offered Monday for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.      Copyright SunTimes / NBC Chicago |||||	– A 13-year-old Chicago boy was shot dead after sneaking out of his Belmont Cragin home late last night with his older sisters, who reportedly were going to confront someone with whom they'd fought on Facebook, ABC7 reports. "She was dissing our gang," Jennifer Sosa, one of the sisters of slain teen Anthony Diaz, tells the station. "They jumped all of us and they ended up shooting my brother." Anthony was said by his family and police to have been taking video of the street fight on his cellphone when the shooting occurred, the Chicago Tribune reports. Cops found the phone near Anthony's body and are reviewing the videos. Anthony was shot in the left side and the bullet exited through his chest; he was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital, according to local authorities, per NBC Chicago. Anthony's preacher stepfather, Ralph Otero, tells NBC that the three teens left their home around 10:30pm. A short time later, he says the 17-year-old sister called him and his wife to tell them Anthony had been shot just a block away. Otero's response was one of disbelief. "He's a good student, he's not a gangbanger," he tells the station. "We just moved … from a bad area because it's supposed to be better, and this is what we got." Laura de Domenico, Anthony's mom, acknowledges that the younger of the two sisters (reported to be either 15 or 16) is in a gang and has been in trouble with the law before. "She always had this problem with fighting," she tells CBS Chicago. "I always tell her not to take [Anthony], because he's not streetwise at all." She adds the first thing her daughter said about Anthony's death: "I'm going to get revenge." Police reportedly have no one in custody.
summarize: A possible hidden chamber within the ancient tomb of Tutankhamun is “full of treasures,” Egypt’s tourism minister has promised.      The possibility of a hidden chamber was revealed late last year, when Egypt’s Antiques Ministry said scans of the boy king’s tomb showed evidence of another room behind two secluded doorways, and suggested the possibility of it being the resting place of Queen Nefertiti.      Egypt’s tourism minister Hisham Zaazou told Spanish newspaper ABC on a trip to Spain that there will be a press conference regarding what has been found in Tutankhamun’s tomb, adding that the discovery will be a “Big Bang”.      “We do not know if the burial chamber is Nefertiti or another woman, but it is full of treasures,” he told the newspaper. “It will be a ‘Big Bang’, the discovery of the 21st century”.      Various theories surround the possibility of the hidden chamber. British Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves first raised the belief that Queen Nefertiti, understood to be Tutankhamun’s step-mother, could be buried in a secret compartment after high resolution photos showed straight lines on the walls of the tomb.      In November, Egyptian officials said they were “90% sure” of the hidden chamber after conducting radar tests on the tomb.

It is thought that Tutenkhamun’s tomb may have originally been Queen Nefertiti’s tomb, but was converted when he died at the age of 19, before his own burial chamber had been completed. ||||| An Egyptologist has suggested hidden chambers lie behind a wall in King Tut's tomb. Forthcoming scans may reveal whether such chambers exist.      On April 2, a new series of radar scans will be performed on King Tutankhamun's tomb to search for hidden chambers that may contain an undiscovered royal burial, Egypt's antiquities ministry has announced.      The announcement comes after stories were published in numerous media outlets last week claiming that Egypt's tourism minister, Hisham Zazou, had told the Spanish news outlet ABC that the chambers had been proven to exist and contain numerous treasures.      "The Ministry of Antiquities has not issued any statement concerning the results that have been reached so far," the ministry said in a statement released to Live Science. "Further radar examinations will be performed on April 2, and a press conference will be held afterwards to announce the results of the scan." [See Photos of King Tut's Mummy & His Burial]      Last year, University of Arizona Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves published findings suggesting that there are hidden chambers behind a wall in Tutankhamun's tomb. These chambers, he believes, hold the burial of Queen Nefertiti, the wife of Akhenaten, a pharaoh who was Tutankhamun's father.      "We could be faced, for the first time in recent history, with the intact burial of an Egyptian pharaoh in the Valley of the Kings," Reeves told Live Science last year.      King Tutankhamun lived between roughly 1343 and 1323 B.C. Credit: Horemweb Wikimedia.      Scans performed by Factum Arte, a company commissioned to scan Tutankhamun's tomb, show unusual lines and abnormalities in the plaster of the tomb, Reeves said, adding that these features indicate that a wall was built over a doorway in ancient times.      Some of the artifacts in Tutankhamun's tomb were originally made for Nefertiti but were buried with Tutankhamun after the boy king's death, Reeves found.      Radar scans performed on the tomb last year suggest that a void could exist behind the wall. Egypt's former antiquities minister, Zahi Hawass, urged that the claims be viewed cautiously. He noted that the geology of the Valley of the Kings can lead radar to produce false positives showing a tomb when, in fact, there is only a natural feature.      Reeves did not immediately respond to Live Science's requests for comment on the latest developments.      Tourism disaster      Tourism has long been a major industry in Egypt. Since the revolution that toppled former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Egypt's tourism industry has struggled, archaeologists have told Live Science. The political instability over the past five years has meant that the number of visitors to Egypt has yet to return to its prerevolution levels.      Additionally, recent terrorist attacks — including the bombing of a Russian plane in the Sinai Desert, an attack carried out by the Islamic State group, or ISIS — have made it difficult for the Egyptian government to convince tourists that the country is safe to visit, according to these archaeologists.      Egyptian officials hope that, if a hidden tomb is discovered, it will spur tourists to return to Egypt, bringing badly needed revenue and jobs to the country.

Original article on Live Science. |||||	– First came the theory, then a dribble of updates: In August 2015, University of Arizona archaeologist Nicholas Reeves made the case that Tutankhamun's tomb also holds the remains of Nefertiti. Egyptian authorities had no comment at the time, but three months later, a duo of stories seemed to lend credence to the idea, at least of a hidden chamber. A "preliminary analysis indicates the presence of an area different in its temperature than the other parts of the northern wall," announced Egypt's antiquities minister; further scans that month led Egyptian officials to say they were "approximately 90%" certain a previously unknown chamber is present. Now, the next step in the process has been established. Additional radar exams will take place April 2, and the Ministry of Antiquities will hold a subsequent press conference to share the findings. That update was provided in an emailed statement to Live Science in an apparent attempt to discredit a story picked up by the media last week (see the Independent's version here) in which the country's tourism minister supposedly told Spanish media that the hidden chamber was packed with "treasures." Counters the statement, "The Ministry of Antiquities has not issued any statement concerning the results that have been reached so far."
summarize: FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that he would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrump touts report Warner attempted to talk to dossier author Poll: Nearly half of Iowans wouldn’t vote for Trump in 2020 Rubio on Warner contact with Russian lobbyist: It’s ‘had zero impact on our work’ MORE for mishandling government secrets, clearing the way for her to be crowned the Democratic Party’s nominee for president later this month.      Comey said evidence showed the former secretary of State had been “extremely careless” in handling classified emails over a private server, but that it was not enough to merit an indictment.      ADVERTISEMENT      “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” Comey told reporters in a dramatic announcement at the FBI’s headquarters in Washington.      “We are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” he added.      If Comey’s decision was not entirely surprising, the timing — coming hours before Clinton’s first joint appearance with President Obama — was a shocker.      The political world has been awaiting the FBI’s judgment of Clinton for months, wondering if a surprise indictment could block her path to the nomination and suddenly open the door to Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersTrump has declared war on our climate — we won’t let him win Stock slide bites boastful Trump, but rising wages great for GOP Millions should march on DC to defeat Trump Republicans MORE (I-Vt.) or Vice President Biden.      Instead, Comey ended the FBI’s investigation days after Clinton was interviewed by investigators at the bureau’s headquarters, and about a week after Attorney General Loretta Lynch made headlines by meeting her husband, former President Clinton, on an airport tarmac.      While the decision ends talk of an indictment, Comey gave new ammunition to Clinton critics in scathing criticism of her setup.      A total of 113 emails from Clinton’s machine contained information that was classified at the time they were sent or received, Comey said, undercutting a claim from Clinton that the messages were only upgraded after the fact. Another roughly 2,000 emails were classified later.      The FBI’s investigation also found that “a very small” number of them “bore markings indicating the presence of classified information,” wrecking her claims at ignorance about the sensitive nature of the material in her inbox.      And among the “several thousand” work-related messages recovered from the approximately 30,000 Clinton deleted in 2014, three were classified. The former first lady had said the deleted emails were purely personal in nature and didn’t belong in the government’s hands.      In what may be the one positive detail for Clinton’s presidential campaign, Comey asserted that there was no evidence to support allegations that her team had “intentionally deleted” the additional work-related messages “in an effort to conceal them.”      “Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” Comey said.      The FBI chief also said that he could not rule out the possibility that Clinton’s server had been hacked, despite failing to find any evidence of a cyber intrusion.      The bureau’s decision not to recommend charges upset Republicans, who have long said Clinton’s email arrangement jeopardized national security.

Yet the decision nonetheless seems likely to haunt Comey, a Republican whose 10-year term is not slated to end until 2023. Multiple Republicans had sung the FBI director’s praises in the weeks ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, but those warm feelings might begin to erode if they feel he succumbed to political pressure.      While declining to support an indictment on Tuesday, Comey asserted that Clinton’s email setup was nonetheless evidence of a troubling lack of concern about protecting national secrets.      Someone of the stature of Clinton or her senior aides, he said, “should have known” that the system carried security risks.      “To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences,” Comey warned. “To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.      “But that is not what we are deciding now.”      Spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the State Department would decline to consider administrative punishments for any current staffers until the Justice Department formally closes its review.      Comey’s remarks also appeared to raise the question of whether Clinton’s aides could be denied security clearances if she wins the White House this November.      “This sort of irresponsibility can directly jeopardize U.S. national security and put people’s lives at risk,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.      “I hope the irresponsible handling of classified information documented by the FBI will be considered if any of these individuals currently possesses a security clearance or applies for one in the future.”      Updated at 8:25 p.m. ||||| FBI Director James Comey said on July 5, 2016, that Hillary Clinton did send and receive classified emails during her time as secretary of state, but shouldn't be charged with criminal misconduct. (Reuters)      FBI Director James B. Comey said Tuesday that while Hillary Clinton and her staff were “extremely careless” in how they handled emails while she was secretary of state, the bureau would not recommend criminal charges. Here is a transcript of Comey’s prepared remarks released by the FBI:      Good morning. I’m here to give you an update on the FBI’s investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail system during her time as Secretary of State.      After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice.      This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Second, I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say.      I want to start by thanking the FBI employees who did remarkable work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts.      So, first, what we have done:      The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State. The referral focused on whether classified information was transmitted on that personal system.      Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.      Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with the personal e-mail server by any foreign power, or other hostile actors.      I have so far used the singular term, “e-mail server,” in describing the referral that began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on that personal domain. As new servers and equipment were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back together — to gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal e-mail was used for government work — has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of hours of effort.      For example, when one of Secretary Clinton’s original personal servers was decommissioned in 2013, the e-mail software was removed. Doing that didn’t remove the e-mail content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of e-mail fragments end up unsorted in the server’s unused — or “slack”— space. We searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could be put back together.      FBI investigators have also read all of the approximately 30,000 e-mails provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014. Where an e-mail was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the FBI referred the e-mail to any U.S. government agency that was a likely “owner” of information in the e-mail, so that agency could make a determination as to whether the e-mail contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or whether there was reason to classify the e-mail now, even if its content was not classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as “up-classifying”).      From the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.      The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. We found those additional e-mails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private e-mail domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond.      This helped us recover work-related e-mails that were not among the 30,000 produced to State. Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of e-mail fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013.      With respect to the thousands of e-mails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top Secret e-mails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been “up-classified.”      I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our assessment is that, like many e-mail users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted e-mails or e-mails were purged from the system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government account — or even a commercial account like Gmail — there was no archiving at all of her e-mails, so it is not surprising that we discovered e-mails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when she produced the 30,000 e-mails to the State Department.      It could also be that some of the additional work-related e-mails we recovered were among those deleted as “personal” by Secretary Clinton’s lawyers when they reviewed and sorted her e-mails for production in 2014.      The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not individually read the content of all of her e-mails, as we did for those available to us; instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related e-mails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total e-mails remaining on Secretary Clinton’s personal system in 2014. It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related e-mails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server.      It is also likely that there are other work-related e-mails that they did not produce to State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they deleted all e-mails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery.      We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort.      And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of Secretary Clinton’s personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded on e-mail, to those involved in the e-mail production to State, and finally, Secretary Clinton herself.      Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal e-mail operation.      That’s what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found:      Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.      For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later “up-classified” e-mails).      None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government — or even with a commercial service like Gmail.      Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked “classified” in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.      While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government.      With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account.      So that’s what we found. Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice:      In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.      Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.      In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.      To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.      As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.      I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.      I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation— including people in government — but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.

James Comey did criticize Clinton and her staff for being "extremely careless." but he said no "reasonable prosecutor" would bring charges. Comey also stressed that the Department of Justice would have the final say on the matter. As the New York Times notes, Attorney General Loretta Lynch—who had controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last week—already has said she would defer to the recommendation of the FBI and her own department's investigators. The FBI reviewed more than 30,000 Clinton emails and identified 110 in 52 email chains that had information deemed classified at the time the emails were sent; of those, eight contained "top secret" information, said Comey, per the Washington Post. In previous cases that resulted in criminal charges, investigators found evidence of "clearly intentional and willful" mishandling of information, and "we do not see those things here," said Comey, per the Hill. “Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” he said. Donald Trump was quick to pounce: "The system is rigged," he tweeted. "General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment." In another, he wrote that "Crooked Hillary" escaped charges despite compromising national security. "Wow!"
summarize: Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended tighter controls on how doctors prescribe the most commonly used narcotic painkillers, changes that are expected to take place as early as next year.                              The move, which represents a major policy shift, follows a decade-long debate over whether the widely abused drugs, which contain the narcotic hydrocodone, should be controlled as tightly as more powerful painkillers like OxyContin.      The drugs at issue contain a combination of hydrocodone and an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen or aspirin and are sold either as generics or under brand names like Vicodin or Lortab. Doctors use the medications to treat pain from injuries, arthritis, dental extractions and other problems.      The change would reduce the number of refills patients could get before going back to see their doctor. Patients would also be required to take a prescription to a pharmacy, rather than have a doctor call it in.      Prescription drugs account for about three-quarters of all drug overdose deaths in the United States, with the number of deaths from narcotic painkillers, or opioids, quadrupling since 1999, according to federal data. Drugs containing hydrocodone represent a huge share — about 70 percent — of all opioid prescriptions, and the looser rules governing them, some experts say, have contributed to their abuse.      Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said she expected the new regulations to go into effect in 2014. The recommendation requires the approval of the Department of Health and Human Services and adoption by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which has long pushed for the measure.      For years, F.D.A. officials had rejected recommendations from the D.E.A. and others for stronger prescribing controls on the drugs, saying the action would create undue hardships for patients. A number of doctors’ groups, including the American Medical Association and pharmacy organizations, have continued to fight the measure, citing the impact on patients.      In a telephone interview, Dr. Woodcock said that F.D.A. officials were aware that changing the prescribing rules would affect patients. She said, however, that the impact on public health caused by the abuse of the drugs as well as their medical use had reached a tipping point.      “These are very difficult trade-offs that our society has to make,” she said. “The reason we approve these drugs is for people in pain. But we can’t ignore the epidemic on the other side.”      The new regulations would reduce by half, to 90 days, the supply of the drug a patient could obtain without a new prescription.      Currently, a patient can refill a prescription for such drugs five times over a six-month period before needing a new prescription. Federal data suggest that most patients take such medications for only 14 days, creating the potential for excess pills to be sold or to be taken out of medicine chests by curious teenagers and others.      The F.D.A. recommendation is likely to have a significant impact on the availability of the drugs, as well as on how pharmacies operate and even the types of medical professionals who can prescribe the medications.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In 2011, about 131 million prescriptions for hydrocodone-containing medications were written for about 47 million patients, according to government estimates. That amounts to about five billion pills.      Technically, the change involves the reclassification of hydrocodone-containing painkillers as Schedule II medications from their current classification as Schedule III drugs. The scheduling system, which is overseen by the Drug Enforcement Administration, classifies drugs based on their medical use and their potential for abuse and addiction.      Schedule II drugs are those drugs with the highest potential for abuse that can be legally prescribed. They include painkillers like oxycodone — the active ingredient in OxyContin — methadone and fentanyl, as well as Adderall and Ritalin, which are prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.      In recent years, the question of whether to tighten prescribing controls over hydrocodone-containing drugs has been the subject of intense lobbying.      Last year, for example, lobbyists for druggists and chain pharmacies mobilized to derail a measure passed in the Senate that would mandate the types of restrictions that the F.D.A. is now recommending.      At the time, the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society said that making patients see doctors more often to get prescriptions would impose added burdens and costs on them.      Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, expressed dismay when the proposal died in the House of Representatives.      “They got their victory — but not at my expense,” said Mr. Manchin, whose state has been hard hit by prescription drug abuse. “The people who will pay the price are the young boys and girls in communities across this nation.”      Dr. Woodcock, of the F.D.A., said that requiring patients with long-lasting pain to see a doctor after three months, rather than six, for a new prescription could benefit them. “If you are needing chronic therapy of this magnitude,” she said, “you should be seeing your prescriber.”      A D.E.A. spokeswoman, Barbara Carreno, said that agency officials would not comment on the agency’s recommendation.      One of the trade groups that opposed the change, the National Community Pharmacists Association, said in a statement on Thursday that the move would “likely pose significant hardships for many patients and delay relief for vulnerable patients with legitimate chronic pain.”      Penney Cowan, the executive director of the American Chronic Pain Association, an advocacy group, said she believed that drugs like Vicodin should be only one part of a treatment program for patients with long-term pain. But she added that the new rules could make it harder for some patients to find doctors to prescribe the drugs or pharmacies to fill the prescriptions.      “We are hearing from more and more people having difficulty finding access to care,” Ms. Cowan said.      Earlier this year, an expert advisory panel to the F.D.A. voted 19 to 10 in favor of reclassifying hydrocodone-containing painkillers as Schedule II drugs. While such recommendations are not binding, the agency often follows them.      Along with changing how doctors prescribe these drugs, the classification change would also impose added storage and record-keeping requirements on druggists. In some states, nurse practitioners and other health care professionals who can currently prescribe hydrocodone-containing drugs may no longer be able to do so. ||||| WASHINGTON |      WASHINGTON Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended tighter restrictions on products that contain hydrocodone, an opioid painkiller present in commonly prescribed, potentially addictive drugs such as Vicodin.      Until now, Vicodin and other products that contain less than 15 milligrams of hydrocodone have been classified as Schedule III controlled substances. The FDA recommends reclassifying them more restrictively -- potentially as Schedule II products, in line with opioid pain-killers such as oxycodone and morphine.      Reclassifying the products would make them harder to obtain, both by addicts and by legitimate pain patients. Physicians are not allowed to call in a prescription for a Schedule II product to a pharmacy. Instead, patients must present a written prescription.      In addition, patients would not be allowed as many refills before returning to see their doctors, potentially representing a hardship for patients in chronic pain.      The proposed change was urged by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which is battling a rising tide of prescription drug abuse. The change must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services and the DEA, which will make a final scheduling decision.      Opponents of the rule change, including many physicians, have argued for years that restricting pain products further could cause hardship to pain patients, especially the elderly.      Proponents argue that the death toll from abuse is unacceptably high.      Nearly three of four prescription drug overdoses are caused by opioid pain-killers, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      Regulators are trying to tackle the problem from a variety of angles. In an attempt to restrict supply, the DEA has been putting pressure on wholesale suppliers of prescription drugs to police their customers better.      Several companies, including Pfizer Inc and Endo Health Solutions, have been working to develop tamper resistant opioids that cannot be easily crushed or dissolved by addicts looking to get a full dose of the drug quickly.      The misuse of prescription pain-killers was responsible for more than 475,000 emergency department visits in 2009, a number that nearly doubled in just five years, according to the CDC.      In January a panel of outside medical experts voted 19 to 10 to reclassify the products. The vote followed two days of discussions.      Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's pharmaceuticals division, said in a statement that the agency has, over the past few years, been "challenged with determining how to balance the need to ensure continued access to those patients who rely on continuous pain relief while addressing the ongoing concerns about abuse and misuse."      In the end, she said, the level of opioid abuse and the "tremendous amount of public interest" in the matter led the agency to recommend a change. |||||	– It will likely be tougher for people to get their hands on Vicodin and similar painkillers next year. The FDA today recommended tougher restrictions for drugs made with hydrocodone, reports Reuters. Assuming the guidelines are approved by the department of Health and Human Services, patients would get fewer refills, and doctors no longer would be able to phone in prescriptions to a pharmacy. Instead, patients would need to present a written prescription. The New York Times calls the move a "major policy shift" because it would put the narcotic painkillers in the same class as more powerful ones such as OxyContin, which has oxycodone as its main ingredient. The DEA has long pushed for the move, citing growing abuse of the hydrocodone drugs, but groups including the American Medical Association have been leery of making it harder for patients in need to get relief.
summarize: Please enable Javascript to watch this video      LAYTON, Utah -- The owners of a Layton Subway that received international attention after an employee was accused of putting drugs in a Layton police officer's drink are suing for defamation.      Kristin Myers and Dallas Buttars are the franchise owners, and they're being represented by attorney Robert Sykes in the suit filed Tuesday.      "My life has been changed forever," Myers said. "It will never be the same."      The owners say the ordeal has cost them $17,000 in business.      "I've been told by several people that the only way we’re ever going to recover is we’re going to have to move our location because it's always going to be known as the store that drugged the cop," Myers said.      The officer, who hasn't been publicly identified, bought a drink at the Subway drive-thru last August and began to feel sick. He told his fellow officers and Layton Police responded.      They brought in their K9s to search the store and the car of the employee who served the drink, but they found nothing. Surveillance video showed no wrongdoing, and urine tests of the officer that night came back negative for drugs.      "They knew they hadn’t found a single trace of drugs or illegal substances or any admissions," Sykes said of the case. "They had denials from everybody. They had zero evidence. Zero evidence."      Sykes says the police relied on an ion scanner test, which indicated traces of meth and THC, but it's a test known for false positives and it is inadmissible in court. With that test in hand, Layton Police arrested the employee and started doing interviews with the media.      "It's hard to get your reputation back once its been stolen from you," Sykes said of the damage done by the allegations.      Layton City Attorney, Gary Crane, says that he stands by the officers and how they handled what transpired afterwards. He says he finds the lawsuit surprising because the officers have a cordial relationship with the business.      However, Sykes says when he told Layton about this pending lawsuit, their response was inadequate.      "Let's make this a win-win situation: We’ll agree to let them cater our Christmas party and some of our parties and bring their sandwiches," Sykes said of the city's response.      Buttars has lived in Layton for 29 years, but he says he doesn't feel safe there anymore, knowing he has to rely on the Layton Police Department to protect him.      "I now fear that I have to live with the fact that the Layton Police Department and Layton City officials feel that I did them wrong. I will never ever be able to call on them if I needed help" Buttars said.      The 18-year-old employee who was arrested, was never charged. He's not part of this lawsuit and all Sykes would say about that is that the matter was honorably resolved for him. ||||| The owner of a Subway franchisee is accusing her local police department of destroying her business and reputation by knowingly making false accusations through the local news that an employee of the restaurant spiked and officer’s drink with methamphetamine.      The TL;DR Version • On Aug. 8, 2016, a police officer believed the lemonade he purchased from Subway had been spiked.      • A preliminary, non-conclusive test, reportedly tested positive for meth and THC.      • Police arrested the Subway employee who served the drink, even though there was no evidence to support the allegations.      • Despite two negative urine samples from the officer, police allegedly alerted a reporter about this “scoop” and allowed it to air.      • The owner of the Subway she has lost customers, had employees quit, and suffered a damaged reputation because police went public with false allegations.      • The arrested employee recently settled for $50,000.      This all began almost exactly a year ago in Layton City, UT, when a Layton Police Department officer pulled into the drive-thru at a local Subway eatery to order a sandwich and a lemonade.      The officer said that he immediately suspected something was wrong with his drink and that he began to feel ill. He took the lemonade back to the station and ran a preliminary drug screen on the beverage. Police said at the time that the lemonade tested positive for both methamphetamine and THC, the active chemical in marijuana.      SIMILAR: How Home-Grown Tomatoes And Misread Tea Leaves Led To Pointless Police Raid On Innocent Family’s Home      Later that night, the incident was on the local news, with a headline claiming the officer had been “hospitalized,” and police saying that surveillance video showed an employee possibly putting something in the drink, and that this employee had subsequently been arrested on suspicion of a second-degree felony.      The news story even included an unpleasant mug shot of the 18-year-old, and in her voice-over for the story that aired live, the reporter declared that the officer had been hit with a “double dose of illegal narcotics.”      For this story, which aired only hours after the officer purchased his meal, a public information officer for the Layton Police spoke to the reporter while standing outside of the Subway and making some damning remarks. He called the situation “terrifying” for police, said without qualification that the lemonade had tested positive for the two drugs, and that “we can obviously assume that it was because he was a police officer in a marked vehicle, but we don’t know for sure.”      This news had a devastating effect on the Subway shop, says the owner. More than a half-dozen employees, including a manager, quit in the aftermath of the arrest. A number of them had also been subjected to questioning by the police. Customers stopped coming, and the local school ceased ordering sandwiches from the store.      But weeks went by and no official charges were brought against the teen who’d been arrested. It wasn’t until more than two months after the original incident that police confirmed that there was no meth or THC in the lemonade and there was no evidence that the employee had done anything to the officer’s drink.      The damage was done by this point, says the Subway franchisee, who last week filed a lawsuit [PDF] in federal court against the Layton Police Department, alleging that officers knew there was no actual evidence of a spiked drink but decided to go public with their unsubstantiated claims.      According to the lawsuit, police knew that two urine tests — taken at the hospital two and five hours before local news story aired — had turned up no evidence of any drugs in the officer’s system.      What’s more, the plaintiffs say that searches of the Subway, the employee, and his car found nothing to support the allegation that the drink had been spiked or that the worker had been in contact with drugs of any sort. Police even brought in drug-sniffing dogs to no avail, notes the lawsuit. And all of this occurred hours before police gave the interview that aired later that evening.      And while the online version of the local news story mentions that the initial positive test of the lemonade was an “ion scanner” test, the lawsuit claims that police made no effort to clarify that the test used on the drink is intended only for preliminary screening and that it frequently provides false-positive results.      None of this was told to the reporter who put together that story, notes the lawsuit, and police made no effort to provide these exculpatory facts to the reporter despite having ample time before the piece aired. In fact, police had an additional hour that evening because Olympics coverage pushed back the usual start time for the nightly news show.      The day after this news broke, the Subway owner says she spoke to a Layton PD detective who revealed that the urine tests had come up negative, that he didn’t see anything suspicious on the surveillance footage, and that the teen would likely not be charged.      Police subsequently found no evidence to support the notion that the officer’s drink had been spiked, but the plaintiffs say the city did nothing to quell the growing interest in the case from both local and national media.      The accused employee, who’d been released on bail, says he was the subject of vitriol and threatening comments from people — including law enforcement groups — who believed he’d tried to poison a police officer. Others called for a boycott of the Subway location. But still the police did nothing to quell this outrage even though they knew it was increasingly likely that the teen had been falsely accused.      On Oct. 11, Layton Police finally announced that no charges would be filed because all tests had come back negative. At the time, the department refused to apologize to the teen or to even publicly state that it had made a mistake.      That employee, who eventually went back to work at Subway, sued the city of Layton and recently settled out of court for $50,000.      In the franchisee’s lawsuit, the owner claims that she lost nearly $300,000 between flagging sales, spoiled food, having to hire and train new employees, and stigmatization of being associated with illegal drugs.      An attorney representing the franchisee explains to the Washington Post that this lawsuit isn’t about the police making a mistake; it’s about the police allegedly knowing they’d made a mistake but turning it into a media event anyway.      “I’m not saying they should be sued for a faulty investigation,” says attorney Robert Sykes. “But part of the investigation doesn’t involve a press conference.”      The complaint claims that Layton PD’s public information officer — who is called out as a named defendant in the lawsuit — pitched this poisoning story to the local TV reporter as a “scoop,” then allowed the false information to fester, resulting in hundreds of millions of social media hits, according to the plaintiffs.      “They kept omitting key facts, leaving the false impression this officer had been poisoned,” says Sykes. |||||       Subway franchise owners Dallas Buttars, left, and Kristin Myers have sued the Layton Police Department in Utah for defamation. They speak here during an Aug. 9 news conference in Salt Lake City with their attorney Robert Sykes. (Rick Bowmer/AP)      After nearly 20 years in the food service industry, Kristin Myers was used to dealing with the occasional unsatisfied customer.      But last August, the Layton, Utah, business owner and her partner, Dallas Buttars, were thrown a bizarre curveball when a local police officer accused an employee of Myers’s Subway franchise of spiking his drink with THC and methamphetamine — allegations the local department repeated on a nightly newscast.      Within only a few days, however, investigators reversed course. According to a statement from the Layton Police Department released Oct. 11, additional drug testing was “unable to confirm that contaminates were in the officer’s drink.”      But by then, the damage had been done. According to a defamation lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Utah against the city and authorities, the police’s debunked claim sunk Myers’s business.      “This has been one of the worst years,” Myers told The Washington Post. “I’m in the store everyday, and I had several days were customers were coming in to give us the riot act. We also had people asking, ‘Can you put that special stuff in my sandwich.’”      Worse, Myers’s federal court complaint accuses police of purposely letting out misinformation when the evidence proved otherwise.      “They kept omitting key facts, leaving the false impression this officer had been poisoned,” Robert Sykes, the attorney representing Myers and Buttars, told The Post. “I’m not saying they should be sued for a faulty investigation. But part of the investigation doesn’t involve a press conference.”      On Aug. 8, 2016, the police officer went through the Subway drive-through in Layton, about 25 miles north of Salt Lake City. The officer bought a sandwich and a drink, according to the complaint, and after taking of sip from his drink said he felt “strange or ill.”      Back at the station, the officer told he colleagues that he believed “his drink had been adulterated with some kind of drug.” The other officers analyzed the drink with a “screening test” “involving an ion scanner,” the complaint stated.      “The test allegedly came back positive for methamphetamine and THC.” Trouble is, the test was well-known to have accuracy issues, the lawsuit said.      Even so, police suspicion fixed on the 18-year-old who was manning the drive-through window, referred to only as “TU” in the court records but identified by Fox 13 as Tanis Ukena.      “There was not a mean bone in his body, so we knew it right away, it didn’t happen,” Myers said. “It was incredibly shocking.”      The Subway owners agreed to allow police to investigate the possible poisoning on Aug. 8. The shop and employee were searched; drug dogs also sniffed the area, as well as Ukena’s car. Officers also watched surveillance video from inside the store.      Nothing pointed toward a possible crime. But Ukena was arrested and taken for questioning at the police station.      Later that day, a television news reporter from KSL — after receiving a tip from the police spokesman, Sgt. Clint Bobrowski — aired a report about the possible Subway poisoning. Bobrowski did an interview with the station outside the store between 5 and 6 p.m.      The piece, which ran on the 11 p.m. newscast, featured the department spokesmen saying “The drink tested positive for THC and methamphetamine.” Bobrowski also said “We can obviously assume” the drink was spiked “because he was a police officer in a marked vehicle but we don’t know for sure.”      “Our business causes us, a lot of us, to eat out every single meal, so something like this is incredibly terrifying,” Bobrowski said. “I don’t use the word ‘terrifying’ lightly. It’s scary.”      But the department actually should have known the poisoning was fake by the time the spokesman went on air, the complaint alleged. Not only did Bobrowski fail to acknowledge the investigation had proven nothing, the initial ion drug screening was known to have a “very high false positive rate for showing drugs when there are no drugs.”      Also, the officer was given two drug tests — one at 5:00 p.m., another at 9:00 p.m. — that both came back “negative for the presence of any drugs.”      Once the television news item went live, the impact was irreversible. According to Sykes, the Subway’s business was off 30 percent in the following weeks. Myers told The Post six employees quit.      “We were inundated with people that wanted to know what happened,” she said. “We got letters in the mail, anonymous ones, asking ‘How could you hire someone like that?’”      By Aug. 9, however, Layton City Police detectives admitted to the owners Ukena had done nothing wrong after again reviewing the surveillance video.      “The Layton Police Department would like to thank Subway for their complete cooperation,” the department said in an Oct. 11 news release. “The department would also like to express our appreciation for the patience of Tanis and his family during this investigation.”      The teenager filed his own lawsuit against the department, and last week Layton agree to settle the action for $50,000, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Ukena is now serving on a Mormon mission.      The lawsuit filed last week by Myers and Buttars seeks to recoup the $17,000 loss tied to the alleged defamation, as well as additional damages of $250,000      Layton City Police Department’s Sgt. Paul Gardiner declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by The Post. Last week, Layton City Attorney Gary Crane told the Salt Lake Tribune his office was reviewing the case.

The lawsuit claims surveillance footage and a search of the restaurant and employee's car also found no evidence of drugs or any tampering with the officer's drink. But that didn't stop police from going ahead with the story. What followed was what Myers calls "one of the worst years." She says business dropped 30%, six employees quit, and customers complained.

summarize: The Syrian president was largely unapologetic for recent violence and offered only vague promises of reform.      There was little in Bashar al-Assad's speech on Monday that Syrians have not heard before. The president's 75-minute address to an audience at Damascus University echoed the themes he struck in two previous televised addresses. He opened with a long discussion of the "foreign conspiracies" against Syria, and justified the army's use of force against protesters as the "only option left." He offered little by way of reforms, promising only a series of committees and "national dialogues" to address various issues - political reform, the economy and the constitution, among others. His hour-long address to the Syrian parliament in late March blamed the protests on foreign conspirators; he promised reforms, but offered few specifics. Two weeks later, Assad spoke to his newly-appointed cabinet, pledging to end the country's emergency law and tackle unemployment. Since then, Assad has been largely silent. "I did not want to speak until I had something to say," Assad said. While his words were similar, though, his body language was different. Gone was the jocular president who leaned into the podium and cracked jokes with the parliament; the Assad who spoke on Monday was more hesitant, hanging back from the microphones, pausing frequently to cough or clear his throat. It was a deeply technocratic speech, focused on committees and bureaucratic changes - at one point, Assad spoke about the need for various government agencies to co-operate better - rather than concrete reforms. "The national dialogue authority will be tasked with consulting with different groups to reach the correct formula to design a reform plan," Assad said, for example, striking what might seem an oddly detached tone given the current unrest in Syria. The 'black period' Assad was largely unapologetic about the crackdown which has left hundreds dead, particularly the recent violence in northern Syria, centered around the town of Jisr al-Shughur. The Syrian government has accused "armed groups" in that town of killing 120 members of the security forces, a claim which cannot be verified or disproved. Assad repeated that claim in his speech, and said the attacks were carried out by a "minority ... with a medieval mindset." More than 10,500 refugees have fled violence in northern Syria this month, according to Turkish officials [Reuters] "They had very advanced weapons and means of communication," he said. "[This will] derail the reform process and bring grave repercussions on our society. What is happening today is not related to reform or development, it is mere vandalism." His language seemed to be an oblique reference to the Muslim Brotherhood, the banned opposition group-in-exile which has thrown its support behind protests. The group has had little influence in Syria since 1982, when Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father, bombarded the city of Hama to quell a Brotherhood revolt. Tens of thousands were killed. Assad mentioned the Brotherhood again later, when he accused some Syrian protesters of being "destructive elements." "Some of these demands are from the period of confrontation with the Muslim Brotherhood, the black period," Assad said. "We should not continue to live in a black period." Assad did offer his condolences to families who have lost loved ones during this year's unrest, but said nothing about punishing officers or soldiers implicated in human rights abuses. "They are spreading chaos in the name of freedom," Assad said of the protesters in Jisr al-Shughur. "The use of force was the only option left... in some cases peaceful demonstrations were used as a cover, where armed infiltrators were hiding." 'Depression and fear' Assad spent little time discussing the economy, one of the deepest grievances in Syria. The country has posted growth rates of 4 to 5 per cent over the last three years, largely thanks to increased oil and gas exports. But corruption and a heavily state-directed economy have meant the benefits of that growth are not widely shared. Assad said he directed the government to boost employment, and to fix the damage caused by months of protests. (The Syrian government has not publicly estimated the cost of the protests, both direct and indirect, to the economy.) He also stressed the need to restore confidence in Syria's economy, warning that its "collapse" would have serious consequences. "The most dangerous thing we face in the next stage is the weakness or collapse of the Syrian economy, and a large part of the problem is psychological," Assad said. "We cannot allow depression and fear to defeat us." But he offered no specific proposals for economic reform, short of calling for a national dialogue on the shape of Syria's future economy. He did touch on corruption - again, promising a committee would deal with it. "Corruption has left a great deal of sorrow. Corruption is enough to undermine any country," Assad said. "It is the result of favoritism and nepotism." Left unspoken was the name of Rami Makhlouf, one of the country's wealthiest businessmen, who announced last week that he was quitting business and donating some of his investments to charity. Makhlouf is a widely reviled figure in Syria, a symbol of the nepotism at the intersection of business and politics: He is the president's cousin, and that tie to the ruling family has given him monopolies in a number of businesses, including telecommunications, real estate and construction. ||||| Refugees blocked from leaving Syria      By Middle East correspondent Ben Knight      Posted      Syrian troops are reportedly blocking roads leading to Turkey in an effort to prevent refugees from fleeing violence in the country.      There are now more than 10,500 refugees in Turkey who have fled the crackdown in north-west Syria.      It is not known how many more are sitting on the Syrian side of the border waiting to cross.      They have been cut off from food and medical aid since the Syrian army rolled into the town of Bdama, 20 kilometres from the border, on the weekend.      Turkish authorities are currently delivering aid directly to the border, to be passed on to refugees who are still inside Syria.      Later today, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is expected to make a public statement on the crisis - just his third since the uprising began three months ago.      Mr Assad has said little during the crisis, and what he has said has had little in the way of concessions towards the protesters.      It is unlikely there is much he can say now that would end the demonstrations, other than announcing his resignation - and that seems extremely unlikely. |||||	– Protests broke out across Syria today, after president Bashar al-Assad delivered a speech that blamed “saboteurs” and “foreign conspiracies” for the country’s unrest. The speech had been hailed in advance as one that would potentially be "groundbreaking," but it actually offered little new in terms of concessions or reforms, according to al Jazeera. Assad promised only to form committees and hold “national dialogues” that might lead to political reforms or a new constitution. Chants of “liar, liar,” rang out in the city of Latakia, where several neighborhoods are surrounded by troops, Reuters reports. Protests also broke out as far east as Albu Kamal , a city near the Iraqi border, as far south as Daraa, and in the suburbs of Damascus, where people shouted, “No to dialogue with murderers.” In the north, meanwhile, Syrian troops blocked all roads to Turkey, to prevent more refugees from fleeing there and to block food and medical aid from flowing in, ABC News reports.
summarize: Image copyright Nicole Dutra Image caption The Araguaia river dolphin is the first new species described since 1918      Scientists in Brazil have discovered the first new river dolphin species since the end of World War One.      Named after the Araguaia river where it was found, the species is only the fifth known of its kind in the world.      Writing in the journal Plos One, the researchers say it separated from other South American river species more than two million years ago.      There are believed to be about 1,000 of the creatures living in the Araguaia river basin.      River dolphins are among the world's rarest creatures.      According to the IUCN, there are only four known species, and three of them are on the Red List, meaning they are critically endangered.      It is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked Dr Tomas Hrbek, Federal University of Amazonas      These dolphins are only distantly related to their seafaring cousins, tending to have long beaks which let them hunt for fish in the mud at the bottom of rivers.      Big brains      One of the best known species, the Yangtze river dolphin or baiji is believed to have gone extinct in about 2006.      South America though is home to the Amazon river dolphin, also known as the pink dolphin or boto, said to be the most intelligent of all the river species.      The new discovery is said to be related to the Amazonian, although scientists believe the species separated more than two million years ago.      "It is very similar to the other ones," said lead author Dr Tomas Hrbek, from the Federal University of Amazonas.      "It was something that was very unexpected, it is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked. It is very exciting."      The scientists say there are some differences in the number of teeth and they suspect the Araguaia river species is smaller, but most of the clues to their separate nature were found in their genes.      By analysing DNA samples from dozens of dolphins in both rivers, the team concluded the Araguaia river creature was indeed a new species.      They acknowledge though that some experts may question whether or not the discovery is in fact, wholly distinct.      Image copyright Nicole Dutra Image caption The new dolphins are very similar to the Amazon river species though the scientists believe they separated two million years ago      "In science you can never be sure about anything," said Dr Hrbek.      "We looked at the mitochondrial DNA which is essentially looking at the lineages, and there is no sharing of lineages.      "The groups that we see, the haplotypes, are much more closely related to each other than they are to groups elsewhere. For this to happen, the groups must have been isolated from each other for a long time.      "The divergence we observed is larger than the divergences observed between other dolphin species," he said.      The researchers propose that the new species be called the Araguaian Boto, or Boto-do-Araguaia.      They estimate that there are about 1,000 of these creatures living in the river that flows northward for more than 2,600km to join the Amazon.      The researchers are concerned about the future for the new dolphin, saying that it appears to have very low levels of genetic diversity.      They are also worried because of human development.      "Since the 1960s the Araguaia river basin has been experiencing significant anthropogenic pressure via agricultural and ranching activities, and the construction of hydroelectric dams," the authors write in their study.      "The dolphins are at the top of the line, they eat a lot of fish," said Dr Hrbek.      "They rob fishing nets so the fishermen tend to not like them, people shoot them."      They believe that as a result of the threats that it faces, the new species should be categorised as Vulnerable on the Red List.

Tomas Hrbek of the Federal University of Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, and colleagues took DNA from river dolphins in the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers. He found they differed from all other species in Brazil. They also only have 24 teeth per jaw, rather than the 25 to 29 found in the Amazon's other river dolphins. He calls the species Inia araguaiaensis.      The team's analysis of I. araguaiaensis's genes suggest that the species formed 2.08 million years ago, when the Araguaia-Tocantins basin was cut off from the rest of the Amazon river system by huge rapids and waterfalls. River dolphins are slow swimmers that rarely leap, so the shifting landscape isolated the dolphins from their fellows.      Hrbek thinks the formation of rapids has been crucial to river dolphin evolution. The Madeira river's Inia boliviensis arose 2.87 million years ago when the Teotônio rapids formed, while the Casiquiare rapids in the Orinoco river gave rise to the subspecies Inia geoffrensis humboldtiana.      Dammed      However, a different obstacle poses a threat to I. araguaiaensis. Hrbek says dam construction on the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers may wipe it out. "Its future is pretty bleak," he says. "The Araguaia-Tocantins basin suffers huge human disturbance and there are probably less than 1000 I. araguaiaensis in existence." That means it could soon follow in the footsteps of China's iconic baiji, which was declared extinct in 2007.      "It's exciting evidence for a previously unrecognised species within the ancient lineage of Amazon river dolphins," says Scott Baker of Oregon State University in Newport. "Yet it's already rare, and its habitat is now fragmented by dams."

They comprise relict evolutionary lineages of high taxonomic distinctness and conservation value, but are afforded little protection. We report the discovery of a new species of a river dolphin from the Araguaia River basin of Brazil, the first such discovery in nearly 100 years. The species is diagnosable by a series of molecular and morphological characters and diverged from its Amazonian sister taxon 2.08 million years ago. The estimated time of divergence corresponds to the separation of the Araguaia-Tocantins basin from the Amazon basin. This discovery highlights the immensity of the deficit in our knowledge of Neotropical biodiversity, as well as vulnerability of biodiversity to anthropogenic actions in an increasingly threatened landscape. We anticipate that this study will provide an impetus for the taxonomic and conservation reanalysis of other taxa shared between the Araguaia and Amazon aquatic ecosystems, as well as stimulate historical biogeographical analyses of the two basins.

Introduction True river dolphins of the genus Inia are widely distributed throughout the Amazon, Orinoco, and Araguaia-Tocantins basins (Fig. 1) [1]. The Araguaia-Tocantins River basin currently does not form part of the Amazon River basin [2], [3], the two basins having become disconnected although not completely isolated at the transition of the Pliocene to the Pleistocene [2]. Currently only a narrow canal west of Marajó Island links the Amazon River delta with the Pará River into which the Araguaia-Tocantins River drains. Connectivity between the Araguaia-Tocantins and Amazon basins is further restricted by a series of major rapids on the lower Tocantins River as it transits from the Brazilian Shield to the Amazonian lowland plain, the largest of which have been flooded in the process of creation of the Tucuruí Dam (03° 50′ 0.36″ S; 49° 38′ 15.55″ W). Major barriers such as waterfalls and rapids are thought to delimit Inia taxa as in the case of the upper Madeira River rapids which are thought to delimit I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis [1], [4], [5]. Similarly, the rapids on the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers together with the Cassiquiare Canal are thought to delimit the Orinoco and Amazon subspecies of I. geoffrensis [1], [4], [5]. The Araguaia-Tocantins River system is thus not only almost completely disconnected from the Amazon River basin, the portion of it that flows on the Brazilian Shield is isolated by rapids from the mouth of the river system and the Amazon River delta by a series of rapids. It is therefore possible that Inia individuals upstream of these rapids or even in the entire system represent a biological entity evolutionarily independent of I. geoffrensis in the Amazon basin. To test this hypothesis we analyzed a series of mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA and morphological characters of the two known species of Inia as well as individuals from the Araguaia River basin.

Black outline denotes the limit of the Amazon basin. Question marks denote uncertainty as to which species occurs in the Tocantins River downstream of the Tucuruí dam which potentially delimits the distributions of I. geoffrensis and I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. Bars on the Madeira River represent a series of rapids that delimit the distribution of I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis. The single bar on the northern limit of the Amazon basin represents the Casiquiare canal which connects the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and is thought to delimit the I. g. humboldtiana subspecies from I. g. geoffrensis. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0083623.g001      Materials and Methods Ethics Statement Samples were collected either from carcases, or from live animals using minimally invasive sampling procedures [6]. Protocol for handling and removing small quantities of cutaneous tissue samples from the caudal fluke of live animals was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Use (Comissão de Ética do Uso de Animais – CEUA) of National Research Institute of the Amazon (INPA). Field Sampling Samples were obtained from animals in the Amazon-Solimões basin, the Bolivian sub-basin, and the Araguaia River. Samples were maintained in 95% ethanol and deposited in the official tissue collection (Coleção de Tecidos de Genética Animal – CGTA) of the Federal University of Amazonas and the tissue collection (Coleção de Tecidos) of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia. The licenses for collections were obtained through IBAMA/ICMBIO No. 11325-1 to IPF, No. 13462-1 to VMS, and No. 16741-2 to ND. In total we sampled 45 I. boliviensis from the Bolivian sub-basin, 44 I. geoffrensis from the Amazon-Solimões basin and 32 Inia sp. individuals from the Araguaia River. Nuclear Microsatellite DNA Amplification Total genomic DNA was extracted from skin samples using Qiaquick blood and tissue kit (Hilsden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification was performed on total genomic DNA. Negative controls were run for all reactions. To characterize Inia individuals, we used 7 microsatellite pairs (Ig2B1, Ig11B1, Ig8H1, Ig10E, Ig11D2, Ig3A1, Ig7F2) developed by Gravena et al. [7] for I. geoffrensis, and 3 microsatellite pairs (Ttr11, Ttr48, TtruAAT40) developed by Caldwell et al. [8] and Rosel et al. [9] for Tursiops truncatus. Genotyping was done according Gravena et al. [7] on the ABI 3130XL (Life Technologies) automatic sequencer. The program GeneMapper (Life Technologies) was used to extract raw fragment data, and infer fragment sizes. Mitochondrial DNA Amplification The complete cytochrome b gene was amplified using standard PCR conditions with the primers IniaGluF.1 (5′-GACCAATGACATGAAAAATCATCG-3′) and IniaProR.1 (5′-CAGCTTTGGGTGTTGGTGGTGA-3′) developed for this study. The cytochrome oxidase I DNA barcode region was amplified using the C_VF1LFt1-C_VRLRt1 primer cocktail [10]. All the regions were amplified in a final volume of 15 µl and contained 7.6 µl of ddH 2 O, 1.2 of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1.2 µl of 10 mM dNTPs, 1.5 µl of 10x buffer (750 mM Tris-HCl – pH 8.8 at 25°C, 200 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), 1.5 µl of each primer (2 µM), 0.3 µl of Taq DNA Polymerase (1 U/µl) and 1 µl of DNA (concentration varied between 10 ng and 30 ng). PCR reagents were obtained from Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania). PCR reaction consisted of 35 cycles of denaturation at 93°C for 60 seconds, primer annealing at 50°C for 40 seconds, and primer extension at 72°C for 90 seconds, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products were purified using EXO-SAP (Exonuclease – Shrimp Alcaline Phosphatase) following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol [11]. PCR products were evaluated on a 1% agarose gel, and then purified using the polyethylene glycol and ethanol precipitation protocol [12]. cytochrome b PCR products were sequenced using the primer IniaCytbF.1 (5′-CTACCCTGAGGACAAATATCATT-3′), IniaCytbF.2 (5′-CCCGACCTACTAGGAGACCC-3′), IniaCytbF.3 (5′-CCCGACTTACTAGGGGACCC-3′) and IniaCytbR.1 (5′-GAAGAAGCGTGTTAGTGTTGC-3′) developed for this study. cytochrome oxidase c I DNA barcode region PCR products were sequenced with M13F(−21) and M13R(−27) primers [13]. Cycle sequencing PCR followed manufacturer’s recommended protocol for BigDye sequencing kit (Life Technologies); primer annealing temperature was 50°C. Cycle sequencing reaction products were resolved on the ABI 3130XL (Life Technologies) automatic sequencer. Sequence products were edited, concatenated and aligned using the program Geneious v5.6.3 [14]. Sequences are deposited in Genbank under accession numbers KF657385– KF657432, KF657593– KF657640, KF802241– KF802276, KF802313– KF802348, KF802349– KF802380 and KF802381– KF802412. Population Genetic Characterization of Nuclear Microsatellite Data The program ARLEQUIN version 3.5.1.2 [15] was used to test for linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci, and to test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In cases of multiple comparisons, p-values were adjusted using the Holm method [16] implemented in the stats package of the software R 2.14.1 [17]. Structure Analyses of Nuclear Microsatellite Data The existence of biological groups is a necessary prerequisite for inferring the existence of a species under the Biological Species Concept (BSC) [18]. The microsatellite data were therefore analyzed in the program STRUCTURE version 2.3.3 [19], [20] with the goal of assigning individuals to groups, given a specific number groups (K). We used the ‘admixture’ and ‘correlated-allelic-frequencies’ models with a location prior. Assignment space was explored with 1,000,000 MCMC chains, preceded by 100,000 MCMC chains discarded as burn-in. Convergence was examined by viewing profiles of posterior probabilities, and values of α. Each analysis was repeated 20 times from a different randomly selected starting point, raw output was processed in Structure Harvester 0.6.92 [21]. The 20 independent runs were summarized in the program CLUMPP 1.1.2 [22], and results were visualized in the program DISTRUCT 1.1 [23]. The most likely number of biological groups (K) was inferred using Bayes’ Rule [24]. Principal Components and Correspondence Analysis of Nuclear Microsatellite Data The objective of this analysis was to reduce the dimensionality of the microsatellite data using the Ade4 package [25] in the software R 2.14.1 [17]. The first and second principal components were then plotted against each other, and the dispersion of points within each sample group was visualized by an ellipse encompassing a 67.53% density contour around each group representing the Inia from the Araguaia River, I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis. Discrimination of the three groups of Inia was further assessed using the correspondence analysis implemented in the Ade4 package of R. Around each group an ellipse encompassing a 67.53% density contour was drawn. Population Aggregation Analysis and Phylogenetic Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA Data Evolutionary lineages are diagnosed by discontinuities in character variation among lineages, and correspond to phylogenetic species. The existence of lineages is therefore a necessary and sufficient prerequisite for inferring the existence of a species under the different conceptualizations of the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) [26]–[28]. The existence of lineages in a non tree-based context [26] was inferred using Population Aggregation Analysis performed at the level of an individual [29], [30], while the existence of lineages in a phylogenetic tree-based context [27], [28] was performed using Maximum Parsimony [31] and Bayesian Inference [32] analyses. Maximum Parsimony topology was estimated using PaupRat [33] implemented on the CIPRES Science Gateway website [34]. We used the TBR option to swap topologies, and ran 100 independent replicates. Bayesian Inference topology for molecular data was estimated in MrBayes 3.1.2 [32]; we ran two replicates, each with four independent chains for 10 million MCMC generations, sampling a topology every 10,000 generations. Searches were done using the General Time Reversible (GTR) model of molecular evolution [35] with probability of change from one nucleotide state to another assumed to follow a gamma distribution, and a portion of sites were assumed to be invariant. The GTR+G+I model was suggested as the most appropriate model of molecular evolution in jModeltest [36] using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [37] to select among alternative models. To improve the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction [38], [39], we partitioned the data a priori by codon position. The GTR+G+I model of molecular evolution was applied to each codon position, and parameters were assumed to be uncorrelated between partitions. Convergence between the two independent MrBayes runs was assessed by comparing the posterior probability estimates for each analysis using a scatter-plot created by the compare command in AWTY [40]. Convergent topologies were combined for the calculation of posterior clade probabilities. Following Huelsenbeck et al. [41], the frequency of a clade among the sampled trees was interpreted as the posterior probability of that clade; the posterior probabilities are true probabilities under the assumed model of substitution [42]; thus we considered clades to be significantly supported when Bayesian posterior probabilities were ≥95% [43]. Phylogenetic Dating Using Mitochondrial DNA Data The objective was to estimate the divergence time of the three lineages of Inia from their respective sister taxa. To provide calibration points, we included taxa that resulted from diversification events for which a good fossil record exists, including taxa near the root of our phylogeny. We included additional taxa for the purpose of cross validation of our estimates with those published by Xiong et al. [44] based on complete mitochondrial genomes. We used prior age distributions so that they encompassed the entire period of the origination of the fossil as reported in literature, unless a more precise fossil age estimate was provided by one of the authors of the fossil literature. Calibrations were performed in the program BEAST 1.7.1 [45], with divergence times being lognormally distributed. Calibrations were chosen such that the youngest age of the distribution corresponded with the youngest fossil age estimate, and the oldest fossil estimate was encompassed within the 95% credible interval of the lognormal age distribution. Calibrations follow those used by Xiong et al. [44] with modifications of the 95% credible intervals to truly and exactly encompass the upper and lower fossil ages. The following four calibration points were used: The divergence between Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) was calibrated using the earliest record of mysticetes from the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (see [46] for a review). There has been debate about when the Eocene/Oligocene transition occurred (38–33.5 Mya in [47]), and therefore we chose a lognormal age prior so that the earlier age corresponded to 33.5 Mya and the older 95% credible interval (CI) encompassed the beginning of the Late Eocene (40 Mya) (standard deviation = 1.068). The age of the root of crown Odontoceti was calibrated using the earliest record of a physeterid (sperm whales) – the Late Oligocene Ferecetotherium [48]; see also [49]. The age prior was lognormally distributed so that the youngest age corresponded to 23.7 Mya, the end of the Late Oligocene, and the older 95% credible interval (CI) encompassed the beginning of the Late Oligocene (30 Mya) (standard deviation = 1.135). The divergence between Iniidae (the Amazon River dolphins) and Pontoporidae (La Plata River dolphins) was calibrated using the earliest record of a pontoporid, the Middle Miocene Brachydelphis [50]. The age prior was lognormally distributed so that the youngest fossil age corresponded to 11.2 Mya and the older 95% CI encompassed the beginning of the Middle Miocene (16.6 Mya) (standard deviation = 1.223). The divergence between Phocoenidae (porpoises) and Monodontidae (narwhals) was calibrated using the earliest record of a phocoenid, the Late Miocene Salumiphocaena [51]. This fossil is approximately 10–11 million years old [51], and therefore we chose a lognormal age prior with the younger age corresponding to 10 Mya and the older 95% CI encompassing the beginning of the Late Miocene (11.2 Mya) (standard deviation = 1.061). The BEAST analysis consisted of 1×108 generations with a random starting tree, the Yule speciation prior, uniform [0, 100] prior distribution for the GTR+G+I substitution rates, default values for remaining priors, random starting topology, and topologies were sampled every 10000 generations. To improve the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction [38], [39], [52], we partitioned the data a priori by codon position. The topologies were used to calculate posterior clade probabilities and divergence times. The reliability of the estimated divergence times was further assessed by calculating an expected substitution rate compatible with the observed divergence time. Cranial Measurement Analyses Cranial measurements and counts follow da Silva [1] with data from da Silva [1] serving as a base for comparison. All measurements were standardized as described in da Silva [1] while counts were analyzed untransformed. Since only few individuals were available for morphological analyses, no statistical analyses were performed and only means and ranges of equivalent measurements and counts were compared to those taken from I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis.

Discussion All species concepts applicable to sexually reproducing organisms that conceive of species as an outcome of an evolutionary process implicitly or explicitly assume that species are groups of individuals that can freely exchange genetic information with each other, but are unable to do so with individuals of other species. For example, the Biological Species Concept (BSC) focuses on ongoing patterns of reproduction, using actual or potential reproduction among individuals of the species as a criterion for identifying species limits [18]. On the other hand, the Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) focuses on historical patterns of reproduction that would maintain autonomous evolutionary lineages [26]–[28]. Our analyses identify I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. as both an evolutionary lineage and a group of actually interbreeding individuals, satisfying the criteria necessary for the recognition of this taxon as a species under the Biological as well as Phylogenetic Species Concepts. Analyses conducted with the program STRUCTURE [19], [20] and interpreted using Bayes’ Rule [24] identify three groups as the most likely number of biological groups within the genus Inia (Fig. 2). These biological groups represent I. araguaiaensis sp. nov., I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis. The probability that only two biological groups exist, and that I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. individuals belong to the same biological group as I. geoffrensis is 4.22×10−98. Allowing for individuals to have ancestors from more than one biological group results in the inference that individuals of I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. do not have admixed ancestry. This does not necessarily mean that there is no gene flow or that there has been no recent historical gene flow between I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. and either I. geoffrensis or I. boliviensis, but the data do indicate that all three species represent distinct biological populations characterized by a shared system of mating among members of each species (sensu Templeton [55]), but not among species. Evolutionary distinctness of I. araguaiaensis sp. nov., I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis is also manifested by diagnostic alleles, distinct allelic frequencies and allelic combinations of each species as observed in the PCA (Fig. 3). Assuming the existence of the three species of Inia a priori, the three species are clearly separable in multivariate allelic space (Fig. 4). Inia araguaiaensis sp. nov., I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis are also diagnosable as biological entities evolutionarily independent of each other, i.e. lineages characterized by independent evolutionary trajectories. As such, each species is diagnosable by a series of unique characters. These characters are both molecular (Table 2) and morphological (see Diagnosis above). However, due to morphological conservatism, the majority of the diagnostic characters are molecular. The three species have a long history of evolutionary independence with strongly supported chronological order of speciation events (Figs. 2 & 3). The earliest species-level divergence resulted in the separation of I. boliviensis from the lineage leading to I. geoffrensis and I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. in the late Pliocene (Fig. 5). This divergence was followed shortly by the divergence of I. geoffrensis from I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. in the early Pleistocene (Fig. 5). Both divergences are associated with major geological events in the Amazon basin. With highest probability I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. diverged from its I. geoffrensis sister lineage 2.08 mya (95% HPD 0.811–3.744 mya) (Fig. 5). This divergence time corresponds to the last time that the Araguaia-Tocantins basin discharged directly into the Amazon River at the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary [2]. At the time of the Rossetti and Valeriano study [2], the Pliocene included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 mya [56], and therefore the authors estimated an isolation of the Araguaia-Tocantins basin at 1.8 mya. The estimated isolation of the Araguaia-Tocantins basin from the Amazon basin 1.8 mya corresponds closely to the estimated divergence of I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. from the Araguaia basin and I. geoffrensis from the Amazon basin at 2.08 mya (Fig. 5), leading us to the conclusion that speciation was vicariant. Our results also clearly show that I. boliviensis is a distinct species. Inia boliviensis is an independent biological population (Figs. 2 & 3), and the estimated time of divergence of I. boliviensis from its sister clade is 2.87 mya (95% HPD 1.315–4.903 mya) (Fig. 5). This divergence estimate is broadly compatible with the uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch which commenced to isolate the Bolivian sub-basin from the Amazon basin no earlier than 4 mya [57], [58]. The observed divergence between I. boliviensis and its sister clade has, therefore, likely been driven by the uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch, and has lead to vicariant speciation. Similar signatures of vicariant diversification can be observed in other Amazonian aquatic vertebrate groups such as the piranhas of the genera Pygocentrus and Serrasalmus [59] and peacock basses of the genus Cichla [60]. Currently much of the scientific community [61], [62], including the IUCN (http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/10831​/0), consider I. boliviensis to be a subspecies of I. geoffrensis. However, in 2012 the Ad-Hoc Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (http://www.marinemammalscience.org/) started considering I. boliviensis a full species citing the control region mtDNA data [4] and nuclear introns data [63]. We confirm this taxonomic reassessment and demonstrate that I. boliviensis is diagnosable under the biological species (Figs. 2 & 3) as well as the phylogenetic species (Table 1 and Fig. 5) criteria. Similar to the taxonomic uncertainty involving I. boliviensis, one may question whether or not I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. represents a valid taxon. The observed phylogenetic and mating-system patterns could potentially represent intraspecific variation in a strongly genetically structured species. We reject this notion in favor of the existence of a new species in the Araguaia River basin on the grounds that Inia araguaiaensis sp. nov. 1) has no apparent actual or recent history of admixture with other Inia species, 2) has a large number of diagnostic characters that unambiguously discriminate it from other Inia species, and 3) diverged from its sister taxon I. geoffrensis with highest probability 2.08 million years ago, but no less than 0.811 million years ago. This divergence time exceeds most sister-taxon divergence-time estimates in the closely related family Delphinidae [44], [64]. Therefore, all the presented data corroborate our interpretation that I. araguaiaensis sp. nov. is an evolutionary species, i.e. a lineage with an independent evolutionary trajectory. Conservation True river dolphins are some of the rarest and most endangered of all vertebrates comprising relict evolutionary lineages of high taxonomic distinctness [65], [66]. Of the four extant species listed by the IUCN, three are listed in one of the IUCN Red List’s threat categories (VU – Pontoporia blainvillei, EN – Platanista gangetica, CR – Lipotes vexillifer) while Inia geoffrensis is DD. Although listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, the Chinese baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), became extinct between 2004 and 2006 [67]. The description of I. araguaiaensis represents the first description of a new true river dolphin since 1918 when the now extinct L. vexillifer was described. Lipotes vexillifer was also the first river dolphin, and probably the first cetacean, to become extinct as a result of anthropogenic activities [67]–[69]. The conservation status of I. araguaiaensis has not been assessed, but merits attention. Inia araguaiaensis appears to have low levels of genetic diversity, and also has a restricted distribution in what we estimate to be an approximately 1500 km stretch of the Araguaia River with additional fragmented habitat in the Tocantins River basin [54]. The number of individuals is also probably low. In an environmental impact study conducted for the licensing of the Santa Isabel hydroelectric project on the lower Araguaia River, a total of 122 dolphins were seen over a 12 week period in 60 km survey stretch of the river [70]. Assuming an average width of 0.5 km [71], and assuming that no animal was seen more than once, this would represent approximately 1525 individuals in the Araguaia River basin. Araújo and da Silva [72] estimated, depending on the transect type used, 0.80 to 0.98 indiv/km2 in the Araguaia River suggesting a population of 600 to 735 individuals. Araújo [71], assuming that I. araguaiaensis occurs throughout the total 2110 km length of the Araguaia River estimated a total of 1033 individuals Extrapolating from the highest I. geoffrensis density of 1.3 indiv/km2 observed in non-protected areas of the Amazon basin (the Napo River in Ecuador) [73], 975 individual could occur in the Araguaia River basin. Populations of the middle and upper Tocantins River are fragmented by six hydroelectric dams, not including the Tucurui dam, and are likely to have very few individuals. Since the 1960’s the Araguaia River basin has been experiencing significant anthropogenic pressure via agricultural and ranching activities, and the construction of hydroelectric dams, all of which have had negative effects on many biotic and abiotic aspects of the functioning of the Araguaia River ecosystem [74] which I. araguaiaensis inhabits. Similarly I. araguaiaensis in the Tocantins River is affected by agricultural and industrial development, and is fragmented into isolated populations by hydroelectric dams [54]. Interpreting these data using IUCN criteria, Inia araguaiaensis should minimally be considered vulnerable (VU Red List category).      Supporting Information Figure S1.

Scientists in Brazil, writing in the journal PLOS One, say the Araguaia dolphin, named after the river where it was found, is a distinct species that formed around 2 million years ago when rapids cut it off from the rest of the Amazon river basin, reports the BBC. It is very similar to the Amazon river dolphin, but DNA samples proved it was a different species, slightly smaller and with fewer teeth. It becomes the fifth known river dolphin species in the world (though one is thought to be extinct); the last was identified in 1918. "It was something that was very unexpected, it is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked," the lead researcher says. "It is very exciting." But he warns that there are only around 1,000 of the creatures in existence and its "future is pretty bleak," New Scientist reports. Dams have fragmented its habitat, which has already been degraded by farming and ranching operations, and fishermen have been know to kill it as a pest. (A new seafaring dolphin species was also recently discovered.)
summarize: (CNN) North Korea said Wednesday that it has the ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons, a key step toward building nuclear missiles.      Analysts and U.S. officials have said previously that they suspected Kim Jong Un 's regime was working toward accomplishing the technical feat, which is needed to fit a nuclear device on the tip of a ballistic missile.      U.S. expresses doubt      But on Wednesday, the official U.S. response was skepticism.      "Our assessment of North Korea's nuclear capabilities has not changed," National Security Council spokesman Patrick Ventrell said in a statement. "We do not think that they have that capacity."      "However, they are working on developing a number of long range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that could eventually threaten our allies and the homeland," the U.S. spokesman added. "That is why the Administration is working to improve regional and homeland missile defenses and continuing to work with the other members of the six-party talks to bring North Korea back into compliance with its nonproliferation commitments."      The six-party talks refer to nuclear disarmament efforts by the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.      But the North Korean assertion was unequivocal.      "We have had the capability of miniaturizing nuclear warheads, as well as producing multiform weapons, for some time," the North Korean military said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency.      "We can also guarantee the accuracy not only of short-to-mid-range but also long-range rocket launches, for which we have had the technology for a long time," the statement said.      Claim echoes U.S. military assessments      Despite the U.S.' official skepticism, Pyongyang's announcement about miniaturization -- the first time it has publicly made such a claim -- tallies with some recent assessments from senior U.S. military officials.      U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, said in October that he thought North Korea was capable of miniaturizing a nuclear device.      And Adm. Bill Gortney, the commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command, told reporters last month that the U.S. military believed that Pyongyang could put a nuclear weapon on a road-mobile missile and "shoot it at the (U.S.) homeland."      Gortney added, though, that the United States doesn't think that the missile in question, the KN-08, has been tested. And he said he was confident U.S. defenses would be able to intercept any potential North Korean attack.      Analysts suspect North Korean nuclear advances      Gauging the progress of North Korea's nuclear weapons program is a tricky business. Kim's regime generally cloaks its efforts in secrecy and occasionally trumpets claims of advances through propaganda outlets, leaving the rest of the world to try to connect the dots.      Analysts have said that North Korea may well already be able to fit nuclear warheads on ground-launched missiles that can reach South Korea and Japan.      David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, recently told CNN that Pyongyang could have 10 to 15 nuclear weapons at this point and that it could grow that amount by several weapons per year.      Fashioning a nuclear device small enough to fit on the tip of a ballistic missile is difficult. North Korea signaled its intent to achieve that goal at the time of its most recent nuclear test, in 2013. It described the device it tested then as "a smaller and lighter" bomb than the ones it detonated in 2006 and 2009.      Albright said he thinks Pyongyang can miniaturize a warhead for shorter missiles, but not yet for intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.      "There's just too much testing they need to do, to make sure the re-entry vehicle -- in essence the missile -- is going to work," he explained. "Also, the warhead is going to have to survive in a much more rugged environment, so that requires further testing too.      "I don't think they're there yet."      Miniaturization one of several key steps      Miniaturizing a nuclear weapon is one key part of building a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile.      The nuclear device also needs to be tough enough to be able to withstand the flight on a ballistic missile, experts say, and be housed in a "reentry vehicle" that can endure the intense heat generated by coming back into Earth's atmosphere.      In a February post for the North Korea watching blog 38 North , arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis said he thought North Korea was probably able to carry out each of those three steps.      But big questions remain about the reliability and accuracy of any weapon the North Koreans might be able to put together, wrote Lewis, who is the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.      Adding to concerns, North Korea claimed this month that it had successfully tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile . A South Korean defense official said, though, that the North was believed to still be years away from having a fully operational submarine missile system.      Nuclear progress likely to undermine regional stability      The apparent progress of the North Korean regime's nuclear weapons program is threatening to upend the United States' strategic calculations in the region.      "Pyongyang's advances in mobile ICBM capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the Korean Peninsula," Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in an opinion article for CNN last month. "Put simply, these capabilities could give North Korea confidence that it is immune from any U.S. counterstrikes."      North Korea has demanded that the United States recognize it as a nuclear power. But the United States has said that North Korea's commitment to denuclearization is the starting point for any negotiations between the two sides.      North Korea is the subject of a raft of U.N. Security Council sanctions because of its nuclear tests and long-range rocket launches.      But the international measures don't appear to have stopped Pyongyang from continuing to develop its weapons programs, which it says it needs as a deterrent to the threat it perceives from the United States.      "I think we have rapidly approached the point of no return over the past five-years," Joel Wit, a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said this month. "This program has gained a lot of momentum over the past few years, and not much has been done to stop it." ||||| 2015/05/20 15:28      SEOUL, May 20 (Yonhap) -- North Korea said Wednesday that it has already secured the technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit on a missile, further escalating tensions sparked by its recent test-firing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.      In a statement, a spokesman for the North's powerful National Defense Commission said it will defend the North with the nuclear weapons made small enough to be mounted on missiles, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).      The statement came as the North recently claimed that it successfully test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.      Experts have raised concerns over Pyongyang's move, since it is seen as part of efforts to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs.      sooyeon@yna.co.kr      (END) ||||| On December 20, 2014, the South Korean Ministry of National Defense (MND) released a white paper that contained a surprising statement about North Korea’s nuclear program.[1] “North Korea seems to have made significant progress in miniaturizing its nuclear weapons.”      The MND Minister had made a similar statement in October, but for some reason, this time his statement sparked a flurry of stories in South Korean press, such as the Chosun Ilbo and JoongAng Ilbo, as well as in US publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.      This chatter forced the South Korean government to clarify the statement. “Seoul and Washington have reached consensus that the North already reached a significant level of technology to miniaturize nuclear weapons through three nuclear tests,” an MND official told the Chosun Ilbo. “But there is no intelligence report that the North has already succeeded in miniaturizing nuclear weapons.”      Well that clears it up.      This is now the third time something like this has happened in the past few years—a statement that North Korea has developed a nuclear weapon small enough to arm a ballistic missile of one sort or another, followed by oddly parsed statements suggesting that maybe they haven’t.      In Spring 2013, for example, a US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) threat assessment was mistakenly marked unclassified stating that North Korea might be able to arm ballistic missiles with nuclear weapons, prompting the Department of Defense and Director of National Intelligence to release clarifications of their own. And, in October of that year, the Commander of US Forces Korea stated his personal opinion that North Korea probably could do so, prompting a statement by the ROK Minister of National Defense.      At some level, this debate strikes me as a bit bizarre. The North Koreans have conducted three nuclear weapons tests since 2006, including one they openly declared to have been of a “miniaturized” device; they have also created a Strategic Rocket Force and published a picture of a map showing their nuclear targeting plan against the United States. I realize that North Korean propaganda is often balderdash, but the idea that North Korea might be developing nuclear-armed ballistic missiles isn’t really in the same category as claims that Kim Jong Un doesn’t poop.      Whether North Korea can arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, particularly a ballistic missile that can reach the United States, depends on the answer to three questions:      Can North Korea make a nuclear weapon small enough? Can North Korea’s compact nuclear weapon survive the shock, vibration and temperature change associated with ballistic missile flight? Can North Korea construct a “reentry vehicle” that can survive the extreme heat of reentry, a problem that gets worse with range?      I think the answer to each of these questions is, “yeah, probably.” While I understand the caution in crediting the North Koreans for capabilities that are only under development, there is ample open source information to support such a judgment. Reasonable people may still disagree, but no one should be surprised by the prospect of nuclear-armed North Korean missiles.      Can North Korea Make a Nuclear Weapon Small Enough?      The simplest question is whether North Korea can build a nuclear weapon small enough—both in terms of mass and compactness—to fit atop a ballistic missile. The United States intelligence community has a term of art—simple fission device—to describe first generation nuclear weapons, like the aptly named “Fat Man,” that are much too large to place on a ballistic missile.      As a general technical matter, however, the US intelligence community has always stated that a country could skip right toward building much smaller devices on the order of 1,000 kg—although such weapons would be unreliable without nuclear testing. This device would look something like the US Mark 7, which weighed about 750 kg. Some of my colleagues have pointed out that North Korea could probably do much better, trying out something like the Mark 12 which weighted on 450 kg. (See chart.)      Select Early US Nuclear Warhead Designs for Comparison Mass (kg) Diameter (cm) Yield (kt) Deployed Mark III (“Fat Man”) 4,700 150 20 1945, 1947-1950 Mark 5 1400 110 120 1952-1963 Mark 7 800 80 70 1952-1967 Mark 12 500 60 20 1954-1962 Source: Chuck Hansen, Swords of Armageddon, electronic edition.      Not surprisingly, as early as 1999, DIA was arguing that North Korea might try to build a 650-750 kg device, even if others in the US intelligence community were skeptical. DIA just assumed that North Korea would go straight to a Mark 7-like design.      There is plenty of reason to think that North Korea tried to do precisely that. During the 2000s, there were many reports of North Korean conducting extensive testing of high explosives. A nuclear weapon is mostly a conventional explosive. Making the bomb more compact largely involves design innovations that require fewer explosives to achieve a given level of compression (such as levitated pits and better electronics). One explanation for all the testing of conventional explosives is that North Korea was trying to develop a device small enough to be delivered by missile. In 2005, a North Korean defector stated that North Korea had done precisely that, build a 1,000 kilogram device that was—just as the US intelligence community would have predicted—not reliable. (The defector also said the next device would be smaller.)      When North Korea’s first test in 2006 produced a very disappointing yield, many of us took the small yield to be confirmation of this general hypothesis—North Korea had tried to skip directly to a compact device and it did not work. At one point, a reporter told me this was also the working hypothesis within the US intelligence community. Since then, North Korea has conducted two more nuclear tests that produced far higher yields—a few kilotons in 2009, followed by several kilotons in 2013. Following that lest test, the North Koreans announced they had “miniaturized” their nuclear devices.      It seems very plausible to me that, after three tests, the North Koreans have a nuclear weapons design somewhere in the Mark 12 to March 7 range—450-750 kg in mass with a diameter between 60-90 cm. Lots of states have moved quickly to develop relatively smaller devices. (See chart.) The Chinese provided a uranium-based design to Pakistan that was 500 kg and 90 cm in diameter, which the Pakistanis miniaturized and passed on to Libya and lord knows who else.

Source: Author estimates.      Such a warhead is certainly small enough to arm a Nodong and might just fit on a notional DPRK inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). The problem here is how to estimate the capabilities of a DPRK ICBM that does not exist–based on Unha technology or the KN-08 mockups? If North Korea can’t make a warhead compact enough for its ICBMs, it is more likely to be because the ICBM doesn’t have enough payload space.      Can North Korea’s Compact Nuclear Weapon Survive the Shock, Vibration and Temperature Change Associated with Ballistic Missile Flight?      This is a more interesting problem. It’s all well and good to design a much smaller nuclear weapon using fancy electronics and so on, but the design must be rugged enough to survive the shock, vibration and temperature extremes of taking a ride on a ballistic missile. “The difference has to do with the confidence level in the actual ability of the North Koreans to make a weapon that will work in a missile,” James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, explained in 2013, “And neither we nor the North Koreans know whether that’ll actually—whether they have that—such capability, if they have it, will actually work.”      This was a real problem for the Chinese in the 1960s, too. The Chinese developed a missile-delivered warhead for their DF-2 ballistic missile—the same design that China provided to Pakistan—and originally planned to simulate the abuse suffered during a real launch, followed by an underground test of the roughed-up bomb.      The Chinese, however, decided that it was too hard to simulate the extreme conditions of flight. After a fair amount of back-and-forth between the weaponeers and the central leadership, Zhou Enlai authorized a very unusual live test of a real nuclear weapon on a real ballistic missile. China fired a nuclear-armed DF-2 in October 1966. It worked. The Chinese weren’t alone. We had the same debate in the United States a few years before. Like China, we also settled for a one-off demonstration called Operation Frigate Bird, in which a US submarine fired a nuclear-armed Polaris missile at a nuclear test site in the South Pacific. It worked too, although it later turned out that the warhead in question was judged unreliable.      We might lack confidence in North Korea’s ability to manufacture a reliable miniaturized nuclear weapon. I wonder, though, how much that matters. Do the North Koreans lack confidence in their warheads? What if we underestimate them? What if they are drunk off Juche? What if, like Operation Frigate Bird, the unreliable weapon just happens to work when it’s fired? There is an interesting discussion to be had about reliability, confidence and deterrence, but I wonder whether it adds much to our assessment of North Korea.      Can North Korea Construct a “Reentry Vehicle” that Can Survive the Extreme Heat of Reentry?      Finally, no matter how rugged one makes a nuclear warhead, it has to be packaged in a reentry vehicle that can survive the heat created as it reenters the earth’s atmosphere. The North Koreans could certainly package a warhead in a blunt reentry body that would be inaccurate, very heavy and potentially vulnerable to theater missile defense systems—but it would still survive reentry.      The North Koreans, however, have paraded missiles with so-called “triconic” reentry vehicles that are sort of a compromise between blunt reentry bodies and the slender cones that arm missiles in the US and other advanced nuclear powers. A triconic reentry body must deal with heat through ablation—in other words, the reentry body must be made of material that burns off, taking the heat with it.      This can be a significant challenge for an ICBM, where reentry speeds can reach 7 km/s. China, for example, struggled in the 1970s with developing a reentry vehicle for the DF-5 ICBM that could handle such temperatures. China Today, a series of publications on the technical history of China’s defense industries, describes the problem as “a technical difficulty” which is about as colorful as China Today gets. Ultimately, though, the Chinese solved that problem. In fact, I can’t think of a single state that has been able to build an ICBM, but not able to put a passable reentry vehicle on top of it.      It is common to say North Korea would require a program of testing to overcome these problems. That’s understandable. In the 1960s, reentry vehicle designers probably struggled to model reentry environments and had a limited choice in materials. But today? After more than fifty years of space flight? With a large body of open source information, better computer simulation capabilities and fancy new materials? Maybe a little help from their friends? And maybe a little overconfidence?      And, let’s be clear about the problem here. The warhead probably won’t burn up. Even the North Koreans don’t suck that badly. When designers talk about how hard it is to design an ablative reentry vehicle, what they really mean is designing one where the ablation occurs evenly around a spinning reentry vehicle. The Chinese were as worried about “the stability of the warhead in flight” as they were about protecting the bomb package inside. An unstable reentry body might fail completely, but it is more likely to just wildly miss the intended target—say landing in San Jose when it was aimed at San Francisco. That’s a problem, of course, but Kim Jong Un might be content with such an outcome.      Conclusion      It is not surprising that some people in the US or ROK government think that, yes, North Korea might be able to do these things. Nor is it surprising that others would counsel caution, suggesting that North Korea hasn’t put all together in a single test. North Korea’s missile and nuclear “developments have been accompanied with extremely belligerent, aggressive public rhetoric toward the United States and South Korea,” Clapper testified in 2013. “North Korea has not, however, fully developed, tested or demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear- armed missile.” In other words, prove it.      But is that really what we want? Looking at the Chinese example, do we really want to insist that North Korea arm a missile with a live warhead and conduct a demonstration? A much better solution is trying to negotiate limits on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Such limits would not eliminate the threat these programs pose, but they might keep them unreliable. That would be an achievement.      I’ll be the first person to say that we should not exaggerate the capabilities of North Korea’s nuclear forces, but underestimating them is every bit as bad. The North Koreans are developing military capabilities that we will, sooner or later, have to deal with. I just happen to think that negotiations, as frustrating as they may be, are the best of a series of unappealing options.      Moreover, underestimating the North Koreans often means that, when they surprise us, our political system over-compensates, passing from denial straight into panic. Consider the case of the August 1998 Taepodong launch. The US intelligence community had assessed, in 1995, that “No country, other than the major declared nuclear powers, will develop or otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years that could threaten the contiguous 48 states and Canada.” As it turns out, more than fifteen years later, they were right. (And the fine print on North Korea and the Taepodong program was pretty decent, as well.) So, when North Korea launched a Taepodong in 1998 with an unexpected third stage that failed, the intelligence community got a great big “congratulations” for a job well done. Oh, wait, no it didn’t. The intel was right, but that didn’t matter in part because the technical assessment didn’t convey North Korea’s ambitions to develop a capability that outstripped its abilities.      Just imagine if North Korea were to conduct a live demonstration of a nuclear weapon on a Nodong out to sea. Even if it didn’t work, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo would go bonkers. That’s worth keeping in mind. Yes, the North Koreans probably stink at making compact warheads and accurate reentry vehicles. But that’s not quite the same thing as saying they aren’t trying, that they don’t have some confidence in these capabilities or that we shouldn’t keep trying to find ways to discourage them from testing these systems.

(Kns/AFP/Getty Images)      North Korea claimed Wednesday that it has been able to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit on a missile — a development that, if verified, would mark a major advance in the country’s military capabilities and the threat it can pose to the world.      Pyongyang has a habit of exaggerating its technical abilities, and the latest assertion comes amid widespread doubts about its purported test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile this month.      But Kim Jong Un’s regime is known to have been working simultaneously on a nuclear weapons program and missile technology, and analysts widely believe that it is just a matter of time until North Korea puts the two together through “miniaturization.”      The North’s National Defense Commission, or NDC — its top military authority, chaired by Kim — said it was able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on an intercontinental ballistic missile, designed to be fired at the mainland United States.      “It is long since [North Korea’s] nuclear striking means have entered the stage of producing smaller nukes and diversifying them,” a spokesman for the NDC said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.      U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his plan to visit a North Korean industrial complex has been scrapped after Pyongyang retracted its approval. (Reuters)      [Kerry on North Korea]      North Korea “has reached the stage of ensuring the highest precision and intelligence and best accuracy of not only medium- and short-range rockets, but long-range ones,” the KCNA report continued, according to a translation by South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency.      The report added that this month’s purported submarine missile test was part of the North’s “byungjin” policy, under which Pyongyang hopes to advance its nuclear weapon capabilities and its economy.      Pyongyang claimed it had sent a “world-level strategic weapon” soaring “into the sky from underwater.” State media ran photos of Kim aboard a boat holding binoculars as the rocket blasted out of the sea. But that purported test has been widely discredited.      On Tuesday, Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the North Koreans “have not gotten as far as their clever video editors and spinmeisters would have us believe.”      “They are years away from developing this capability,” he told a forum in Washington.      Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., an expert on North Korea’s weapons programs and chief analytical officer at AllSource Analysis, a consulting firm, wrote that the test missile appeared to have been fired from a submerged barge rather than a submarine. The commentary was in a report for 38 North, a Web site devoted to North Korea.      North Korean television also ran only photos, rather than video, of the test, leading analysts to speculate that the missile had flown for only a few seconds. Notably, one of the photos was not cropped as it was in the newspapers and showed a ship towing a barge.      Still, experts put miniaturization of nuclear weapons as a distinct possibility for the North. It has conducted three nuclear test blasts and regularly launches missiles of varying ranges, advancing its capabilities with each test.      [Top defense chief in North reportedly put to death]      In a separate report for 38 North in February, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said it seemed “very plausible” that North Korea would be able to design nuclear weapons small enough to fit on a missile.      “I’ll be the first person to say that we should not exaggerate the capabilities of North Korea’s nuclear forces, but underestimating them is every bit as bad,” Lewis wrote. “The North Koreans are developing military capabilities that we will, sooner or later, have to deal with.”      A 2013 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said the agency had “moderate confidence” that Pyongyang had the ability to miniaturize its nuclear weapons and mount them on long-range missiles.      U.S. military officials have offered similar assessments more recently, although the military does not consider weapons to be operational until they have been tested.      “Our assessment is that they have the ability to put a nuclear weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the homeland,” Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command, told reporters at the Pentagon last month, referring to North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile.      This echoed an earlier statement from Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea.      [Photo gallery: Inside North Korea]      “I believe they have the capability to miniaturize the device at this point and they have the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have,” he said in October.      But Daniel Pinkston, a Seoul-based expert on North Korea’s nuclear weapons at the International Crisis Group, spoke of the difference between “rhetoric and reality” when it comes to Pyongyang’s claims.      “I think they probably have a small device that they can put on a missile, but as far as actually using it goes, no one has been able to demonstrate anything,” he said.      That Pyongyang was raving about its capabilities probably meant officials there were not yet certain, he said. “I think this shows a lack of confidence and a vulnerability,” Pinkston said.      Separately, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general and a South Korean, said Wednesday that the North had retracted an invitation for him to visit an inter-Korean industrial park Thursday.      The Kaesong complex, where companies from the South employ workers from the North just over the northern side of the border, has long been hailed as an example of inter-Korean cooperation.      Ban, who is in Seoul for an education conference, had said he would visit the complex on Thursday, but Wednesday he said that North Korea had decided against it. “This decision by Pyongyang is deeply regrettable,” he said.

Less than a month after North Korea says it fired a missile off a submarine, the country's National Defense Commission is now claiming it can craft mini nuclear weapons that fit on the tips of such missiles, Yonhap reports. "We have had the capability of miniaturizing nuclear warheads, as well as producing multiform weapons, for some time," reads a statement from the Korean Central News Agency, per CNN. "We can also guarantee the accuracy not only of short- to mid-range but also long-range rocket launches, for which we have had the technology for a long time." Even though North Korea is known for its chest-thumping and unverifiable claims, this particular one about weapons miniaturization is believable to US military officials who've been keeping tabs on the situation, CNN notes. Three main steps are involved in building and launching a nuke-carrying ICBM—creating the mini weapons in the first place, as well as ensuring they're strong enough to endure the long flight and solid enough to make it through re-entry—and Jeffrey Lewis, an arms expert who writes for a North Korea watchdog blog, believes Pyongyang can carry out all three, per CNN. However, the reliability and accuracy of such missiles is still up in the air, Lewis adds. Meanwhile, the vice chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff counters that North Korea is still "many years" from submarine-launched ICBMs, per the Washington Post (he believes photos of the recently reported launch were doctored). "They have not gotten as far as their clever video editors and spinmeisters would have us believe," Adm. James Winnefeld said.

The move appears to be a reaction to the presumptive GOP nominee's sagging poll numbers and weeks of difficulty as he prepped for a tough general-election fight with Hillary Clinton.      Hours after his abrupt exit, Lewandowski gave a pair of television interviews in which he put a positive spin on his exit.      "I wouldn't change one second of my time with Mr. Trump other than to say thank you, it's been an honor," the usually brash Lewandowski told MSNBC in brief comments.      In a nearly 30 minute interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Lewandowski said he didn't "know the answer" to why he was fired, but instead pointed to their record successes in the GOP primary campaign.      Later on Monday, there was a resignation from the campaign's staff preparing for the Republican National Convention. Michael Caputo, director of communications for caucus operations at the convention, quit after tweeting a message mocking Lewandowski's firing. "Ding dong the witch is dead!" Caputo tweeted, with a photo of the ruby slippers on the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East from The Wizard of Oz after she was crushed by a house.      "Unforced errors have no place on a general election campaign for the White House," Caputo said in a statement to NPR.      While some campaign sources tell NPR Trump's split with Corey Lewandowski was "mutual," another described it as a "firing" and a "summary execution." The source said the news was unwelcome for Lewandowski at the weekly Monday staff meeting. The "weekly Monday morning family meeting went awry for Corey," the source said.      Officially, the campaign tried to put a good face on it. "The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign," spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. "The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future."      Lewandowski has been with Trump since he began his presidential run, managing his shoestring operation. But as Trump has moved into the general election, a more traditional campaign structure largely managed by Paul Manafort, a former Ronald Reagan aide, has emerged. Within the campaign, Manafort and Lewandowski have been seen as competing forces. A campaign source told NPR that Trump previously had liked the competitiveness between the two.      "[Corey] knew there was a battle brewing. I am certain he thought he would win," one campaign source told NPR.      In his interview with CNN, Lewandowski denied any tensions between the two, telling Bash that, "Paul and I have been getting along amazingly well."      Lewandowski said he would remain a Trump delegate from New Hampshire and would continue to work to help him beat Clinton in whatever way he could and was leaving with no "professional" regrets.      The now-former campaign manager, though, has been a source of controversy himself. There were accusations — and a battery charge that was later dropped — following a confrontation with a former reporter for Breitbart News in which Lewandowski was seen on video appearing to grab her arm. The news of his ouster on Monday was first reported by the New York Times.      Trump stood behind Lewandowski amidst those charges at a time when his ouster would have been a given for any traditional campaign. But CNN reported Monday that the breaking point appeared to have been growing tensions between himself and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Sources confirmed to NPR that Kushner was indeed playing a bigger role in the campaign. Lewandowski told CNN's Bash that he had a good relationship with all of Trump's family.      Even though Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination more than six weeks ago, his campaign has yet to prepare for the usual rigors of a general-election campaign — hiring top staff, preparing a rapid response and communications team and beginning fundraising and building a data-analytics operation.      Instead, Trump has continued to swirl in controversy, targeting a judge presiding over the Trump University fraud case by accusing him of bias because of his Mexican heritage. He doubled down on his Muslim immigration ban and expanded it after last week's deadly shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. He called for a ban on anyone coming to the U.S. from any country with a proven history of terrorism against the U.S. or its allies. He also made confusing comments on guns, initially saying that if clubgoers had been armed, the shooter could have been stopped. He walked that back after even the NRA disagreed with him.      Lewandowski helped preside over Trump's unconventional primary campaign, bolstered by the billionaire businessman's sheer personality and ability to command the news cycles, dwarfing his GOP opponents. But in a general election, Trump hasn't been able to do the same.      Manafort was brought on earlier this year to help professionalize the skeletal, disorganized Trump operation. But there was reportedly tension between the two, with Lewandowski wanting to keep the same approach that had worked before, while Manafort worked to make Trump pivot to a more disciplined general-election approach. ||||| One day you’re just a smiley PR lackey; the next, you’re a major operative in the nuttiest campaign in decades. Such is the strange year in the life of Hope Hicks, the 27-year-old accidental press secretary for Donald Trump. How did she get here? And how much longer can she last?      From the antechamber to Donald Trump's office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, I was fetched by Hope Hicks. She was apologetic for the wait and a little nervous about what I'd come to discuss—namely, her.      The 27-year-old press secretary was clad in a teal dress, and she dug her stilettos into the colorless carpet as she showed me into the office, a room festooned with enough Trump memorabilia to suggest a serial killer's shrine. There before me sat Trump himself, behind his giant desk, upon which there was nothing resembling a computer, a PalmPilot, or even an Etch A Sketch.      “Oh,” Trump said, flashing his notorious disdain for handshakes as I extended my arm. He stood and reached, Martian-like, for my hand, as if the ritual were not the habit of businessmen or politicians. Hicks, meanwhile, settled into a $5,000 red velvet Knoll lounge chair. She affixed a smile to her face, and then said nothing more to me. As if speaking were not the habit of a spokesperson. But then, Hicks—who never appears on TV and rarely talks to reporters—resembles a traditional political spokesperson about as much as Trump resembles Mister Rogers.      Hicks is a product not of Washington but of the Trump Organization, a marble-walled universe where one's delightful agreeability and ferocious loyalty are worth more than conventional experience. She is a hugger and a people pleaser, with long brown hair and green eyes, a young woman of distinctly all-American flavor—the sort that inspires Tom Petty songs, not riots. And yet Hicks has, almost by accident, helped architect the strangest and least polite campaign in modern American history.      I wanted Hicks to help me understand just how all this had come to pass, how a person who'd never worked in politics had nonetheless become the most improbably important operative in this election. But she declined my request to talk. Instead, she arranged something more surreal: I could talk about her with Donald Trump, in front of her.      EDITOR’S PICK      Trump, of course, has little experience with subjects other than Trump, which he made clear when I asked him about Hicks's quick ascent to his inner circle. “Bill O'Reilly last night said it is the greatest political event in his lifetime,” Trump said, exaggerating O'Reilly's point. “The most incredible political event in his lifetime! That's pretty big. You know, who knew this was going to happen? So…” He pivoted, reluctantly, to the topic at hand. “Hope's been involved from the beginning, and she has been absolutely terrific.”      Hicks's job—a sui generis role of outsize importance that she half invents on the fly—involves keeping the media at bay and operating as Trump's chief gatekeeper. But she's also summoned in critical moments of confusion to play instigator and score-settler. It was her job to facilitate Trump's rebuke of the Pope after His Holiness questioned the Christianity of anybody who would build a border wall (kind of Trump's thing). And it was she who helped malign a female reporter who'd been manhandled by Trump's campaign manager, immediately claiming she was a lying attention hound. Hicks was also called on this spring to explain why Trump, over the course of three days, advocated four positions on abortion. She tried without success to quell the confusion, declaring, finally, that President Trump would end abortion, simple as that: “He will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn.”      Still, for all the grenades Hicks has to both jump on and lob, it's a more quotidian skill set that seems to impress the boss. “If you see her phone going”—he raised both hands and mimicked Hicks answering several devices—“ ‘This is Hope. This is Hope. This is Hope.’ ” He hung up the make-believe phones. “She gets a call a minute, probably,” he said, seemingly pleased with this antiquated barometer of his own popularity.      If Hicks is not much like a conventional press secretary, well, that's all the better for Trump, who hasn't ever wanted one. “He's always been good at being his own spokesman,” Howard Rubenstein, the New York publicist who represented Trump in times of tumult, told me. (Rubenstein might have been speaking literally. In the '80s and '90s, Trump reportedly employed flacks called “John Barron” and “John Miller,” spokespeople who'd phone reporters, sounding suspiciously like Trump.)      Of course, a central component of Trump's appeal is his lack of political experience, which he advertises as proof that once in office, he will do things differently, and better. Similarly, Hicks, a registered but dispassionate Republican since 2008, had never so much as volunteered on a campaign. So I asked Trump if he viewed her outsider status as an asset, much as he did his. “No, I don't think there's a benefit to that,” he said flatly and frankly, “but she was able to build political experience quickly. She was very natural. She was very natural when it comes to picking it up, and a lot of people can't pick it up, because it's so fast-moving. It's faster-moving than anything else. You know, for real estate, you have two days to get back. This thing”—by which he meant campaigning to lead the free world—“you have, like, four seconds before the story goes blasting out.”      As Trump prattled on about the crazy-making swiftness of it all, it wasn't hard to imagine the idea resonating with Hicks, now blushing. The speed with which your whole life can spin—it has to be disorienting. I looked at Hicks, trying to ascertain a reaction, but her face was buried in her hand. And it was clear, just then, that to wonder what Hicks has gotten herself into is to wonder something similar about ourselves.      Hicks's big job in politics started—not that long ago—with a comparatively tiny gig in Trump Tower. In 2012, two years after she'd graduated from Southern Methodist, Hicks was working for a New York PR shop when she was dispatched to help one of the firm's major clients: Ivanka Trump.      At the time, Trump's daughter was expanding her fashion line, and Hicks was enlisted to pitch in—and even do a bit of modeling, appearing online in a practical mint-colored dress, black clutch, and heels, all from the Ivanka Trump collection.      Hicks grew close to Ivanka and began dressing like the heiress, who seemed worthy of the emulation. Ivanka was that rare female corporate leader who is also kind to other women, and she affected an air of competence that seemed to temper the boorishness of the Trump brand. Conveniently, as Hicks ingratiated herself to Ivanka, she won over The Donald as well—helped by the eager-to-please disposition she'd displayed since childhood.      In Greenwich, Connecticut, as a kid, she was an athlete and a model who—after appearing in a Ralph Lauren ad—told a local magazine she intended to be an actress. By high school she was swimming, rowing, and captaining the lacrosse team. (She'd go on to play on SMU's club team.) Kylie Burchell, Hicks's lacrosse coach, recalled her as one of the only players to abide by a no-alcohol policy. “I think the girls were annoyed at her a little bit,” she said. “She was trying to be a leader. She was showing by example what to do.” She wasn’t always so earnest, however. In her senior yearbook, she mistakenly attributed the words of Eleanor Roosevelt—“The future belongs to those who believe in the power of their dreams”—to Jimmy Buffett.      That Hicks, a pretty young lady from a tony town, would gravitate toward PR after college might have seemed obvious. Warranted or not, the PR Girl has become a kind of stereotype—the land-bound stewardess of the aughts. A profession thought to require little more than the ability to walk in a pair of Louboutins and harass people via e-mail. But the sorority-girl caricature wasn't what Hicks had in mind, or in her pedigree. In addition to her father, Paul, who directed PR at the NFL and now works for the D.C. power firm Glover Park Group, both of Hicks's grandfathers worked in public relations.      After meeting Matthew Hiltzik, a New York PR shark, in 2011, Hicks landed a job at his firm. It was here that she began working with Ivanka, putting her in the orbit of The Donald, who was quickly impressed. “I thought Hope was outstanding,” Trump told me, recalling his decision to tell Hiltzik that he was poaching Hicks to work for him. In Trump's telling, Hiltzik was powerless to deny him what he wanted. “I wouldn't say he was thrilled,” Trump told me, “but, you know, we give him a lot of business.” (Hiltzik says the parting was amicable all around.)      So Hicks joined the team at Trump Tower in October 2014, without any idea her new boss intended to become president. Or that she had just signed on to his campaign.      One day in late January of last year, Hicks was summoned to Trump's office. There she found Michael Cohen, Trump's ball-busting attorney, and Sam Nunberg, a nervy political adviser and protégé of Trump confidant Roger Stone. On the speakerphone was Corey Lewandowski, a journeyman operative whom Trump had just hired for a purpose unclear to Hicks.      To the assembled, Trump said simply: We're going to Iowa. Hicks must have known that that meant jumping into a media circus that might change her life, though she wondered only one thing, half in jest: What do people wear in Iowa? Soon she was at the Iowa Freedom Summit, fielding media requests and improvising in the role of real-deal political press secretary.      Within the tight, alpha-male circle of hired guns, Nunberg could sense her unease. A tall, heavyset man with slicked-back hair, Nunberg gifted Hicks a book, Running for Office. He nicknamed his new friend “Hopesicle” and quickly developed a fondness for her. “She was very cute, because she was very anxious at first about all of this,” he told me as he sipped a Thai iced tea at a restaurant on the Upper East Side. “I joked with her once, like, ‘You're like my Peggy, like I'm Don Draper.’ ”      In reality, there was plenty of competition for the role of bizarro Don Draper in the Trump gang. Michael Cohen—a consigliere of The Donald's for a decade, with a near-parody Long Island accent—told me he didn't know what to make of the novice Hicks. When he answered my call, he was in the midst of yelling at someone else on his other phone (showing a dexterity with the phone Trump would have appreciated, I'm sure). He described Hicks to me as a “sensitive person” who “takes things personally” when it comes to the coverage of her boss.      Hicks wasn't expecting to be the press secretary for long. Trips to key primary states came and went with nobody taking her place, though. Just ahead of Trump's formal announcement in June, Hicks's ambivalence about her position created drama fit for an episode of The Apprentice. Lewandowski, a short man with a shorter fuse who looks like a cross between Frank Sinatra's mug shot and Voldemort, would play a starring role.      EDITOR’S PICK      A 42-year-old operative who'd worked for the Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity, Lewandowski was now the campaign manager. Hicks was told she couldn't work for both the political and corporate branches of the Trump team. She had to choose: Join the campaign or go back to the kids' floor of Trump Tower. Hicks, who hates to disappoint, nonetheless told Lewandowski he'd have to find a new press secretary, which apparently set him off. “He made her cry a bunch of times,” Nunberg said. In Nunberg's telling, Lewandowski said to Hicks, “You made a big fucking mistake; you're fucking dead to me.” Lewandowski declined to either confirm or correct Nunberg's recollection. “I don't recall the specifics of that,” he told me. “I can say definitively that I don't recall the specific incident that you're referring to.”      Hicks reconsidered when Trump told her to stay. As she traveled with him and a tiny band of staffers around the country, things with Lewandowski eventually mended. Meanwhile, Lewandowski was consolidating power. Racist Facebook posts Nunberg had made beginning in 2007 surfaced and prompted his firing. (He trashed everyone from Al Sharpton to Marxist Muslims to Louis Farrakhan.) Nunberg believes it was Hicks and Lewandowski who petitioned Trump for his ouster and drafted a brutal statement that characterized him as a “low-level part-time consultant.”      Nunberg still seemed wounded eight months later, when we met. “Of course she ratfucked me, which makes me proud,” he told me. Nunberg maintains no feelings of warmth for Lewandowski. “I literally will suck the fucking blood out of his skull by the time I'm done with him,” he said like a screwball gangster. Not long after Nunberg's firing, his mentor, Stone, left. (Stone says he quit, but the campaign claims he was fired.) The circle was getting smaller, and Hicks, the only staffer without a bald spot or a tough-guy lilt, had apparently learned how to hang on.      Trump's campaign headquarters in Trump Tower occupy an old fifth-floor production studio for The Apprentice. The walls are plywood, decorated by lawn signs and cutouts of Trump. For warmth there's a space heater. Befitting its TV past, the place feels quite literally like the backstage workroom from which the whole Trump Show is produced.      Getting the most out of the star requires keeping him informed. While Trump nurses an obvious addiction to cable news, the reading that's put in front of him is largely confined to a topic he already knows well. Every morning, staffers print out 30 to 50 Google News results for “Donald J. Trump.” He then goes at the sheaf with a marker, making circles and arrows and annotating things he likes or doesn't like. The defaced article gets scanned and e-mailed to the journalist or the person quoted who has drawn Trump's attention, under the subject line “From the office of Donald J. Trump.”      As for what arrives in Hicks's in-box, a typical day brings upwards of 250 media requests. Usually, she alone decides who gets in and who's kept out. But sometimes it's Trump who plays bouncer for his own private party. “She sees the tantrums, and there are tantrums,” a source who's been with Trump and Hicks told me. “He reads something he doesn't like by a reporter, and it's like, ‘This motherfucker! All right, fine. Hope?’ He circles it. ‘This guy's banned! He's banned for a while.’ That's exactly how it works.” Hicks plays parole officer to an extensive and expanding blacklist of outlets and reporters (your correspondent once included) no longer welcome at his events.      While Hicks is often eager to please, she doesn't mind upsetting the media and harbors no reverence for the civic duties of a free press. When reporters send her questions, she's often irked—convinced they're playing detective merely to irritate the campaign. She's seemingly unaware that they might just be vetting a potential United States president. Often she doesn't respond.      None of this has earned her many enemies, however. Like Ivanka, Hicks has managed to float above it all. For now. “I have always found Hope to be great to deal with,” Maggie Haberman of The New York Times told me, “especially given the volume of requests she must be getting.”      The demands of her schedule led to a breakup with her boyfriend of six years. And while she technically still lives in Greenwich—with her sister, Mary Grace—when she's not traveling on Trump Force One, Hicks stays in New York, in a Trump apartment provided by the campaign.      Getting cocooned in Trumpville can test one's psyche or dent one's reputation. Maybe even put one on a self-destructive streak. In May, Hicks, thinking she was e-mailing Trump strategy notes to a campaign staffer, sent them instead to a reporter. Days earlier, she'd landed in the New York Post after she was spotted on East 61st Street, screaming at Lewandowski. The spectacle was dismissed as an interoffice dispute. Though if that's to be believed, the emotional scene, as described to me by people who saw it—Hicks's fists balled, her face streaked with tears—makes you wonder what the hell goes on in the Trump War Room.      Outside the campaign, Hicks's colleagues gossip about whether she'll regret her heady first brush with politics. “She made a choice to work for the most fascist candidate in recent American history,” one political spokesperson told me. “Everyone who knows her tells her to stop doing this and putting her name on stuff.… She is going to regret everything she's said and done. And I don't think she knows it yet.”      Hawking golf resorts one day, Mexican-border walls the next, could Hicks have guessed what her job would become? The gig she signed up for called simply for the ceaseless execution of one man's whims. And she did it with such aplomb that maybe she didn't notice that while the directive never changed, the stakes sure had.      When I sat with Trump in his office—a few days before he locked up the nomination—I asked him if she would someday serve in a Trump administration. “Oh, yeah, sure,” he said, deciding on Hicks's future while she smiled silently and helplessly beside me. “In either capacity, either there, or she'll stay here, but, uh,” he said, “I think she wants to go there.”      Olivia Nuzzi covers politics for The Daily Beast.

Trump fired his wunderkind campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Monday at the campaign’s regular Trump Tower meeting.      “Corey was escorted out of the building,” a source close to the campaign told Breitbart News.      advertisement      Lewandowski came to the meeting unaware that he had lost the support of the GOP presumptive nominee, the source said. At the meeting, attended by both senior campaign staff and members of the family, Trump reviewed different campaign metrics that were all faltering: cooperation with party leaders, fundraising, surrogate operations and most importantly the polls.      The campaign manager seemed to have run out of ideas. When the New York City developer asked Lewandowski what he would do to turn things around, the only thing he could come up with was for Trump to announce his pick for vice-president.      Pitching that as the solution sealed his fate, the source said. “The VP pick was the one piece of suspense that would make people tune into the convention—Corey wanted to give that away now? There was no way.”      When the time came for Trump to lower the axe, no one spoke up to defend Lewandowski.      One month ago, Lewandowski was reported in the New York Post to have had a screaming match with the campaign’s press secretary about the running of the campaign on an uptown Manhattan street four blocks up from Trump Tower.      Afterwards, there was speculation that Lewandowski was in trouble. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The decision to part ways with the loyal aide was Trump's and he told Lewandowski Monday morning in a "direct conversation." Trump's top strategist, Paul Manafort, will be moved into the campaign manager role, two sources tell NBC News.      While Trump and Lewandowski are close, Trump made the decision because of systemic problems in the campaign that had spilled out into the public, leaving Trump's campaign floundering amid sinking poll numbers and image problems, multiple sources from inside the campaign said.      Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed Trump Campaign Manager Ousted 1:28 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      “The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign,” spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. “The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.”      Speaking on Fox News Channel later Monday evening, Trump himself told Bill O'Reilly, "[Lewandowski’s] a talented person. He’s a good guy. He’s a friend of mine. But I think it’s time now for a different kind of a campaign."      Lewandowski's firing is a significant move that will have major implications on the campaign just one month before the Republican Party's nomination convention. It also appears to be a surprise as Lewandowski was with Trump at campaign events and fundraisers as recently as this weekend.      Lewandowski's exit comes at a time when Trump's poll numbers are slumping, he's struggling to implement an organization to run a national campaign, criticism from Republican officials continues to mount, and efforts to deny Trump the nomination emerge.      “I’m willing to share in the successes and also share in the failures. Being the head of the organization, if there are failures of this campaign they lay in my hands and that is what happens when you are a leader and there are consequences for failures,” Lewandowski said in an interview on MSNBC's "MTP Daily."      Though he declined to get into the specifics of why he was let go, Trump's former right-hand man did mention his boss' second-place finish in Iowa as an area he came up short. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz won the first nominating contest of the 2016 campaign, though Trump quickly rebounded with a major win in New Hampshire.      Related: The United States of Trump: An inside look at the voters who took over the Republican Party      After the primaries concluded, Lewandowski had been assigned internal management of major portfolios, including Republican outreach, the running mate search and liaison to the transition team. But a reservoir of mistrust existed in the fragile relationship between Lewandowski and the Republican National Committee. Lewandowski told associates he did not feel the RNC had been fully transparent in early meetings after Indiana's primary. There was concern about whether the party would fully get behind Trump or focus more on preserving a majority for Speaker Ryan and Senate Republicans, according to concerns.

In an earlier interview with NBC News, Lewandowski said he is "honored" to have been able to work with Trump and that he will continue to support the nominee in his role as head of the New Hampshire delegate chair. He also offered to play a role in the campaign in either a "formal or informal" role.      The Trump campaign had been in internal turmoil as Lewandowski clashed with Manafort, a seasoned campaign operative who has attempted to polish Trump and employ a more traditional campaign structure. Lewandowski is known for letting "Trump be Trump," a mantra that some within the campaign say has caused serious, unnecessary errors. And the two have blocked each other from hiring top aides.      On Fox News, Trump acknowledged to O'Reilly that his campaign doesn't have an traditional structure.      "I have 73 people," Trump said. "Hillary Clinton has like almost 900 people. And we’re in the same position. So you know there’s something nice about that. I got criticized for that."      Trump's children, especially Ivanka, have been unhappy with Lewandowski, according to campaign sources. She has been unnerved "for months," especially after Lewandowski was accused of physically assaulting female reporter, Michelle Fields. But Trump had remained loyal to his campaign manager. When asked if Trump would dump Lewandowski in March after, Trump said, "I don't discard people. I stay with people."      Much of Lewandowski's power was reinforced by his access to the candidate. He was almost always at Trump's side and able to deflect his own detractors.      That strategy has, until now, worked.      After Trump's drop in the polls, his children were able to make the case that Lewandowski was no longer fulfilling a need. Ivanka and his other children, Donald Jr. and Eric, attended the meeting Monday morning when Lewandowski was let go.

"It should give Republicans some comfort that he gets it," said a Trump insider.      "He knows that it hasn't been working," said another source.      For those in the GOP establishment and more broadly who have asked and even pleaded, "Is he willing to do what is necessary?" Lewandowski's firing is a signal that Trump is willing to do what it takes to win.      Highlighting the divisions within the campaign, Trump's New York state director Michael Caputo took to Twitter immediately after the news broke.      Caputo resigned hours after sending that tweet.      “I don’t know Michael Caputo and he was never paid by the campaign, he was a volunteer so he’s welcome to tweet anything he wants to,” Lewandowski said on MSNBC. “He’s an overzealous volunteer.”      Campaign adviser Tana Goertz, who like Lewandowski has been a part of Trump's campaign since he announced one year ago, said his firing "needed to be done."      "This was news to me, yes definitely, but the campaign has move into a new direction," Goertz said on MSNBC. "Going into the general election we all have the same goal and that is to get Mr. Trump into the White House and defeat Hillary Clinton. So this was-this was what needed to be done.      Here's a timeline of some of the major moments of Corey Lewandowski's tenure, beginning with Trump's New Hampshire win.      February 9, 2016: Trump wins New Hampshire primary.      March 8, 2016: Lewandowski allegedly yanks on the arm of reporter Michelle Fields at an event at Trump National Golf Club.      March 10, 2016: Fields publishes a full account of the incident on Breitbart’s web site. Trump’s campaign responds, calling the allegation “entirely false.” Fields tweets a photo of bruises on her arm.      March 11, 2016: Lewandowski tweets at Fields "you are totally delusional. I never touched you. As a matter of fact, I have never even met you.”      March 15, 2016: Despite the swirling controversy, Trump publicly congratulates Lewandowski at his March 15 primary victory speech, saying "good job, Corey."

A senior Trump staffer tells New York that Trump's kids—Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka—launched the coup that resulted in Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, getting the ax Monday morning. "Things went south for Lewandowski, and he was fired," the staffer says. Talk about going south: Lewandowski showed up for the regular Monday meeting at Trump Tower without knowing Trump had already turned against him, a source tells Breitbart. When Trump reviewed the campaign's problems (like sinking polls and low fundraising) Lewandowski said only that Trump's VP pick would turn the tide. That's when Trump fired him and had him escorted outside. "I don't know, I don't know the answer to that," Lewandowski said when asked on CNN why he was fired. He added that "things change as a campaign evolves" and said he'll continue to support Trump from "inside" or "outside the campaign." "Ding dong the witch is dead!" tweeted Michael Caputo, a top adviser who directed Trump's campaign in New York. He included a photo of the defeated Wicked Witch of the East from The Wizard of Oz. Ivanka was "particularly unhappy" with Lewandowski since he was accused of grabbing Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields by the arm, tweeted NBC reporter Katy Tur. The woman who broke the news of Lewandowski's ouster—press secretary Hope Hicks—is described by GQ as "a smiley PR lackey" who became Trump's "27-year-old accidental press secretary." Senior Trump strategist Paul Manafort will take Lewandowski's place, sources tell NBC News. A former aide to Ronald Reagan, Manafort was seen as Lewandowski's rival in the campaign, per NPR. "[Corey] knew there was a battle brewing," says a campaign source. "I am certain he thought he would win."
summarize: Tiger Woods race row: Sacked caddie causes outrage with 'black a***hole' outburst at awards dinner      Steve Williams posted an apology on his website      Woods' management said comment was 'regrettable'      By Emily Allen            Last updated at 4:37 PM on 5th November 2011      Tiger Woods' former caddie Steve Williams has apologised for causing outrage at an awards dinner when he made a racist remark about his former boss.      Williams was given an award for the year’s best celebration - a reference to his tongue-in-cheek claim that his current employer Adam Scott’s victory at the Bridgestone Invitational in August was ‘the best win of my career’ - despite being on the bag with Woods for 13 majors.            Asked what the celebration was all about, the 47-year-old New Zealander said: ‘It was my aim to shove it right up that black a**ehole.’      Centre of storm: Steve Williams stunned guests at a gala dinner with a racial slur when accepting a prize for 'best celebration'      The comment was met with a mixture of laughter and shock at the ceremony, with some players turning to each other with eyes widened and jaws agape.      One caddie said: ‘Never have you been in a room and seen so many jaws drop at the same time. We knew he was an idiot but we didn’t know he was a racist idiot. I was standing next to a European Tour official who said, “Thank God he is not on our tour”.’      Approached early the next morning at breakfast, Williams was stunned to learn that British tabloids had gone with the story.      'Why would they do that?' he said. 'The whole thing was meant to be fun.'      He then posted a statement on his website saying: 'I apologise for the comments I made last night at the annual Caddie Awards dinner in Shanghai.            'Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. I now realise how my comments could be construed as racist.      Blast: Williams and Tiger Woods worked together for more than 10 years      'However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologise to Tiger and anyone else I have offended.'      The 100 caddies, players and guests in attendance had accepted their invitations on the condition they did not disclose what happened at the ceremony, held after the second round of the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament.      Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at Excel Sports Management, was with the golfer when he heard the news.      He said: 'It's a regrettable comment, and there's really nothing that Tiger can do or say. He's just going to move on.'      Williams, who could now face a ban or even the sack, had been a regular caddie for Woods since 1999 and helped the American to 13 majors before being fired in July.      He hit out at the manner of the split and a month later was in the news again after his new employer, Scott, won the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Akron, Ohio.            New boss: Williams with Adam Scott on the 16th hole during the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions at Sheshan International Golf Club this week      Williams had told reporters: 'It's the most satisfying win I've ever had, there's no two ways about it. It's the greatest week of my life caddying and I sincerely mean that.'      He later apologised for those comments, saying his emotions got the better of him.            Williams has disputed Woods' version of how their partnership ended, and said he was short-shrifted by Woods despite his loyalty to the former No. 1 player during the sex scandal that derailed his career.      Scott is today preparing for his third round of the HSBC Champions. He is going for his second World Golf Championship of the year.      Woods and Scott are to be in the same group next week at the Australian Open, and there's chance they also could face off at the Presidents Cup in Melbourne the week after.      It's not the first time Williams has run into trouble for his words.      Three years ago at a dinner banquet in New Zealand, he made a disparaging remark about Phil Mickelson.      Williams said it was meant in fun, although he later apologised to Mickelson. ||||| Adam Scott is facing growing pressure to sack his caddie Steve Williams after he described Tiger Woods as "that black arsehole".      Williams, who was sacked by Woods earlier this year, made the comment while on stage at a "caddie of the year" awards ceremony on Friday. He later issued an apology to Woods and continued to carry Scott's bag during Saturday's third round at the Shanghai Masters.      It is understood that players, caddies and senior golf figures will ask Scott to consider Williams's position for this week's Australian Open in Sydney – where Woods is also due to play – and the following week's Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.      "It's not an issue for me," Scott said. "I think everything in that room last night was all in good spirits and a bit of fun and I think it probably got taken out of that room in the wrong context. Steve issued a statement and apologised and he did the right thing."      Williams was on stage to receive his award for "celebration of the year" when Scott won the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio in August, weeks after Woods sacked him. "It was my aim to shove it right up that black arsehole," he said on Friday.      Tiger Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, said: "I was with Tiger last night when he heard the news. We got multiple calls from people who sounded like they were leaving the caddie party. Tiger obviously wasn't there. He doesn't know exactly what was said. But if multiple reports, which all seem to be accurate, are true, then it's sad it's come down to this. It's a regrettable comment, and there's really nothing that Tiger can do or say. He's just going to move on."      Anti-racism groups said Williams's apology was insufficient. Sabby Dhalu, secretary of One Society Many Cultures, said: "I think there should be an investigation into his behaviour and I don't think an apology is enough. The only way to root it out and prevent other people from behaving in the same way is to take sterner action, in the form of disciplinary action and I think an investigation should be conducted." ||||| While attending a "caddie of the year" event in Shanghai, where he won "Celebration of the year" thanks to his ridiculous behavior following Adam Scott's win at the Bridgestone Invitational—including claiming the victory was the greatest of his career—Steve Williams was asked why he made such an absurd statement and said "I wanted to shove it up that black arsehole."      Advertisement      I can only imagine there were many audible gasps and much sucking of teeth after that damned record player skipped for the final time. Indeed, " organisers of the awards ceremony, held at the players' hotel, had declared the occasion 'private' and 'off the record' but when the guests spilled out of the venue they could talk of little else. 'I have never seen so many jaws drop in one room at the same time,' said one caddie who was present. 'I was standing next to a European Tour official and he said to me 'thank God he [Williams] is not on our tour'."      For "his" part, Williams seems to have realized that he is a stupid person and quickly apologized on his website. "He" wrote "I apologize for comments I made last night at the Annual Caddy Awards dinner in Shanghai. Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist. However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended."      Advertisement      Adam Scott has, once again, been forced to defend his caddie's idiocy and remains loyal and unperturbed. He shot birdie-birdie-eagle on the final three holes to find himself three strokes back of the lead going into the final round of the World Golf Championship. He said he thought the quote was probably taken out of context.      Scott seems like a decent guy and I'm sure is privately pissed because it takes a special kind of person to make Tiger Woods look like a victim. It takes an arsehole, really.            Caddie Steve Williams In Race Row After Attack On Tiger Woods [The Guardian]            Adam Scott Withers Another Steve Williams Moment And Stays In Picture At HSBC [Washington Post] |||||	– Tiger Woods' old caddy shocked the professional golfing world yesterday by calling Woods "that black arsehole," Deadspin reports. Accepting an award for "best celebration" yesterday in Shanghai, Steve Williams was asked why he called Adam Scott's win at the Bridgestone Invitational the greatest victory of Williams' career. "I wanted to shove it up that black arsehole," said Williams, filling the room with shock and laughter, the Daily Mail reports. Naturally, the backpedaling came swiftly. Williams posted a apology on his website, saying, "I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist. However I assure you that was not my intent." Golfer Adam Scott, facing pressure to fire Williams, said, "It's not an issue for me," and called the remark "all in good spirits," the Guardian reports. Wood's agent said it was "sad it's come down to this. It's a regrettable comment, and there's really nothing that Tiger can do or say. He's just going to move on."
