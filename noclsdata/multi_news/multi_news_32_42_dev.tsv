(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press)      The vote was 238-180. It came after the House had overwhelmingly rejected a largely symbolic measure to give President Barack Obama the authority to continue U.S. involvement in the military operation against Moammar Gadhafi's forces.      The funding measure would have barred drone attacks and airstrikes but allowed the United States to continue actions in support of NATO.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      The House on Friday overwhelmingly rejected a measure giving President Barack Obama the authority to continue the U.S. military operation against Libya, a major repudiation of the commander in chief.      The vote was 295-123, with Obama losing the support of 70 of his Democrats one day after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made a last-minute plea for the mission.      While the congressional action has no immediate effect on American involvement in the NATO-led mission, it was an embarrassment to a sitting president and certain to have reverberations in Tripoli and NATO capitals.      The vote marked the first time since 1999 that either House has voted against a president's authority to carry out a military operation. The last time was to limit President Bill Clinton's authority to use ground forces in Kosovo.      The House planned a second vote on legislation to cut off money for the military hostilities in the operation.      House Republican leaders pushed for the vote, with rank-and-file members saying the president broke the law by failing to seek congressional approval for the 3-month-old war.      Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he supported the president's authority as commander in chief. "But when the president chooses to challenge the powers of the Congress, I as speaker of the House will defend the constitutional authority of the legislature," he said.      Some Democrats accused the GOP of playing politics with national security. They said the vote would send the wrong message to Gadhafi.      Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the vote would essentially "stop the mission in Libya and empower Moammar Gadhafi."      Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, White House spokesman Jay Carney expressed disappointment.      "We think now is not the time to send the kind of mixed message that it sends when we're working with our allies to achieve the goals that we believe that are widely shared in Congress: protecting civilians in Libya, enforcing a no-fly zone, enforcing an arms embargo and further putting pressure on Gadhafi," Carney said. "The writing's on the wall for Colonel Gadhafi and now is not the time to let up."      Carney also dismissed the action as just one House vote.      The defeated resolution mirrors a Senate measure sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and John McCain, R-Ariz., that Obama has indicated he would welcome. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider the resolution on Tuesday.      The second vote to eliminate money for the Libya operation would make an exception for search and rescue efforts, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, aerial refueling and operational planning to continue the NATO effort in Libya. That measure has no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.      House Republicans and Democrats are furious with Obama for failing to seek congressional authorization as required under the War Powers Resolution. The 1973 law, often ignored by Republican and Democratic presidents, says the commander in chief must seek congressional consent for military actions within 60 days. That deadline has long passed.      Obama stirred congressional unrest last week when he told lawmakers he didn't need authorization because the operation was not full-blown hostilities. NATO commands the Libya operation, but the United States still plays a significant support role that includes aerial refueling of warplanes and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance work as well as drone attacks and bombings.      A New York Times report that said Obama overruled some of his legal advisers further incensed members of Congress.      In a last-ditch effort Thursday, Clinton met with rank-and-file Democrats to explain the mission and discuss the implications if the House votes to cut off funds. The administration requested the closed-door meeting.      Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minn., said Clinton apologized for not coming to Congress earlier. But he said she warned about the implications of a House vote to cut off money.      "The secretary expressed her deep concern that you're probably not on the right track when Gadhafi supports your efforts," Walz said.      Rep. Howard Berman of California, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said such a vote "ensures the failure of the whole mission."      Earlier this week Clinton said lawmakers were free to raise questions, but she asked, "Are you on Gadhafi's side, or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been bringing them support?"      In the Senate, backers of a resolution to authorize the operation wondered whether the administration had waited too long to address the concerns of House members.      "It's way late," said McCain, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. "This is one of the reasons why they're having this veritable uprising in the House, because of a lack of communication. And then the icing on the cake was probably for them when he (Obama) said that we're not engaged in hostilities. That obviously is foolishness."      He added, however, "That is not a reason to pass a resolution that would encourage Moammar Gadhafi to stay in power."      Earlier this month, the House voted 268-145 to rebuke Obama for failing to provide a "compelling rationale" for the Libyan mission and for launching U.S. military forces without congressional approval. ||||| The House of Representatives refused to authorize U.S. involvement in the NATO mission in Libya on Friday but also rejected an effort to cut off partial support for the mission, sending contradictory messages in a pair of votes that demonstrated the deep divisions in both parties over the use of American forces in the conflict.Despite growing frustration in Congress over the White House 's handling of the Libya mission, the failure of the back-to-back votes in the House will preserve the status quo for now, allowing the U.S. military to continue operations in Libya.The attempt to strip funding was in large part an attempt to give voice to that frustration. Republicans blasted the president as conducting an unconstitutional military mission, while setting a dangerous precedent that would give the executive branch nearly unchecked power to wage war."If the president believes that missile strikes and drone operations taking place in Libya are critical, it is his responsibility to explain [that] to the American people and to seek authorization from this Congress. Because the president has failed to do that ... we are here today," House Speaker John Boehner said from the floor before the vote.The White House argues that because the United States is acting as a part of NATO, its engagement does not meet the definition of "hostilities" that requires congressional authorization under the War Powers Act.The argument has won over few in Congress, even Democratic allies. But opponents of the House bill argued that the solution was to authorize the Libya mission. Cutting off the funding was merely an attempt to score political points while risking damage to the U.S.' relationship with allies, they argued."If we want our allies to stand by us in our time of need in Afghanistan we have to stand by them in places like Libya," said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). "We're either in an alliance or we're not."Earlier, an attempt to authorize the current level of military force in Libya for one year failed. That measure, identical to one with bipartisan support in the Senate, was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of 123-295. Seventy Democrats joined with Republicans to reject the measure, and eight Republicans voted for the measure.The funding bill failed 180-238. It would have cut all U.S. financial backing for the mission until authorized by Congress. It makes an exception for a short list of specific activities not directly related to a typical definition of "hostilities," including intelligence gathering, search and rescue, aerial refueling and planning.Opponents argued that the bill would essentially end U.S. involvement in the mission.Even if it passed, the bill would have had virtually no chance of becoming law. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has expressed support for the mission in Libya and was not expected to bring it up for a vote.Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. |||||	– House Republicans wanted to deliver a one-two rebuke to President Obama today over Libya, but they'll have to settle for half that: Good news for Obama: A GOP-led measure to cut off funds for the military operation failed 238-180.

"We need to bring this to a conclusion -- today," Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters during a search for the suspect, identified as Steve Stephens      "There is no need for any further bloodshed in this incident tonight," Williams added.      Police said late Sunday that Stephens "may be out of state at this time," and authorities called on residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan "to be on alert."      Stephens didn't know the elderly victim he killed around 2 p.m., said Cleveland authorities, who did not release a motive.      Stephens also claimed publicly to have committed multiple homicides , according to police. Williams said, "Currently, there are no other victims that we know of."      Cleveland Police said homicide suspect Steve Stephens was last seen driving a new model Ford Fusion.      Authorities said Stephens is a black male who is 6-feet 1-inch and weighs 244 pounds. He has a full beard.      Stephens was last seen wearing a dark blue and gray or black striped polo shirt. Stephens is driving a white Ford Fusion with temporary license plates, according to Cleveland police.      Authorities believe Stephens recently purchased the car.      'What happened today is senseless'      "He is considered armed and dangerous, so we want people to be careful out there," Williams said.      The FBI is assisting Cleveland police in the search for Stephens. Nearly five hours after the shooting, Williams said authorities hadn't had a verifiable report of a sighting of Stephens. Hundreds of leads had poured into the department, police said.      "What happened today is senseless and if Steve has an issue, he needs to talk to some folks to get that resolved," Williams said.

The video on Stephens' Facebook page showed a gun being pointed at an unidentified man's head. The gun is fired and the man recoils and falls to the ground. The video was posted Sunday afternoon and Facebook later disabled access to it.      The video of the shooting was not broadcast live. It was previously recorded and then uploaded to Facebook by Stephens, according to a Facebook spokesperson.      In a statement, the spokesperson said the shooting was a "horrific crime."      "We do not allow this kind of content on Facebook. We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety," the statement said.

"From what we can tell now, it's just a random person that he picked out. We don't know why," Williams said.      Godwin had just left his children's home after eating an Easter meal and was walking home when he was killed, CNN affiliate WOIO reported.      "He is a good guy. ... He'd give you the shirt off his back and I'm not just saying that for these cameras," Robert Godwin Jr. told WOIO. "This man right here was a good man. I hate he's gone ... I don't know what I'm going to do. ... It's not real."      Godwin's daughter, Malisa Godwin, said: "It feels like my heart is going to stop."      Police earlier had reported the victim's name as Goodwin.      'Mad with his girlfriend'      Stephens' mother, Maggie Green, told CNN she had spoken to her son on Sunday and he told her he was "mad with his girlfriend. That's why he is shooting people and he won't stop until his mother or girlfriend tell him to stop."      Steve Stephens in shown in a Facebook video on Sunday      Green said she told her son to stop. She said she was upset and in disbelief.      Cleveland Police were interviewing Stephens' girlfriend on Sunday, Loomis said.      Stephens is employed at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency in northeast Ohio that serves children, teenagers and families, according to a spokeswoman for the facility.      "We are shocked and horrified like everyone else," said Nancy Kortemeyer, a spokeswoman for Beech Brook. "To think that one of our employees could do this is awful."      Kortemeyer could not provide any details on the length of Stephens' employment at Beech Brook, or his specific job title.      The hunt for Stephens caused alarm. Cleveland State University issued an alert on social media. The shelter in place advisory was lifted Sunday evening.      Williams said the city was not on lockdown and urged people to watch out for each other. He said Cleveland police had paired up in squad cars as they hunted for Stephens. Other law enforcement officers were also riding with Cleveland officers, the police said.      "He needs to turn himself in so that he can get the help that he needs and he can't keep victimizing this community based on his issues," Williams said. |||||	– Police in Cleveland say a man shot and killed another man Sunday while broadcasting it on Facebook Live.

(Associated Press)      Harris County Sheriff's Maj. Armando Tello said authorities had detained a person of interest. He did not provide any details about the people who were wounded, such as whether they were students or included the person who was arrested.      Authorities thought there could be a second shooter, according to a law enforcement official in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the ongoing case.      The school's official Twitter feed said the shooting was between two people and that the situation was under control. It had issued an alert on its website earlier, telling students and faculty to take immediate shelter or avoid the campus.      Aerial footage from local television stations showed police cars and ambulances parked on the Lone Star College System campus about 20 miles north of downtown Houston. Emergency personnel could be seen tending to people on stretchers, while others ran from a building led by officers.      Mark Smith, spokesman for the Harris County Emergency Corps, said four people were taken to two hospitals. He said at least two had gunshot wounds, and one appeared to have had a heart attack related to the shooting. He said one was in critical condition.      Relatives identified Jody Neal, 24, as one of the people who was shot and said he was taken to Harris Health Ben Taub Hospital Emergency Center with gunshots in his arm, stomach and leg.      "He was sitting in the study room. There (were) three people on the computer and a guy walked up the stairs and opened fire on him," Stacy Neal, Jody's sister, told KPRC-TV. "They said it was just one guy that came in with a gun."      Other students said they were studying or waiting for classes to start when they heard gunfire about 12:30 p.m.      "I didn't think they were shots," said Daniel Flores, 19. "It sounded like someone was kicking a door."      He was in a second-floor tutoring lab with about 60 people. Once they realized the sound was gunfire, they fled to the nearby student services center, where authorities kept them for about 30 minutes before letting them go, Flores said.      Cody Harris, 20, said he was in a classroom with about six or seven other students waiting for a psychology class to start when he heard eight shots. He and other students looked at each other, said "I guess we should get out of here," and fled.      "I was just worried about getting out," Harris said. "I called my grandmother and asked her to pick me up."      The shooting comes one month after a gunman attacked an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children and heightening security concerns at campuses across the country. In Texas, several school districts have either implemented or are considering a plan to allow faculty to carry guns on campus. The Texas Legislature this year may also debate a bill that would allow guns on college campuses.      The Lone Star College System has an enrollment of 90,000 students and six college campuses, according to its website. Its programs in Harris County include training to be a paramedic.      Mark Zaragosa said he had just come out of an EMT class when he saw two people who were injured and stopped to help them. Officers had not yet arrived, he said.      "The two people that I took care of had just minor injuries," Zaragosa told KHOU. "One gentleman had a gunshot to the knee and the (other) actually had an entry wound to the lower buttocks area."      Keisha Cohn, 27, who also is studying to be a paramedic, said she was inside a building about 50 feet away from where the shots were fired. She heard "no less than five" shots and started running.      She fled to the learning center, which houses computers and study areas. Eventually, a deputy showed up and escorted people out, she said. She left her car on the campus, which was evacuated and closed for the rest of the day.      ___      Associated Press writer Eileen Sullivan contributed to this report from Washington. ||||| Page 1 of 1      A student stuck in her classroom at Lone Star College while a gun man was reportedly shooting in the hallways outside frantically tweeted to her family and friends Tuesday.

summarize: A 3-year-old toddler reported kidnapped more than a year ago in South Florida was found safe Monday about 280 miles away in Palatka, according to the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office.      Lilly Abigail Baumann is back with her father, Robert Baumann, after someone saw the child on a Sunday-night CNN segment on “The Hunt with John Walsh” and realized she and her mother were her tenants, the Sheriff’s Office said.      The child’s 23-year-old mother, Megan Elizabeth Everett, has been booked into the Putnam County jail on no bail on warrants for charges of kidnapping, interference with custody and concealing minors contrary to a court order, according to authorities. The FBI issued a bulletin on the case last summer.      While no Amber Alert was issued, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement did issue a Missing Endangered Persons report on the little girl, saying she “may be in the company of” Everett.      The child was reported missing May 13, 2014, when Everett failed to return her daughter to the girl’s father as directed in their custody agreement, according to the FBI. Everett had moved out of that home and taken their daughter with her and had not been seen since.      When the father went to pick up his daughter, Everett’s boyfriend answered the door and told him she “doesn’t live here. She moved,” and slammed the door in his face. She also left a note that said she did not want their child vaccinated, according to “The Hunt With John Walsh” show.      “If I let them take her and vaccinate her and brainwash her, I wouldn’t be doing what’s right,” the note read. “I cannot let a judge tell me how my daughter should be raised. We will miss you, but I had to leave. I know she will be safer and happier with my family and I. Love, Meg and Lilly.”      On May 19, 2014, the Sunrise Police Department issued an arrest warrant for Everett, and she also was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution less than a month later, the FBI reported.      The FBI’s missing person’s report indicated that the mother and child could be traveling in a silver 1999 Saturn with Florida plates.      But it was a Putnam County landlady who saw the CNN show and realized that Everett and the little girl were renting a home from her on Motes Lane, south of Palatka, according to the Sheriff’s Office. The landlady called CNN, which in turn contacted the FBI. Agents from the Daytona Beach FBI office called the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office.      Capts. Joseph Wells and Dominic Piscitello led a team of deputies to the home. They surrounded it, then saw a woman and child inside and contacted them, the Sheriff’s Office said.      Lilly was recovered safe and spent Monday afternoon with a victims advocate from the Sheriff’s Office as she waited for her father. Everett was booked into the Putnam County jail on the outstanding warrants, the Sheriff’s Office said.      The CNN segment from “The Hunt with John Walsh” can be seen at cnn.com/2015/07/30/us/megan-everett-the-hunt-john-walsh/index.html.      Dan Scanlan: (904) 359-4549 ||||| A Sunrise woman who disappeared with her 2-year-old daughter last month to avoid having the child vaccinated now faces a federal criminal charge, according to court records.      Megan Elizabeth Everett, 22, was last seen on May 6, when Robert Baumann dropped off their daughter, Lilly, in compliance with a shared custody agreement. Lilly was supposed to be returned to Baumann a week later, but Everett never showed up.      According to court records, Everett left a note for her boyfriend, Carlos Lesters, vaguely explaining her actions.      "You are a great dad," she wrote, with the word "great" underlined. "If I let them take her and vaccinate her and brainwash her, I wouldn't be doing what's right. I cannot let a judge tell me how my daughter should be raised. We will miss you. But I had to leave."      The child was the subject of a custody battle that appeared to be resolved in April, when Broward Circuit Judge Steven Feren granted each side 50 percent custody. Lilly was to alternate between each parent's home, with the exchange taking place every Tuesday, said Baumann's lawyer, Donna Goldman.      Broward Circuit Judge Michele Towbin Singer signed a warrant on May 19 to arrest Everett on charges of kidnapping, interference with custody and concealing a minor contrary to a court order. The federal charge accused Everett of crossing state lines to avoid prosecution for the state charges.      Baumann, an air-conditioning repairman, and Everett, a bookkeeper, were never married.      Everett's mother, Pam Everett, said Friday that the child belongs with her father. |||||	– Florida sheriff's deputies said today they have arrested Megan Everett, 23, who allegedly kidnapped her 3-year-old daughter last year to ensure she wouldn't be vaccinated, the Florida Times Union reports. Everett's landlady apparently saw them on the CNN show "The Hunt with John Walsh" and turned them in. It all began last year in Sunrise, Fla., when Everett didn't return daughter Lilly Baumann to her dad, Robert Baumann, as part of their custody agreement, the Sun-Sentinel reported at the time. Everett boyfriend Carlos Lesters said she had left only a note: "If I let them take her and vaccinate her and brainwash her, I wouldn't be doing what's right," it read. "I cannot let a judge tell me how my daughter should be raised. We will miss you. But I had to leave." But Baumann says vaccination wasn't the only issue between them: "She wanted to home-school my daughter," he says. "I didn't want that to happen. She didn't want Lilly to learn about black history. She just wanted her to learn about the Confederacy." As it happens, Carlos is described in court papers as a gun enthusiast who loves the Confederate flag and has family in the South. As for vaccinations, "I think she wanted to keep her from being vaccinated because that would keep her out of day care," Baumann says. Now Lilly is with her dad again, and Everett is in Putnam County jail on no bail on charges of interference with custody, concealing minors contrary to a court order, and kidnapping.

It's not clear who made the original error.      Kyle, who has been praised for his heroic service, has also faced scrutiny in the past over questions of accuracy regarding his story. He was killed in 2013 by another military veteran. ||||| HOUSTON (AP) — The number of medals slain Navy Seal and "American Sniper" author Chris Kyle received has been corrected following a military investigation.      The Navy investigation determined that Kyle earned one Silver Star and four Bronze Stars. In his best-selling book, Kyle wrote he had received two Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars.      Lt. Jackie Pau, a Navy spokeswoman, said Sunday the investigation didn't determine how the error happened but stated that errors on the discharge paperwork that lists such awards are not uncommon.      Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, didn't immediately return a phone call Sunday.      Kyle, regarded as the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, was killed in 2013 at a Texas shooting range. A former Marine was convicted in his death. |||||	– Chris Kyle claimed in his American Sniper memoir that he had been awarded a pair of Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars. The United States Navy, after some review, would beg to differ: The Navy revised Kyle's medal count downward, to one Silver Star and four Bronze Stars, reports Time. Kyle's discharge papers had yet a different number: Two Silver and six Bronze, though a Navy rep says that such clerical errors are not uncommon, notes the AP. Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, did not return a request for comment on Sunday.
summarize: SCHERTZ, Texas - UPDATE at 6:50 p.m.:      The Austin Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are confirming that the two packages located at separate FedEx facilities in the San Antonio and Austin area are connected to the previous four package explosions.      The previous four explosions occurred within three weeks between March 2 and March 18 in Austin.      Tuesday's package explosion, however, happened less than 70 miles south in Schertz at a FedEx facility. The second package, located at another FedEx facility in Austin, was disrupted by law enforcement officers, authorities said.      FBI, @Austin_Police and @ATFHou confirmed packages located at two separate FedEx facilities in the Austin/San Antonio area today are connected to the four previous package explosions that occurred between March 2 and March 18 in Austin, Texas. #PackageBombMurders — FBI SanAntonio (@FBISanAntonio) March 20, 2018      5:30 p.m.            The chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security committee says federal authorities informed him investigators have obtained surveillance videos in Austin that "could possibly" show a suspect in the package bombing at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio.            Congressman Michael McCaul told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's been briefed by the FBI, ATF and Austin police about the situation. But he adds that investigators are still pouring through the surveillance recordings.            Austin police earlier said another suspicious package was discovered at a second FedEx center near Austin's main airport. McCaul says evidence obtained from that package if kept intact could be key in finding the bomber.            McCaul, whose district includes Austin, says he hopes the bomber's "biggest mistake was going through FedEx."            3:45 p.m.            FedEx says it has turned over "extensive evidence" to authorities after a package exploded at its processing center in the town of Schertz, south of Austin.            In a statement, the company says "the individual responsible" for sending the package that blew up also shipped a second package that has been secured and turned over to law enforcement.            FedEx says it gave authorities evidence "related to these packages and the individual that shipped them collected from our advanced technology security systems."            A company spokeswoman subsequently refused to say if that second package might have been linked to a suspicious package that authorities seized at another FedEx shipping facility on Tuesday, this one in south Austin, near the city's airport.            No arrests have been made in the five bombings that have rocked the Austin area since March 2.      12:45 p.m.      FedEx released a statement confirming the individual responsible for the Schertz package bomb also shipped a second package that was secured and turned over to law enforcement.      The statement also says the delivery service has turned over extensive evidence related to the packages and the individual who shipped them "collected from [their] advanced technology systems."      12:37 p.m.      The San Antonio Police Department clarified chief William McManus misspoke when he said there was a second package discovered at the FedEx facility in Schertz. Authorities did not find a secondary device at the facility.      12 p.m.      Federal investigators say the package that exploded at a FedEx facility in Schertz is believed to be linked to the string of bombings in Austin.      "It would be silly for us not to admit that we suspect it's related," FBI agent Michelle Lee said.      President Donald Trump is blaming a "very sick individual or individuals" for a series of bombings in Austin, Texas.      Trump said during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that the situation is "terrible."      He says, "This is obviously a very sick individual or individuals" and that authorities are "working to get to the bottom of it."      11:10 a.m.      Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told an Austin TV station that the bomb that blew up at the FedEx facility in Schertz was mailed from Austin to Austin.      Multiple sources are reporting that the package was mailed from a privately owned FedEx store in Sunset Valley.      The FedEx website lists the location of the FedEx office on Brodie Lane as only having a drop box for packages inside the building. Meaning whoever drops off a package at that location must go inside the store.      San Antonio Chief of Police William McManus said there were two packages at the Schertz FedEx facility during a media briefing, but only one exploded. NOTE: SAPD has since stated that McManus misspoke during the 10:30 a.m. press conference and that there were not two packages at the facility.      Chief McManus is urging people not to panic, but to stay cautious.      He said more security could be possible with the upcoming NCAA tournament taking place in downtown San Antonio.      10:15 a.m.      During a media briefing, Schertz Chief of Police Michael Hansen said an explosion was called into the Schertz Police Department at 12:25 a.m.      Members of SAPD, ATF and FBI arrived at the Schertz FedEx facility shortly after.      The package exploded when it was traveling down an automated conveyor belt, Hansen said.      Hansen also said that he’s confident the facility and Schertz area are not a target and that the area is secure.      The FedEx facility has been evacuated and unidentified parcel delivery services are working with FedEx to deliver packages that are still currently at the facility, said FBI Assistant special agent in charge James Smith.      A woman was treated for ringing ears as a result of the explosion, Hansen said.      APD responded to 420 suspicious package calls between 8 a.m. yesterday and 8 a.m. today bringing the total number to 1,257 calls since approximately 8 a.m. on March 12. — Austin Police Dept (@Austin_Police) March 20, 2018      ---      Here's the latest on the explosions in Schertz and Austin according to the Associated Press:      8:35 a.m.      The White House says the federal government is doing "whatever is necessary" to apprehend whomever is responsible for a series of explosions in Austin, Texas.      Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tells Fox News Channel that President Donald Trump is aware of the situation.      Sanders says federal authorities are working closely with local authorities and have offered their full support and cooperation "to make sure we're doing whatever is necessary and whatever is possible" to stop the explosions and find whomever is responsible.      8:30 a.m.      A heavy law enforcement presence is surrounding the FedEx distribution center in Schertz.      The area around the facility is heavily industrial and features warehouses and parking lots empty except for parked trailers.      A woman who identified herself as an FedEx employee emerged from the shipping facility wrapped in a blanket as the sun rose Tuesday and said she'd been evacuated. She declined to give her name.      ---      (Original Story)      One person was hurt when a package exploded at the FedEx ground distribution facility in Schertz overnight, authorities said Tuesday.      The incident occurred just before 12:30 a.m. at the facility located in the 9900 block of Doerr Lane, which is located not far from Highway 3009 and Nacogdoches Road.      According to officials, the medium-sized package contained metal shrapnel and nails and was headed to Austin when it exploded on a conveyer track, injuring one person. The explosion comes as authorities search for answers regarding a series of explosions that have shaken Austin.      FIRST LOOK: Aerial photos show up close look at serial bomber's latest attack in Austin      READ: Austin bombings work of serial bomber, police chief says      Special Agent Michelle Lee of the FBI in San Antonio told the Associated Press on Tuesday that it is still early in the investigation, adding that “it would be silly for us not to admit that we suspect it’s related” to the four Austin bombings that have killed two people and injured four others since March 2. The latest bombing in Austin injured two men on Sunday.      Roughly 75 employees were working at the processing plant when the package exploded. The person hurt sustained a concussion-like injury from the detonation of the package, officials said.      Presently the FBI is leading an investigation that includes the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as well as Schertz police and the San Antonio Police Department bomb squad. Officials said the scene has been secured.

Hours later, police sent a hazardous-materials team to a FedEx facility in Austin to check on a suspicious package there. There was no immediate word about whether that package contained a bomb.      FBI agent Michelle Lee said the explosion happened around 1 a.m. at a FedEx facility in Schertz, which is just northeast of San Antonio and about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Austin. A worker was treated for minor injuries and released, police said.      “It would be silly for us not to admit that we suspect it’s related” to the four Austin bombings that have killed two people and injured four others since March 2, Lee said. She did not have details about the size, weight or description of the package.      The package was on a conveyer belt when it detonated. One worker reported ringing in her ears after the blast. She was treated and released from a hospital.      Schertz Police Chief Michael Hansen said the intended target of the bomb was not the shipping facility or anyone in Schertz. But neither the police chief nor federal agents would say where the package was sent from, where it was being shipped or give any other details about the investigation.      The FedEx blast came less than two days after another bombing wounded two men Sunday night in a quiet Austin neighborhood. It was triggered by a nearly invisible tripwire, suggesting a “higher level of sophistication” than agents saw in three package bombs left on doorsteps, according to Fred Milanowski, agent in charge of the Houston division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.      Authorities have not identified the two men who were hurt Sunday, saying only that they are in their 20s and white. But William Grote told The Associated Press on Monday that his grandson was one of them and that he had what appeared to be nails embedded in his knees.      Police described the men’s injuries as significant, and both remained hospitalized Monday in stable condition.      Grote said his grandson was in a lot of pain. On the night of the bombing, one of the victims was riding a bike in the street and the other was on a sidewalk when they crossed a tripwire that he said knocked “them both off their feet.”      “It was so dark they couldn’t tell, and they tripped,” he said. “They didn’t see it. It was a wire. And it blew up.”      Grote said his son, who lives about 100 yards (90 meters) from the blast, heard the explosion and raced outside to find both of the young men bleeding profusely.      The presence of a tripwire was a departure from the first three bombings, which involved parcels left on doorsteps that detonated when moved or opened.      The tripwire heightened fears around Austin, a town famous for its cool, hipster attitude.      “It’s creepy,” said Erin Mays, 33. “I’m not a scared person, but this feels very next-door-neighbor kind of stuff.”      Authorities repeated prior warnings about not touching unexpected packages and issued new ones to be wary of any stray object left in public, especially ones with protruding wires.      “We’re very concerned that with tripwires, a child could be walking down a sidewalk and hit something,” Christopher Combs, FBI agent in charge of the bureau’s San Antonio division, said in an interview.      Police originally pointed to possible hate crimes, but the victims have now been black, Hispanic and white and from different parts of the city.      Local and state police and hundreds of federal agents are investigating. The reward for information leading to an arrest has climbed to $115,000.      “We are clearly dealing with what we believe to be a serial bomber at this point,” Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said, citing similarities among the four bombs. He would not elaborate, though, saying he did not want to undermine the investigation.      While the first three bombings all occurred east of Interstate 35, a section of town that tends to be more heavily minority and less affluent, Sunday’s was west of the highway. The differences in location, the lack of a motive and other unknowns make it harder to draw conclusions about any possible pattern.      Thad Holt, 76, said he is now watching his steps as he makes his way through a section of town near the latest attack. “I think everybody can now say, ‘Oh, that’s like my neighborhood,’” he said.      The latest bomb was anchored to a metal yard sign near the head of a hiking trail, Milanowski said.      “It was a thin wire or filament, kind of like fishing line,” he said. “It would have been very difficult for someone to see.”      Authorities have checked more than 500 leads, Milanowski said. Police asked anyone with surveillance cameras at home to come forward with the footage on the chance it captured suspicious vehicles or people. |||||	– Hours after pleas for information about Austin's serial bomber, a package bound for the city exploded at a FedEx facility near San Antonio, injuring one. The explosion was reported just after midnight Tuesday at the FedEx Ground distribution center in Schertz, 65 miles southwest of Austin. A medium-sized box with an Austin address, containing nails and metal shrapnel, exploded on a conveyor track, reports KSAT, noting a worker suffered a concussion and was treated at the scene. The FBI is investigating and says it's "more than possible" the blast is linked to recent bombings in Austin, which have killed two and injured four, WREG reports. Some $115,000 is offered for information on the alleged bomber, reports the Washington Post.
summarize: V. Stiviano says Donald Sterling's racist comments on an audio recording leaked to the public were not the first by the Los Angeles Clippers owner in conversations with her.      FILE - In this Dec. 19, 2010, file photo, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, third right, sits with V. Stiviano, left, as they watch the Clippers play the Los Angeles Lakers during an NBA preseason... (Associated Press)      "There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one. This was one of very many," Stiviano told Barbara Walters on ABC's "20/20" in an interview that aired Friday night. "Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know."      Sterling told Stiviano in the recording that she should not post online photos of herself with black people, including basketball great Magic Johnson, or bring black people to Clippers' games.      The recording, which an attorney for Stiviano said was leaked by a third party, led to public outcry across the country and the NBA. Some sponsors dropped the Clippers and others re-evaluated their relationship with the NBA.      On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5 million and urged league owners to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners is required to force him to sell.      Though Stiviano told Walters that Sterling should "absolutely" apologize, she said she still loves him like a father figure and does not believe he is a racist.      "I think Mr. Sterling is from a different generation than I am," she said. "I think he was brought up to believe these things ... segregation, whites and blacks. But through his actions he's shown that he's not a racist. He's shown to be a very generous and kind man."      Stiviano said that since the ban, Sterling has felt confused, alone and not supported by those around him.      "I think he's highly more traumatized and hurt by the things that he said himself," she said. "I think he can't even believe or understand sometimes the thing he says, and I think he's hurt by it. He's hurting right now."      A real-estate mogul, Sterling has been accused of racial missteps before.      The billionaire had paid a $2.76 million settlement to resolve a federal lawsuit accusing him of systematically excluding blacks and Hispanics from his rental properties. He also won a wrongful termination lawsuit by general manager Elgin Baylor, who accused him of various slurs and slights. ||||| Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s confidante V. Stiviano today told ABC’s Barbara Walters that she thinks the embattled NBA basketball owner should apologize for his racist remarks.      Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      "Yes. Absolutely,” Stiviano, 31, said when Walters asked her during an exclusive television interview in Los Angeles.      "I think he’s highly more traumatized and hurt by the things that he said himself,” she added. “I think he can’t even believe or understand sometimes the thing he says, and I think he’s hurt by it. He’s hurting right now."      Donald Sterling's 2002 Battle With an Ex-Mistress Has Similarities to Today      NBA Bans Clippers Owner Donald Sterling For Life      NBA Owner Believes Donald Sterling Ouster Vote Will Be Unanimous      Why Woman Accused of Leaking Racist Rant Changed Her Name      ESPN: Full Coverage      Asked if she thought he would go through with a public apology, Stiviano replied: “God only knows.”      This is the first television interview for Stiviano since the NBA handed Sterling a lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine on Tuesday for his racial remarks about African-Americans featured in a leaked audiotape recording.      Prior to this interview with ABC News, Stiviano had been seen in public wearing a large visor over her face, which she said made it “easier to mask the pain."      The interview comes a week after TMZ released the audio recordings, which subsequently launched the league investigation that led to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to ban Sterling for life. The NBA Board of Governors will vote on whether Sterling will be forced to sell the team.      One of the mysteries surrounding the situation is how the audio recordings came to light. Stiviano, who was on the receiving end of Sterling’s rant on the leaked tapes and describes herself as black and Mexican, told Walters she did record their conversations, and shared them with friends. Stiviano said a friend leaked the audio.      But, she said, this rant -- in which Sterling told Stiviano not to “promote” her relationship with black people or “bring them to my games,” -- "was not the first time” they had these conversations.      “There’s been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one. This was one of very many,” she said. “Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There’s a number of other hours that the world doesn’t know.”      Stiviano denied having a romantic relationship with Sterling, saying she is his personal assistant and sees Sterling as “a father figure” -- calling herself his "silly rabbit." She claims that people around Sterling would say negative things about her to him, saying they “poison his mind and heart about things about me,” which would drive him to say certain things.      Despite the controversy around his comments, she said he is not a racist.      “I think Mr. Sterling is from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things … segregation, whites and blacks,” Stiviano said. “But through his actions he’s shown that he’s not a racist. He’s shown to be a very generous and kind man.”      Sterling, 80, has owned the Clippers since 1981. Sources also told ESPN Thursday that Sterling is battling cancer.      Stiviano is also currently tangled in a legal battle with Sterling’s estranged wife Rochelle Sterling. |||||	– Well, not everybody thinks LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling is a racist: V. Stiviano, the woman who started this whole mess by recording her private conversations with him, offered up some decent words about him last night to Barbara Walters of ABC News: On racism: "I think Mr. Sterling is from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things … segregation, whites, and blacks. But through his actions he's shown that he's not a racist. He's shown to be a very generous and kind man." Still, Stiviano said he "absolutely" should apologize for his remarks about black people, notes AP. On their relationship: Stiviano says she is his personal assistant and never had a romantic relationship with the 80-year-old. She says she loves him as a "father figure." 'He's hurting': "I think he's highly more traumatized and hurt by the things that he said himself. I think he can't even believe or understand sometimes the thing he says, and I think he's hurt by it. He's hurting right now." On how the tapes surfaced: Stiviano said she gave the tapes to friends for safekeeping and one of them leaked the audio to the media.
summarize: Get ready, LEGO fans: Tiny female LEGO scientists will storm toy aisles with their tiny scientific equipment starting this August.      That’s because the toy company just selected the Female Minifigure Set, which features a female chemist, a female astronomer, and a female paleontologist, as its latest LEGO Ideas Winner. Each scientist comes with their own equipment, including a chemistry lab, a telescope and a dinosaur skeleton, and the collection is called the “Research Institute.”      The idea was proposed by Dr. Ellen Kooijman, who wrote in her project proposal that professional LEGO figurines could “show that girls can become anything they want, including a paleontologist or an astronomer.”      Anyone can submit a proposal for a new LEGO set to the LEGO Ideas platform. Proposals that get more than 10,000 votes get reviewed by the company as a potential real-world project.      The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now      LEGO has been criticized for its lack of female toys after a 7-year old girl wrote to the company earlier this year asking why only male toys got to do cool things. In her handwritten letter which went viral, Charlotte Benjamin lamented that there were “more LEGO boy people and barely any LEGO girls” and observed that “all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs, but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people … even swam with sharks”      Benjamin was apparently not excited about the “Lego Friends” series, which features pink-clad figurines who get their hair done, make cupcakes, and drive around with their girlfriends.      Write to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com. ||||| Science-themed project was submitted to Lego Ideas by Dr Ellen Kooijman, who recognized a gender gap in toy sets      Women in science are taking one tiny, plastic step forward after Lego announced on Tuesday it will launch a series of female scientists and their lab tools.      The science-themed project was selected as the latest Lego Ideas winner, and is set to hit shelves in August 2014.      The series – notably devoid of pink – includes an astronomer with a telescope, a paleontologist with a dinosaur skeleton and a chemist in a lab.      The project idea was submitted by Dr Ellen Kooijman, a geochemist in Stockholm.      In her project proposal, Kooijman wrote: "The motto of these [s]cientists is clear: explore the world and beyond!"            The toy company has been criticised in the past for its gender-based marketing tactics, and in particular, over a line of building blocks geared for girls called Lego Friends, featuring slim female figurines that lock into pastel-painted settings such as a beauty salon and bakery.            The debate even prompted a seven-year-old girl to write a letter to Lego asking why there are "more Lego boy people and barely any Lego girls".      In her letter, Charlotte Benjamin lamented how "all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and had no jobs," while the boy figures went "on adventures, worked, saved people and had jobs".      On her blog, Kooijman, an avid Lego builder, said she recognized a gender gap among the figurines.      "As a female scientist I had noticed two things about the available Lego sets: a skewed male/female minifigure ratio and a rather stereotypical representation of the available female figures," she wrote. "It seemed logical that I would suggest a small set of female minifigures in interesting professions to make our Lego city communities more diverse."      Lego Ideas is a site where enthusiasts can submit and vote on ideas for sets they want to see available in toy stores. When an project receives 10,000 votes, it then enters a review phase to be evaluated by a board made up of set designers and marketing representatives, according to its website.      After testing the concepts for stability, playability, safety, market fit and more, the board selects one idea to become the next Lego Ideas product. The creator is recognized for inspiring the product and receives a cut of the product's sales.      “We’re very excited to release Ellen Kooijman’s Female Minifigure set, featuring three scientists, now entitled 'Research Institute' as our next Lego Ideas set," Lego said in a statement on its site. "This awesome model is an inspiring set that offers a lot for kids as well as adults. The final design, pricing and availability are still being worked out, but it’s on track to be released August 2014, so keep an eye out!”      Lego had not returned a request for comment at the time of publication.      Kooijman’s scientists beat out six other potential projects, among them a Sherlock set and a Legend of Zelda set. ||||| At long last, LEGO will actually have new female figurines who do something other than bake and hang out at the beach.      The Denmark-based toy company has approved new designs for female scientist, paleontologist and astronomer characters from its LEGO Ideas online competition.      “We’re very excited to release Ellen Kooijman’s Female Minifigure set, featuring 3 scientists, now entitled “Research Institute” as our next LEGO Ideas set,” LEGO said in an official statement. “This awesome model is an inspiring set that offers a lot for kids as well as adults.”      As Kooijman put it, LEGO typically features a “stereotypical representation” of women in their figures, and she set out to change that.      “As a female scientist I had noticed two things about the available LEGO sets: a skewed male/female minifigure ratio and a rather stereotypical representation of the available female figures,” Kooijman wrote in a post explaining her project.      “It seemed logical that I would suggest a small set of female minifigures in interesting professions to make our LEGO city communities more diverse,” she added.      Support for the project was slow at first, but thanks to a flurry of tweets, it skyrocketed from around 2,000 supporters to 10,000 in just about one week.      Despite comprising nearly half of the U.S. workforce, and 60 percent of bachelor degree recipients, women filled only 24 percent of Science Technology Engineering and Math jobs in 2009, according to the Department of Commerce.      It’s an acute problem with no easy solution. But many believe that one piece of the puzzle is broadening the dreams and visions of young girls.      In 2013, LEGO introduced a “scientist” mini-figure to its collection, and though she had no particular specialty, it was warmly received.      But LEGO’S 2011 attempt to explicitly appeal to girls was resoundingly panned. LEGO Friends seemed like a Barbie knockoff — replete with lots of pink, short skirts, hanging out at the pool and of course, some good old baking. Its critics called the toy sets condescending and stereotypical, or worse: sexist.      Earlier this year, a 7-year-old girl wrote to the company to complain that “all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and had no jobs,” while the boys in LEGO toys “went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs.”      7yo Charlotte writes an adorable and strongly worded letter to LEGO regarding the lack of adventures for girls. pic.twitter.com/JblNKzCwJs — SocImages (@SocImages) January 28, 2014            Kooijman’s design is the first step in correcting this problem.      For this heightened awareness of the depiction of women in toys and the media, there are many decades of feminism to thank.      More recently, however, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has made changing the depiction of women in stock images a big priority, along with — somewhat controversially — a campaign to reclaim the word “bossy” as a compliment, not a critique.      And startup GoldieBlox captivated the world with its truly ingenious ad recasting the Beastie Boys song “Girls” as a mini-feminist anthem to the backdrop of young girls building and breaking things. (The ad did get the company embroiled in a copyright infringement lawsuit with the band, though.)      “Girls, you think you know what you want,” they sing. “You like to buy us pink toys, and everything else is for boys.”      LEGO’s new “Research Institute” set is on track to be released in August 2014, the company said. |||||	– Lego has apparently heard the criticism that its plastic universe is mostly a boys' club, and things will change this summer. A new line of figurines due out in August will feature a female chemist, paleontologist, and astronomer, reports Time. The set was suggested by a female geochemist in Sweden as part of the Lego Ideas platform in which regular folks get to suggest ideas that get put up for a vote. One thing the Guardian likes: The coming set looks "notably devoid of pink." It's about time, writes Abby Phillip at the Washington Post. The lack of women in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math is "an acute problem with no easy solution," she writes. "But many believe that one piece of the puzzle is broadening the dreams and visions of young girls."

Rene was a music producer who had been living at the home.      1:52 PM PT --The Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office tells TMZ Sports ... the dead body is a man, but he's NOT the owner of the house.      Officials will not release the identity until next of kin have been notified.      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional information will be provided when it is available and appropriate for release."      A dead body was found at the New Jersey home of NY Giants star Janoris Jenkins on Tuesday and now the Major Crimes Unit is investigating ... TMZ Sports has learned.      First off, we're told Janoris was out of the state when the body was discovered early Tuesday morning -- but sources connected to the NFL player tell us his camp is aware of the situation.      We don't know if cops have identified a suspect or even have a working theory on how the person died.      Sources tell us the body was discovered in the basement by a worker at the house. Law enforcement officers in Bergen County raced to the scene. We're told the coroner showed up a short time later.      The identity of the victim is unclear -- we know investigators are actively working the case.      One source connected to Jenkins says the NFL player has been in Florida and was not at the home when cops arrived.      We've reached out to JJ's reps for comment -- but, so far, no word back. ||||| The body of a music producer was found Tuesday inside a Fair Lawn home owned by New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins.      The dead man was identified Tuesday night as 25-year-old Roosevelt Rene, a Jenkins family friend. Jenkins, a Florida native, has reportedly been in that state since Giants mini-camp broke early this month.      Rene produced music under the name Trypps Beatz and numerous fans took to Twitter Tuesday night to post condolences.      How Rene died has not yet been determined, and is pending an autopsy by the Bergen County Medical Examiner's Office, authorities said.      Public records show that Rene previously lived in Dallas, Georgia, and Spring Valley, N.Y.      Jenkins was a second round pick by St. Louis Rams in 2012 and has been with the Giants since 2016, when he was selected to the Pro Bowl. He also raps under the name Rabbit during his time away from football.      TMZ reported that Rene's body was discovered in the basement by a worker at the home.      Roosevelt Rene, who was found dead in the New Jersey home of New York Giants player Janoris Jenkins in a possible homicide, was a hip-hop producer and artist who went by the name Trypps Beatz: https://t.co/yNn91iO2OR #breaking pic.twitter.com/THEPEWKYmt -- Tom Cleary (@tomwcleary) June 27, 2018      Jenkins purchased the house for $500,000 in 2016, public records show.      "The Bergen County Prosecutor's Office Major Crimes Unit and the Fair Lawn Police Department are investigating a death at [Jenkins' residence]," Acting Prosecutor Dennis Calo said in a statement.      NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported that law enforcement sources told him police are investigating the death as a "possible strangulation/suffocation."      Per law enforcement sources, police are investigating a possible strangulation/suffocation as the cause of death in the case of the body found at Giants CB Janoris Jenkins' home. -- Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) June 26, 2018      Fair Lawn Police Sgt Brian Metzler said police were called to the home at 10:22 a.m. and that members of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office and Bergen County Sheriff's Office were also on scene.      Metzler declined to give specifics about the investigation, but said police have never been called to Jenkins' home in the past.      A neighbor at the scene, who identified herself only as Debbie, said Jenkins lives at the home with his brother. She said she never had any issues with either of them and was shocked when she heard the body was found at the home.      Investigators were seen digging through the contents of a white Lexus sedan with Florida plates in the driveway as well as a Land Rover. They also removed several small brown paper bags from the home and loaded them into an unmarked prosecutor's office SUV.      Prosecutor's office detectives left the home around 9 p.m. and only a marked Fair Lawn Police car remained at the scene.      The Giants said that they were aware of, and monitoring the situation.      Jenkins, voted to his first Pro Bowl in 2016 is a key member of the Giants' secondary. However, he is coming off a season-ending ankle injury suffered in Week 9 against Washington last year. Despite the injury cutting his season short, Jenkins intercepted three passes and returned two of them for touchdowns, in addition to making 26 tackles.

(AP) — The brother of New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins was arrested and charged Wednesday with manslaughter in the death of a 25-year-man whose body was found in the NFL player's New Jersey home.      The Bergen County prosecutor's office said Wednesday 34-year-old William H. Jenkins, of Fair Lawn, was charged with aggravated manslaughter in the death of Roosevelt Rene, whose body was discovered Tuesday.      Acting Prosecutor Dennis Calo said William Jenkins is in custody in the Ontario County Jail in New York state. The investigation is ongoing.      Janoris Jenkins' home is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of MetLife Stadium.

The 29-year-old signed a five-year, $62.5 million contract with the team in 2016 and had an outstanding first season when he was selected to be a starter in the 2017 Pro Bowl.      His second season did not go as well. The veteran was suspended for a game for violating team rules in late October and eventually had his season end in late November by an ankle injury that required surgery.      He has intercepted 16 passes in six seasons and scored nine touchdowns.      Jenkins played at Florida from 2008-10 before finishing his college career at North Alabama. He was drafted in the second round by the St. Louis Rams in 2012.

summarize: To misquote Forrest Gump’s mother, ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ is like a box of chocolates. Or rather, it’s like a vast, family-sized festive crate of chocolates, all wrapped in the shiniest packaging, all exploding with sweetness and surprises. Maybe there are a couple of flavours you don’t much care for, and after a while it all starts to get a bit dizzying, but you stuff yourself anyway, coming up bloated and satisfied on the other side.      Based on one of Marvel Comics’ lesser known franchises, this is the tale of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), an earthling abducted as a boy who, a quarter of a century later, is working as a Han Solo-style outlaw-for-hire under the self-ordained nickname Star-Lord. When his quest for a mysterious orb attracts the attention of some blue-skinned intergalactic troublemakers, Quill throws in with a team of fellow outsiders including green-skinned warrior princess Gamora (Zoe Saldana), genetically enhanced raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), comically literal man-mountain Drax (Dave Bautista) and a self-regenerating, semi-sentient walking tree named Groot (Vin Diesel, typecast again).      There’s a basic good-v-evil plot in here somewhere, but it’s rendered largely impenetrable by a profusion of Marvel-verse asides which will only make sense to those who have followed the mythology across the entire comic and film franchise (some conversations seem to consist entirely of silly names jumbled up at random). No matter – the rest of us can just sit back and enjoy the ride, as the film ricochets from one dazzling, frazzling action set-piece to the next, pausing only to charm our socks off with another pithy retort, classic bubblegum-pop hit or cutely random alien character.      Some may find the film’s self-satisfaction a mite grating – Pratt is likeable but he’s no Harrison Ford, however hard he tries – and there are moments where the sheer brain-melting relentlessness becomes wearying. But overall this is giddy, ridiculous fun, a witty, wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a film. Marvel, you shouldn’t have! ||||| At the height of their powers, our overlords at Marvel have deigned to prove, like an emperor tolerating a court jester, that they do, in fact, have a sense of humor.      This image released by Disney - Marvel shows, from left, Zoe Saldana, the character Rocket Racoon, voiced by Bladley Cooper, Chris Pratt, the character Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel and Dave Bautista in... (Associated Press)      The Marvel universe, of course, isn't entirely lacking comedy, as we've seen in "Iron Man" and "The Avengers." But on the whole, the Marvel kingdom is built on an unshakable foundation of self-seriousness. The comic book studio seems to fear that if the solemnity of its fiction isn't diligently guarded, people might start questioning whether all these men in spandex merit quite so much attention.      Yet "Guardians of the Galaxy," a 3-D space opera about a ragtag crew of mercenaries, is Marvel's most irreverent film yet, and has a welcome, slightly self-mocking tone that dares to suggest intergalactic battles over orbs might actually be a tad silly.      This is all very much to the good, but the problem with "Guardians of the Galaxy," directed by James Gunn, is the weakness of the comedy it wears so proudly. It takes more than a soundtrack full of '70s tunes, a talking raccoon and a few gags about "Footloose" to be funny. It's "zany" in quotes.      As if demonstrating its tonal distance from Marvel's other planetary bodies, "Guardians of the Galaxy" takes place at the far reaches of space, where we find Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) skipping along on an abandoned planet. He removes his mask, presses play on a Walkman and does something normally sacrosanct in Marvel-land: He dances. Blaring is the irresistible 1974 hit "Come and Get Your Love" by Redbone, the first of many such old radio hits.      The music, as we learned in the prologue, is from a mixtape given to Quill as a child by his cancer-stricken mother shortly before her death. Distraught, he rushes outside only to — in quite the double-whammy — be beamed up by a spaceship.      Twenty-six years later, Quill is a Han Solo-like scavenger who stumbles across a silver orb also sought by some powerfully evil forces: Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace, obscured by makeup but still a severe presence) and his boss, Thanos (Josh Brolin). The warm spirit of "Guardians" owes much to Pratt, the guileless, formerly doughy "Parks and Recreation" star; his casting in inspired.      The resulting scrum for the orb introduces several more seekers: the green-skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista) and a CGI odd couple: a bitterly sardonic raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick, a talking tree called Groot (Vin Diesel) who looks like he sprouted from "The Lord of the Rings." All reluctantly unite like a sarcastic "Dirty Dozen."      The Guardians, who were first introduced in a 1969 comic, are far from Marvel's star players. But their not-primetime-player status is freeing to Gunn, whose 2010 comedy "Super" starred Rainn Wilson as a wannabe crime fighter. He wrote the film with Nicole Perlman, clearly aspiring for a rollicking adventure in the mold of "Indiana Jones" or "Star Wars," which the movie's poster evoked.      But the film is terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects. Presumably awaiting meatier work sequels to come, fine actors like Glenn Close, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro come and go with just a few lines. (How can a movie seeking humor in outer space not utilize Reilly?)      The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and "Guardians" depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat. Others, eager for any playfulness from Marvel, will surely be more excited by "Guardians of the Galaxy." To them I quote Solo: "Laugh it up, Fuzzball."      "Guardians of the Galaxy," a Walt Disney Studios release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for "intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and some language." Running time: 121 minutes. Two stars out of four.      ___      MPAA definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.

Chris Pratt (front) leads a ragtag band that includes Zoe Saldana (left) in "Guardians of the Galaxy."      Guardians of the Galaxy is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in such hot weather.      It's the first film based on a comic book to actually play like a comic book, a slick escapist treat.      Peter Quill (Chris Pratt of Parks and Recreation) is a freelance ravager (space pirate) who pilfers a mysterious orb. Suddenly, he's being chased by everyone with a warp drive.      In the most crazy and crowded prison in the cosmos, Quill puts together a ragtag crew of scoundrels from every quadrant of the sky, including a genetically enhanced trigger-happy raccoon (voiced almost unrecognizably by Bradley Cooper to sound like a cabdriver from Camden).      The gadgetry and fight scenes are nicely rendered. The aeronautical battles, though, fall well short of state-of-the-art. Maybe they're collateral damage to the film's goofy style.      Because the special effects in Guardians look slightly, almost intentionally, chintzy. It's as though director James Gunn wanted to make sure we stayed in the farce and didn't get sucked in by the sci-fi trappings.      This is entertainment straight out of the professional wrestling handbook: larger than life and emphatically artificial. Unless, of course, you believe the criminal class light years from our planet is exchanging banter cribbed from bad Bill Murray movies.      Speaking of pro wrestling, Dave Bautista, the WWE's Batista, has a wonderful turn as the Guardians' behemoth, Drax the Destroyer. And Zoe Saldana gives one of her best tinted-skin-alien performances yet as Gamora.      Pratt carries the film loosely, as the super-chill Quill, who seems to think he can sweet-talk his way out of the scariest situation.      Michael Rooker and John C. Reilly make the most of their comedic supporting roles. Also impressive as more grimly one-dimensional characters are Lee Pace (Halt and Catch Fire) and Doctor Who's Karen Gillan.      Guardians of the Galaxy has a crazy jukebox. Driven by Top-40 acts from the '70s like Elvin Bishop, Redbone, and the Five Stairsteps, it sounds like one of those cheesy K-Tel albums.      Oldies in space? Hey, it works, along with all the other disparate elements in this frothy action spoof. Guardians of the Galaxy throws everything in the blender, including, yes, Rupert Holmes' "Piña Colada Song."      dhiltbrand@phillynews.com      215-854-4875      @daveondemand_tv      Guardians of the Galaxy Directed by James Gunn.

Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Lee Pace. Directed by James Gunn. (PG-13. 121 minutes.)      "Guardians of the Galaxy" is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at. That just this little is enough to take "Guardians" into the realm of "not bad" says more about the state of action than it does about the movie itself.      It deals with an effort to save "the galaxy," but this is a notion without emotion. We are shown nothing about this particular galaxy that should make us care whether it gets saved or blown up like Vulcan in "Star Trek" (2009). There's no burning reason to root for one set of spaceships over the other. Rather, the mere concept of "saving the galaxy" is supposed to engage the audience - for two hours.      Yes, there are jokes, but most of these are along the lines of the movie's making fun of itself before we all notice there's nothing to take seriously. In place of wit, "Guardians" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening - and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it.      Lacking dimension      As for the three-dimensional visuals, there's little here that couldn't have been rendered just as well in two. In fact, the three dimensions just dim the movie into murkiness, making the experience too much like watching it with sunglasses on. Taking the 3-D glasses off during the close-ups provides the occasional relief.      The movie starts with a poorly acted but recognizably human situation, of a little boy saying goodbye to his mother, who is on her deathbed. After she dies, he stumbles out of the hospital, inconsolable. And just as we're forgetting the kind of movie we've signed up for, a flying saucer shows up - as unwelcome and as out of place as any fictional flying saucer in history - and beams the boy on board.      Twenty-six years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is a merry, roving space rogue, a happy-go-lucky fellow flying through the universe, living off his smarts, so it's a wonder he doesn't starve to death. He comes upon a metal orb, about the size of a softball, which apparently everyone wants for some intense yet unspecified purpose. Suffice it to say, it's like the ring in "The Lord of the Rings" or the little box that raised hell in the "Hellraiser" series.      Most of "Guardians of the Galaxy" consists of Peter trying to hold on to the orb, or trying to get the orb back, or trying to prevent someone from doing something really horrible with it. The actual powers of the orb aren't quite specified. The powers are there for the convenience of the screenwriters, to allow great but not ultimate damage, to make things always desperate but never hopeless, dangerous but still doable.      The situation is, in fact, analogous to that of Marvel Enterprises, which produced "Guardians," based on its comic book series. Right now, Marvel holds the orb of power, and it seems nothing can stop it. But will it really take over the entertainment galaxy? With movies like this? I'm beginning to doubt it.      Anyway, while the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) pursues him through the universe, Peter goes about putting together his team of misfit space guardians, which includes a half-man, half-raccoon (nicely voiced by Bradley Cooper), Zoe Saldana as a lethal and damaged woman of mystery, and a human-like tree, known as Groot. Vin Diesel is the voice of Groot, and something needs to be said about the use of Diesel in the promotion of this film. In the action realm, Diesel is a name to be reckoned with, an actor people look forward to seeing. But in "Guardians," his voice is not only unimportant; it's doctored. What's more, Groot has only one line of dialogue, which he repeats over and over. For all intents and purposes, there is no recognizable sign of Diesel in this movie - and too bad. He could have helped.      No time for boredom      John C. Reilly does appear, as a politician on a threatened planet, and he gets the film's few genuine laughs. Glenn Close also has a small role, lending an illusion of gravitas in exchange for a paycheck, which seems a fair exchange. To its credit, "Guardians of the Galaxy" belabors little, so there's no time to get bored, and the fact that it takes nothing seriously, including itself, saves it from all of the usual outer space ostentation.      It's a cheerful emptiness, neither good nor bad, and pleasant enough. ||||| Maybe you never heard of Guardians of the Galaxy, the Marvel comic franchise that wilts in the shadows while Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Avengers get all the love. Maybe you think a big-ass movie about wanna-be Marvel icons isn't worth your time.      Snap out of it. Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. It's insanely, shamelessly silly – just one reason to love it.      Another is the up-for-anything cast. Chris Pratt is blissfully right as Peter Quill, who calls himself the Star Lord, mostly because no one else will. Since age nine, when he was zapped from Earth into space after the death of his mother, Peter has been bounty-hunting around the cosmos in the corrupt employ of blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker).      If you're a fan of Pratt as chubby Andy Dwyer on Parks and Recreation or as the voice of Emmet in The Lego Movie or in supporting roles in smart movies such as Moneyball and Zero Dark Thirty, you'll want to catch him here. Whether he's busting funky dance moves to the 1970s oldies songs on his late mom's cassette player (he kills it on "O-o-h Child") or showing his chops as a space warrior, Pratt nails every beat in the role – comedy, drama, action and six-pack-baring stud appeal. Want to see Pratt become a full-fledged movie star? This is where it happens.      All praise to director James Gunn, the creative force behind the little-seen but muchadmired Slither and Super, for making his first epic an epic treat. The twisty script Gunn wrote with Nicole Perlman tests Peter's mettle with an impossible task: Collect major bucks and, oh yeah, save the galaxy by stealing a mysterious orb back from the evil Ronan (Lee Pace), who wants to use the orb's beyond-nuclear power for, well, the usual reasons.      Of course, Peter needs help, which he gets, reluctantly, from four loser misfits, much like himself. Zoe Saldana defines seductive stealth as Gamora, the green-skinned assassin that Peter hits on despite his rep for sleeping with enemy aliens. "That was one time," Peter objects.      WWE wrestling champ Dave Bautista brings ferocity and feeling to Drax the Destroyer, the tattooed hulk who wants to crush Ronan for killing his wife and daughter.      The real scene-stealers are computer-generated. Those who've always dismissed Vin Diesel as a wooden actor will get a kick out of hearing him voice the role of Groot, a walking tree whose one line of dialogue is "I am Groot." Diesel gets the last laugh, since he wrings those three words for unexpected humor and heart.      Top dog or, in this case, top rodent is Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, a growling, gun-slinging raccoon given to mouthing off at his fellow guardians. While giving surprising depth to this genetically altered raccoon, Cooper has a ball taking the piss out of friends and foes who mistake Rocket for a candy-ass cartoon.      You'll have a ball too. Guardians of the Galaxy is crowded with characters and incidents that sometimes spill over into confusion and chaos. Still, this orphan child of the Marvel universe possesses a wild-card energy and a throwaway charm that its bloated bigger-budget brothers should envy. Even a sequel doesn't inspire dread. Should the Guardians take on the Avengers? Hell, yeah! ||||| Hollywood saved it�s biggest summer blast for last.      �Guardians of the Galaxy� is the most successful space western since the first �Star Wars� trilogy, an irreverent mix of mismatched characters, heavy-handed baddies and huge battle sequences spiced up with sharp one-liners and a healthy helping of attitude.      There are no pretensions here, no deep thoughts or shallow thoughts trying to look deep. There is a lot of Indiana Jones in the script, with some Avengers and even a hint of �Firefly,� but all this movie wants to do is have big fun. Which is exactly what it does.      Then again, what else can you do when one of your main characters is a walking tree who can only say three words � �I am Groot�? You�d better be having fun.      �Guardians� centers on Peter Quill (aka Star Lord), played by Chris Pratt, the �Parks and Recreation� star who also voiced one of this year�s top films, �The LEGO Movie.� Pratt is buff and handsome enough to pull off the heroic thing, but the film also takes full advantage of his comic chops.      When Quill was a little boy on Earth, a spaceship beamed him aboard just after his mother died. About all he had on him was his Sony Walkman (look it up, kids), which provides the wonderfully incongruous out-of-time soundtrack to the movie.      Twenty years later and Quill is a grown man, a space scavenger of sorts. When he comes upon the magical mumbo-jumbo ball (that�s not its technical name, but all movies like this have the basic equivalent, some item everybody wants), he suddenly find himself the center of a lot of attention.      That attention most immediately comes from two scoundrels, the aforementioned Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and his partner Rocket, a machine-gun wielding hyper-intelligent raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper). They are soon joined by the green-skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a trained fighting machine sent by the evil Ronan (an excellent Lee Pace) to also capture the magical mumbo-jumbo ball.      Somehow this group all end up in jail together, where they meet the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista), who has sworn to kill Ronan, but opts instead to kill Gamora, until she confesses she was set to betray Ronan. At which point the gang begins melding into the Guardians of the Galaxy.      Directed and co-written (along with Nicole Perlman) by James Gunn (�Slither,� �Super�), �Guardians� can�t rely on the mass nostalgia for its characters that other Marvel Comics franchises have had built in. Baby boomers didn�t grow up with Groot, kids don�t have Rocket pajamas (they doubtlessly will now). But maybe that�s why the franchise seems so fresh � there are few preconceptions or audience expectations about these characters.      But a lot of credit has to go to Gunn, whose somewhat obscure previous films have always struck a precarious balance between dark humor and action. Here the humor isn�t as dark, the action isn�t as gory, and the balance doesn�t feel precarious.      Sure some of the battles become a blur � that�s the way of action extravaganzas these days. And the band of misfits concept goes back decades.      But none of those misfits was a talking tree or an armed raccoon. �Guardians of the Galaxy� has wit, energy and zaniness to spare. It will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more.      'Guardians of the Galaxy'      GRADE: B+      Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language      Running time: 121 minutes ||||| The most touching thing in Guardians of the Galaxy is its very first opening scene, set in 1988. A young boy, inseparable from his Walkman, watches his mother die of cancer and then runs, in tears, out onto a field, where he’s promptly abducted by a spaceship. The scene positions this entire sci-fi spectacle as a wish-fulfillment fantasy, anchoring its derring-do and frivolity in grief. We read and watch stuff like this to get away, it tells us. So come away with us. Of course, this is just another variation on the old Spielbergian motif of the broken child saved by wonder, but it still works. It’s also an artful dodge, because while this very enjoyable film does return briefly to this scene later on, it mostly avoids anything approaching this level of poignancy for the rest of its running time.      That young boy, 26 years later, has grown up to become Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), who wanders space and calls himself Star-Lord, a “Ravager” whose chief aim appears to be to find, steal, or smuggle cool stuff to sell. After he gets his hands on a mysterious and highly coveted object known as “The Orb,” he’s thrust together with a group of intergalactic misfits: A sociopathic, genetically modified talking raccoon named Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper; a giant tree-creature named Groot (who can say only “I am Groot,” but can still somehow get the raccoon to understand him, à la Chewbacca and Han Solo), voiced by Vin Diesel; beautiful, conflicted warrior Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana (claiming her third giant franchise; is she our current record-holder?); and musclebound, humorless, vengeful Drax the Destroyer, played by wrestling star Dave Bautista.      The film jumps between galaxies and planets and interstellar colonies with amazing proficiency. Director James Gunn, who co-wrote the script with Nicole Perlman, has a rare talent, one that George Lucas also had but few filmmakers working in this genre do: He can effortlessly cut between evocative worlds we’ve never seen before without losing sight of the action and the pace of his narrative. With a few deft strokes, he can place us inside an entire mining colony built around the decaying head of an ancient deity floating around the cosmos — the same way that Lucas and his directors could throw us from a swamp planet to Cloud City without having to sit around and give us belabored explanations of what these were. This is a precious gift: an intuitive ability to understand both what we need to know and what we don’t need to know. A story of this scale needs elegant shorthand, the kind of shorthand whose very lack doomed films like John Carter and After Earth. Gunn has it in spades.      A good thing, too, because the plot itself is ridiculously — and, I suspect, purposefully — dense, having to do with something called an "Infinity Stone," which apparently has the power to destroy entire galaxies when wielded by the right being. Or something. Again, it doesn’t really matter. This might be, in terms of sheer destructive capability, the most powerful MacGuffin in the Marvel universe, and yet it feels thoroughly inconsequential. That’s because this is an insistently lighthearted movie. Think about it: Whereas most action films would have a character designated as comic relief, Guardians has a character designated as straight-man relief. Practically everyone else is comic relief of one form or another.      And so, the film eagerly delivers a nonstop onslaught of irreverent one-liners and jokey exchanges and random pop-culture references — endearing gags you want to laugh at even when they’re not particularly funny. Context is everything here. Consider a line like, “He says he’s an A-hole, but — and I’m quoting him here — he’s ‘not 100 percent a dick.’” Or: “I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid. Bonnie and Clyde. John Stamos.” These wouldn’t be particularly brilliant lines in a standard-issue comedy. (Really? More Stamos jokes?) But wedged inside a superhero spectacle set in outer space, it all feels hilarious, the same way the familiar classic-rock soundtrack, featuring everything from “Moonage Daydream” to “Cherry Bomb,” feels cool. The movie wins you over with its calculated incongruities. It has a charm similar to this year’s earlier The Lego Movie, but that film used its wild, relentless gags to build to a celebration of unbridled creativity and diversity, and even managed to question things like fate, faith, and free will.      But in Guardians of the Galaxy, they’re mostly just jokes. And that frivolity might be both the film’s greatest asset and its chief limitation. Gunn occasionally gives us moments that suggest he wants to do more than just make us chuckle. He has a great eye, not necessarily for pretty pictures, but for images of emotional grandeur — whether it’s of a spaceship beaming in two doomed lovers floating in what appears to be a final embrace, or for the spectacle of thousands of tiny ships conjoining to create a kind of protective cosmic netting. But he almost always undercuts these moments with gags, as if he’s afraid to commit to something bigger, darker, more profound. The film seems forever on the verge of becoming transcendent, but something keeps pulling it back — a certain eager-to-please-ness, maybe even an almost adolescent fear of the grand gesture.      Gunn originally came up through the ranks at Troma (where he wrote Tromeo and Juliet), and a friend I saw Guardians of the Galaxy with, who loved the movie, called it “the most expensive Troma film ever made.” That sounds about right, and it’s not a bad thing. The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself — because it seems capable of being so much more. ||||| “Guardians of the Galaxy” brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.”      Chris Pratt stars as an interstellar frat-boy Indiana Jones, out to steal and sell a precious orb that looks like a wire Christmas ornament from Pier 1 Imports. He teams up with a lady warrior (Zoe Saldana, this time in greenface) who is double-crossing her villainous boss; a wisecracking, Joisey-accented bounty-hunter raccoon (Bradley Cooper, stealing work from Gilbert Gottfried); a large killer plant who says only “I am Groot” (though Vin Diesel is the one they hired to say this); and Drax (Dave Bautista), a block of muscle and tats.      Our hero, scruff-faced earthling Peter (Pratt), speaks in the kind of slang that passes for wit down at Delta Psi — just keep saying “dude,” “chill” or “bro,” it’ll be hilarious. Drax issues dumb-guy chatter that’s meant to bring relief to low-IQ audience members. He doesn’t get metaphors, see? “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast.” Hey, Drax, Joey Tribbiani thinks your shtick is old.      As the gang of outlaws whizzes around the universe, villains as fragile as Pringles line up to be obediently killed, amid dialogue that’s a jarring mix of fusty Conan-the-Barbarian-isms (“Spare me your foul gaze, woman”) and bro talk (“They got my d - - k message!”). For background filler there are tunes from Peter’s beloved ’70s pop mixtape. Out: John Williams. In: “The Piña Colada Song.”      The movie isn’t a full-on spoof, like “A Million Ways To Die in Space.”      Instead, we’re actually supposed to get pumped up by the chaotic action, the dazzlingly detailed special effects and the mortal combat with blue-faced villains with bits of circuit board or seaweed stuck to their faces. The comedy is meant to deflate tension that isn’t there in the first place. Writer-director James Gunn keeps pulling the rug out without first bothering to trick anyone into standing on it.      It all goes by as slowly as an IRS audit because there’s no suspense: We learn at the outset that the screenwriters will, when stuck, simply dream up some new problem-solving gadget or superpower and give it, unexplained, to whomever needs it. Floating in space for a few seconds will kill you, unless it doesn’t.      Grasping an all-powerful golf ball of energy will destroy you, except it won’t. A large weapon will suddenly be tossed to the paws of the raccoon, or the walking tree will form a magical bird’s nest of love around the whole crew to protect them from a crash landing. When in doubt, cut to the potty-mouthed raccoon. Ha, ha, he’s saying “Holy s - - t!” or “Attention, idiots!” Straight out of “Howard the Duck.”      The one-liners in “Star Wars,” an obvious inspiration, got laughs while maintaining the illusion that the characters were in danger.      Here, a joke about “Footloose” does the opposite. Told that a legendary hero called Kevin Bacon saved the people who had sticks up their butts, Saldana’s character asks, “Who put the sticks up their butts?” It’s supposed to be Drax’s job to be the sitcom cretin here, but in “Guardians of the Galaxy” there’s so much stupid being delivered that everybody has to chip in. |||||	– Guardians of the Galaxy—what the AP describes as a "3-D space opera" starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper—opens today, and reviewers seem happy. As of this writing, 91% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes approve of the Marvel flick, mainly because it does what a summertime movie inspired by a comic series is supposed to: entertain, excite, and elicit a few laughs. Examples: Peter Travers writes at Rolling Stone that, "through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the cliches of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun." He adds that it's "insanely, shamelessly silly" and that this is the movie where a ripped Pratt transforms into a "full-fledged movie star." Summer and cinema metaphors as over the top as the movie abound. Tom Long writes at the Detroit News that the film "will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more," while David Hiltbrand writes at the Philadelphia Inquirer declares that Guardians "is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in hot weather." Tom Huddleston writes at Time Out London that the movie is like the "box of chocolates" from Forrest Gump: "A vast, family-sized festive crate of chocolates, all wrapped in the shiniest packaging, all exploding with sweetness and surprises." Bilge Ebiri offers more of a backhanded compliment, writing at Vulture that the "very fun" Guardians "is the class clown of the Marvel Universe," wistfully adding that, "like most class clowns … you wish it would apply itself, because it seems capable of being so much more." And then—the naysayers. Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle writes that the movie "feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it," while Kyle Smith at the New York Post calls the movie "space junk" and makes the wince-inducing comparison of the film to sci-fi fiascos Howard the Duck and Green Lantern.
summarize: Topics: Opening Shot, Editor's Picks, John Boehner, Barack Obama, Fiscal cliff, Politics News      Last night was hardly the first public humiliation that John Boehner has suffered at the hands of his fellow Republicans, but it’s probably the most stark. And it raises some very basic questions about the House speaker’s political future – like whether he even has one.      That Boehner had devised and pursued Plan B in the first place seemed to speak to his weak grip on the GOP conference. Boehner and President Obama had negotiated their way to within spitting distance of each other, with the president giving significant ground on his revenue demands, agreeing to a reduction in Social Security benefits, and giving up on a payroll tax holiday extension. But when word of the looming deal leaked, House Republicans let their displeasure be known, and the speaker announced that he’d instead hold a vote on a bill to extend the Bush tax rates for all income under $1 million. That was Plan B.      Exactly where Plan B fit into Boehner’s overall strategy was a matter of some debate, but he pressed hard for it and confidently predicted he had the 218 votes needed to pass it. So now we know that not only does Boehner not have sufficient support among Republicans to pass a potential compromise with Obama, he also doesn’t have the support to pass his own plan.      It’s still possible some kind of fiscal cliff deal will be completed before Jan. 1, but it’s hard to see how. Last night’s developments are a clear sign that a significant chunk of Republicans are simply committed to never voting for any kind of tax hike – even one on a tiny chunk of super-wealthy people, even when it comes with some serious concessions from the other party, and even when failing to act means that taxes will go up for everyone.      The most likely scenario now is that Jan. 1 will come and go, the Bush tax cuts will expire for all Americans, and President Obama and Democrats will then introduce a bill to restore the Bush rates for most people – maybe using the $250,000 income threshold that Obama stuck with until this week. Maybe then, when the vote really would be for a tax cut, Republicans will sign off on it. But for now, that’s not where they are. ||||| Has there been a House speaker in modern American history with less control over his members than John Boehner?      Sad trombone. (Charles Dharapak / AP)      Over the past three days, Boehner has focused all attention on "Plan B": an effort to strengthen his hand in negotiations with President Obama by passing backup legislation that would extend the Bush tax cuts for all income under $1 million.      Tonight, Boehner lost that vote. In a dramatic turn of events on the House floor, he pulled the legislation. In a statement released moments ago, he said, "The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass." Boehner lost.      Plan A, which was a deal with Obama, was put on ice, many believe, because Boehner couldn't wrangle the votes to pass anything Obama would sign. Plan B failed because Boehner couldn't wrangle the Republican votes to pass something Obama had sworn he wouldn't sign.      The failure of Plan B proved something important: Boehner doesn't have enough Republican support to pass any bill that increases taxes -- even one meant to block a larger tax increase -- without a significant number of Democrats. The House has now adjourned until after Christmas, but it's clear now what Plan C is going to have to be: Boehner is going to need to accept the simple reality that if he's to be a successful speaker, he's going to need to begin passing legislation with Democratic votes.      There's an asterisk there, though: It's not entirely clear whether Boehner will be the speaker of the House a month from today. The vote to elect the next speaker is on Jan. 3. To win, you need an absolute majority of the House, not a plurality. Even a hopeless conservative challenge that attracts only a handful of Republican votes could deny Boehner the speakership until a consensus candidate emerged. Tonight's vote makes that challenge more likely.      A significant number of Boehner's members clearly don't trust his strategic instincts, they don't feel personally bound to support him, they clearly disagree with his belief that tax rates must rise as part of a deal, and they, along with many other Republicans, must be humiliated after the shenanigans on the House floor this evening. Worse, they know that Boehner knows he'll need Democratic support to get a budget deal done. That means "a cave," at least from the perspective of the conservative bloc, is certain. That, too, will make a change of leadership appealing.      If a conservative spoiler runs, he or she could very possibly deny Boehner the 218 votes he needs to become speaker, clearing the way for a consensus candidate like Eric Cantor to unite the party. It's hard to say exactly how likely that is. But it's likelier than it was, say, this morning. ||||| Has there been a House speaker in modern American history with less control over his members than John Boehner?      Sad trombone.

It "was hardly the first public humiliation" Boehner's troops have dealt him, writes Steve Kornacki at Salon, but "it raises some very basic questions about the House speaker's political future—like whether he even has one." This is a speaker who doesn't even have the GOP votes to pass his own plan, let alone a compromise Obama would be willing to sign. If Boehner stays on as speaker, he's going to have to get used to passing things with Democratic votes—but that's a pretty big if. As Ezra Klein at the Washington Post points out, Boehner will need an absolute majority to win the Jan. 3 speaker election, which means that even a no-hope conservative challenger could derail him, clearing the way for, say, a consensus candidate like Eric Cantor to come forward. Kornacki, meanwhile, can imagine Boehner "just walking away, leaving the gavel for some other unfortunate soul." (Kornacki's full piece here; Klein's here.)
summarize: Singer Scott Stapp of the band Creed belted out some very bad lyrics in his day. Panthers linebacker Ben Jacobs is carrying on the tradition. Owen Sweeney Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP ||||| Singer Scott Stapp, of the band Creed, says he thinks the Carolina Panthers’ “Creedbombing” is hilarious, and it has made him a fan of the team. Owen Sweeney Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP |||||	– The Carolina Panthers started a new trend called "Creedbombing," which is exactly what it sounds like—surprising someone by loudly singing a Creed song in your best impersonation of Creed's growly lead singer, Scott Stapp—and the team has won Stapp himself as a fan as a result. "They are my team right now," the frontman, normally a Cowboys fan, tells the Charlotte Observer. He adds that he wants to meet the team and maybe even film a Creedbombing video with players. "The fact that Creed is still in the conversation 20 years later I think speaks for volumes for how the music has impacted people," he notes. "Like, are you serious? This is so cool," Stapp said when describing his initial reaction to learning about Creedbombing. "And I just felt like, hey man, there are Creed fans on the Panthers?" Well, either that or they're making fun of your band, Scott. But, to be fair, linebacker Ben Jacobs said Creedbombing was born out of a realization that he and other teammates "still kind of liked the songs" when he first described Creedbombing to the Observer. "The key is you’ve got to make really deep, direct eye contact," he said. "So if you Creedbomb someone you’ve got to look them directly in the eye." Stapp, who is currently doing a solo tour, says his band has started Creedbombing him.
summarize: Photo by Brendan Smailowski/AFP/Getty Images      The Iranian nuclear deal struck Saturday night is a triumph. It contains nothing that any American, Israeli, or Arab skeptic could reasonably protest. Had George W. Bush negotiated this deal, Republicans would be hailing his diplomatic prowess, and rightly so.      A few weeks ago, a “senior administration official” outlined the agreement that President Obama hoped to achieve in Geneva. Some reporters who heard the briefing (including me) thought that the terms were way too one-sided, that the Iranians would never accept them. Here’s the thing: The deal just signed by Iran and the P5+1 nations (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China plus Germany) is precisely the hoped-for deal laid out at that briefing.            It is an interim agreement, not a treaty (which means, among other things, that it doesn’t require Senate ratification). It is meant as a first step toward a comprehensive treaty to be negotiated in the next six months. More than that, it expires in six months. In other words, if Iran and the other powers can’t agree on a follow-on accord in six months, nobody is stuck with a deal that was never meant to be permanent. There is no opportunity for traps and trickery.      Advertisement            Meanwhile, Iran has to do the following things: halt the enrichment of all uranium above 5 percent and freeze the stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.5 percent; neutralize its stockpile of uranium that’s been enriched to 20 percent (either by diluting it to 5 percent purity or converting it to a form that cannot be used to make a weapon); stop producing, installing, or modernizing centrifuges; stop constructing more enrichment facilities; halt all activities at the Arak nuclear reactor (which has the potential to produce nuclear weapons made of plutonium); permit much wider and more intrusive measures of verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency, including daily inspections of all facilities.            Without going into a lot of technical detail (which can be read here), the point is this: The agreement makes it impossible for the Iranians to make any further progress toward making a nuclear weapon in the next six months—and, if the talks break down after that, and the Iranians decide at that point to start building a nuclear arsenal, it will take them much longer to do so.      In exchange for these restraints, the P5+1 nations agree to free up about $6 billion of Iran’s long-frozen foreign assets. This amounts to a very small percentage of the sanctions imposed on Iran’s energy and financial sectors. Meanwhile, all other sanctions will remain in place and continue to be vigorously enforced; the agreement doesn’t affect those sanctions at all. The U.S. Congress does have to agree not to impose additional sanctions in the next six months. If it imposes them anyway, they must know that this agreement—and the international coalition holding the sanctions in place—will collapse. Even this Congress is likely to hold off. If it does go ahead and passes a bill imposing new sanctions, Obama will certainly veto it.            So what’s not to like? According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several American neoconservatives, plenty.* In their view, a good agreement must, first, dismantle Iran’s entire nuclear program and, second, ban Iran from enriching uranium to any level. In other words, it must ensure that Iran can never build a nuclear weapon.      Advertisement            Notice, I wrote in my lede that the agreement signed Saturday night contains nothing that anyone could “reasonably” protest. These objections are unreasonable. Even if the mullahs of Iran vanished tomorrow and were replaced by secular democrats, these new rulers would continue to demand what they see as the right to enrich uranium to some degree. Some would argue that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty enshrines this right. Certainly the NPT allows them the right to develop “peaceful nuclear energy”—that is, to have some form of a nuclear program.            Netanyahu’s worry has been that a partial accord would allow the Iranians to advance their nuclear program while stringing us along in interminable follow-on negotiations. It should be clear that the terms of this agreement prevent them from playing games. President Obama also said, in a televised address Saturday night, that if the Iranians don’t abide by their commitments in the next six months, he will again freeze their overseas funds and impose stiffer sanctions.      Does the agreement end all reasonable worries about Iran? No. The next phase—the more comprehensive agreement that the parties will try to negotiate over the next six months—will be a much harder nut. The follow-on accord will, presumably, require Iran to dismantle more of its nuclear program—and require the West to start lifting its more crippling sanctions. This will be much more controversial, on all sides. If the first-phase deal falls apart, it will be easy for President Obama to refreeze Iran’s foreign assets. But if the next phase—the comprehensive accord—falls apart, it will be harder for the P5+1 nations to reimpose sanctions. On the Iranian side, their hard-liners must be gulping at even this interim agreement, hoping that the unfreezing of assets will provide enough economic relief to make the nuclear cutbacks worthwhile. How much further they’re willing to cut without the total lifting of Western sanctions—and how far the West is willing to lift sanctions without the total dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear programs—is unknown. Merely posing the question this way is cause for pessimism.      Then again, who would have thought, even a few weeks ago, that an agreement of this magnitude could possibly have been negotiated? Until two months ago, the United States and Iran had not held formal talks of any sort since 1979. Yet this deal goes way beyond any arms-control accord that the United States and the Soviet Union struck in the first 18 years of détente.*            Advertisement            But let’s get serious and address the real reason some people object to this agreement—or any Iranian agreement. First, they don’t trust Iran. This is reasonable; when it comes to their nuclear facilities, the Iranians have been lying and cheating for years. The thing about this agreement is that—like all well-written accords between countries with good reason to distrust one another—it doesn’t require trust.      The second reason for resistance, and a more serious political problem, is that some people (including the Israeli president, many American neoconservatives, and lots of Sunni Arabs) are worried, above all, that this agreement might work. They don’t want to see the United States and the other big powers cozying up with Iran. The Sunnis fear that doing so might tilt the regional balance of power against them and toward the Shiites. Some Israelis fear that a deal could signal an American retreat from the entire region (though many Israelis, including former Mossad chiefs, support an Iranian deal, within reason). And some American neoconservatives … well, let’s face it, they trust Netanyahu more than they trust Obama.      It’s time for all the critics to take a deep breath, read the terms of the agreement, recognize that the deal goes way beyond what anybody could reasonably have hoped for, and give this thing a chance. It is in U.S., Israeli, and Arab interests for Iran to do things that make it harder to build a nuclear bomb. And if a détente-of-sorts evolves from these talks, if it becomes possible for the United States and Iran to discuss, then maybe act upon, issues of mutual interest, then that is certainly in our interest, whatever anybody else thinks.      In recent weeks, some neocons have warned that Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s seemingly pragmatic new president who’s brought about all these breakthroughs, is “no Gorbachev.” This is true, but it’s worth recalling that, back when he first came to power and started talking about glasnost and perestroika, these same people warned that Gorbachev was no Gorbachev either.      Advertisement            The agreement struck Saturday night (or Sunday morning, Geneva time) is a first step. In a year’s time, it may be seen as a small step and a brief, naive step at that. But for now it’s a step rife with historic possibilities; it’s a step that should be taken with caution but also with hope and gusto.      Correction, Nov. 24, 2013: The article originally stated that it took the U.S. and the USSR a "quarter-century" to reach any arms-control deals during détente. (Return.) ||||| Soapbox Let’s Not Celebrate This Iran Deal…Yet      3. Iran Is Iran      The only problem with dancing with a bear, an old saying goes, is that you can never let go. Iran is a very problematic partner for the United States and is likely to remain so for a long time to come. The nuclear issue can’t be easily compartmentalized: From its support for terrorist groups abroad to its abysmal human rights record at home to its support for Syria’s blood-soaked dictator Bashar al-Assad, Iran is locked into a set of policies that—to put it mildly—simply don’t sell well on Capitol Hill. Even if Iran is serious on the nuclear issue, its conduct on so many other issues is so diametrically opposed to U.S. interests that its newfound cooperativeness will raise suspicions. And because there will be a need to pacify Iran’s own hardliners, nasty anti-Israeli statements of the kind the supreme leader made last week, when he described Israel as a “rabid dog,” are likely to continue. Congressional efforts to impose additional sanctions will only push the mullahs to new heights of rhetorical extremism.      4. The Tyranny of Process      No matter how imperfect, negotiators and U.S. officials get very attached to their negotiations and agreements. Those who labored to produce this interim agreement will become very invested in their handiwork and move to defend it vigorously. I’ve seen this movie and succumbed to these same sentiments several times over the years. The process—with all its historic resonance—will acquire a legitimacy and authority that will steel the administration against arguments that point out its deficiencies. Part of this flows from the conviction of those inside who know how hard it is to get anything done in negotiations; and part from the logic that you need to compare the accord not to the perfect but to the alternative: Iran’s continued effort to acquire a breakout capacity. That the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany blessed the agreement will give it further legitimacy and authority. All of this will give the United States a major stake in keeping the process going, even beyond the six-month deadline for reaching a comprehensive agreement. And even if Iran fudges some aspects of the deal, there will be great pressure and temptation to try to work things out even at the risk of not strictly enforcing the agreement.      5. The Problem With Interim Agreements      And that brings us to perhaps the most serious challenge of all. The recently concluded interim agreement may be problematic because it doesn’t put a brake on some of the most troubling aspects on Iran’s nuclear program, particularly limiting centrifuges and seeking ironclad assurances that Iran can’t reconvert its enriched uranium stockpile into usable material.      But what if the six-month period ends without a comprehensive accord? The logic behind a comprehernsive deal is that Iran will get hooked on a reinvigorated economy—popular pressures will grow as jobs are created, goods become available and the leadership sees the advantage of more and more sanctions relief. But reaching a sweeping agreement with Iran that puts to rest any prospect of the reconstitution of its nuclear program in exchange for removal of the toughest sanctions, on banking and oil, seems right now a fantastical proposition. There’s just too much suspicion and mistrust between the United States and Iran, not to mention Israeli and Saudi anxieties, congressional pressure, Iran’s regional policies and its own desire to preserve as much of its costly nuclear infrastructure as possible.      A more limited transaction—say, another interim agreement to ensure the negotiating process continues—is perhaps a more realistic alternative. What negotiation ever produced a perfect agreement? Even if the negotiators saw a comprehensive accord as a desired end state, can Washington and Tehran deliver an end game where Iran gives up all of its nuclear infrastructure and the United States lifts all sanctions? More likely, the supreme leader’s goal is to get as much sanctions relief as he can while keeping as much of his nuclear program as he can, too. And given Iran’s regional policies and human rights abuses, Congress will likely not want to relax non-nuclear related sanctions.      In the end, whatever develops, we need to be honest with ourselves about what’s achievable. We need to stop deluding ourselves that negotiations will produce a final agreement that will end Iran’s aspirations for a nuclear weapons capacity. Iran has come too far in its nuclear program for the United States and Israel ever to have that kind of certainty or finality. The advocates of cutting a deal with Iran, including smart and cool heads in Israel, are right that the best you might be able to do is to put more time back on the Iranian nuclear program’s clock so that the world will have enough warning to detect and deal with an effort to break out and weaponize.      That’s not terribly comforting. But that’s what happens when the mullahs play three-dimensional chess and we play checkers.      This accord is less worrisome than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes, but not as compelling and reassuring as U.S. officials maintain. Using it to our advantage depends on keeping sanctions tight, monitoring intrusive and a credible military option on the table. Then there's figuring out exactly what we do six months from now if no comprehensive deal materializes? That would help too.      Aaron David Miller is vice president for new initiatives and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. His forthcoming book is titled Can America Have Another Great President? |||||	– The nuclear deal struck with Iran last night is either "a triumph," or something we shouldn't be all that excited about just yet. Dueling columnists weigh in: Guess what: The deal is exactly what President Obama was going for, an agreement that—when details were leaked a few weeks ago—no one thought Iran would agree to, writes Fred Kaplan at Slate. The interim agreement requires Iran to stop enriching uranium above 5%, freeze the stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.5%, neutralize the stockpile enriched to 20% so it cannot be used for weapons, halt work on centrifuges and enrichment facilities, permit more and better inspections, and more. "The agreement makes it impossible for the Iranians to make any further progress toward making a nuclear weapon in the next six months—and, if the talks break down after that, and the Iranians decide at that point to start building a nuclear arsenal, it will take them much longer to do so." Kaplan calls it "a triumph," adding that only a very small percentage of the sanctions on Iran will be freed up in exchange. It's a first step "rife with historic possibilities."  On Politico, Aaron David Miller takes a more wary approach. Yes, this deal could end up being a "historic" part of US-Iran relations, but "we should be careful about putting on the party hats and breaking out the champagne—at least for now, anyway." He lays out five reasons why. Among them: Israel isn't happy with the deal, which could make for "a diplomatic trainwreck." But perhaps the most serious problem: In Miller's opinion, the deal doesn't go far enough to put the brakes on Iran's nuclear program (it should have "limit[ed] centrifuges and [sought] ironclad assurances that Iran can’t reconvert its enriched uranium stockpile into useable material"), meaning we must consider the consequences if a comprehensive accord is not reached within the six-month limit—which it likely won't be. "We need to be honest with ourselves about what’s achievable."

Streep used her time onstage while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award to talk about when she first saw Trump mock a disabled reporter at a 2015 rally. "It kind of broke my heart," she noted, berating the "instinct to humiliate" that he seemed to display. The New York Times first got hold of Trump right after the awards—it was Times reporter Serge Kovaleski whom Trump reportedly made fun of—and although he said he hadn't seen Streep's speech, he noted he "wasn't surprised" about coming under fire from "liberal movie people." "People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter's disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing," he said, adding he'd simply been "calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story." He reiterated his stance early Monday with a three-tweet defense. "Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a … Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never 'mocked' a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him … 'groveling' when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!" He also told the Times there'd be "plenty of movie and entertainment stars" at his inauguration and that "all the dress shops are sold out in Washington."
summarize: Anthony DelMundo/New York Daily News Holocaust escapee Leon Gersten (right) is reunited with Czeslaw Polziec of Poland on Wednesday.      Sixty-nine years melted away in a moment of pure joy Friday as a New Yorker was reunited with the son of a Polish farmer who helped save him from the Holocaust.      Leon Gersten was grinning from ear to ear when Czeslaw Pólziec emerged in the waiting area at John F. Kennedy International Airport.      “Hi! Hi! Hi!” the beaming Pole said when he spotted Gersten, rattling off the few words in English he knows. “I am very glad to see you.”      Then Pólziec, 81, and Gersten, 79, embraced like long-lost brothers.      Anthony DelMundo/New York Daily News Gersten and his family had remained in touch with Polziec's for years after the Holocaust, sending care packages out of gratitude, but the groups eventually lost contact.      “We never forget the fact that you and your parents saved our lives,” Gersten told Pólziec.      More hugs followed from some of Gersten’s five kids, 34 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.      “I didn’t want to miss this,” said Gersten’s 51-year-old daughter, Judith Barer of Baltimore, a mother of eight. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to show the Pólziecs what they’re done for us. They saved my father and therefore they saved my entire family.”      The Jewish Foundation For The Righteous Leon Gersten was taken in by the family along with his mother and other relatives after she had first fled the City of Rzeszow, leaving behind Leon’s father, sister and three brothers, who were never heard from again.      Asked why his parents risked their lives to save Gersten and the four other Jews who turned up unexpectedly at their farm, Pólziec gave a simple but compelling answer.      “These were honest people who just wanted to do the right thing,” he said via a translator.      Gersten is from the City of Rzeszow. His fate became yoked with the Pólziec family’s after his mother, Frieda Tepper Gersten, fled with him to the town of Frysztak, where her parents lived.      Anthony DelMundo/New York Daily News Polziec, just two years older, was a possible playmate for young Leon, but Gersten saw him only infrequently as he dropped off food to his family's hiding place.      His father, sister and three brothers stayed behind ... and were never heard from again.      In July 1942, when the Nazis began rounding up the Jews, Gersten’s mom disguised herself as a Catholic by donning a crucifix, grabbed her son and escaped with her sister, brother-in-law and their son.      Her parents stayed behind in Frysztak and were murdered.      The Jewish Foundation For The Righteous Refusing to admit sheltering their new friends, Stanislaw and Maria Polziec withstood a beating during a raid by Nazis who heard suspicious footsteps.      Gersten’s mother had been a peddler and sought shelter from some of her customers in this part of southern Poland. But they were too frightened to take in five Jewish strangers.      They escapees were desperate by the time they arrived at the humble farm of Stanislaw and Maria Pólziec, who barely had enough food to feed their five children.      But the Pólziecs took pity on the Jews and hid them in the dark attic above their barn. They also refused to take any money from them.      “The punishment for aiding a Jew in this part of the world was death,” said Stanlee Stahl of the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, which arranged the reunion. “They were taking a huge risk.”      Gersten, who was 8 when he went into hiding, remembers passing the time by watching spiders catch flies and picking lice from his cousin’s head.      Pólziec was two years older and a potential playmate. But Gersten saw him just once a week, when he brought them the bread, potatoes and mushrooms that kept them alive.

Life consisted of long stretches of monotony interrupted by short bursts of terror when German raids forced them to flee to the gravelike bunker the farmer had dug for them.      During one raid, the invaders heard suspicious footsteps and didn’t believe Stanislaw Pólziec when he insisted the noise was from his kids.      Gersten said they beat the farmer without mercy and they could hear his screams and his wife pleading for them to stop. But the brave Poles wouldn’t give up the Jews.      Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News Leon Gersten, with Czeslaw Pólziec (left) by his side, lights the menorah on Wednesday, the first night of Chanukah.      “We were treated like human beings despite the fact that we were causing them hardships,” Gersten said.      The Gerstens’ ordeal ended in August 1944 when the Soviets liberated the area and they emerged from their hiding place.      They eventually moved to New York City and started new lives, sending care packages when they could to their Polish rescuers.      Pearl Gabel/New York Daily News Czeslaw Pólziec, 81, and Leon Gersten, 79, embrace by the Chanukah menorah hours after the pair was reunited at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Some of Gersten's five children, 34 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren were on hand to witness the event.      Gersten became a psychologist and started his own family, but over time he lost contact with the Pólziecs.      After his mother died, Gersten decided it was time to tell the world about the family who saved them, planting the seeds for a happy reunion.      csiemaszko@nydailynews.com ||||| This was one holiday gift they’ll never forget.      A Long Island psychologist who narrowly escaped the Holocaust was reunited for the first time with an elderly man whose family had hid him from the Nazis.      Leon Gersten, 79, and Czeslaw Polziec, 81, finally shook hands and embraced Wednesday after nearly 70 years — just hours before the first Hanukkah candle was lit.      Both men struggled to fight back tears during the remarkable reunion at JFK.      “I want to tell you that I feel very honored and grateful that you made this effort to take this long trip,” Gersten told the Polish national. “It’s not easy for you to come here so we can have the opportunity to honor you and your family.”      The emotional Gersten looked Polziec straight in the eye and said, “We never forgot the fact that you and your parents are the ones who saved our lives. The only reason we are alive is because of you and your family.”      Polziec’s interpreter broke down in tears relaying that message.      “I cannot believe it that this actually came true,” Polziec said through the interpreter.      “I am very happy, after 69 years in Poland, finally meeting my friend. We lived in terrible circumstances. Poland was occupied and they [the Nazis] did what they did. They were killing the Jews.”      Gersten and his loved ones spent two years of his childhood in the home of Polziec’s Catholic family.      Gersten, walking with a cane and wearing a yarmulke, embraced Polziec and gave him a bouquet of flowers.      The Cedarhurst, LI, psychologist, his mom, sister and brother-in-law’s family all owe their lives to Polziec, whose family risked it all in defying Hitler’s killers.      Gersten gestured to his extended family around him, and claimed victory against Hitler’s evil.      “This is why our gratitude is so great, because of them. These generations are growing up,” Gersten said. “The Germans did not succeed, and this was our triumph.”      The emotional reunion was sponsored by the Manhattan-based Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, which publicizes inspiring tales of non-Jews who rescued Holocaust victims.      Gertsen has five kids, 34 grandchildren and nine great grandkids — all lives made possible by the courage of Polziec’s family.      The Gerstens lived in an attic at Polziec’s home in the village of Frystak in southeastern Poland.      The ingenious hosts even built an underground bunker that they could cover with a grain-storage bin in case the Nazis or their collaborators came knocking.      In one close call, Polziec’s dad was severely beaten by German soldiers who suspected him of hiding Jews.      But Hitler’s thugs had nothing on Polziec’s valiant dad and he protected the Gertsen family.      “You have to know that it was under the death penalty when the Germans learned about hiding the Jews. All the families could have been killed,” Polziec said. “But my father was a big man, so he was not afraid.”      The senior Polziec made it clear to all kids: Keep your mouths shut about their house “guests.”      “The children were gathered and we were told that we have guests at home,” Polziec said. “You are not to speak of that. You cannot tell anyone.”      Polziec grew up to get married, have two daughters and work at an aircraft factory.      His mom and dad never flinched in their choice to hide the Gersten family.      “These were honest people who just wanted to do the right thing,” Polziec said. “No one consulted us [kids]. No one told us what the motives were. This was the decision of my father and my mother.”      Additional reporting by David K. Li ||||| By Moni Basu, CNN      Follow @MbasuCNN      (CNN) - Leon Gersten could not bear to watch “Schindler’s List,” the movie about Czech industrialist Oskar Schindler who saved 1,200 Jews from Nazi extermination camps. It was too painful for the Holocaust survivor, too close to reality.      But now, almost 70 years after his village in Poland was liberated by the Soviet army, Gersten is meeting the man who is the Oskar Schindler of his own life: Czeslaw Polziec.      Like Schindler, Polziec is Catholic. His family secretly sheltered Gersten in rural Poland for two years during World War II.      As though such a reunion between survivor and rescuer were not emotional enough, this one is taking place Wednesday on the eve of Hanukkah, which coincides this year with Thanksgiving. Two celebrations of gratitude.      Gersten, 79, had tried to imagine how he might feel when he would finally meet his Polish friend at John F. Kennedy International Airport. He said only this: “I think it will be a physical reaction.”      And it was. The two men embraced. Then, they embraced again.      "Hi, hi, hi," Polziec said, his English limited to just a few words.      But words seemed useless now anyway. For Gersten, none seemed adequate for a man who saved his life. A man who had, through his actions, given him precious assurance there was goodness left in a world that seemed purely evil.      “I am alive because of them,” Gersten said of Polziec and his family. “They are heroes.”      Gersten had waited for this day when he could express his gratitude in person. When he could show Polziec his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They were the greatest proof of the enormity of the Polziec family's actions.      On Thanksgiving, the two men will sit down for a formal dinner and on Sunday, several generations of Gersten’s family, including a granddaughter traveling from Israel, will share a meal with Polziec at a New York restaurant.      “How wonderful to be able to see him,” Gersten said earlier this week, each word laced with the kind of anticipation a soldier coming home after battle feels. “How wonderful to be reunited, share memories.”      With Polziec by his side, Gersten’s Hanukkah promises to be special. He plans to perform an act he was never able to do when he was in hiding on Polziec’s family farm, one that will celebrate the miracle of his survival.      Life in the attic      The shared memories will take Gersten back to Frystak, Poland. To July 1942.      Gersten’s mother, Frieda Tepper Gersten, worked as a peddler and traveled throughout southern Poland, selling fabric and other items. She and Leon moved from the town of Rzeszow to Frystak to live with her parents shortly after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. Gersten’s father, Yonasan, was unable to get work in Frystak and stayed in Rzeszow with Gersten’s sister and three brothers.      Gersten never saw his father or siblings again. He has no photos except one of his sister. He knows they all perished but everything else is blank. Where? When? How?      Then one July day, the Germans ordered the Jews of Frystak to assemble in the marketplace. They rounded up 1,600 people, mostly children and the elderly, marched them outside town, slaughtered them and tossed their bodies like garbage into a mass grave.      Among the dead were Gersten’s grandparents.      His mother knew she and her son would die, too, unless she escaped the Jewish ghetto. She disguised herself as a Catholic, a cross around her neck. With her boy, she walked into the countryside and knocked on the doors of her customers to ask for shelter for herself and her son - as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their son.      Many turned her away. It was risky to come to the aid of Jews. It could prove fatal.      But the Polziecs were different.      Maria and Stanislaw Polziec lived on a farm in nearby Zawadka with their four daughters and son, Czeslaw. They had barely the means to feed their own family, let alone buy food for five strangers.      But they took in the desperate Jews and created a living space for them in a dark attic above their barn. Czeslaw Polziec brought them food and stood guard when other people came to the farm.      Gersten remembers receiving one big loaf of bread a week. It was divided into five – the two boys got first pick. And there were potatoes. Gersten offered his uncle an extra potato for every two hours he entertained the boys with stories.      “Food was very tight,” Gersten said. “But we weren’t starving.”      The space was adequate, too. The main problem was inactivity. There was nothing to do. Gersten watched spiders catch flies. Or plucked lice from his cousin’s head. That’s how he passed time.      Gersten was only 8 then; Polziec, 10. Their interaction was limited.      Sometimes, in the early morning, Gersten climbed down the ladder to help Polziec in the stable. There were two cows, a horse and pig.      Other times, Polziec picked mushrooms and brought them up for soup.      On some winter nights, the attic got cold and the Polziecs invited their Jewish guests into their home to spend the evening in warmth.      They built an earthen bunker in the barn to hide Gersten and his family for the times when Germans raided the farm. It measured 4 feet by 3 feet and was just big enough to hold five people. It resembled a grave, really. The Polziecs slid a big, wooden grain storage bin over the opening to deflect suspicion.      One night, Nazi collaborators raided the farm and heard the footsteps of Gersten’s family scurrying into the bunker. They questioned Stanislaw Polziec, who blamed the noise on children in the attic. The collaborators beat Stanislaw, bloodied him without mercy. Gersten could hear the Polziec family’s screams. Still, the Polziecs did not betray the Jews.      Gersten said he remains impressed the Polziecs never showed any resentment toward their Jewish guests for the enormous danger they had brought them.      Gersten remained in the Polziec’s attic for two years, until the day in 1944 when Soviet soldiers liberated the area. Gersten and his mother eventually moved to America.      'Should we have let them die?'      For many years after, Gersten had dreams of being shot by the Nazis. He liked sleeping when it rained. All those months in hiding, he’d felt secure on stormy nights, knowing the Nazis would not go out to look for Jews then.      He grappled with his own survival as he made a new life for himself in New York.      “My mother was very religious,” he said. “She had a more positive outlook about surviving, although we could never answer why God would want us to survive over others.”      Gersten and his mother kept up with the Polziecs after the war. They sent a few dollars and care packages with clothes back to Poland.      Gersten earned a doctorate in educational psychology from Columbia University and started his own practice. He stopped speaking Polish – his mother tongue was Yiddish - and forgot it with time. He never yearned to return to the town where he lived as a boy. His house and the life he once knew were gone. So were most of his loved ones.      “I have ambivalent feelings about going back there,” he said.      Over the years, he lost contact with the Polziecs. But after his mother died, Gersten wrote to the Jewish Historical Society in Poland about what the Polziecs had done. About two years ago, he decided to submit the family’s name to Yad Vashem, Israel’s official memorial to victims of the Holocaust. The memorial also recognizes non-Jews who helped Jews survive. Schindler’s name is in that database, as are the Polziecs'.      In America, The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous helped Gersten find Czeslaw Polziec in Poland. His parents had passed away years before.      The New York-based foundation supports non-Jews who refused to remain passive during the Holocaust. About 650 rescuers in Europe receive funding for food and essential goods like heating fuel.      The foundation is sponsoring Polziec’s visit to New York, including a dinner honoring him and his family.      Stanlee Stahl, the executive director of the foundation, visited Polziec in Poland. It was not possible for CNN to speak with him before the reunion - he was preparing to make the long journey across the Atlantic.      But Stahl described him as someone who has the handsomely rugged looks of a retired Marine. He served in the Polish army and then worked in security for many years.      Polziec doesn’t think of himself or his family as heroes, he told the foundation. They were God-fearing people, ordinary people, who simply did what they deemed the right thing to do in a desperate situation.      Should we have let them die? he asked in a statement to the foundation.      “The question alone does not bear thinking about,” he said. “They had every right to live. Nobody who has not lived through those desolate days will ever really understand what my parents did, and I am sure, were they still with us, they would be surprised that an honor has been bestowed upon them.”      Stahl said the foundation has helped arrange 18 reunions between survivors and rescuers. But this year, because Hanukkah coincides with Thanksgiving, Gersten’s reunion with Polziec is truly special.      “We owe a great deal of gratitude to these righteous gentiles,” Stahl said. “They saved the honor of humanity.”      Gersten, meanwhile, said he remains amazed by the loyalty of the Polziecs, especially Czeslaw and his sisters, who were so young then. They went to school and church and interacted with so many people. Yet they never uttered a word.      That’s something Gersten plans to point out when he sits down for Thanksgiving dinner with Polziec. He will be grateful that for two years, his Polish friend kept a secret.      But before that, on Wednesday night, Gersten is looking forward to lighting a Hanukkah menorah, which commemorates the rededication of the ancient temple and the miracle of one day’s worth of oil lasting eight.      Gersten was never able to light a menorah when he was hiding in Polziec’s home. The light would have given away the family’s presence, put an end to their survival. Now with Polziec finally by his side again, Gersten’s menorah will symbolize his own family’s miracle. |||||	– An interpreter broke down crying yesterday when he relayed a message from a Holocaust survivor to the Polish man whose family hid him in their attic during World War II—a man he had not seen for almost 70 years. "We never forgot the fact that you and your parents are the ones who saved our lives. The only reason we are alive is because of you and your family," Leon Gersten, 79, told Czeslaw Polziec, 81, both of them fighting against tears of their own. The first words Polziec said upon seeing Gersten at the airport were some of the few English words he knows, the New York Daily News reports: "Hi! Hi! Hi! I am very glad to see you." They'll celebrate Thanksgiving and Hanukkah together, CNN reports. Gersten, now a Long Island psychologist, was sheltered by Polziec's Catholic family for two years along with other family members including his mother, sister, and his brother-in-law's family. "These generations are growing up" because of the Polziec family, Gersten said, gesturing to his extended family. The Polziecs did not know the Gerstens before the family showed up at their farm seeking shelter, but they went so far as to build an underground bunker, just in case the Gerstens needed to hide there. Polziec's father was even once beaten by suspicious Nazis, the New York Post reports. But the Gerstens "were honest people who just wanted to do the right thing," said Polziec when asked why his parents took them in.

summarize: OKLAHOMA CITY—When Aubrey McClendon drove his Chevy Tahoe into a bridge the day after he was indicted for allegedly rigging the price of oil and gas leases, suspicions arose that the shale-energy pioneer had killed himself.      But a two-month investigation by the Oklahoma City Police Department has found nothing to suggest Mr. McClendon committed suicide.      “We... ||||| Aubrey K. McClendon has been charged by a federal grand jury with conspiring to rig bids for the purchase of oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma, the Department of Justice announced today.      The indictment alleges that McClendon orchestrated a conspiracy between two large oil and gas companies to not bid against each other for the purchase of certain oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma. During this conspiracy, which ran from December 2007 to March 2012, the conspirators would decide ahead of time who would win the leases. The winning bidder would then allocate an interest in the leases to the other company. McClendon instructed his subordinates to execute the conspiratorial agreement, which included, among other things, withdrawing bids for certain leases and agreeing on the allocation of interests in the leases between the conspiring companies.      “While serving as CEO of a major oil and gas company, the defendant formed and led a conspiracy to suppress prices paid to leaseholders in northwest Oklahoma,” said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.”      “The FBI is committed to investigating individuals who engage in corrupt criminal conduct,” said Special Agent in Charge Scott L. Cruse of the FBI’s Oklahoma City Division. “We will continue to work with the DOJ Antitrust Division to target those who devise schemes which create an unfair competitive advantage by way of bid rigging or other illegal means.”      The indictment, filed today in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, alleges that McClendon’s conspiracy affected certain bids for leasehold interests and producing properties in northwest Oklahoma. Leasehold interests give a lessee the right to develop the land and to extract oil and natural gas from the land for a time period typically lasting three to five years. Producing properties are tracts of land where the existing lessee has drilled wells on the land and the wells are producing a stream of oil and/or natural gas. Purchasing a producing property includes not just the underlying leasehold interests to drill on the land, but also the producing wells and infrastructure already on the land.      Each violation of the Sherman Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for individuals.      The charges contained in the indictment are allegations and not evidence of guilt. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.      This is the first case resulting from an ongoing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry. This investigation is being conducted by the Antitrust Division’s Chicago Office and the FBI’s Oklahoma City Field Office, with assistance from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Oklahoma. Anyone with information in connection with this investigation is urged to call the Antitrust Division’s Chicago Office at 312-984-7200, visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.html or call the FBI’s Oklahoma City Field Office at 405-290-7770. ||||| A two-month investigation by the Oklahoma City Police Department found no evidence of suicide in the March 2 car crash that killed Oklahoma City businessman Aubrey McClendon, the police confirmed Tuesday.      A report has not been released, but the two-month investigation has been completed, spokesman Capt. Paco Balderrama told The Oklahoman on Tuesday.      "That investigation involved homicide detectives looking into the circumstances that led up to his death," Balderrama said. "After conducting a very thorough investigation, speaking to people who knew him and people who spoke to him prior to the accident, we found no information that would indicate anything other than a vehicular accident."      Balderrama said the investigation was thorough and looked into every possibility.      "We may never know with 100 percent certainty, but at the conclusion of our investigation, we had no evidence to believe there were other factors or possibilities," he said.      The police have sent their report to the medical examiner's office, where a separate investigation is still ongoing. The medical examiner's office has not yet made a determination on the manner of death, said Amy Elliott, chief administrative officer for the medical examiner.      A heavy caseload at the medical examiner's office has slowed the process, Elliott said.      Co-founder of Chesapeake Energy Corp. and founder of American Energy Partners LP, McClendon died in a car crash March 2, one day after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of conspiring to rig bids for oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma. Those charges were dismissed after the car crash.      The police completed their accident investigation two weeks after the crash. That investigation revealed McClendon's 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe was traveling 88 mph five seconds before the impact and that it hit the concrete wall at 78 mph. McClendon was not wearing a seat belt.      The vehicle veered left of center nearly 200 feet before crashing into the wall, the accident report stated. The vehicle's crash data box also revealed that McClendon tapped the brake pedal, but did not attempt to slow just before the crash, Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty said in March.      Because of intense attention and rumors, police then decided to conduct a homicide investigation, Balderrama said Tuesday.      "There was so much chatter of a cover up or something other than an accident," he said. "To put those rumors to rest, we felt it necessary" to conduct the homicide investigation.

McClendon, part owner of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was speeding and not wearing a seatbelt when he slammed into a bridge in Oklahoma City on March 2. The 56-year-old fracking pioneer, who had a wife and three children, faced up to 10 years in federal prison and a $1 million fine if found guilty of conspiring to rig bids for oil and gas leases in Oklahoma. A police spokesman tells the Oklahoman that in the course of a two-month investigation, officers spoke to many people who knew McClendon, looked into every possibility, and determined there was no evidence of suicide. "We may never know with 100% certainty, but at the conclusion of our investigation, we had no evidence to believe there were other factors or possibilities," he says. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office says a separate investigation is continuing—and since there's a backlog of cases, it could be a long time before that investigation concludes.

summarize: ADDITION TO IDENTIFY OPPOSITION LAWMAKER - Opposition lawmaker Armando Armas lies on the ground covering his head as pro-government militias attack lawmakers and National Assembly employees, in Caracas,... (Associated Press)      CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Pro-government militias wielding wooden sticks and metal bars stormed congress on Wednesday, attacking opposition lawmakers during a special session coinciding with Venezuela's independence day.      Four lawmakers were injured and blood was splattered on the neoclassical legislature's white walls. One of them, Americo de Grazia, had to be removed in a stretcher while suffering from convulsions.      "This doesn't hurt as much as watching how every day how we lose a little bit more of our country," Armando Arias said from inside an ambulance as he was being treated for head wounds that spilled blood across his clothes.      The unprecedented attack, in plain view of national guardsmen assigned to protect the legislature, comes amid three months of often-violent confrontations between security forces and protesters who accuse the government of trying to establish a dictatorship by jailing foes, pushing aside the opposition-controlled legislature and rewriting the constitution to avoid fair elections.      Tensions were already high after Vice President Tareck El Aissami made an unannounced morning visit to the National Assembly, accompanied by top government and military officials, for an event celebrating independence day. The short appearance at the congress by top officials who have repeatedly dismissed the legislators as a band of U.S.-backed conspirators was seen by many as a provocation.      Standing next to a display case holding the founding charter, El Aissami said global powers are once again trying to subjugate Venezuela.      "We still haven't finished definitively breaking the chains of the empire," he said, adding that President Nicolas Maduro's plans to rewrite the constitution — a move the opposition sees as a power-grab — offers Venezuela the best chance to be truly independent.      After he left, dozens of government supporters set up a picket outside the building, heckling lawmakers with menacing chants and eventually invading the legislature themselves. The siege only lifted after seven nerve-wracking hours when police set up a corridor to allow the hundreds of people trapped inside the legislature, including lawmakers and journalists, to leave.      The brazen attack on one of the symbols of Venezuela's already limping democracy drew widespread international rebuke.      "This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela's independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela's independence 206 years ago today," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.      Despite the violence, lawmakers approved a plan by the opposition to hold a symbolic referendum on July 16 that would give voters the chance to reject Maduro's plans to draft a new political charter.      Later Maduro condemned the violence, but complained that the opposition doesn't do enough to control "terrorist attacks" committed against security forces by anti-government protesters.      "I will never be an accomplice to acts of violence," said Maduro during a speech at a military parade.      The clash followed Tuesday's appearance of two short videos by a former police inspector who allegedly stole a helicopter and fired on two government buildings last week.      Oscar Perez, repeating a call for rebellion among the security forces, said that he was in Caracas after abandoning the helicopter along the Caribbean coast and was ready for the "second phase" of his campaign to free his homeland from what he called the corrupt rule of Maduro and his "assassin" allies.      Perez gave no other details but pledged to join youth who have been protesting on the streets the past three months against Maduro.      "Stop talking. Get on the streets. Take action. Fight," he said in the video, sitting before a Venezuelan flag and with what looks like an assault rifle by his side. He also denounced Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution.      "If this constitutional assembly goes through, Venezuela will cease to exist because we'll have given away the country to the Cubans," he said.      Hours later, another video appeared in which he urged Venezuelans to march on a Caracas military base, not the presidential palace, to locate and remove Maduro along with the ruling elite.      The bold though largely harmless June 27 attack shocked Venezuelans who had grown accustomed to almost-daily clashes since April between often-violent youth protesters and security forces that have left more than 90 people dead and hundreds injured.      Perez apparently piloted the stolen police helicopter that sprayed 15 bullets toward the Interior Ministry and dropped at least two grenades over the supreme court building.      While Maduro claimed Perez had stolen the helicopter on a U.S.-backed mission to oust him from power, many in the opposition questioned whether the incident was a staged by the government to distract attention from the president's increasingly authoritarian rule.      Adding to the intrigue is Perez's colorful past.      In 2015, he produced and starred in a film called "Suspended Death," and several photos show him in fatigues, scuba diving while toting an assault rifle, skydiving and standing in action poses with a German shepherd by his side. In his political debut, he read a manifesto in which he claimed to be part of a group of disgruntled members of Venezuela's security forces determined to save the country's democracy.      Perez said in the video that the strike produced no casualties because he had taken care to avoid them. Neither of the buildings he attacked suffered damage. The helicopter he stole was found 24 hours later, abandoned in a verdant valley near the Caribbean coastline outside Caracas. ||||| CARACAS (Reuters) - Pipe-wielding government supporters burst into Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest flare-up of violence during a political crisis.      The melee, which injured seven opposition politicians, was another worrying flashpoint in a traumatic last three months for the South American OPEC nation, shaken by opposition protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro.      At least 90 people have died in the unrest, with fighting and barricades frequently blocking cities across Venezuela.      National Assembly president Julio Borges said more than 350 politicians, journalists and guests to the Independence Day session were trapped in the siege that lasted until dusk.      “There are bullets, cars destroyed including mine, blood stains around the (congress) palace,” he told reporters. “The violence in Venezuela has a name and surname: Nicolas Maduro.”      The crowd had gathered just after dawn outside the building in downtown Caracas, chanting in favor of Maduro, witnesses said. In the late morning, several dozen people ran past the gates with pipes, sticks and stones and went on the attack.      Several injured lawmakers stumbled bloodied and dazed around the assembly’s corridors. Some journalists were robbed.      After the morning attack, a crowd of roughly 100 people, many dressed in red and shouting “Long Live The Revolution!”, trapped people inside for hours, witnesses said.      Some in the crowd outside the legislature brandished pistols, threatened to cut water and power supplies, and played an audio of former socialist president Hugo Chavez saying “Tremble, oligarchy!” Fireworks were thrown inside.      Related Coverage Venezuela Assembly siege ending: witnesses      The worst-hurt lawmaker, Americo De Grazia, was hit on the head, fell unconscious, and was eventually taken by stretcher to an ambulance. His family later said he was out of critical condition and being stitched up.      Downtown Caracas is a traditional stronghold neighborhood for the government and there has been a string of clashes there since the opposition thrashed the ruling Socialist Party in December 2015 parliamentary elections.      In a speech during a military parade for Independence Day, Maduro condemned the “strange” violence in the assembly and asked for an investigation. But he also challenged the opposition to speak out about violence from within its ranks.      In daily protests since April, young demonstrators have frequently attacked security forces with stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails, and burned property. They killed one man by dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire.      “I want peace for Venezuela,” Maduro said. “I don’t accept violence from anyone.”      FOREIGN CONDEMNATION      Numerous foreign nations repudiated Wednesday’s events.      “I condemn the grotesque attack on the Venezuelan assembly,” tweeted UK ambassador John Saville.      “This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela’s independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela’s independence 206 years ago today,” the U.S. State Department said.

REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares      Venezuela’s opposition is demanding general elections to end socialist rule and solutions to the OPEC nation’s brutal economic crisis. The government says its foes are seeking a violent coup with U.S. support.      Earlier, a Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video vowing to continue fighting.      “Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,” police pilot Oscar Perez said in the video, wearing a military uniform and wool cap, with a Venezuelan flag and rifle behind him.      Perez had not been seen since he hijacked a helicopter last week and flew through Caracas pulling a “Freedom” banner. He opened fire and dropped grenades on the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court but nobody was injured.      Maduro, 54, the successor to Hugo Chavez, called that attack a terrorist assault to overthrow him and lambasted Western nations for not condemning it.      But many government critics doubt the official version, and some even suggested it may have been staged to divert attention from the country’s economic and political crises.      In the video, Perez said the attack was “perfectly achieved” with no collateral damage “because it was planned, because we are not murderers like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro.”      Perez said he had staged an emergency landing on the Caribbean coast following the attack, and returned to the capital after hiking through mountains. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Perez, who has portrayed himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, also is an actor who starred in a 2015 movie about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman.      Although he has claimed wider support within the security forces, Perez’s actions so far appear to be a rogue stunt organized by a small group of disaffected policemen.      Slideshow (21 Images)      Venezuela’s opposition says Maduro is seeking to consolidate control through a Constituent Assembly, a superbody that will be elected at the end of July. The opposition has promised to boycott the vote, which it says is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party.      Before the attack on them, opposition lawmakers held a session denouncing the president as a “dictator” and approving a plebiscite that the opposition is organizing for July 16, asking Venezuelans what they think of Maduro’s plans. |||||	– Pro-government militias wielding wooden sticks and metal bars stormed the congress building in Caracas on Wednesday, attacking opposition lawmakers during a special session coinciding with Venezuela's independence day.

summarize: Stock image of typewriter. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)      Germany may go old school to guard against spying.      The German government will continue to use encrypted e-mails and phones, but it could also expand its use of typewriters, said Patrick Sensburg, the head of the German parliament's investigation into U.S. spying, in an interview with German TV station ARD Monday, Reuters reports.      The Germans are even considering using non-electronic typewriters, Sensburg said.      .      Last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel objected to U.S. National Security Agency surveillance in Germany, including her own cellphone.      To add to German distrust of the United States, a man who reportedly worked for Germany's intelligence agency was arrested this month for allegedly selling documents to the United States.      Germany would not be the first country to turn to less sophisticated technology in countersurveillance efforts. . Last year, Russia's Federal Guard Service decided to use more typewriters and paper documents after Edward Snowden's leaks of classified NSA documents.      At the time, Nikolai Kovalev, the former head of the Federal Security Service, told Russian newspaper Izvestia, "Any information can be taken from computers. ... So from the point of view of keeping secrets, the most primitive method is preferred: a human hand with a pen or a typewriter."

The head of the Bundestag's parliamentary inquiry into NSA activity in Germany said in an interview with the Morgenmagazin TV programme that he and his colleagues were seriously thinking of ditching email completely.      Asked "Are you considering typewriters" by the interviewer on Monday night, the Christian Democrat politican Patrick Sensburg said: "As a matter of fact, we have – and not electronic models either". "Really?" the surprised interviewer checked. "Yes, no joke," Sensburg responded.      "Unlike other inquiry committees, we are investigating an ongoing situation. Intelligence activities are still going on, they are happening," said Sensburg.      Last week, Merkel's government asked the CIA's station officer in Germany to leave the country after an employee of the German intelligence agency BND confessed to passing confidential documents to the US secret service. The ongoing investigation prompted speculation that the CIA may have actively targeted the Bundestag's NSA inquiry committee.      Last year, the Russian government reportedly took similar measures after the extent of US electronic surveillance was revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.      The federal guard service, a powerful body tasked with protecting Russia's highest-ranking officials, put in an order for 20 Triumph Adler typewriters, which create unique "handwriting", that allows the source of any documents created on them to be traced.      But judging by the reaction to Sensburg's comments, manual typewriters are unlikely to be widely adopted in German political circles.      "Before I start using typewriters and burning notes after reading, I'd rather abolish the secret services," tweeted Martina Renner, an opposition member of the parliamentary committee investigating the activities of US and other intelligence agencies in Germany. Sahra Wagenknecht, Die Linke party's deputy chair, described the suggestion as grotesque.      Christian Flisek, the SPD's representative on the committee, told Spiegel Online: "This call for mechanical typewriters is making our work sound ridiculous. We live in the 21st century, where many people communicate predominantly by digital means. Effective counter-espionage works digitally too. The idea that we can protect people from surveillance by dragging them back to the typewriter is absurd."      Yet while Sensburg may regret his comments, there is little question that revelations about digital surveillance have triggered a fundamental rethink about how the German government conducts its communications.      "Above all, people are trying to stay away from technology whenever they can," wrote Die Welt. "Those concerned talk less on the phone, prefer to meet in person. More coffees are being drunk and lunches eaten together. Even the walk in the park is increasingly enjoying a revival."      Last November, in the immediate aftermath of the revelations of NSA monitoring of Merkel's mobile phone, the German government instructed its MPs to only use encrypted mobile phones for sensitive calls. The use of iPhones for intra-governmental communications is reportedly banned.      Since then, some have even questioned whether the state-of-the-art "Secusmart" encryption mobile currently used by the chancellor is safe from bugging attempts.      The Bundestag's NSA inquiry committee has found its own way of protecting itself from surveillance: before every meeting, members leave their mobiles in a metal box in an adjacent room, in which any remaining snippets of conversation are drowned out by the music of Edvard Grieg played at full blast. |||||	– The wave of the future for some German government communications could be a decidedly retro one. It's no secret that the country is unhappy with NSA and other spying on the country, and in a TV interview Monday, the politician heading up parliament's probe into NSA doings in the country revealed that his NSA committee is seriously considering using typewriters. "And not electronic models either." The interviewer seemed not to expect that revelation, notes the Guardian, asking, "Really?" Replied Patrick Sensburg, "Yes, no joke." Some of Germany's politicians do see it as a joke, however. Says the SPD's representative on the committee, "This call for mechanical typewriters is making our work sound ridiculous. The idea that we can protect people from surveillance by dragging them back to the typewriter is absurd." USA Today notes that Russia has reportedly been using more typewriters in the wake of the Snowden leaks, specifically, an electric German model called the Triumph-Adler Twen 180. Indeed, Kremlin security officials planned to spend more than $15,000 on the machines last year.

summarize: Philae, the probe that landed on a comet as part of the Rosetta mission, has detected organic molecules in the comet's atmosphere. We don't know exactly what the molecules are yet, but they could hold a key to early life on Earth. Hell, this is a big reason we sent Rosetta all the way to a lonely comet in the first place.      Advertisement      Organic molecules are those that contain carbon. We, being carbon-based life forms, are all made of such molecules, but organic molecules may actually have extraterrestrial origins. Simulations have suggested that ultraviolet radiation bombarding icy particles can form organic molecules out in space. In turn, comets could have brought those molecules to Earth, providing the raw materials for life on our planet.      The Rosetta team was expecting to find organic molecules on the comet, but didn't—and, as yet, still don't—know exactly what kind. It could be simple organic molecules like methane, which would confirm what what we've observed about comets from afar. Even more exciting would be complex ones like amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids made of the exact same atoms can be mirror images of one another, either left-handed or right-handed. It's long puzzled scientists why the majoriy of amino acids on Earth are left-handed—perhaps this imbalance can be traced to the amino acids found on a comet.      Advertisement      To get a complete picture, scientists will need to analyze samples from beneath the comet's surface, too. The experiment to drill into the comet and analyze samples seems to have failed. There might be another chance it Philae gets more sunlight as the comet speeds toward the sun. Meanwhile Philae has gone dark, but scientists are still hard at work analyzing the data it sent back. [WSJ]      Top image: European Space Agency ||||| Image copyright Esa/Rosetta /Navcam      The Philae lander has detected organic molecules on the surface of its comet, scientists have confirmed.      Carbon-containing "organics" are the basis of life on Earth and may give clues to chemical ingredients delivered to our planet early in its history.      The compounds were picked up by a German-built instrument designed to "sniff" the comet's thin atmosphere.      Other analyses suggest the comet's surface is largely water-ice covered with a thin dust layer.      The European Space Agency (Esa) craft touched down on the Comet 67P on 12 November after a 10-year journey.      Dr Fred Goessmann, principal investigator on the Cosac instrument, which made the organics detection, confirmed the find to BBC News. But he added that the team was still trying to interpret the results.      It has not been disclosed which molecules have been found, or how complex they are.      There's a trade off - once it gets too hot, Philae will die as well. There is a sweet spot Prof Mark McCaughrean, Senior science adviser, Esa      But the results are likely to provide insights into the possible role of comets in contributing some of the chemical building blocks to the primordial mix from which life evolved on the early Earth.      Preliminary results from the Mupus instrument, which deployed a hammer to the comet after Philae's landing, suggest there is a layer of dust 10-20cm thick on the surface with very hard water-ice underneath.      The ice would be frozen solid at temperatures encountered in the outer Solar System - Mupus data suggest this layer has a tensile strength similar to sandstone.      "It's within a very broad spectrum of ice models. It was harder than expected at that location, but it's still within bounds," said Prof Mark McCaughrean, senior science adviser to Esa, told BBC News.      "People will be playing with [mathematical] models of pure water-ice mixed with certain amount of dust."      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Philae has gone into standby because of low power      He explained: "You can't rule out rock, but if you look at the global story, we know the overall density of the comet is 0.4g/cubic cm. There's no way the thing's made of rock.      "It's more likely there's sintered ice at the surface with more porous material lower down that hasn't been exposed to the Sun in the same way."      After bouncing off the surface at least twice, Philae came to a stop in some sort of high-walled trap.      "The fact that we landed up against something may actually be in our favour. If we'd landed on the main surface, the dust layer may have been even thicker and it's possible we might not have gone down [to the ice]," said Prof McCaughrean.      Scientists had to race to perform as many key tests as they could before Philae's battery life ran out at the weekend.      On re-charge      A key objective was to drill a sample of "soil" and analyse it in Cosac's oven. But, disappointingly, the latest information suggest no soil was delivered to the instrument.      Prof McCaughrean explained: "We didn't necessarily see many organics in the signal. That could be because we didn't manage to pick up a sample. But what we know is that the drill went down to its full extent and came back up again."      "But there's no independent way to say: This is what the sample looks like before you put it in there."      Scientists are hopeful however that as Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko approaches the Sun in coming months, Philae's solar panels will see sunlight again. This might allow the batteries to re-charge, and enable the lander to perform science once more.      "There's a trade off - once it gets too hot, Philae will die as well. There is a sweet spot," said Prof McCaughrean.      He added: "Given the fact that there is a factor of six, seven, eight in solar illumination and the last action we took was to rotate the body of Philae around to get the bigger solar panel in, I think it's perfectly reasonable to think it may well happen.      "By being in the shadow of the cliff, it might even help us, that we might not get so hot, even at full solar illumination. But if you don't get so hot that you don't overheat, have you got enough solar power to charge the system."      The lander's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), designed to provide information on the elemental composition of the surface, seems to have partially seen a signal from its own lens cover - which could have dropped off at a strange angle because Philae was not lying flat.

They said it was not yet clear whether the molecules included the complex compounds that make up proteins. One of the key aims of the mission is to discover whether carbon-based compounds, the basis of life as we know it, were brought to early Earth by comets.      Philae landed on Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko after a 10-year journey through space aboard the Rosetta spacecraft, on a mission to unlock details about how planets and perhaps even how life evolved. It wrapped up a 57-hour marathon of scientific experiments on the comet's surface on Saturday as its batteries ran out. Philae's COSAC gas-analyzing instrument was able to sniff the comet's ultra-thin atmosphere and detect the first organic molecules after landing, the DLR German Aerospace Center said. The lander also drilled into the comet's surface, although it is still unclear whether Philae managed to deliver a sample to COSAC for analysis.

An instrument aboard the Philae lander essentially sniffed the atmosphere and found evidence of the molecules, which, as the Wall Street Journal explains, are the "rudimentary building blocks of life." It might shed further light on the theory that a comet or comets smacked into a young Earth and delivered the materials necessary for life. While the discovery isn't a huge surprise, it could prove especially interesting if the molecules are complex ones such as amino acids rather than simple ones such as methane, observes the Journal. Further study is needed to figure out what kind of molecules were found, but it looks like scientists won't be getting any help from soil analysis. The lander drilled below the comet's surface to retrieve a frozen sample, which was to be analyzed in the lander's oven, but it now looks like no sample ever made it into the oven, reports the BBC. As scientists pore over data that the lander managed to send before going dark, they continue to hold out hope that the craft, which is equipped with solar panels, will wake up in the coming months as the comet moves closer to the sun. As for the newly discovered organic molecules, "they could hold a key to early life on Earth," writes Sarah Zhang at Gizmodo. "This is a big reason we sent Rosetta all the way to a lonely comet in the first place. "
summarize: In the courtyard of Teatro Lux, a theater in Pisa, Italy, the performance of an experimental production on Saturday offered an unusual spectacle. The play, called “Mirages,” was not performed from a stage, but throughout the theater by different actors in different places. The audience moved through the play as one might move through a gallery.      Then, the surreal scene got even more so: An actor performing a monologue in which he simulated hanging, either accidentally or purposefully, hung himself for real in front of a single member of the audience. Now, 27-year-old Raphael Schumacher is dead, and two directors and two stage technicians are being investigated for manslaughter, as ANSA News reported.      “The actor was supposed to perform a short monologue, revolving around the difficulties experienced by a 15-year-old boy and including a hanging simulation at the end,” prosecutor Giancarlo Dominijanni told Il Tirreno. “The original script included an interaction between the spectator and Schumacher before the tragic event. It was performed successfully earlier on Saturday evening, when he ended the scene laying his head in the noose.”      Schumacher, as the BBC reported, was rescued by the audience member, who happened to be a recently graduated from medical school and who, though Schumacher’s face was covered, saw his body twitching. But the damage was irreversible. He never recovered consciousness and was declared clinically dead Thursday.      Questions about how he could have met such a tragic fate — and speculation over whether he meant to kill himself — have been raised as details of the strange incident slowly emerged in Italian media and English-language outlets.      “I strongly believe he did not try to commit suicide,” the actor’s mother, unnamed in an Il Tirreno report, said. “… His father died recently and he had just broken up with someone, but he had soon regained inner peace. He didn’t leave any messages and had no reason to kill himself.”      However, others pointed out that Schumacher had changed the original ending of his scene in “Mirages.”      “The script included a different ending, a gunshot. Raphael changed it without telling us,” Andrea Vescio, one of the managers of Teatro Lux, said. Vescio added: “All I can say is that I saw a 27-year-old boy on the ground, unconscious. He was performing a hanging scene in front of a sole spectator, the young graduate who called for help.” (The ANSA report that confirmed Schumacher’s death did not name the theater staff under investigation.)      “We are truly shocked,” Gabriele De Luca, art director of the theater, told Il Tirreno. “We don’t know what happened exactly, nobody knows. We immediately started collaborating with the investigators. … We just hope Raphael will get better soon.”      In the wake of the tragedy, the theater has closed.      “Following the imponderable tragedy that occurred at the Theater Lux in the night of Saturday 30 January, we believe it is appropriate to suspend all activities of the theater, including the shows,” the theater said in a statement translated to English on its Facebook page. “As soon as the activities will resume it will be our care to communicate through our website, our profiles on social networks and the media, the press. We will of course to reimburse as soon as possible all those who had already bought tickets. Some of your understanding we hope you can respect this silence, we salute you.”      Schumacher graduated from drama school last year; Teatro Lux is a venue in downtown Pisa that includes a movie theater, bar and performance space. An English translation of a mission statement posted to its website reads: “We want to dispel the myth … that theater is something boring and challenging, suitable only for young ladies in fur coats and tails, and rediscover the playful and popular — in the best sense of the term — soul of the theater.”      More from Morning Mix      Wife crashes her own funeral, horrifying her husband, who had paid to have her killed ||||| PISA. Raphael Schumacher, 27-years-old young professional actor of experimental theatre born in Brunate (in the Province of Como) is in desperate conditions in the intensive-care unit of Pisa’s main hospital. He is in a coma after the tragedy occurred Saturday night, during his performance in a theatre of the historical city centre. The theatre is now sealed off and the police is investigating. Investigators, who are being coordinated by State prosecutor Giancarlo Dominijanni, have interviewed who was present when the incident occurred (dozens of people among the audience and the characters on stage)      A YOUNG MEDICAL GRADUATE AND ONLY SPECTATOR REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG According a summary reconstruction of the event, the actor, who works with the association "The Thing", was performing a hanging scene in the theatre courtyard. Suddenly, something went wrong. He just had put the rope on a fig tree and his feet on a cube. A young female spectator, a recent medical graduate, immediately noticed that the actor was not acting anymore, but something more serious was happening. Schumacher’s face was covered by a mask, but his trembling body left no doubt: he was alive but suffocating. She cried for help, lowering him to the ground and called 118. The actor was already unconscious when the ambulance took him to the hospital. This is what the young woman told the investigators.      TWO HYPOTHESES When the incident occurred, six shows in six different halls were being staged, as part of an all-night-event called “Mirages. A night at Lux”. Schumacher was performing the hanging scene in an outside courtyard. There are two hypotheses under examination: either the actor tried to commit suicide or he was a victim of a tragic accident. Police is also verifying if proper workplace safety procedures were in place.      RAPHAEL’S MOTHER: "I STRONGLY BELIEVE HE DID NOT TRY TO COMMIT SUIDEIC” Raphael’s mother is obviously shocked. She arrived in Pisa on Sunday morning and stayed all day at the hospital. She immediately excluded the hypothesis of suicide. "His father died recently and he had just broken up with someone, but he had soon regained inner peace. He didn’t leave any messages and had no reason to kill himself”, she said.      THE MANAGERS OF THE THEATRE: “HE WAS STAGING A HANGING SCENE” "We are devastated. We don’t really know what to say”, said Andrea Vescio, one of the managers of the association “The Thing”, with shaky voice. "All I can say is that I saw a 27-year-old boy on the ground, unconscious. He was performing a hanging scene in front of a sole spectator, the young graduate who called for help". According to the police, there were a few dozens of people in the theatre, when the incident occurred. “We are truly shocked. We don’t know what happened exactly, nobody knows. We immediately started collaborating with the investigators”, said Gabriele De Luca, art director the theatre. “We just hope Raphael will get better soon”.

The four may also be liable for failing to follow workplace safety regulations, prosecutors said. Schumacher was pronounced dead Thursday evening and his family authorized the donation of his organs.      In the scene, Schumacher recited a monologue expressing the existential angst of a 15-year-old who ends up placing his head in a noose to depict suicide by hanging. The monologue took place before a single spectator. Shumacher was discovered unconscious and completely oxygen-deprived by the following spectator, a few minutes after the end of his scene.      He never recovered consciousness.       ||||| While all premature celebrity deaths are shocking, some of the most startling are those when an entertainer dies on stage during an actual performance. Actor Brandon Lee was famously mortally wounded by a prop gun while filming The Crow. Entertainer Carmen Miranda famously had a small heart attack while recording a dance segment for a variety show and was found dead lying on the floor the next morning. Popular actors and comedians John Candy and John Ritter both had heart attacks while on-set and died just hours later. And, of course, everyone remembers when Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin was killed by a stingray while filming a snorkeling segment.      This list contains anyone who worked as a professional entertaining on stage, on radio, in film or television or elsewhere, who died while engaged in a performance, in any way. Though the majority of these entertainers suffered an injury or illness mid-performance, and died of natural causes, some were actually killed or were involved in some kind of tragic accident. Those involved in these strange incidents include "Dimebag" Darrell of the metal band Pantera, who was murdered by a gunman while performing in Ohio, or actor Vic Morrow, who memorably was killed on the set of the Twilight Zone film while shooting a scene set in the Vietnam War. Though the list includes performers of all kinds, it does not include stuntmen or those whose performances involved potentially life-threatening situations. ||||| Image copyright Facebook Image caption Raphael Schumacher had been in a coma since the incident.

summarize: A female park ranger was killed trying to protect two British tourists after gunmen ambushed their vehicle in Congo’s Virunga National Park.      The woman, named locally as Rachel Katumwa, was gunned down as the two Britons were dragged away and marched through the forest by their attackers, who are now demanding a $200,000 ransom for their safe return,      Ms Katumwa is understood to be the first female ranger to be killed in the park, which has been riven by violence in recent years.      Tributes were paid to the 25-year-old ranger on Saturday as efforts by the Congolese Army continued to find the kidnapped Britons.      Emmanuel de Merode, Virunga National Park director, said Ms Katumwa was one of the Park’s 26 female rangers. He added that she was "committed, showing true bravery in her work".      One of Ms Katumwa's colleagues at Virunga National Park described her as “a devoted conservationist who died in the line of duty’”. ||||| LONDON (Reuters) - Two Britons and their Congolese driver held hostage in Democratic Republic of Congo have been released, Virunga National Park said on Sunday.      Robert Jesty and Bethan Davies were abducted along with their driver on Friday while visiting Africa’s oldest national park.      Park ranger Rachel Makissa Baraka, 25, was killed during the kidnapping, which took place near the village of Kibati just north of Goma.      The two freed British hostages said they were “very grateful for the excellent support” they had received.      They would not comment further, they said in a statement released by Britain’s Foreign Office.      Baraka was critically injured when the vehicle the four were travelling in was attacked by armed assailants, the park said on its website.      She was transferred to a nearby hospital to receive emergency medical treatment, but died shortly afterwards of her injuries, the park said.      “She was one of the Park’s 26 female rangers and was highly committed, showing true bravery in her work,” said Park Director Emmanuel de Merode.      Eastern Congo has been the scene of waves of violence over the past 2-1/2 decades and was at the epicentre of two wars between 1996 and 2003 that killed millions, mainly through hunger and disease.      Rebel groups and militias still control large swathes of the territory. More than 175 rangers have died protecting the park, which is in the rugged mountains and volcanic plains adjacent to Rwanda and Uganda.      It has nevertheless attracted a growing number of visitors keen to visit its endangered mountain gorillas and the active Nyiragongo volcano.      British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson paid tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation “for their tireless help during this terrible case”.      “My thoughts are now with the family of Virunga Park ranger Rachel Makissa Baraka who was killed during the kidnapping, and with the injured driver and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident,” he said.

The park, which is a Unesco world heritage site, is home to critically-endangered mountain gorillas, lions, elephants and hippos.      The Foreign Office currently - and before the kidnapping - advises against travelling to the area.      "The opportunities for gorilla trekking in the Virunga National Park in North Kivu are limited, and armed groups are sometimes active within the park," the advice says.      "Tourists in eastern DRC have been known to be left very vulnerable as a result of trying to travel independently without escorted transport, and the risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high." |||||	– A pair of British hikers looking for adventure in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been freed after being kidnapped, but a 25-year-old park ranger is dead. British authorities said Sunday that Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty had been freed after gunmen ambushed their vehicle in Virunga National Park on Friday, reports the BBC. During the ambush, the gunmen killed Rachel Masika Baraka, who was one of 26 female rangers at the park. She is believed to be the first female ranger killed at Virunga, which Reuters explains is located in a still-volatile region near Uganda and Rwanda but remains a draw for tourists worldwide because of its endangered mountain gorillas and active volcano. She is the eighth park ranger overall killed in this year alone. The details of how the hostages were freed remain murky, but ransom negotiations had been underway. The gunmen took the British pair on foot, along with their driver, who was eventually freed before the Brits. "One of them said to me ‘I will leave you here, if (they) find you, tell them we need $200,000 and if they keep on chasing us, we will kill these two,'" the injured driver tells the Telegraph. The kidnappers later reduced their demand to $30,000, according to another story in the Telegraph. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced the release but did not say whether any ransom was paid. "I pay tribute to the help of the DRC authorities and Congolese Institute of Nature Conservation," Johnson tweeted. "My thoughts with the family of the ranger tragically killed during the kidnapping."

Hardest hit in this latest round — as revealed by The Daily Beast — is Leonardo DiCaprio.      The “Titanic” star’s decision to pull out of a planned Steve Jobs biopic turns DiCaprio into a punching bag in a series of September ­e-mails between a producer on the problem-plagued project and Amy Pascal, the studio’s beleaguered co-chair.      “Despicable,” Pascal blasts Leo in an impolitic slur that’s sure to shake her already precarious standing at the studio.      Pascal has been flailing in a rising tide of embarrassing leaks for days — including one in which she made racially insensitive jokes about President Obama’s movie preferences — and has been fighting to keep her job with a series of mea culpas, including apologies to the Rev. Al Sharpton and the public in general.      “Was this about the deal … or did he just change his mind,” the producer, Mark Gordon, e-mails Pascal at the start of the acid exchange, inquiring into why DiCaprio ditched the Aaron Sorkin-penned “Jobs.”      Pascal replies, “The latter,” implying that the star was simply being DiCapricious.      “Horrible behavior,” sniffs Gordon.      “Actually despicable,” ups Pascal.      George Clooney gets considerably better treatment from the tart-tongued executrix in an e-mail exchange from ­January.      Clooney was having a crisis of confidence — in a big way — over bad reviews for “The Monuments Men.”      But Pascal actually comforted him, promising him both protection and profits.      “I need some protection from all the reviews,” the surprisingly thin-skinned Clooney writes Pascal in an e-mail subject-lined “it’s getting worse.”      “Let’s just make it a hit,” he adds. “I haven’t slept in 30 hours. And it’s 7 am.”      Pascal answers, “we will protect you by making money… that’s the best revenge.”      The next day, Clooney is still sounding deprived of sleep and confidence.      “I adore you Amy,” he writes her.      “You are literally the only person running a studio that loves film. I fear I’ve let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I’ve just lost touch… Who knew? Sorry. I won’t do it again.”            I need some protection from all the reviews… I haven’t slept in 30 hours. - Clooney in an e-mail to Amy Pascal      Adorable Willow and Jaden Smith turn out to be the youngest-yet victims of Sony’s hating honchos.      This time, the bile comes from no less than Tom Rothman, the head of Sony subsidiary TriStar Productions.      Rothman takes a swipe at the kids in an e-mail he sent to Pascal in November, after he reads an interview in T magazine that recounts the Smith family’s unorthodox opinions on everything from public education to quantum physics.      “1. Read this,” Rothman writes Pascal.      “2. they r home schooled: don’t let this family date your movies!!!”      The e-mail makes no mention of dad Will Smith’s two-decade-long successful history with the studio, extending back to “Men in Black.”      Pascal’s on far better terms with star Ryan Gosling.      “Ryan absolutely loved you,” Ilene Feldman, Gosling’s talent manager, told Pascal after an October meeting.      “Said it was like speed dating because he was late after hitting every wrong gate on the lot. Not [sic] it should turn to marriage. He really wants to do something with you.”      Pascal was so pleased by the praise that she forwarded the e-mail to Michael De Luca, co-president of production for Sony subsidiary Columbia Pictures, along with a query into what future projects Gosling might be interested in.      “It’s ‘Ghostbusters’ according to Ilene,” De Luca replies.      Other recently revealed dirt includes revelations that Sony execs were extremely unhappy with the script for the $300 million-plus 007 flick “Spectre,” the much-sweated-over pages of which were leaked in their entirety.      “THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF A TWIST RATHER THAN A SERIES OF WATERY CHASES WTIH GUNS,” one exec yelled in capital letters in August about the flick’s ending, according to Defamer .gawker.com.      Another stunning revelation: Sony’s $600,000 top p.r. exec was fired after The Hollywood Reporter failed to invite Pascal to participate in a round- ­table interview with other top Hollywood execs, according to Bloomberg news.      “Fire your PR guy immediately,” advised Pascal’s husband, ex-New York Times reporter Bernard Weinraub.      The exec, Charles Sipkins, was out of a job six days later, Bloomberg reported.      The monthlong e-mail barrage is the handiwork of a band of hackers calling itself the “Guardians of Peace.”      The group is believed to be affiliated with the government of North Korea, which has loudly decried Sony’s planned Christmas release of the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy “The Interview.”      The two actors portray journalists hired by the CIA to assassinate North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.      On Saturday, the hackers released a seventh batch of files purloined from Sony’s computers — along with a promise of more to come, plus an unspecified “Christmas gift.”      The gift will “put sony Pictures into the worst state,” The Hollywood Reporter reported. ||||| Lea Seydoux (l) and Monica Bellucci will join the cast of Spectre alongside Daniel Craig.      An early version of the script for the new James Bond film has been stolen by hackers.      The producers of Spectre have confirmed that the screenplay was taken as part of a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November.      In a statement on the film's official website, Eon Productions said they were concerned the script may be published online.      Spectre is due to be released in November 2015.      The statement said: "Eon Productions, the producers of the James Bond films, learned this morning that an early version of the screenplay for the new Bond film SPECTRE is amongst the material stolen and illegally made public by hackers who infiltrated the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system.      "Eon Productions is concerned that third parties who have received the stolen screenplay may seek to publish it or its contents."      Bond will be driving an Aston Martin DB10 in the 2015 release      Filming for Spectre began this month after the title and cast were unveiled in London.      A new car was shown off, but few details were given about the plot for the film.      A Sony spokesman denied reports that the cyber attack had forced the studio to stop production.      "Productions are still moving forward," Robert Lawson told the Reuters news agency.      The Bond franchise is a valuable asset for Sony Pictures, with Skyfall making $1.1 billion (£640m) worldwide.      On November 24 hackers disabled the computer network at California-based Sony Pictures.      They also released salary and Social Security numbers for thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities      North Korea has denied being behind the attack in retaliation for a film depicting the country's leader but praised it as a "righteous deed".      The FBI has confirmed that it is investigating.      Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube ||||| Thursday night’s world premiere of Sony’s “The Interview” offered plenty of laughs after weeks of news from the massive cyber-hack that’s bedeviled the studio.      “I can’t say I’ve been getting a lot of sleep lately,” said Sony’s Dwight Caines.      There were three police cars parked outside the Ace Hotel Theatre, very few camera crews, and a very small red carpet inside where Seth Rogen, James Franco and Randall Park posed for photographers and declined media interviews. Attendees tended to avoid discussing the disclosures arising from the online attacks — which many believe may have been orchestrated by North Korea because of the movie. Indeed, Rogen assiduously avoided any mention of the hacking during the run-up to the screening.      “If you’re going to ask me questions, I’m going to run away!” he said, before he did.      The audience cheered as Rogen and co-director Evan Goldberg took the stage to intro the comedy with a heartfelt shout-out to studio president Amy Pascal.      “Before we start we just want to thank Amy Pascal for having the balls to make this movie!” Rogen said to a near standing ovation. Before the screening started, Pascal was greeted continuously with hugs from well-wishers including Caines, producers Matt Tolmach, Tom Rothman and Donald De Line.      Charles Chun, who plays General Jong in the film, said afterwards that he had no doubt about the origin of the hack.      “I think we know who did this,” he said. “And if they can do this to a big corporation like Sony, what does that mean for everyone else?”      However, Chun seemed to think that, if anything, the hack has raised awareness of the film. “And I think the film is going to do really well at the box office because it’s so funny.” ||||| For Sony Pictures, it may get even worse.      Hackers are threatening to release more sensitive data from last month's massive cyber break-in.      "We are preparing for you a Christmas gift," the group posted on a website. "The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state."      The file has since been deleted but CNN viewed a saved version of the post.      Related: Get up-to-speed on the Sony mega-hack      The hackers, who call themselves The Guardians of Peace, have already exposed a trove of sensitive data. Revelations include everything from embarrassing emails between Sony executives to information on compensation and celebrity secrets.      While the identity of the hackers remains murky, several security researchers have pointed to North Korea. They point to similarities between this hack and last year's attack against South Korean banks.      Why Sony Pictures and why Christmas? The hackers are believed to have been inspired by the Christmas day release of the Hollywood studio's film "The Interview." Seth Rogen and James Franco star in a comedy about a plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.      Related: Bringing down Sony was frighteningly easy |||||	– The Sony hackers apparently also stole an early version of the script to the latest Bond movie, titled Sceptre, according to the BBC, and the movie's producers say in a statement they're "concerned that third parties who have received the stolen screenplay may seek to publish it or its contents." Meanwhile, reports CNN, the group says it's far from done: "We are preparing for you a Christmas gift," it posted online. "The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state." But wait, there is much, much more fallout: Sony exec Amy Pascal is taking another hit, blasting Leonardo DiCaprio as "despicable" for pulling out of a planned Steve Jobs biopic, reports Page Six. George Clooney, meanwhile, confessed bad reviews for The Monuments Men were eating him up. "I need some protection from all the reviews," he emailed Pascal. "It's getting worse. I haven’t slept in 30 hours. And it’s 7 am." When she responded, "we will protect you by making money… that’s the best revenge," he emailed back, "I adore you Amy. You are literally the only person running a studio that loves film. I fear I’ve let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I’ve just lost touch… Who knew? Sorry. I won’t do it again." In another email, Pascal discusses plans for a "female spidey movie," notes the Daily Beast. She also fielded a pitch from Kanye West's creative director, who was "looking to take the storytelling to the next level with a feature length film, shot for an immersive cinema experience." Gawker notes that in a subject line "Jaden and Willow Smith on Prana Energy, Time and Why School is Overrated," one Sony exec jokes to Pascal that "they r home schooled: don't let this family date your movies!!!" Meanwhile, Variety notes that Seth Rogen, star of The Interview (which possibly prompted the hack) gave a shout-out to Pascal. "We just wanted to thank Amy Pascal for having the balls to make this movie!" he told the crowd at the premiere.

summarize: Media ‘Megyn Kelly Today’ Ratings Not All Sunshine for NBC’s New Morning Host Image Megyn Kelly drew 2.9 million viewers on her first day as host of the 9 a.m. hour of NBC’s “Today” show. By the end of her first week, the number had fallen to 2.3 million. Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times      Megyn Kelly, the new host of the 9 a.m. hour of NBC’s “Today” show, is off to a soft start in the ratings.      In her first week as a cheerful morning personality, Ms. Kelly, a former Fox News anchor, drew an average of 2.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen, with 765,000 of them in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic prized by advertisers and network executives.      The total audience for “Megyn Kelly Today,” Ms. Kelly’s portion of the show, was roughly in line with what “Today” was reaching in the same hour before making the change, when it was hosted by Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer and Sheinelle Jones. In the coveted age bracket, the show’s audience for Ms. Kelly was 5 percent smaller than it was the previous week.      NBC hired Ms. Kelly, 46, in January. She had spent 12 years as part of the 21st Century Fox family and was a popular figure among the cable network’s conservative viewers. In an effort to keep her from leaving, Fox reportedly offered her an annual salary of $20 million, but to no avail.      Ms. Kelly’s first “Today” hour, which featured as its main guests the cast of the rebooted NBC sitcom “Will & Grace,” had an audience of 2.9 million viewers. The next day, 2.6 million viewers tuned in. By week’s end, the number had fallen to 2.3 million.      With its host reportedly making a salary of $17 million a year and a new set having been constructed within NBC’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, “Megyn Kelly Today” is more costly than the previous 9 a.m. segment of “Today.” Losing viewers, in the long run, would be a problem.      Ms. Kelly’s first week was highly scrutinized, and the early reviews for the show were brutal. She addressed them at the end of her hour on Sept. 29, saying, “It’s been very exciting, it’s been so educational, I’ve been just so delighted by the media response, which is really” — she shook her head before continuing — “no.”      After a breath, she added, “The viewer response has been awesome!”      As Ms. Kelly moved away from the sometimes prosecutorial persona she inhabited during much of her tenure at Fox, there were a few bumpy moments. The “Will & Grace” star Debra Messing said after appearing on the show that she regretted having done so. Jane Fonda blanched when Ms. Kelly asked her to talk about plastic surgery procedures she has had. And a vulgarity uttered by a cameraman who inadvertently walked into a shot went viral.      Another awkward moment came on Oct. 3, two days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, when Ms. Kelly cut off Tom Brokaw, the former longtime NBC anchor and network eminence, as he went into a lengthy discourse on gun rights and the National Rifle Association.      “Got it,” Ms. Kelly said, adding that she had to “leave it at that, Tom,” before shifting to a commercial break. (Mr. Brokaw later told The Washington Post that he was having problems with his hearing aid. “I’m a Kelly fan,” he added.)      Ms. Kelly has said that the show would be a mix of a talk show and a news show, and it has moved in both directions, from typical morning fare — celebrity interviews, a segment involving an adorable crime-fighting dog — to gritty discussions of the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers cases.      NBC has said from the start that it would be patient with the show. Andrew Lack, the network’s news chairman, told affiliates months ago that he did not expect things to be “perfect” with both of Ms. Kelly’s new programs — she also hosts a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus — in the early going.      At least for now, it appears that Ms. Kelly’s main competitor, ABC’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” will maintain a lead in the ratings. In the top 56 media markets, “Live” beat “Megyn Kelly Today” by 21 percent in households last week, according to Nielsen.      Exact audience figures for last week’s episodes of “Live,” a syndicated show featuring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, will not be available until next week. It averaged an 2.8 million viewers in the week before Ms. Kelly’s debut, with 915,000 in the 25-to-54 age range.      For Ms. Kelly and NBC executives, there was one hopeful nugget buried in the Nielsen data: The number of viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic was 755,000 on Sept. 29, after having fallen to roughly 649,000 the day before.

She tells the live studio audience “I’m kind of done with politics for now,” talks about her family and describes events that have shaped her. NBC News’ Megyn Kelly TODAY      Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly prepares for her morning debut on NBC's 'Megyn Kelly Today.' (Photo: Peter Kramer, NBC)      Megyn Kelly called her new morning show a work in progress, but she may need to show marked improvement to justify her NBC price tag.      The former Fox News anchor's Megyn Kelly Today, which premiered Sept. 25, averaged 2.5 million viewers for her first full week, according to Nielsen estimates. That's down 12% from results for Today's 9 a.m. ET/PT hour in the same week last year, in the midst of the election campaign — when Al Roker, Tamron Hall and Billy Bush were anchoring — and down a steep 24% among core news viewers ages 25 to 54.      The good news: After starting with 2.9 million on Monday and dipping to 2.3 million by Wednesday, she leveled off there for the remainder of the week.      More: 'Megyn Kelly Today': 'It's not going to be the Trump channel,' she promises      Premiere-week ratings for the syndicated Live with Kelly and Ryan, which airs opposite Megyn on many ABC stations, are not yet available. But Megyn Kelly Today's lead-in, the 8 a.m. hour of Today, was off a smaller 8%, to 3.7 million, ranking second to ABC's Good Morning America (also down), after tying it in the same week last year. And Today's 10 a.m. hour, starring Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb, was down 7%, to 1.8 million.      NBC will be hard-pressed to justify Kelly's estimated $17 million salary when her lesser-paid predecessors had more viewers, and her summer magazine series regularly ranked third in its time slot behind repeats of 60 Minutes and America's Funniest Videos.      But NBC News president Noah Oppenheim told USA TODAY, before the morning show premiered, that he'd exhibit patience: "Launching a TV show is a hard thing to do, and we're certainly not naïve about that."      Critics pounced on what they called Kelly's missteps in her first days on the air.      'Will & Grace' star Debra Messing, center, says she was "dismayed" by a question host Megyn Kelly asked a gay fan of the show. (Photo: Nathan Congleton/NBC)      She cheerily told a Will & Grace fan on Monday's premiere that "the gay thing is going to work out great" for him, leading the NBC comedy's star Debra Messing to later say she regretted agreeing to appear on the show with her castmates.      On Wednesday, Kelly asked Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery, as the flummoxed 79-year-old actress, sitting next to Robert Redford, said, "We really want to talk about that now?"      And this week, she generated more headlines after she cut off Tom Brokaw mid-sentence during his impassioned speech about the National Rifle Association, in a panel discussion that followed the Las Vegas gun massacre, blaming a "hard break" for a commercial.      Critics also took issue with her transformation from a sharp-elbowed interviewer on Fox News' The Kelly File — where she frequently echoed right-wing talking points about gay marriage and other social issues — to her new role as a warm, touchy-feely morning-show host, for which empathy is part of the job description.      In an earlier interview with USA TODAY, Kelly said she's not a fan of politics and has long wanted to do the type of show she has now. She also said she isn't concerned about the weak track record of daytime hosts such as Katie Couric, Meredith Vieira and Jane Pauley after their Today tenures. "The more time you spend looking over your shoulder, at your competitor or someone that came prior to you, the more you fail."      CLOSE The critics have spoken and Megyn Kelly's debut on 'Today' was super awkward. USA TODAY      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2klIOsg |||||	– The ratings for Megyn Kelly's first week as an NBC host are in, and they are likely to be a disappointment for the network. Megyn Kelly Today debuted last Monday with 2.9 million viewers, dropped to 2.3 million Wednesday, then recovered slightly for an average of 2.5 million viewers, reports USA Today. That's down 12% from last year for the 9am time slot and down 24% among ages 25 to 54. It's worth noting that last year was an election year, which might have helped the numbers. Kelly's ratings were on par with the time slot's ratings just before she took over, notes the New York Times. Kelly won't be network execs' only concern. NBC's Today at 8am and Today With Kathie Lee & Hoda at 10am were also down 8% and 7%, respectively. The numbers for the show seen as Kelly's main competitor, ABC’s Live with Kelly and Ryan, aren't out yet, but it's a safe bet the show will beat Kelly's. The ABC show averaged 2.8 million viewers the week before Kelly's debut, notes the Times.

RadarOnline.com has exclusively obtained the court documents that show the warring exes are in the middle of a bitter custody battle over their 2-year-old daughter, Samantha — and they two are lobbing nasty accusations at each other claiming alcohol abuse, drug use and child abandonment.      READ THE SHOCKING COURT PAPERS      Kennedy, who insists she was 60-year-old Williams’ “spousal equivalent” from 2006 through 2013, is demanding the former child star cough up a monthly child support payment of $3,423, which she claims is peanuts because Williams’ estate is worth at least $13 million.      She also blames Williams for “physically and emotionally abandoning their daughter” and wants to only grant him supervised access since he has a “history of alcohol abuse.”      Kennedy, 36, states in legal documents that Williams “is often too preoccupied with other distractions to be able to give” Samantha “the appropriate attention and care she needs.”      Williams isn’t taking the accusations lightly.      PHOTOS: You Can Sue For That? The 53 Wackiest Lawsuits      “I categorically deny each and every insult upon me as being the rants of a scorned woman,” he wrote in a response obtained by Radar. “I do not and have not abused alcohol or any drugs, legal or illegal.”      He contends that his former live-in lover is upset because she wanted a marriage proposal and got pregnant on purpose when it never materialized. Williams then demands joint legal and physical custody of their toddler.      “She was nothing more than a sexual companion who I treated very well, including paying $23K for dental work because of her neglect of her teeth,” he writes in the scathing court papers.      “I also paid $11K for her to attend Paul Mitchell Beauty School so she could be self-supporting, all to no avail.”      PHOTOS: Hollywood’s 16 Nastiest Custody Battles      Now Williams is requesting that Kennedy not be allowed to disparage him, drink or use drugs like marijuana around their daughter.

The explosive case was scheduled to go to trial this month but has been postponed until mid-summer. ||||| Here’s the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up … her sex life.      “I like to date, but not every date needs to lead to marriage. I actually have a friend with benefits,” 80-year-old Florence Henderson revealed to Closer Weekly.      The “Brady Bunch” matriarch added, “It’s foolish to think that older people don’t enjoy sex. It’s a big myth. There is no age limit on the enjoyment of sex. It keeps getting better.

I really enjoy his company, but I am sure he sees other people, as I do.”      Her type of man is one that she can talk and laugh with. She said that if there’s no sense of humor, she’s “going home very early.”      “I like to date younger men because they need to keep up with me,” she explained.      The actress, known for her prim and proper mother role, is celebrating her 81st birthday on Valentine’s Day, but told the mag that she feels like she’s 28. “I do anything and everything to stay active because, let’s face it, I am not slowing down anytime soon!”      Henderson has four children with her first husband Ira Bernstein who split up in 1985 after 29 years of marriage.

summarize: The PlayStation 3 has been hacked before, originally with the PSJailbreak dongle and fail0verflow, but Sony managed to fight back with Firmware 3.60 which managed to ingeniously re-secure the console. But Hackers have released a custom firmware which allows compromised consoles to log into PSN, alongside LV0 decryption keys which allow the user to bypass future security updates.      The Three Musketeers’ claims that they already had the keys for a while but decided not to publish them.

Unlocking games consoles is a common way for users to open up the system, but in the past, such efforts have been quickly thwarted.      This hack is equivalent to stealing a master key, say experts.      It comes as Sony heard that one of the mass lawsuits brought against it in the US had been dismissed by the judge.      Access to the inner workings of a games console means people can utilise its huge computing power in novel ways.      For example, the United States Air Force has networked 1,700 PS3s to create a powerful supercomputer.      But often the unlocking - called jailbreaking - is seen as a means to allow users to play pirated games.      The hackers behind the publication of the so-called LV0 decryption keys call themselves The Three Musketeers.      They say that they decided to release the information after it was leaked and fell into the hands of hackers who had planned to charge a fee for the code.      In a statement published on The Hacker News, the group said: "You can be sure that if it wouldn't have been for this leak, this key would never have seen the light of day, only the fear of our work being used to make money out of it has forced said us to release this now."      Writing about the hack, Eurogamer said: "Options Sony has in battling this leak are limited - every PS3 out there needs to be able to decrypt any firmware download package in order for the console to be updated.      "The reveal of the LV0 key basically means that any system update released by Sony going forward can be decrypted with little or no effort whatsoever."      'Perfect security'      In the past efforts to jailbreak the PS3 have been countered with the release of firmware able to resecure the console.      Source close to the firm say they are not convinced that the latest hack is any more serious that past ones. An official statement from the console maker is due shortly.      In better news for Sony, a US judge has thrown out a mass lawsuit brought by users of the PlayStation Network, following a huge security breach in May 2011 which saw the user information of 69 million customers exposed.      The suit accused Sony of failing to adequately protect information and exposing users to identity theft.      Judge Battaglia from the US District Court of Southern California pointed to a clause in the user agreement which noted that "there was no such thing as perfect security" and said that the disclaimers meant there were no grounds for the lawsuits.      The plaintiffs have until 9 November to appeal against the decision. |||||	– An online leak of security info for Sony's PlayStation 3 could make it easy for hackers to unlock the system and play pirated games on the console, reports the BBC.

Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 2 ABSTRACT The meaning maintenance model argues that any violation of expectations leads to an affective experience that motivates compensatory affirmation. We explore whether the neural mechanism that responds to meaning threats can be inhibited by acetaminophen, in the same way that it inhibits physical pain, or the distress caused by social rejection. Across two studies, participants received either acetaminophen or a placebo, and were provided with either an unsettling experience or a control experience. In Study 1, participants either wrote about their death or a control topic. In Study 2, participants either watched a surrealist film clip or a control film clip. In both studies, participants in the meaning threat condition who had taken a placebo showed typical compensatory affirmations by becoming more punitive towards law-­‐breakers, while those who had taken acetaminophen, and those in the control conditions, did not. Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 3 It does not take long after the opening credits of a David Lynch film for the viewer to sense that something is awry. Whether it’s the nonlinear dream imagery, the unsettling juxtaposition of the beautiful alongside the horrifying, or the surreal disconnect between the events and characters’ reactions, Lynch’s films are recognized for their ability to “disturb, offend or mystify” (Rodley, 2005, pg. 245). Insofar as it “hurts” to watch some of Lynch’s films, as it arguably does whenever we are assaulted by thoughts and experiences that are at odds with our expectations and values, we might question how this uncomfortable feeling is represented in the brain. In this paper we explore the common foundation that underlies people's reactions to various kinds of events that cause anxiety, unease, and pain. The meaning maintenance model (MMM) proposes that domain-­‐general arousal is triggered by any experience that is surprising, confusing, or in violation of expectations (Heine, Proulx, & Vohs, 2006). In this article, we extend recent work on the common neural pathway for physical and social pain, to suggest that any unexpected event, not just those with a physical or social component, produces the same initial neural and subjective experience of distress. Based on this, we argue that acetaminophen, shown to reduce both physical and social pain, will also prevent typical meaning maintenance responses. Pain and rejection Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 4 Both physical pain and social rejection share a neural process and subjective component that is experienced as distress (Eisenberger & Lieberman, 2004; MacDonald, & Leary, 2005). While there are experiences unique to each event, such as the sensory awareness of specific pain, there are many subjective and neurological similarities that lead to the same general felt unpleasantness (Price, 2000). For instance, there is evidence that experiencing more or less of one type of pain, influences sensitivity to the other (Asmundson, Norton, & Jacobson, 1996; MacDonald, Kingsbury, & Shaw, 2005). Likewise, social support has been found to reduce physical pain (Hoogendoorn, van Poppel, Bongers, Koes, & Bouter, 2000), and a number of drugs (including opiate-­‐based drugs, anti-­‐depressants, and acetaminophen) have been shown to reduce both physical and social pain (e.g., DeWall, et al., 2010; Panksepp, 2004). One brain region that responds to both events is the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The dACC responds to physical and social pain (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003) and its activation is correlated with subjective reports of felt unpleasantness after physical pain (Tölle et al., 1999) and exclusion (Eisenberger, et al., 2003). However, there is evidence that the dACC reacts to all conflicts and errors in general (Botvinick, Cohen, & Carter, 2004). The dACC has been described as a cortical alarm system, sensitive to any discrepancy in the environment, not just to those that relate directly to physical damage or social rejection (Eisenberger & Lieberman, 2004; Inzlicht, McGregor, Hirsh, & Nash, 2009; Shackman et al., 2011). While it is true then, that an individual will likely not confuse a stubbed toe with being picked last for a soccer team, we suggest that the early-­‐ Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 5 stage neural mechanisms for both these events, or for any perceived anomaly, share much in common and require additional context to give them specificity. The Meaning Maintenance Model The MMM focuses on people’s compensatory responses to violations of expectations, termed meaning threats. The model argues that any perceived meaning threat produces unpleasant arousal that often lies outside of awareness, and is non-­‐specific to the causal stimulus. This arousal arguably serves to prompt people to identify the source of the perceived discrepancy and, if time and cognitive resources are sufficiently available, accommodate to the unexpected event. For example, upon observing oneself freely choose to write an essay in favor of a tuition increase at one’s university, a participant might accommodate to this by changing their attitudes towards tuition increases. In many cases, however, it is not possible to resolve the violation, either because the problem is too complex, or the person has failed to correctly identify the source of their arousal. When this occurs, people may respond to the arousal by affirming any available unrelated schema to which they are committed. These affirmations of intact meaning frameworks serve to dispel the unpleasant sense that something is wrong. Consequently, disturbing experiences that are as explicit and complex as writing about one’s own death (Burke, Martens, & Faucher, 2010) or dealing with social rejection (Nash, McGregor, & Prentice, 2011), down to experiences that are relatively implicit and benign, such as subliminally seeing incoherent word-­‐pairs (e.g., “quickly-­‐blueberry”; Randles, Proulx, & Heine, 2011) or being presented with a change-­‐blindness manipulation (Proulx & Heine, 2008), all lead to increased motivation to affirm unrelated beliefs. Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 6 These kinds of affirmation responses have been identified in a number of different research paradigms, such as terror management theory, self-­‐affirmation, and uncertainty management (for reviews see Heine et al., 2006; Proulx, Inzlicht, & Harmon-­‐Jones, 2012). The dACC has been theorized to be the source of the unpleasant arousal associated with uncertainty and violations of expectations (McGregor, Nash, Mann, & Phills, 2010), and strong adherence to belief systems that serve as affirmations, such as religion and political conservatism, inhibit activity throughout the ACC (Amodio, Jost, Master, & Yee, 2007; Inzlicht, et al., 2009). The arousal caused by meaning threats is not always consciously accessible, which is a clear departure from pain or social distress. However, when participants are given an explanation for their unpleasant arousal (e.g., being told that it is due to a supplement they have taken) they attribute their distress to this other source and fail to show compensatory responses (Kay, Moscovitch, & Laurin, 2010; Proulx & Heine, 2008; Zanna & Cooper, 1974), suggesting that they are in fact experiencing some form of distress or negative affect. Given that many types of anomalous experiences can elicit the same affirmation response, and that the resultant arousal can be misattributed, it suggests that the distress is general enough that the source of arousal can be confounded in the person’s mind. The present research is predicated on four key findings of the literature: 1) both physical and social pain are associated with activation in the dACC (e.g., Eisenberger et al., 2003); 2) the dACC is activated in response to anomalies (e.g., Botvinick et al., 2004); 3) social rejection can produce the same compensatory Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 7 affirmation as other meaning threats (e.g., Nash et al., 2011); and, 4) acetaminophen has been shown to reduce physical and social pain and activation in the dACC, (DeWall et al., 2010). These findings led us to predict that acetaminophen may also inhibit compensatory affirmation following meaning threats. We reasoned that participants who experienced a meaning threat after having consumed acetaminophen would fail to detect any increase in arousal and thus not show the kinds of compensatory affirmation identified in previous research. Towards this end we conducted two studies with different meaning threats and affirmations. METHOD Participants and procedure We recruited 121 participants (81 women). The sample was predominantly of East Asian (45%), European (29%), and South Asian (12%) descent. Participants were offered $15 through flyers posted on campus, or partial course credit in psychology classes. The study was advertised as a general assessment of the cognitive and emotional impacts of acetaminophen. In contrast to the procedure of DeWall et al. (2010; in which participants took acetaminophen multiple times a day for three weeks), participants in the present study received a single acute dose of acetaminophen, which was active in their system while they experienced the threat. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1000mg of Tylenol brand acetaminophen (Rapid ReleaseTM formula) or 1000mg of sugar (a placebo), packed in two opaque gel capsules. The researcher was blind to both the type of capsules administered (using coded bottles) and the version of the materials that participants completed. Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 8 The effects of acetaminophen are difficult to detect if one is not already in pain, making it hard to identify if one has taken a drug or placebo. When taken orally, Tylenol’s expected time to reach peak absorption is 45-­‐60 minutes, and its ceiling effectiveness in adults occurs at 1000mg (Bertolini et al., 2006; Gibb & Anderson, 2008); this is also the maximum recommended single dose. After receiving the capsules to ingest, participants were given free time for 30 minutes prior to working on filler tasks, which took approximately 25 minutes to complete. They then completed the mortality salience or dental pain paragraphs, followed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the prostitution bond scenario (all materials described below). Our expectation was that participants in the placebo condition who received the mortality salience manipulation would show typical compensatory affirmation, while those who had taken Tylenol would not show this reaction. Materials Filler tasks. We asked participants to complete a number of materials not relevant to the task, to mask our specific hypothesis of interest. These included a page of Sudoku puzzles, a memory task matching faces of individuals to their biographies and a series of personality questionnaires that were not analyzed as part of the study. Mortality salience manipulation. Participants completed the standard mortality salience manipulation: they either wrote two paragraphs about what will happen to their body after they die and how they feel about it, or two paragraphs about dental pain (Burke et al., 2010). Terror management theorists have argued that thoughts Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 9 about death produced a unique type of anxiety (Greenberg, Solomon, & Pyszczynski, 1997). Recently however, a number of other theorists have argued that thinking about death is incompatible with everyday thoughts about relationships, plans, and ambitions (Heine et al., 2006; McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, & Spencer, 2001; Proulx et al., 2012), and that it leads to the same anxiety associated with other violations of expectations, such as frustrated social interactions, or perceived incongruities. These arguments have been supported empirically, where mortality salience has been shown to lead to the same compensatory affirmation as viewing surreal art (Proulx, Heine, & Vohs, 2010), perceiving a visual anomaly (Proulx & Heine, 2008) or viewing subliminally-­‐presented incongruous word-­‐pairs (e.g. role-­‐fork; Randles et al., 2011). The rationale behind using dental pain as a control was that it should be aversive, but should not create an experience of violated expectations or uncertainty, and thus should not lead to affirmation responses (McGregor, et al., 1998). This control condition thus helps to rule out negative mood as an explanation for the compensatory affirmation, which is why it is used as a standard control group in mortality salience paradigms (Burke et al., 2010). Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. This measure identifies the state of affect an individual is experiencing, based on twenty different affect descriptors. Participants are asked how they are feeling at the moment (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). This scale is often used as a delay between the mortality salience manipulation and the dependent variable, and typically reveals that the manipulation does not influence either positive or negative affect (Burke et al., 2010). Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 10 Social judgment survey. Participants read a hypothetical arrest report about a prostitute and were asked to set the amount of the bail (from $0-­‐$999). This measure has been used in a number of other meaning-­‐threat studies (Proulx & Heine, 2008; Proulx et al., 2010; Randles et al., 2011; Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski & Lyon, 1989). Participants are expected to increase the bond value after a threat, because trading sex for money is both at odds with commonly held cultural views of relationships, as well as being against the law. Increasing the bond assessment provides participants an opportunity to affirm their belief that prostitution is wrong. RESULTS During the debriefing, participants were asked to guess which capsules they had consumed. Fifty-­‐five percent claimed they had no idea; of those who guessed, 57% were correct (not different from chance; p=.17). Five participants were removed for not completing the materials. Planned orthogonal contrasts were used to test our hypothesis. We chose this analysis because we were expecting one particular pattern of effects: namely that the threatened group that received a placebo would show higher compensatory affirmation compared to the other three groups. As predicted, only participants who had experienced a meaning threat and had taken the placebo showed evidence of increased affirmation. Participants in the threat/placebo group punished the norm violator by a significantly larger amount than the other three groups, t112=2.33, Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 11 p=.02, d=.52 ± .44 CI.975 (See Figure 1)1. Participants in the threat/acetaminophen group showed no compensatory affirmation compared to the two control groups, t112<1, d=.09 ± .45 CI.975. The two control groups did not differ, t112<1, d=.09 ± .50 CI.975. As with previous meaning threat studies, no differences between conditions emerged for self-­‐reported positive or negative affect (all ts<1). These results suggests that a drug that can alleviate mild pain, headaches, or hurt feelings (DeWall et al., 2010) can also alleviate the affirmation responses that are incurred when people consider their own mortality, which some have argued threatens meaning (Heine et al., 2006; Proulx et al., 2012). STUDY 2 In Study 1, we employed the most commonly used manipulation of existential anxiety, mortality salience. To test whether acetaminophen affects uncertainty more broadly defined, we turned to a very different and novel manipulation in Study 2. We turned to an artistic tradition which is known precisely for its ability to provoke feelings of discomfort and unease: surrealism. The surrealist tradition involves the juxtaposition of unfamiliar elements in familiar settings. Past research has found that surrealist art forms, including literature, paintings, and humor, lead to compensatory responses (Proulx & Heine, 2009; Proulx et al., 2010). The work of surrealist filmmaker David Lynch seemed especially apt for our needs. As his biographer Rodley (2005; p. x) noted, “the 1 Point and interval estimates for Cohen’s d are based on recommendations in Robey (2004). Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 12 indefinable ‘mood’ or ‘feeling’ Lynch seeks to convey is linked to a form of intellectual uncertainty – what he calls being ‘lost in darkness and confusion.’” METHODS Students were recruited through the same methods as Study 1. Of the 236 recruited, 8 failed to complete the study because of technical problems, and the data from 21 participants were removed because they reported during an open-­‐ended debriefing that they had participated in previous MMM experiments or guessed that we were interested in their responses to the Lynch film. The key effects still remain significant if these 21 participants are included in the analyses. This left 207 participants (124 women), who were predominantly of European (52%), East Asian (25%), and South Asian (7%) descent. The paradigm was identical to Study 1, with two differences. First, the meaning threat was changed. Participants in the meaning threat condition watched 3 films. First, was a 2-­‐minute clip from a Donald Duck cartoon, designed to ease participants into the task. They then watched a 4-­‐minute clip from the short film, Rabbits, created by David Lynch. The film, which at first resembles a sit-­‐com, consists of a series of non-­‐sequiturs, seemingly random laugh and applause tracks separated by long portentous pauses, an eerie soundscape, a complete absence of a narrative, and characters inexplicably dressed in rabbit costumes. The clip is ominous, although it contains no reference to disturbing or unpleasant topics. After the Rabbits clip, participants then watched a 2-­‐minute clip from Snoopy, designed to serve as a distraction/delay, followed by the PANAS. As we were concerned that participants would identify Rabbits as critical to the study, adding an Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 13 additional distractor beyond the PANAS was expected to help reduce suspicion. Participants in the control condition saw the same videos except the Rabbits clip was replaced with a 4-­‐minute clip from a Simpsons episode (all clips available upon request). We also changed the dependent affirmation measure. This study was conducted 3-­‐6 months after a well-­‐publicized local riot that followed the loss of the Vancouver Canucks bid for the Stanley Cup, and we expected that most students held a negative view of this event. Thus, after a threat, participants should affirm this view by calling for stronger punishment for the rioters. Participants were informed that people were debating whether the rioters should be given more lenient sentences than comparable individual acts of vandalism, because they acted impulsively, or stiffer sentences because they took advantage of the city while it was vulnerable. Participants then marked a spot on a line connecting the endpoints, indicating that rioters should not be fined or jailed (0%) to a doubled fine or sentence (200%), with a normal fine or sentence (100%) lying at the midpoint. (See Appendix A in the Supplementary Materials online for measure). RESULTS Participants were unable to correctly identify whether they had taken acetaminophen or a placebo: 53% claimed they had no idea; of those who guessed, 45% were correct (not different from chance, p=.29). Participants in all conditions set the fine for the rioter at a higher value then the court would normally set (all ps<.001), which confirms our expectations that most students in our sample found the behaviors unacceptable. Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 14 As in Study 1 we used planned orthogonal contrasts to test whether the placebo-­‐threat condition showed more compensatory affirmation than the other conditions. Again, only participants who had experienced a meaning threat and had taken the placebo showed evidence of increased affirmation. Participants in the threat/placebo group punished the norm violator by a significantly larger amount than the other three groups, t203=2.64 p<.01, d=.43 ± .32 CI.975 (See Figure 2). Participants in the threat/acetaminophen group showed no compensatory affirmation compared to the two control groups, t203<1, d=.05 ± .34 CI.975. There was no difference between the acetaminophen and placebo groups for the control manipulation, t203<1, d=.09 ± .35. Again, there was no difference between the groups in self-­‐reported positive or negative affect (all ts<1.2, ps>.23). DISCUSSION Two studies show that acetaminophen interrupts the typical compensatory responses to meaning threats. In the first study, we identified a typical mortality salience reaction in the placebo group, but those who had taken acetaminophen responded in ways similar to those who did not contemplate their mortality. In the second study, these findings were replicated using a surreal video clip and a novel dependent measure, showing that participants who watched the David Lynch clip and took a placebo were more punitive than those who had consumed acetaminophen or who had watched the control video. In neither study were there any differences in self-­‐reported positive or negative affect, which renders it unlikely that the effects were simply a function of people becoming more punitive because they were in a bad mood. Rather we argue that a particular type of distress Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 15 associated with expectancy violation (originating from the dACC) and a failure to correctly identify or be able to accommodate to the source of that distress lead to this affirmation. These results are consistent with the notion of a domain-­‐general process for expectancy violation. Although there is some evidence that domain-­‐specific responses to certain types of uncertainty or threat can occur (e.g. Burke et al., 2010; Rutjens & Loseman, 2010), a recent review of the threat compensation literature underscored how similar psychological processes are implicated across different threats (Proulx et al., 2012). Our findings imply that the similarities between physical pain and belongingness threats may not be specifically due to them both triggering something akin to pain, but rather that they both typically involve a violation of expectations. This is not to say that uncertainty is a necessary feature of pain, but that pain (as with social failures) is often brought about by unexpected consequences to behaviors or actions. In reviewing the literature on the ACC, Shackman et al. (2011) argue that the “the core function common to negative affect, pain and cognitive control is the need to determine an optimal course of action in the face of uncertainty” (p. 160). However, one disconnect between the present findings and current data on the dACC is that our results, and many manipulations of uncertainty or existential anxiety (e.g., Burke et al., 2010), do not lead to changes in self-­‐reported affect as measured by the PANAS. Studies that have measured dACC activation following physical pain, social pain, and frustration have produced self-­‐reported negative Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 16 affect (e.g. DeWall et al. 2010; Eisenberger & Lieberman 2004; Spunt, Lieberman, Cohen & Eisenberger, 2012), and a recent meta-­‐analysis of brain imaging studies found that the dACC was activated in response to manipulations that induced fear, anger, or disgust (Shackman et al., 2011). There are multiple possibilities for this disconnect. It could be that a) the PANAS does not tap into the kinds of negative affect associated with expectancy violations, b) asking participants about how they feel right now is less effective than asking how they felt about the threat (as Spunt et al. (2012) did), or c) people might not always have conscious access to the arousal elicited from expectancy violations. These studies have a number of limitations and suggest several future research directions. First, it is unclear how well our findings would generalize to other samples. Research on terror management theory finds effects of the same direction across a broad array of samples, although Americans and college students show stronger effects than other samples (Burke et al., 2010). We therefore anticipate that the findings obtained here would also be of the same direction yet weaker in magnitude in other samples. A second limitation is that acetaminophen affects a number of brain regions, some not directly related to physical or social distress (Toussaint et al., 2010). Thus, there are several possible explanations for our findings. First, acetaminophen might reduce felt arousal upon witnessing violations. Second, participants may experience the same arousal, but the trigger for the affirmational response may be interrupted by the drug. Third, the presence of the drug may make participants less attentive so they never notice the violation to begin with. Fourth, acetaminophen could potentially affect some of the cognitive Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 17 processes involved in completing the dependent measures. Although our studies were inspired by the neurological link between physical pain, social pain, and expectancy violation, further work will be needed to confirm that overlapping neurological structures are involved. We also do not know whether other pain-­‐relievers would have the same kinds of inhibiting effects. Given the past work that inspired this research (see introduction) it seems possible that any drug that inhibits pain via the central nervous system might be effective, but this has yet to be tested (two exceptions being that marijuana has also been found to reduce both physical pain and social pain; Deckman, DeWall, Way, Gilman, & Richman, 2012, and that the tranquilizer phenobarbital reduces attitude change following induced compliance; Cooper, Zanna, & Taves, 1978). An additional hypothesis that emerges from these findings is that acetaminophen may not only reduce felt uncertainty during unexpected negative events, but also positive ones (such as receiving a surprise promotion at work). Consistent with this hypothesis are findings that fluid compensation also emerges from positive expectancy violations, such as participants seeing a doctored photo of themselves that makes them look more attractive (Proulx & Randles, 2010) and evidence that the ACC does respond to positive feedback, if negative feedback was expected (Oliveira, McDonald & Goodman, 2007) The findings raise several questions, and a fuller understanding could be achieved through employing alternative measures of distress (e.g., psychophysiological measures, fMRI), painkillers (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid), kinds of Acetaminophen reduces meaning maintenance 18 meaning violations (e.g., cognitive dissonance), compensatory measures (e.g., pattern learning, increased beliefs in God), and samples (e.g., young children). Despite the many questions that these findings raise, they do demonstrate that acetaminophen has far more reaching psychological consequences than previously realized, and that a single pill can serve as an effective manipulation in the lab.

Psychologists used that as a proxy measure for personal distress, a relationship that has been previously demonstrated.      Daniel Randles and colleagues at the University of British Columbia write in the journal Psychological Science, "The meaning-maintenance model posits that any violation of expectations leads to an affective experience that motivates compensatory affirmation. We explore whether the neural mechanism that responds to meaning threats can be inhibited by acetaminophen." Totally.      More plainly, "Physical pain and social rejection share a neural process and subjective component that are experienced as distress." That neural process has been traced to the same part of the brain. They figure that if you blunt one, you blunt both. As they told LiveScience, "When people feel overwhelmed with uncertainty in life or distressed by a lack of purpose, what they're feeling may actually be painful distress ... We think that Tylenol is blocking existential unease in the same way it prevents pain, because a similar neurological process is responsible for both types of distress."      In this study, Randles's team gave 120 people either two extra-strength Tylenol or a placebo. They then primed them by asking half to write about what happens when we die (meant to invoke or replicate existential anxiety) and the other half to write about a control, non-existential topic (going to the dentist, meant to focus people on concrete things). The rationale was that "thinking about death is incompatible with everyday thoughts ... and that it leads to the same anxiety ... as frustrated social interactions or perceived incongruities."      Then all were asked how high they would set bond for a hypothetical person arrested for prostitution.      Randles et al, Psychological Science Randles et al, Psychological Science      Among people who took the placebo pill, those who wrote about existential anxiety set much higher bail ($450) than those who wrote about the dentist ($300). But if they took Tylenol and wrote existentially, that sense of moral judgment seemed to be blunted. They set the same bond regardless of the priming.      Then in a similar, separate experiment, they primed the subjects by having them watch video clips. They either watched The Simpsons or a film by surrealistic neonoir writer/director David Lynch, in which humans with rabbit heads wander an urban apartment muttering non sequiturs. They then passed judgment on people arrested in a hockey riot. Again, the people in the existential mindset imposed harsh sanctions, but the people who'd watched The Simpsons were lenient. If they'd taken Tylenol first, though, the David Lynch-induced anxiety was apparently blunted. They recommended the same sanctions as the Simpsons-primed group. ||||| Abstract      Acetaminophen has recently been recognized as having impacts that extend into the affective domain. In particular, double blind placebo controlled trials have revealed that acetaminophen reduces the magnitude of reactivity to social rejection, frustration, dissonance and to both negatively and positively valenced attitude objects. Given this diversity of consequences, it has been proposed that the psychological effects of acetaminophen may reflect a widespread blunting of evaluative processing. We tested this hypothesis using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixty-two participants received acetaminophen or a placebo in a double-blind protocol and completed the Go/NoGo task. Participants’ ERPs were observed following errors on the Go/NoGo task, in particular the error-related negativity (ERN; measured at FCz) and error-related positivity (Pe; measured at Pz and CPz). Results show that acetaminophen inhibits the Pe, but not the ERN, and the magnitude of an individual’s Pe correlates positively with omission errors, partially mediating the effects of acetaminophen on the error rate. These results suggest that recently documented affective blunting caused by acetaminophen may best be described as an inhibition of evaluative processing. They also contribute to the growing work suggesting that the Pe is more strongly associated with conscious awareness of errors relative to the ERN. ||||| TORONTO, April 8 (UPI) -- Acetaminophen, commonly sold as Tylenol, is thought to treat everything from fever to headache with few or no side effects, but a recent study suggests the drug could prevent people from spotting errors.      Researchers at the University of Toronto found people are less reactive to uncertain situations when they've taken normally recommended doses of the drug.      Acetaminophen is used by a lot of people without prescription, and the recent study showed people did not perceive any cognitive difference while on the drug, but that doesn't mean it isn't there.      While recent research has only begun to show how acetaminophen stops pain, some behavioral studies have shown slight cognitive impairments when on the drug. Researches involved with the new study conducted previous research that found slower reactions among participants using acetaminophen.      "An obvious question is if people aren't detecting these errors, are they also making errors more often when taking acetaminophen?" Dan Randles, a researcher at the University of Toronto, said in a press release. "This is the first study to address this question, so we need more work and ideally with tasks more closely related to normal daily behavior."      For the study, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, researchers recruited 62 people for a double-blind, randomized study with half the participants receiving 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen, the normal maximum dose, and the rest given a placebo.      The participants were then hooked up to an electroencephalogram and given a target-detection task called Go or No Go, hitting a button when an "F" appeared on a screen but not hitting the button if an "E" appeared on the screen.      In addition to hitting the button more often when an "E" appeared, the group given acetaminophen also missed more "F" screens than the placebo group -- suggesting the drug has an effect on the mind beyond simply killing pain.      "It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error, which may have implications for cognitive control in daily life," Randles said. ||||| It's been known for more than a century that acetaminophen is an effective painkiller, but according to a new U of T study it could also be impeding error-detection in the brain.      The research, authored by a team including postdoctoral fellow Dan Randles and researchers from the University of British Columbia, is the first neurological study to look at how acetaminophen could be inhibiting the brain response associated with making errors.      "Past research tells us physical pain and social rejection share a neural process that we experience as distress, and both have been traced to same part of the brain," says Randles.      Recent research has begun to show how exactly acetaminophen inhibits pain, while behavioural studies suggest it may also inhibit evaluative responses more generally. Randles own past research has found that people are less reactive to uncertain situations when under the effect of acetaminophen.      "The core idea of our study is that we don't fully understand how acetaminophen affects the brain," says Randles. "While there's been recent behavioural research on the effects of acetaminophen, we wanted to have a sense of what's happening neurologically."      To test the idea two groups of 30 were given a target-detection task called the Go or No Go. Participants were asked to hit a Go button every time the letter F flashed on a screen but refrain from hitting the button if an E flashed on the screen. "The trick is you're supposed to move very quickly capturing all the GOs, but hold back when you see a No Go," says Randles.      Each participant was hooked up to an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain. The researchers were looking for a particular wave called Error Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Related Positivity (Pe). Essentially what happens is that when people are hooked up to an EEG and make an error in the task there is a robust increase in ERN and Pe.      One group, which was given 1,000 mg of acetaminophen -- the equivalent of a normal maximum dose -- showed a smaller Pe when making mistakes than those who didn't receive a dose, suggesting that acetaminophen inhibits our conscious awareness of the error.      "It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error, which may have implications for cognitive control in daily life," says Randles.      Cognitive control is an important neurological function because people are constantly doing cognitive tasks that flow automatically like reading, walking or talking. These tasks require very little cognitive control because they are well mapped out neurological processes, notes Randles.      "Sometimes you need to interrupt your normal processes or they'll lead to a mistake, like when you're talking to a friend while crossing the street, you should still be ready to react to an erratic driver," explains Randles.      "The task we designed is meant to capture that since most of the stimuli were Go, so you end up getting into a routine of automatically hitting the Go button. When you see a No Go, that requires cognitive control because you need to interrupt the process."      The study was double blind, so neither the researcher running the study nor the participant knew whether they had been given a placebo or acetaminophen.      An unexpected and surprise finding that Randles plans to explore more closely is that those who received an acetaminophen dose appeared to miss more of the Go stimuli than they should have. He plans on expanding on the error detection aspect of the research to see whether acetaminophen is possibly causing people to "mind wander" and become distracted.      "An obvious question is if people aren't detecting these errors, are they also making errors more often when taking acetaminophen? This is the first study to address this question, so we need more work and ideally with tasks more closely related to normal daily behaviour."      The research is published in the current edition of the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. |||||	– That Tylenol you just popped may do the trick when it comes to dulling your headache. But a new University of Toronto study finds that the painkiller's active ingredient, acetaminophen, may also put a damper on your ability to notice errors, Science Daily reports. "The core idea of our study is that we don't fully understand how acetaminophen affects the brain," researcher Dan Randles says. To get a clearer picture, the team put together two teams of 30 participants each and had them play "Go or No Go," in which they hit a Go button when the letter F flashed on a screen and do nothing when the letter E appeared. The subjects, half of whom had taken 1,000mg of acetaminophen, were hooked up to an EEG to measure brain activity. The group that had taken the equivalent of a normal maximum dose of the painkiller hit the Go button more often when E flashed on the screen, according to UPI. Also, they failed to push the button when the F appeared more often than those on the placebo group. "It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error," Randles says. Next on the agenda for the researchers: to study whether acetaminophen causes people to "mind wander," and to answer the question of whether the drug, in addition to inhibiting the ability to detect errors, also contributes to people making more mistakes. Past research has suggested that acetaminophen may reduce the pain of social rejection, "sort of like alcohol or Xanax," the Atlantic reported in 2013. Another study shows that the drug alters the way people pass moral judgment. (Acetaminophen isn't addictive, but these drugs are.)
summarize: LOS ANGELES (AP) — A court fight over retail operations at one of the nation's busiest airports led to a charges Friday that passengers are being gouged on bottled water prices.      Legal papers filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by boutique retailer Kitson Stores said Hudson Group, which operates many shops at Los Angeles International Airport, is exploiting travelers with "hugely" inflated water prices.      The two sides have been exchanging accusations over business operations and licensing arrangements at the airport, which attracts 70 million travelers annually.      Kitson says New Jersey-based Hudson refused to sell bottled water at the airport's two Kitson shops it operates at $2.55 for a liter. Instead, Hudson charges consumers about $5 a bottle at the stores, the court filing said.      Kitson argues that Hudson is trying to force its stores out of the airport because of the friction over water prices.      "Water is one of the most basic necessities for travelers and Hudson is taking advantage of the post- 9-11 airport restrictions" by inflating water prices, Kitson attorney Steven Bledsoe said in a telephone interview. "We believe that Hudson has breached its contracts with Kitson and has no right to close the Kitson stores."      Hudson attorney Brian Timmons called the Kitson claim a publicity stunt intended to divert attention from its failure to meet contractual obligations.      In a statement, he said Hudson is moving forward with plans to terminate the relationship. Last month, Hudson filed a complaint in Superior Court against the boutique company for breach of contract.      "Kitson is known for selling pricey items in its high end boutiques," Timmons said. "Anyone who thinks that Kitson is really motivated here by an altruistic concern over how much consumers are paying for water at LAX has either never shopped at a Kitson store or is really naive." ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

It's the bottled variety that has touched off a legal war between Kitson Stores, an LA-based retailer of trendy high-end fashion, and the Hudson Group, which owns and operates several stores at airports around the country.      More than a year ago, Kitson licensed its name to two Hudson stores inside LAX. Under the agreement, Kitson provides Hudson with the items it wants sold, and Hudson in return gives Kitson six percent of gross sales.      Enter the bottled beverage at the heart of the dispute. Recently, Kitson sent Hudson liter bottles of Smartwater it was already selling at its own stores around Los Angeles for $2.55, but wanted Hudson to sell them inside the airport for the same price.      Hudson, however, refused to accept the shipment.      Inside LAX, a bottle of Smartwater sells for $4.68—a whopping 200 percent mark-up from its retail price outside the terminal (at one Ralph's store, a Smartwater liter sells for a mere $1.49).      With that price tag, getting a drink almost requires taking out a second mortgage. Kitson agrees, and it's one of the reasons the company is suing Hudson for breach of contract.      "Hudson Group is price gouging customers here at LAX as well as all across the nation," said Kitson spokesman Brad Chase. "They make millions and millions of dollars off the backs of air travelers. To lower the price to a fair rate of $2.55 will hit them hard on their bottom line."      Hudson, however, sees it differently.      "They're desperate," said Hudson Group attorney Brian Timmons. He said the water lawsuit is a PR splash which dilutes the real issue: The Kitson-Hudson marriage has been a bad relationship from the beginning.      A deal sours      Last month, Hudson filed suit to end its agreement with Kitson early, claiming breach of contract.      Among other issues, Hudson alleges Kitson founder Fraser Ross violated the terms of their contract by personally appearing at the LAX shops and berating employees. Hudson is seeking over $1 million in penalties and damages, and wants to remove Kitson by the end of March.      Timmons said Kitson didn't even start selling water until after it was threatened with eviction, and did so with the sole purpose of putting pressure on Hudson—something Kitson denies.      "Hudson Group is retaliating against Kitson using petty smears against the founder, specifically because they know that they've been caught price gouging," said Chase, the Kitson spokesman.      According to airport authority rules, a product sold inside terminals cannot be priced more than 18 percent above its "street value," or what it would sell for at the same store outside the airport.      Timmons points out that his client has no outside-the-airport stores to provide a comparison, and said Hudson's prices are similar to other vendors inside LAX. For the sake of comparison, CNBC verified that liter bottles of water selling at Starbucks inside the airport went for $4.95, priced above what Hudson charged for Smartwater.      Price or product?      So why not sell water at Kitson-branded stores? "It's not about the price, it's about the product," said Timmons. He said water is sold in plenty of stores already. "Hudson entered into the brand partnership with Kitson to sell the iconic novelty items at LAX for which Kitson has become known—not to sell water."      When asked by CNBC if perhaps Hudson doesn't want to sell discounted water at Kitson and undercut profits at its other stores, Timmons replied: "Kitson is not after bargain-minded shoppers. And people don't go to Kitson to buy water. So anyone who thinks Kitson is really motivated here by an altruistic concern over how much travelers at LAX are paying for water has either never shopped at Kitson, or is really naïve."      Hudson has claimed both sides have agreed that Kitson will vacate on March 31st, but Kitson's Brad Chase says not quite. "Kitson has no intention of leaving LAX," he said.      The retailer could try to operate its own stores outright at the airport, but that requires an application process with the airport authority to meet the necessary requirements to operate in a high-security environment.      "Fundamentally the way it works at the airport is with a contract," said Chase. "We're being held captive." |||||	– Consumers fed up with the eye-watering price of bottled water in airports have an unlikely champion: Kitson Stores, an LA-based boutique retailer where T-shirts can cost $300. Kitson is in a contract dispute with Hudson Group—which operates dozens of stores at Los Angeles International Airport and hundreds more at airports across the country—and is suing Hudson for "gouging" passengers with bottled water that costs nearly $5, NBC News reports. A Kitson lawyer tells the AP that Hudson, which operates two stores at LAX for Kitson, "is taking advantage of the post-9/11 airport restrictions" and refused to sell liter bottles of water for $2.55 at the Kitson stores it operates because it was making too much money selling water at higher prices elsewhere. According to airport authority rules, products sold in LAX terminals cannot be priced more than 18% above their "street value," NBC notes. With $5 water, "I don't know what street that is, but that's not my street," a Kitson spokeswoman tells Forbes. Hudson, which accuses Kitson of angling to get its own airport retail space, counters that Kitson only started trying to sell water after it was accused of breach of contract when its founder turned up at the airport stores to berate employees. Anyone who thinks that the company is motivated "by an altruistic concern over how much consumers are paying for water at LAX has either never shopped at a Kitson store or is really naive," a Hudson lawyer tells the AP. (A military contractor pleaded guilty last year to massively inflating prices of items, including water.)

Conditions of his release include that he surrenders his passports and travel documents, does not visit his house where the model died and does not use any prohibited substances. He is also banned from drinking alcohol.            He was eventually driven from court at 3.45pm GMT without making any comment. However, his uncle Arnold released a short statement on behalf of the family saying 'We are relieved of the fact that Oscar got bail.      'But at the same time we are in mourning for the death of Reeva with her family.

Mr Nair made the ruling after four days of arguments from prosecution and defence in Pistorius' bail hearing.

He says the shooting was accidental because he thought she was a dangerous intruder inside his home.

'We're still very sad. She was an amazing person.'      Kenny Kunene, a friend of the athlete, told Sky News that Pistorius had not been given any special treatment, and said the case had taken a toll on Pistorius and his family.            'It has obviously taken a serious toll because they stopped doing everything and they focused on this particular bail application, they have been here every day,' he said.      'Obviously he will have to focus on the case and I think the conditions bind him. They give him time and space to focus on this case, particularly with support from the family.'      BAIL AUDIO Paralympian's promise not to leave country key to ruling      Jubilant: His family looked delighted that he was released, although this is only the first stage in a legal battle      Relief: Arnold Pistorius, uncle of Oscar Pistorius, addresses members of the media saying 'We are relieved of the fact that Oscar got bail today' Tense times: Oscar Pistorius' father Henke Pistorius, right, with his children Carl, centre, and Aimee, left, watch as the athlete walks in earlier in the day Support: His family have sat in the front row everyday this week - at times patting his shoulder and talking to Pistorius as he sat on the bench in front on them            On display: A 9mm pistol sits beside car keys, a watch and mobile phone on the beside table at Oscar Pistorius's Pretoria home, pictured during a magazine photoshoot in 2010      CONDITIONS OF PISTORIUS' BAIL • He appears in court on 4 June at 8.30am . • He surrenders all passports and refrains from applying for any passports.      • He refrains from entering any airport.      • He turns in all firearms.      • He refrains from possessing any firearms.      `• He refrains from talking to any witnesses for the prosecution.      • He will have a probation officer and correctional official from the date of release until the conclusion of the case.      • Cannot leave the district of Pretoria without the permission of his probation officer • He shall give them a phone number and must be contactable day and night.      • He must not be charged with an offence of violence against women.      • He must not use drugs or alcohol.      • The magistrate also ruled that he could not return to his home, where the killing of Miss Steenkamp took place. Speaking outside court, Medupe Simasiku, from South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), told reporters: 'The bail application does not mean that this person is acquitted.'      He said that when the court meets again on June 4, they will have a better idea of when a trial can be held.      During the lengthy hearing, Pistorius looked distraught as Mr Nair summed up the evidence the court has heard including the Paralympian's own account of what happened when he opened fire.      Mr Nair, who previously described his task as 'unenviable', said there was no suggestion that Pistorius was a flight risk, he did not appear to have a propensity to violence, and there was no evidence that he would interfere with witnesses. But Mr Nair was scathing in discussing Detective Hilton Botha's testimony presented to the court earlier in the week, saying he 'made several errors and concessions during cross-examination.' He said that the state only has circumstantial evidence but that 'does not prevent it being schedule six and I will approach it in that vein' - in the legal system schedule six means premeditated murder. And that Det Botha's perception of distance was 'astounding' when he discussed how near witnesses were to Pistorius' home.      He said Det Botha 'blundered' on description of substances by saying testosterone and pointed out he was forced to concede there was a cartridge out in the passage which he had omitted from evidence. Wiping his brow due to the heat in the court, Mr Nair said Det Botha did not spend as much time as he ought to in order to show Pistorius had a propensity towards violence.      He stated the past incidents as discussed in court were not enough to establish a propensity towards violence. Nair said said the prosecution did not do enough to establish whether or not Pistorius had a house in Italy. Animated: Oscar Pistorius' lawyer Barry Roux, centre, gestures during his client's bail application Battle: Defence lawyer Barry Roux conferring with other court attendees during the hearing yesterday      Replacement: Today Lieutenant-General Vineshkumar Moonoo, left, the police detective who will take over the Oscar Pistorius case from Detective Hilton Botha appeared at the Magistrate Court in Pretoria            He explained had that been done, given Pistorius did not mention it in his affidavit, that would have been important.      But Mr Nair said he had found it difficult to comprehend why Pistorius had opened fire in the way he did.            He questioned why Pistorius did not try to locate his girlfriend on fearing an burglar was in the house, why he did not try to determine who was in the toilet and why he would venture into the bathroom area where he thought there was a 'danger.'            Miss Steenkamp's Valentine's Day killing has seized the world's attention and there was intense focus today if Pistorius would be released, and if so, with what conditions.      He has been held at a police station in Pretoria since last week, but suspects who are denied bail are typically held in a prison.            The fourth day's proceedings began with prosecutor Gerrie Nel admitting the prosecution had interpreted Pistorius' affidavit wrongly      Mr Nel said the way he read the affidavit was that Pistorius was saying he did not do anything wrong, not even culpable homicide. But he added that it was Pistorius' fault and he should have testified.      The prosecutor said Pistorius had the 'money, means and motive' to flee if given bail, and described how WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was just as well known, but had avoided bail by seeking refuge in London's Ecuadorian Embassy.      He admitted that despite Det Botha's claims that Pistorius has a home in Italy were incorrect, but said he does have access to a house there.      Bail condition: The magistrate also ruled that he could not return to his home, where the killing of Reeva Steenkamp took place Magistrate Nair interrupted, saying 'Would he be ducking and diving every day? On those prostheses?' 'Yes,' answered Mr Nel, prompting laughter from the gallery and annoying the prosecutor.      He then went on to suggest that Pistorius might change his face to avoid being recognised.      Mr Nel questioned why Pistorius, an apparently 'paranoid man' slept with windows and balcony doors open. Mr Nel said Pistorius' account that Miss Steenkamp was shot while going to the toilet was 'improbable' - he cited the fact the bullet went through her shorts as evidence she was wearing them when she was shot. He also brought up the witness testimony that neighbours heard arguments, screams and shots - he questioned why witnesses lie about hearing noise that night. He conceded that Pistorius cried at the scene, but he argued that was to be expected claiming that his emotion was because he was sorry he had shot her and his career was gone. He felt sorry for himself, said Mr Nel. But defence lawyer Barry Roux mocked Mr Nel's argument that Pistorius is a flight risk saying that every time he goes through airport security it causes a commotion. He said it would be difficult for Pistorius to flee as he would struggle with his prosthetic legs, which cannot go unnoticed through airport security, need maintenance and adjustment on a monthly basis, and his own legs need regular medical treatment.      He said that if he were prosecuting he would argue it was culpable homicide, not murder.            'He did not want to kill Reeva,' Mr Roux claimed. The charge here is not that he wanted to kill an unknown burglar, he said.            Mr Roux said it makes sense that Pistorius went downstairs to open the front door before carrying Steenkamp's body down, because the security guard is on his way and he wants to let him in.            Yesterday a photo emerged that indicated visitors to the home of Oscar Pistorius were left in no doubt of his need to feel safe.      It shows the silver 9mm pistol he kept on the bedside table next to his car keys, designer watch and remote controls.      Step by step: Oscar Pistorius' account of how the events unfolded at his upscale Pretoria home on Valentine's Day It emerged yesterday as the case against Pistorius descended into farce. The detective leading the inquiry was replaced after it was revealed that he has been accused of attempted murder. The gun was pictured in 2010 during a magazine photoshoot at the Blade Runner’s Pretoria home.      It is not known if it is the gun Pistorius used to kill the 29-year-old model, bu firearms expert David W Dyson said yesterday that it looked like a semi-automatic 9mm Taurus parabellum, the type recovered from the scene.      In his affidavit presented to his bail hearing Pistorius, said: ‘I’ve received death threats. I sleep with my 9mm under my bed.’ Argument: Oscar Pistorius' defence said it would be difficult for him to flee as he would struggle with his prosthetic legs, which cannot go unnoticed through airport security Charges: Prosecutors believe that Reeva Steenkamp sought refuge in the bathroom after arguing with the athlete dubbed Blade Runner The athlete applied for firearms licenses for six more weapons weeks before the shooting.      Yesterday South Africa’s top detective was put in charge of the case after Detective Hilton Botha, who had led the investigation, was removed. It emerged that Botha and two other officers are accused of opening fire on a minibus full of passengers.      Police said charges of attempted murder against Botha had initially been dismissed but were reinstated before he was called to Pistorius’s flat after Miss Steenkamp was shot in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. Botha, who has been accused of bungling the case, will be replaced by Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo.      National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega said the Pistorius investigation would now be handled at a national level.      Police Brigadier Neville Malila, of the South African Police Service, said he learnt only on Wednesday that the charges against Botha, dating from 2011, were active again.      He said they were reinstated before Miss Steenkamp’s death and could not explain why Botha, who has not been suspended, had been given the lead role in South Africa’s most high-profile murder inquiry. Botha, a police veteran of 24 years, had been embarrassed and ridiculed in the witness box in the packed Pretoria courtroom on Wednesday as he gave confusing and conflicting evidence.      He was accused of contaminating the crime scene in Pistorius’s house and had to backtrack on details such as how far away witnesses were when they heard screaming, shouting and gunshots.      His discomfort continued yesterday as he denied he had been drunk when he opened fire on the minibus and said the incident happened when he and fellow officers had been chasing suspects. VIDEO Pistorius's family cry tears of joy as Paralympian granted bail Relief: Supporters of Oscar Pistorius celebrate outside the Pretoria Magistrates court Message: Supporters hold signs outside the court on the fourth and final day of Oscar Pistorius' bail hearing Waiting: One supporter held a sign reading 'Nobody is perfect not even the president/beggar' Questioned by defence lawyer Barry Roux, Botha conceded that Pistorius’s version of events – that he fired into the toilet door in a panic thinking an intruder was lurking behind it – was plausible.      He admitted that telephone records from the night of the shooting, including those of Miss Steenkamp, had still not been obtained.      It led to magistrate Desmond Nair observing there appeared ‘a lack of urgency’ in the police case.      Mr Roux stressed: ‘The poor quality of evidence presented by the chief investigating officer exposed disastrous shortcomings in the state’s case.’ Mr Nair had earlier asked: ‘Do you think there will be some level of shock if the accused is released?’      Mr Roux responded: ‘I think there will be a level of shock in this country if he is not released.’      Last night the Pistorius family appeared optimistic.      The athlete’s uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said the Paralympian, who has spent long periods of the bail hearing sobbing with his head in his hands, was eating again after six days and had spent much of his time in custody reading the Bible.      Sportswear firm Nike suspended its contract with the athlete earlier this week.            Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article. ||||| The father of Oscar Pistorius' dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp says the athlete will have to "live with his conscience" if he is lying about how he killed her.      But Barry Steenkamp said he may be able to forgive Pistorius one day, if the London Olympic and Paralympic runner is telling the truth about shooting dead 29-year-old model Reeva after mistaking her for an intruder.      "If it didn't happen the way he says it did, he must suffer and he will suffer," Steenkamp told the South African Beeld newspaper. "It does not matter how much he has and how good his legal team is, he will have to live with his conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps some day forgive him."      On Friday, Pistorius was freed on bail but still faces charges of premeditated murder.      June Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, told Beeld that she received a bouquet of flowers from the Pistorius family. "But what does it mean?" she said. "Nothing."      She also said the Pistorius family must be "devastated" and had done nothing wrong. "They are not to blame," she said.      The paper reported that she wept as she described how she had hoped one day to play with her daughter's children. "Now everything is taken away from her in such a violent way. It's so violent. We just want to know the truth", she said.      The Steenkamp family has previously made no comment on the case other than to demand that Pistorius provide "answers" about their daughter's death.      Pistorius, 26, was granted bail on Friday and his case postponed until 4 June. He spent Saturday at his uncle's home in an affluent suburb of Pretoria. "We are extremely thankful that Oscar is now home," his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said in a statement, "What happened has changed our lives irrevocably."      His lawyer Kenny Oldwage said the athlete "will be in a residence we've provided in Pretoria". His coach, Ampie Louw, was quoted as saying he is considering putting Pistorius back in training "to get his mind clear".      Pistorius was ordered to hand over firearms and passports, avoid his home and all witnesses in the case, report to a police station twice a week, and not to drink alcohol. He is not permitted to enter any international airport departure hall.      The court's decision to grant bail, set at 1m rand (£73,000), came after four days of twists and turns in a case that has gripped the world. Pistorius admitted shooting dead his girlfriend at his luxury home near Pretoria on 14 February, but claimed he thought she was a burglar. The prosecution insist it was premediatated murder while the defence argues culpable homicide. |||||	– Oscar Pistorius is staying with an uncle in a Pretoria suburb today after being released on bail yesterday, reports the Guardian. The father of the woman he killed, meanwhile, offers this assessment to a German newspaper: "If it didn't happen the way he says it did, he must suffer and he will suffer," says Barry Steenkamp. "It does not matter how much he has and how good his legal team is, he will have to live with his conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps some day forgive him." Pistorius, who maintains that he mistook Reeva Steenkamp for a burglar, is not due back in court until June 4, and his coach says he might put the Olympian back into training as soon as Monday, reports the Daily Mail. His relatives sent a bouquet of flowers to Reeva's mother, but it does not appear to have gone over well. "What does it mean?" asks June Steenkamp. "Nothing." Also today, CNN reports that Pistorius' brother had his Twitter account hacked, and the family is now canceling its social media accounts as a result.

Unfortunately, their moment in the spotlight was not so welcome: mass ridicule over what may well be one of the worst-doctored photographs in internet history.      The saga began on Monday when Huili's website published a picture showing, according to the accompanying story, three local officials inspecting a newly completed road construction project this month. The picture certainly portrayed the men, and the road, but the officials appeared to be levitating several inches above the tarmac. As photographic fakery goes it was astonishingly clumsy.      The outraged – or amused – calls began to the county's PR department, which immediately apologised and withdrew the image. The explanation was almost as curious as the picture itself: as other photos showed, the three men did visit the road in question, but an unnamed photographer decided his original pictures were not suitably impressive and decided to stitch two together.      "A government employee posted the edited picture out of error... The county government understands the wide attention, and hope to apologise for and clarify the matter," a Huili official told the state-run Xinhua news agency.      Officials from the county, in Sichuan province, even hurriedly signed up to the hugely popular Sina Weibo social media site to post an explanation.      All this was, however, too late to prevent a torrent of mockery as the offending image was passed around chatrooms and other websites. Inevitably, within hours there was a flood of parodies showing the officials variously landing on the moon, surrounded by dinosaurs and, in one instance, joined on their inspection tour by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. |||||	– A badly doctored propaganda photo has made hapless officials in China's Huili county the laughing stock of a nation of 1.3 billion people. The photo on the rural county's website appeared to show county officials levitating above the road project they were inspecting, the Guardian reports. The county apologized and pulled the photo—but not before it had spread through countless blogs and chatrooms. Chinese Internet users came up with a flood of parodies, showing the officials on the moon, at a soccer game, surrounded by dinosaurs, or joined by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Officials blame the photo on a government photographer who thought the photos he had taken of the leaders inspecting the road weren't impressive enough and decided to combine a few of them.
