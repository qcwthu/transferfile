summarize: Chicago police say they will work to ensure a similar incident doesn't repeat itself after they accidentally destroyed a note left by a girl who committed suicide from an insulin overdose. (Reuters)      Before 29-year-old Nicole Porter took her own life in 2015, her mother said, she penned two emotional letters to her parents. In them, she said, was the last “I love you” she ever heard from their daughter.      “Dear Mom and Dad, I love you guys so much,” Nicole wrote in one of the suicide notes, which her mother read Friday to The Washington Post. “I’m very sorry to put you both through this. I couldn’t have asked for better parents. And I know this isn’t fair. Just know that there was nothing you guys could have done to stop me.      “None of this is anyone’s fault but my own. So please don’t blame yourself or anyone else.”      But CBS Chicago reported that the letters are now gone — accidentally destroyed by the Chicago Police Department, which was investigating the young woman’s death.      [Why a mother says she fed a deadly drug cocktail to her severely disabled daughter]      Nicole Porter’s mother, Terry Porter, said her daughter was only a semester short from earning her nursing degree — but was tired, stressed and had been in therapy for depression. In February 2015, she committed suicide through an insulin overdose.      She was not diabetic, her mother said.      Chicago police detectives sealed up Nicole Porter’s apartment and took her driver’s license, suicide notes and syringes as evidence but promised to return the letters to her parents once the investigation was complete, Porter said.      The case came to a close earlier this year.      But Porter said that when she and her husband, David, went to retrieve the letters, they were told that their daughter’s last letters had been destroyed.      “I almost hit the floor. I was devastated,” she said. “Those letters were something we wanted — they were meant for her sister, and for me and her dad.”      [‘I will always love him’: Mother drove into lake with her young son in the car, authorities say]      Chicago police told The Post that it was an accident and that the department is “deeply sorry” for the mistake.

The chief of detectives has personally ensured we have put another safeguard in place so that this will never happen again.”      Guglielmi said that in non-criminal cases, there is a destruction schedule for evidence, but that when families request the items, a hold is placed on them.      In this case, Guglielmi said, detectives did send a photo of the letters to the parents and “had all intentions” of returning them when the case was closed. But, he said, there was “a paperwork error from one department to another” and the hold was not extended on the suicide notes — so they were destroyed.      “We’re so deeply sorry,” Guglielmi said. “We gave them our deepest condolences, and we apologized for the family’s loss and for the mistake.”      [Their son was killed. They believe his parrot is telling people who pulled the trigger.]      Porter said her daughter’s death was ruled a suicide in May 2015 and, a few months later, she and her husband began asking for their daughter’s letters.      A police detective scanned copies and emailed them to the couple, she said, but he told them he could not release the originals until the case was closed.      “So we left him alone and, during that time, we received the death certificate that gave cause of death as insulin overdose,” she told The Post. “We emailed the detective and said, ‘When can we have the letters?’ ”      In April, Porter said, the detective told them the case had been closed, and the hold had been released on the evidence. But, she said, when she and her husband went to get the letters in May, the notes were long gone.      “It’s hard,” she said. “Suicide notes to somebody else might just be two pieces of paper with words on them, but to me, they were part of her — and they were meant for us. They didn’t belong to the Chicago Police Department.      “If I could just hold them in my hand, it would feel like I could hold a part of her,” she said, her voice cracking. “I feel like that was taken away from me. It’s just really hard.”      More reading:      His wife was in pain, and he couldn’t afford her meds. So he killed her, deputies say.

"Dear Mom and Dad, I love you guys so much."      Those are some of the last words Terry Porter's daughter, Nicole, wrote before she committed suicide with a lethal dose of insulin on Feb. 27, 2015.      She was 29-years-old.      "She was struggling a little bit with depression," Terry Porter told CBS Chicago. "She was seeing a therapist."      As part of the death investigation, Chicago Police kept two suicide notes written by Nicole as evidence. A detective emailed her parents copies of them.      "He said once the investigation was complete, that they would be released to us," Porter said.      Nicole's death was officially ruled a suicide in May, 2015.      In August, the family began pressing the detective for Nicole's notes.      "His response was I haven't received anything from the coroner's office," Porter said. "The case isn't closed. I can't release them."      Finally, on April 13, 2016, the detective sent Terry Porter an email saying he had the final report and had released the hold on the notes.      But a month later, when she and her husband went to pick them up, they were told the letters were destroyed three days after the hold was lifted. In a statement, CPD said it was an accident, caused by an administrative error.      "It was like everything was ripped right open again," Porter said.      Having the letters "would be part of her and I can hold onto. It would mean the world to me right now," Porter said.      "It was the last 'I love you' she ever said to us. It's the last physical thing she ever left for us. They're a part of her that she gave to us in the last hours of her life."      Terry says she's grateful she has copies of Nicole's notes, but it's heartbreaking to know the originals were destroyed.      She hopes Chicago Police will now review their evidence policies to make sure another family won't suffer the same pain as hers.      "I don't want this to ever happen to anyone else," Porter said. |||||	– Before taking her own life, Nicole Porter wrote two last letters to her family.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video      HARRISBURG, Pa. - City teachers pleaded with district administrators Monday to help support them as they deal with what they are calling an unprecedented level of misbehavior among children, some of which is resulting in physical violence against teachers.      The Harrisburg Education Association says the behavioral issues have prompted the resignations of at least 45 teachers between July and October, and further resignations have since occurred, according to association president Jody Barksdale.      Some of the worst behavior has come from some of the district's youngest students. Amanda Sheaffer, a first-grade teacher in the district for four years, described the bad behavior she has seen.      "I have been hit, I have been kicked, I have been restrained from behind where I've been unable to move my arms," she said. "It really throws off the whole day. I mean, you have an incident happen and you have to do a room clear, get all the students out, and then after that you have to take the time to do the write-up, and you have to make sure security comes and gets the kids."      The HEA says the complaints come from three or four school sites, but would not specify which ones. They say they want more support from administrators.      "Let's get together, as a task force, as a community, teachers, principals and see what we can put together to actually help these children that are displaying these atypical behaviors," Barksdale said.      School district leaders say they will work with teachers to get to the bottom of the behavioral problems.      "Once we meet and find out that there are needs that we need to have serviced, that means it's going to take parent involvement to make that happen," said Superintendent Sybil Knight-Burney.      Sheaffer says she has not thought of resigning in spite of the challenges she says she faces on a daily basis.      "I try to see the good, and think that these students and kids need me, and I'm trying to do something positive and different," she said.      The school district has responded to the HEA Claims with the following:      "In response to the Harrisburg School District’s Collective Bargaining Group, and earlier statements made to the media concerning issues facing our District, we find it unfortunate that our teacher organization has chosen to engage in public discourse opposed to factual and substantive discussions. The District is committed to promoting a safe and healthy work and learning environment for our faculty, staff and students. As we all can agree, student achievement is our      primary mission.      Concerning the District’s staffing positions, the facts are as follows: The District had 55 instructional vacancies in July 2017, the District hired 130 direct and indirect support staff between April to August 2017, inclusive of 30 professional staff. We currently have 38 professional job vacancies as a result of resignations due to a host of reasons and retirements. Urban education is fraught with challenges, opportunities and experiences. The administration of the      Harrisburg School District is dedicated and working extremely hard, providing year-long educator development and teacher mentoring programs. Additionally, processes for Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) and/or Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) are in place throughout all schools.      Further, the District has an open door policy to advance communication and address any and all concerns from administrators, faculty, staff and/or students.      As a School District, our effectiveness and success hinges on all stakeholders taking a positive and committed stance on moving the quality of education forward for every student; this includes professional responsibility, accountability and true ownership of the work that puts students first and continues to move our District in the direction of academic growth and achievement. As a District, we will continue to strive to overcome isolated challenges and resolve differences. Furthermore, we endeavor to build a culture of collaboration among all stakeholders that is focused on improving teaching and learning in every school throughout the District. ||||| Harrisburg teachers stopped short Monday night of declaring their workplaces unsafe.      But a growing number of "extraordinary incidents" that cause lesson plans to come to a screeching halt, lead to destruction of property and, all too often, someone getting hurt, is trending up at certain buildings.      "I have been kicked, punched, hit, scratched. I've had a student physically restraining me in front of my other students.... And many of the personal things that i have bought for my classroom have been broken or destroyed," said Amanda Sheaffer, a first-grade teacher in the city.      "Many minutes are spent each day dealing with violence that is happening in the classroom."      "How am I meeting my students' needs with this behavior happening? How am I supposed to have a safe, nurturing learning environment when this behavior happens?," Sheaffer asked board members.      Big changes coming for Harrisburg, including a two-way Second Street      She was one of about a half-dozen classroom teachers and several parents, most representing Melrose and Downey elementary schools, who appealed to the board Monday for swifter and more aggressive steps to deal with a cohort of increasingly troubled kids.      The stories of how bad it can get quickly overshadowed other business at the regularly-scheduled board meeting.      "We aren't complaining. We are here begging for help so that we can help those students," said Harrisburg Education Association President Jody Barksdale, whose members brought similar concerns to the board in January.      The classroom teachers HEA represents need more help dealing with a mounting set of behavioral issues that, Barksdale said, are making it increasingly difficult for teachers to teach and any students to learn.      Especially at the elementary level.      "Teachers and students are being hit, kicked, slapped, scratched, cussed at.... and observing other students flip over tables, desks and chairs. Teachers have had to take the rest of their class into the hallway top protect them during these outbursts," Barksdale said.      "Not much has changed since last January," Barksdale continued, when she first relayed complaints about to the board and top district administrators about the in-school outbursts.      She called for, at minimum, formation of an administration / teacher / parent task force to address the violence in the schools, as well as a focus on more consistency across buildings in handling student discipline issues.      Longer-term, teachers need more training and in-building supports to deal with children battling mental health issues or trauma at home.      "Keep in mind, this kind of stuff is only happening in a few buildings," Barksdale added.      "We have a lot of schools in the district where things are going really well... But there are a few buildings where a lot of these behaviors are standouts, and that's why we're here. To address those standouts."      Harrisburg Superintendent Sybil Knight-Burney agreed Monday to the formation of a task force.      But she also contended the district - which out-sourced most of its counseling services and alternative education services following major budget struggles in 2010 - is constantly working to try to address the worst of its behavioral challenges.      "Unfortunately, some of these things take time," Knight-Burney said, "They take time for training; they take time for investigation, and making sure that we are doing the right thing for our students."      Barksdale stressed HEA is not at war with the district.      "Nobody's at war with anybody. If anything, it's a cry that we work together," the union president said. "We have to expedite the process."

"I have been kicked, punched, hit, scratched. I've had a student physically restraining me in front of my other students. ... And many of the personal things that I have bought for my classroom have been broken or destroyed," says one first-grade teacher, per PennLive. She says that in addition to the violence, the incidents disrupt the day as the classroom needs to be cleared, the incident written up, and school security involved, per FOX43. The HEA is asking for a task force to figure out strategies. Association President Jody Barksdale says the association started asking for help in January, and little has changed since then.

summarize: CLOSE Convicted murder Jodi Arias will not be receiving visitors anytime soon. KNXV-TV in Phoenix says Arias has lost visitation privileges for roughly 200 days as punishment for calling a female correctional officer a vulgar name. USA TODAY      Convicted murderer Jodi Arias isn't getting "contact" visits for the next six months after calling a guard a vulgar name after being denied a haircut.      Jodi Arias has lost the privilege of contact visits for six months after calling a state correctional officer a vulgar name, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)      Jodi Arias, one of Arizona's more notorious criminals, won't be getting company in prison anytime soon.      The convicted murderer has lost the privilege of contact visits for six months after calling a state correctional officer a vulgar name, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections.      Arias was convicted in 2013 of the murder of her secret lover, Travis Alexander, who was found dead in the shower of his Mesa home in 2008. But her first jury hung on whether to sentence her to death or to life in prison. She went back to trial in late 2014, and in March 2015, the second jury also reached an impasse, forcing the judge in the case to sentence Arias to life in prison with no chance of release.      Arias is now housed in a maximum-security unit in Goodyear.      Arias had become upset Feb. 3 because she wanted a haircut. She was told no by a correctional officer, and Arias used the derogatory term in response, the Corrections Department said.      Contact visits allow an inmate to be in a room with visitors instead of having to speak through telephones on opposite sides of a glass wall.

According to a report from the Arizona Department of Corrections, Arias was disrespectful to staff on February 3 around 11 a.m. when she admitted to a correctional officer that she called the officer a "c*** blocker."      The officer said Arias originally made the comment to another officer while she was making a call. The remark was investigated and according to Arias, the comment was taken out of context.      The report goes on to state that Arias made the remark in front of another inmate. She claims she hears "other inmates talk that way all the time and figured it was ok."      According to the report, Arias who was making a phone call had requested a haircut, but the request was denied by an officer. She was informed of the officer's decision, and she then said to another officer, who had informed her of the denial, that she "knew she would say no" because "she's a c*** blocker."      Arias was later confronted about the remark, and the inmate did not want to admit to it but later did.      She claims she "did not know that word to mean anything sexual" and the officer could look up the phrase on Urban Dictionary "because that would show it means to 'stonewall someone.'"      The investigation was completed on February 9.      As a result of Arias' remark, Andrew Wilder, with the Arizona Department of Corrections, said the inmate will have to demonstrate at least 180 days of good behavior in order to see visitors again. |||||	– Jodi Arias is less than a year into a sentence of life without parole for the 2008 murder of boyfriend Travis Alexander, and she apparently isn't adjusting that well to life in maximum security: The Arizona Republic reports that she has lost contact visitation rights for at least 180 days after making an insulting remark about a corrections officer, meaning she will see visitors on the other side of a glass wall instead of in the same room. According to an Arizona Department of Corrections report seen by ABC 15, Arias admitted making the remark about the officer on Feb. 3 after her request for a haircut was denied, though she argued that the remark wasn't that bad and officers should look it up on Urban Dictionary "because that would show it means to 'stonewall someone.'" That word would be "c---blocker," per ABC 15.

West’s designs debuted Saturday at Turning Point USA’s Young Black Leadership Summit, a meeting of young black conservatives in Washington. West didn’t attend the conference, but was there “in spirit,” according to TPUSA’s Communications Director Candace Owens.      “Blexit is a renaissance and I am blessed to say that this logo, these colors, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West,” said Owens, 29.      She gushed that West “has taken one of the boldest steps in America to open a conversation we have needed to have.”      The rapper and husband of Kim Kardashian visited the president inside the Oval Office earlier this month. His bromance with Trump began around April, when he tweeted, “the mob can’t make me not love him.”      The new shirts come in traffic-cone orange, teal and a muted lavender with designs that say “Blexit” or “We Free.”      The clothes were part of a broader launch of Blexit.com, which includes testimonials from black Americans who have left the Democratic Party.      Owens said there will be a Blexit tour to major cities including Chicago and Philadelphia, starting next year.      “The Blexit movement will spend 2019 holding rallies in every major city in America that the Democrats have destroyed,” she said. ||||| Graphic design is his passion. Kanye West is now dipping his toe into logo-making, crafting—or, at least, helping to craft—the “X” in the logo for Blexit, a self-described “frequency for those who have released themselves from the political orthodoxy” started by conservative commentator Candace Owens. Teal and orange T-shirts and hats featuring the Blexit logo and “We Free” on them were handed out at the Young Black Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C., last weekend, where, according to Page Six, Owens credited West with their design. With their bright colors, they do look a little more fashionable than your average MAGA hat—but the human-shaped “X” in Blexit is about on par with the Trump administration’s efforts at a Space Force logo. So, is the Blexit logo what happens when MAGA Kanye overtakes Fashion Kanye?      Don’t worry too much about that just yet. On Monday, Owens seemed to backtrack a bit on West’s involvement and, as per usual for a Trumpworld denizen, blamed the media for getting it wrong: “I said on stage that my friend and fellow superhero helped me design the ‘X’ for BLEXIT. This may shock the world, but Ye is a world renowned designer. Everyone who knows him asks him for advice on design. Ye supports various people in different regards, because at the end of the day—his [is] a message about unity and love.”      While West’s Yeezy line usually sticks to muted colors and neutrals, the bright colors of the Blexit merch touch on the 90s nostalgia taking over the fashion industry, so it seems likely that West had some say in the design process, even if Owens would rather you not talk about it.      Shortly before he re-tweeted Owens, West tweeted, “We’re about love unity and we design for the world.”      The much-discussed “X” that West helped design, to whatever degree, isn’t much to look at, just a shapeless figure outstretching its hands and legs in the shape of the letter. The new logo was reportedly released in tandem with a broader launch of the organization’s Web site, which includes articles with headlines like “Democrats vs. Civil Rights Protests” and “President LBJ’s True Motivations” depicting Democrats as those perpetuating racism and Republicans as misunderstood heroes.      Owens ended her statement echoing a common thought of West’s, writing, “Let’s not politicize love.”      It’s an interesting ask coming from the woman who proudly posted a photo of a Blexit hat next to a MAGA hat and accused “angry leftists” of keeping the black community apart. While West enters into his controversy-of-the-week with Blexit, his wife, Kim Kardashian, seems to be going out of her way to stay out of it, staying busy on social media to promote her new line of fragrances.

Kanye West's new apparel line—which urges blacks to ditch the Democrats in a so-called "Blexit"—was unveiled Saturday at Turning Point USA’s Young Black Leadership Summit in Washington, DC, a meeting for young black conservatives, per the New York Post. "Blexit is a renaissance and I am blessed to say that this logo, these colors, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West," says TPUSA Communications Director Candace Owens. West didn't attend but was there "in spirit," she says. The apparel line includes shirts featuring a human form in the shape of an "X" and the text "Blexit" or "We Free," per the Guardian. The release coincided with politically charged messages like Owens tweeting an image of MAGA and Blexit caps side-by-side, and articles on Blexit.com depicting Democrats as racists and Republicans as heroes. But Vanity Fair notes that Owens, also a TV pundit and YouTube star, later downplayed the political angle, saying, "Let's not politicize love." She also appeared to backpedal on West's creative input: "I said on stage that my friend and fellow superhero helped me design the 'X' for Blexit. ... Everyone who knows him asks him for advice on design." (Kanye recently met with President Trump and released a "stream of consciousness.")
summarize: It was an off-the-cuff remark heard instantly around the world, befuddling spectators of President Trump’s freewheeling Wednesday news conference, who appeared conflicted about whether it was polite, rude or a mixture of both.      “Yes, please, Mr. Kurd. Go ahead,” Trump said to Kurdish journalist Rahim Rashidi as he called on him to ask a question about U.S. relations with the Kurds.      The answer from Trump was nearly drowned out by the social media frenzy that ensued, as people wondered whether they had heard the president correctly. The clip started circulating and wound up in highlight reels of the news conference. “Mr. Kurd” started trending on Twitter.      But of those shocked by Trump’s remark, Rashidi, a reporter for Kurdistan 24, was not among them.      “Hello, this is Mr. Kurd,” he said as he answered the phone late Wednesday night, several hours after he went viral.      "Mr. Kurd." He called a man Mr. Kurd. Because he has an accent and asked a question about the Kurds. @realDonaldTrump #PressConference — Michael Seitzman (@michaelseitzman) September 26, 2018      This Trump presser.

He referred to a Kurdish reporter as 'Mr Kurd'            What is going on. — Samira Sawlani (@samirasawlani) September 26, 2018      For Rashidi, Trump’s acknowledgment of his identity as a Kurdish person as the world looked on was far from insulting. Instead, it was a moment of pride, he said.      “I loved it, because all the time our identity is ignored by the Turkish government, by the Iranian government,” he told The Washington Post. “We are proud of our struggle for democracy, for justice, for freedom. He made me so happy when he called me Mr. Kurd. It was a moment of respect for us, for me.”      The Kurds are “one of the world’s largest peoples without a sovereign state,” with a “history marked by marginalization and persecution,” as the Council on Foreign Relations has put it. About 30 million Kurds live in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, and “many who remain in their ancestral lands maintain a strong sense of a distinctly Kurdish identity,” the CFR wrote, amid their long-fought bid for independence. Rashidi said he was born in Iranian Kurdistan and later lived in Iraqi Kurdistan until 2000. At that point, he fled to Turkey and later Sweden as a legal refugee, he said. He now lives in Washington, D.C.      I get your point but given the denial of identity by the governments forced on Kurds, its cool to hear such recognition by POTUS on the world stage. https://t.co/vubjQmPNq5 — Yerevan Saeed (@YerevanSaeed) September 27, 2018      On Wednesday night, other Kurds also expressed appreciation for Trump’s acknowledgment of their identity, including another Kurdish journalist in the room. Majeed Gly, New York bureau chief for Rudaw Media Network, said on Twitter that he would “actually take it as a compliment if you call me Mr. Kurd.”      “There is an outcry on social media as if Trump was being disrespectful,” Namo Abdulla, the Washington bureau chief for Rudaw, said on Twitter. “He was not! I am #Kurdish and Mr. Kurd is my colleague. Kurdishness is an identity most Kurds are openly proud of.”      I identify as #MrKurd and I'm totally proud of it, I don't see how it's disrespectful, I only see recognition and racial respect in the statement, and I don't even agree with Trump all that much, but y'all people need to chill. — Khalid Mirany (@Khalid_Mirany) September 27, 2018      Amid a flurry of questions directed at Trump about the sexual misconduct allegations that have beleaguered Supreme Court nominee Brett. M. Kavanaugh, Rashidi asked Trump what the future relationship with the Kurds will look like in a “post-ISIS” world. Kurdish militias, allied with U.S. forces, have played a crucial role in Syria in the fight against the Islamic State. But the question on Kurds’ minds, Rashidi said, is whether the U.S. government will continue to support the Kurds after the Islamic State is defeated.      “We’re trying to get along very well,” Trump said in response. “We do get along great with the Kurds. We’re trying to help them a lot. Don’t forget, that’s their territory. We have to help them. I want to help them. They fought with us. They died with us. They died. We lost tens of thousands of Kurds, died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us. And for themselves. They died for themselves. They’re great people. And we have not forgotten. We don’t forget.”      Rashidi said he found Trump’s answer more than sufficient.      “It’s given us something,” Rashidi told The Washington Post. “He’s given us hope.”      Asked whether he believed Trump’s moniker would stick, Rashidi said it’s already caught on.      “Just call me Mr. Kurd,” he joked. ||||| President Donald Trump called on a foreign news reporter by referring to him as “Mr. Kurd” during a solo news conference in New York on Wednesday.

Rahim Rashidi is not among the aghast, and his opinion matters more than most: He's Mr. Kurd. As the Washington Post reports, Rashidi, a Kurdish journalist who reports for Kurdistan 24, wanted to ask Trump about US relations with the Kurds, some 30 million stateless people who live across Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, and have helped the US in the fight against ISIS. Trump said to him, "Yes, please, Mr. Kurd. Go ahead." Rashidi, frankly, was thrilled. "I loved it, because all the time our identity is ignored by the Turkish government, by the Iranian government," he tells the Post. "We are proud of our struggle for democracy, for justice, for freedom. He made me so happy when he called me Mr. Kurd. It was a moment of respect for us, for me." Indeed, the Post notes that when it telephoned Rashidi late Wednesday, he picked up the phone with a new greeting: "Hello, this is Mr. Kurd."
summarize: WASHINGTON – Aaron Alexis, the gunman who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday before being fatally shot by law enforcement officials, had a Navy record that included several unauthorized absences from duty, instances of insubordination and disorderly conduct, one instance of being absent without leave, and several failed inspections, according to a Navy official.      The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the current investigation, also said that in addition to his two previously known arrests in 2004 and 2010, Alexis had been arrested in DeKalb County, Ga., in 2008 on a disorderly conduct charge and held for two nights.      None of the disciplinary problems or his arrests, however, prevented Alexis from receiving a security clearance or from purchasing a shotgun recently in northern Virginia.      The Navy gave Alexis an administrative punishment after his 2008 arrest. Officials have not revealed what punishments Alexis received for his other offenses, but sanctions often range from loss of pay to reduction in rank.      WHO THEY WERE: Navy Yard shooting victims      Alexis applied in 2011 for an early discharge from the Navy, before his enlistment was up. Because of the spate of disciplinary problems, Navy officials looked at giving him a general discharge, which is given to sailors with conduct problems whose performance otherwise is satisfactory. But after examining his record closely, they opted to give him an honorable discharge in January 2011, the official said.      The additional evidence regarding Alexis’ disciplinary history came as officials also disclosed that he recently had sought treatment at a veterans healthcare facility for mental problems.      Alexis "went to the VA to talk to them about mental-health issues. He was trying to get help, we think," said a federal official, also speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.      He had been hoping to get back into the Navy but was "experiencing problems" at the contracting firm that employed him, the official said.      Alexis "didn't take that very well," the official added.      Investigators have confirmed that Alexis bought the shotgun used in Monday’s shooting at a gun shop in Lorton, Va. Managers at the store, Sharp Shooter, referred questions to their lawyers.      Three weapons were found near Alexis' body Monday — the shotgun, a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol. Investigators are looking at the possibility that he may have seized one or more of the weapons from a security guard he shot at the base.      Investigators are also looking at the possibility that Alexis may have nursed a grievance with his employer regarding pay.      FULL COVERAGE: Navy Yard shooting      Thomas Hoshko, chief executive of the firm the Experts, said he wasn't aware of reports of a pay dispute or that Alexis may have sought treatment for mental illness. Alexis had held a security clearance since 2007, when he joined the Navy, Hoshko said.      Alexis had worked for the company on a contract in Asia last year and had recently been rehired and assigned to work at the Navy Yard. He had "no personal or professional issues," Hoshko said in an email.      Hoshko added that Alexis passed a background check in July and a drug test. He received an identification card from the Defense Department.      “No one who conducted his background investigations made us aware of any potential issues with mental health," Hoshko said.      Both the Defense Department and the Diplomatic Security Service had "reviewed a drug test and two background checks on Alexis," including one in July, before his assignment to the Navy Marine contract, he added.      Alexis returned to the firm in July after telling a colleague, he needed "to get back to work" because “school did not pay," Hoshko said.      Hoshko added that Alexis "successfully completed over six short-term assignments" at various military installations "prior to being assigned to the Washington Navy Yard last week."      "We were not aware of any problems regarding his personal or professional work prior to this most unfortunate incident," he said.      The company is a subcontractor for Hewlett-Packard.

When officers came to his hotel room early on Aug. 7, Mr. Alexis told them that a person he had argued with at an airport in Virginia “has sent three people to follow him” and that they were harassing him with a microwave machine, according to a Newport, R.I., police report. Mr. Alexis said he had heard “voices speaking to him through the wall, flooring and ceiling,” the report said.      Mr. Alexis told the police he was a Navy contractor, and then twice that month he sought treatment from the Veterans Affairs Department for psychiatric issues, according to a senior law enforcement official. But it did not raise a red flag that might have prevented him from entering the military base in Washington where, the authorities say, he killed 12 people on Monday.      On Wednesday, Mr. Alexis’s mother apologized to the victims in a brief statement she read from her Brooklyn home.      “I don’t know why he did what he did, and I will never be able to ask him why,” Cathleen Alexis said. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”      The episode in Rhode Island adds to a growing list of questions about how Mr. Alexis, who had a history of infractions as a Navy reservist, mental health problems and run-ins with the police over gun violence, gained and kept a security clearance from the Defense Department that gave him access to military bases, including the navy yard, where he was shot to death by the police.      Time and again, Mr. Alexis’s behavior fell below a level that would have brought a serious response, like a less-than-honorable discharge from the military or involuntary commitment to a mental institution, experts and officials said.      But the sheer number of episodes raises questions about the government’s system for vetting people for security clearances, including the thousands of contractors who help run the nation’s military and security system work. Though the cases are different, the access granted Mr. Alexis, a former Navy reservist who as an independent contractor serviced Navy computers, raises questions similar to those raised about another outside government contractor, Edward J. Snowden, who leaked national intelligence secrets.      “These two incidents combined suggest to me a very flawed system for granting security clearances,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who called for a Congressional investigation into the granting of security clearances to government contractors. “Who knows how many other Snowdens and Aaron Alexises are out there?”      On Tuesday, President Obama ordered the White House budget office to conduct a governmentwide review of policies for security clearances for contractors and employees in federal agencies. In an interview with Noticias Telemundo, the president said the nation did not have a “firm enough background check system.” He also called once again for Congress to enact legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with mental illness.      “I do get concerned that this becomes a ritual that we go through every three, four months, where we have these horrific mass shootings,” he said.      Senior Pentagon officials also said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel intended to review physical security and access at all Defense Department installations around the world.      Many planets aligned to place Mr. Alexis, 34, at the start of the workday in the navy yard with a Remington pump-action shotgun, firing down from a balcony, the police said, and killing the employees, all civilians. ||||| Aaron Alexis, 34, has been identified by officials as the gunman in Monday’s shooting at the Washington Navy Yard. In 2010, Alexis was arrested by Fort Worth police after a bullet was fired through the floor of his upstairs neighbor’s apartment. He told police that his gun accidentally discharged while he was cleaning it, and no charges were pursued.

Authorities say the former Navy reservist, who had been living in Fort Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.      The military’s beleaguered background-check system failed to block Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis from an all-access pass to a half-dozen military installations, despite a history of arrests for shooting episodes and disorderly conduct.      Alexis, a military contractor working on a computer project, used his secret-level clearance to gain entry to the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, where officials said he gunned down a dozen people before being killed by police.      The revelations about Alexis’s troubled past — and his ability to pass the government’s security-check system — prompted multiple examinations Tuesday into how background checks are conducted and how long a security clearance can last without review. The system was already under scrutiny after leaks of classified documents by fugitive National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.      President Obama directed his budget office to conduct a government-wide review of security standards for contractors and employees across federal agencies. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also ordered a broad review into security and access to military installations worldwide.      More than 24 hours after the deadly rampage, there was still widespread confusion over how Alexis managed to escape scrutiny since being given access to classified materials and facilities five years ago. The private contractor that most recently employed him pointed the finger at the Defense Department, which defended its handling of the case.      Alexis was granted secret-level security clearance in March 2008, when he was working as a full-time Navy reservist, according to the Pentagon. He was discharged from the Navy in January 2011 after a series of run-ins with his military superiors and police.      In September 2012, a Hewlett-Packard subcontractor called The Experts hired Alexis and said it confirmed his security clearance with the Defense Department. Thomas Hoshko, the company’s chief executive, said he confirmed the status again in late June of this year, when Alexis returned to work for the firm after a brief hiatus.      A background check done by a private contractor at the time turned up only a minor traffic violation, according to Hoshko. “It came back clean,” he said.      Alexis worked as a subcontractor helping to update and replace computers for Navy and Marine Corps installations. Since July, the 34-year-old had worked at six different naval locations, including facilities in Arlington, Va., Cherry Point, N.C., and Stafford, Va. He worked at the Navy Yard for several days before the shooting.      It is unclear why the Defense Department approved Alexis’s security clearance after his 2004 arrest in Seattle for shooting out the tires of a car. Thomas Richards, a spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management, said the office conducted only one security review of Alexis, in 2007, and that it turned up his 2004 arrest in Seattle.      He maintained his clearance despite more recent brushes with the law and a pattern of misconduct that preceded his discharge from the Navy. Alexis was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in DeKalb County, Ga., in 2008, and after he fired a shot into his apartment ceiling in Texas in 2010.      A Defense Department official said that lower-level clearances such as the one granted to Alexis are typically good for 10 years. Former military employees who become private-sector contractors can also maintain their clearance during that time.      The official said a person can keep a clearance “in the absence of unadjudicated derogatory information.”      The agency did not conduct a new background check either last year, when Alexis was first hired as a military contractor, or this summer, when Alexis was seeking a second stint with the contracting firm, people familiar with his hiring said. Instead, the company hired an approved background screening firm that confirmed with the Defense Department that Alexis’s security clearance remained valid.      A secret-level clearance requires far less-intensive digging than one for top-secret clearance, and involves only a check of the FBI database, military records and data from law enforcement agencies where an applicant has lived, worked or attended school during the past five years. It does not require interviews with family members, co-workers or employers.      Hoshko told The Washington Post that he would not have hired Alexis if he had known about his arrests.      “Anything that suggests criminal problems or mental-health issues, that would be a flag,” he said. “We would not have hired him.”      No one in the company was made aware of the past incidents, he said. “If there’s not full disclosure on this, how do they expect us to make good decisions about who to trust and hire?”      Hoshko said his company and other contracting firms rely on the military to approve the security clearances of their employees, and he fears that budget crunches have led to faster and less thorough checks. His company hired a private firm — in September 2012, when Alexis first came to The Experts, and in June 2013, when he returned for another stint — to conduct a criminal background check of Alexis. As part of the company’s standard procedure for hiring new employees and rehiring old ones, the company also verified with the Defense Department both times that Alexis’s security clearance remained in force and conducted new drug tests.      Congressional leaders on Tuesday called for investigations and hearings into how the military screens contractors for classified work and entry to its bases. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) asked the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to hold a hearing into contractor hiring practices at military installations, while Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) wrote to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus seeking answers about oversight of contractor access and flaws in security clearances.      A report released Tuesday by the Defense Department’s inspector general also found serious deficiencies in a Navy screening program for people who didn’t have standard credentials. The program does not apply to contractors such as Alexis, but congressional staffers say it indicates another serious deficiency in the screening system.      Auditors found 52 convicted felons who received routine,      unescorted access to naval facilities through the program, known as the Navy Commercial Access Control System. The inspector general said the program, developed in 2010 to check the credentials of occasional contractors, created “a false sense of security” and should be abandoned immediately.      In one example, the report said an individual was given unescorted access to a base in 2011 for more than three months before it was discovered he had been convicted years earlier of “indecent liberties with a child,” a felony. Several other felonies also weren’t caught in the screening, including convictions for assault, theft and “throwing a missile at an occupied vehicle.”      Hoshko said he was disturbed to learn from The Post and other news outlets about police reports alleging that Alexis shot out a construction worker’s tires in Seattle in 2004 and fired a bullet into the ceiling of his Fort Worth apartment in 2010.      “If I can find this out just by doing a Google search, that is sad,” Hoshko said. “Anything that suggests criminal problems or mental-health issues, that would be a flag. We would not have hired him.”      Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) received staff briefings on the case Tuesday and has authored legislation that would provide more funding to ferret out screening flaws.      “Corners are obviously being cut,” Tester said. “We had Snowden earlier this year and now the Navy Yard tragedy. We have to fix this.”      Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he plans to investigate “a number of things” in the coming weeks — especially how Alexis could have been employed by a federal contractor despite his arrest records and treatment for mental illness.      “What is the responsibility of our government and contractors to vet employees and from time to time reinvestigate those employees, if concerns arise about someone?” Carper asked. “What kind of clearance or clearances did this suspect possess? What kind of background check did he undergo in order to get his clearance? Were his clearances up to date? Is there some quality problem with the quality process of granting those clearances? And maybe a third one is what can we learn from this incident to help make this installation and other military installations and federal buildings safer, so that some good could come out of something that was awful.”      Hoshko, whose company is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said he applauds Congress’s revived interest in the rigor of security clearances, the vast majority of which are handled by private firms.      “You have to more seriously look at the people’s backgrounds,” Hosh­ko said. “If he had a mental background, we would have wanted to know it. . . . The whole [security clearance process] needs to be reviewed top to bottom.”      Alexis began working for The Experts as an hourly computer technician in September 2012 at a U.S. military base in Japan and finished his work in Japan in January 2013.      “There were no incidents,” Hosh­ko said. “The guys liked him.”      He took a break, according to co-workers, because he wanted to go back to school.      He returned to work on The Experts’ subcontract in July. Alexis told one of his colleagues that he was returning to the contracting world “because school didn’t pay,” Hoshko said.

Aaron Alexis, the man police say shot and killed 12 people in a Washington Navy Yard, reportedly called police to complain about people following him and that he was hearing voices. He sought mental health treatment from a nearby VA hospital, officials said. NBC's Pete Williams reports.      "He was tired of dealing with the government," said Kristi Suthamtewkal, whose husband owns the Thai Bowl Restaurant in Fort Worth, where Alexis worked in exchange for room and board.      But instead of leaving the U.S., the former Navy reservist relocated from Texas to Virginia, where an IT company called The Experts put him on a government contract at the Washington Navy Yard.      A day after Alexis, 34, gunned down 12 people at the yard, new details emerged of his troubled past — from his preoccupation with 9/11 to recent mental problems that included hearing voices in his head.      Investigators said Tuesday that a preliminary probe has turned up no evidence that Alexis participated in rescue operations at Ground Zero, as his father once told police.      He was, however, employed as a clerical worker at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, in the shadow of the Twin Towers, when they were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001.      “He talked about 9/11 and where he was and how the buildings had collapsed and he couldn’t believe that...and how he was upset with the terrorists for taking innocent lives," Suthamtewkal said.      Kristi Suthamtewakul via Reuters Aaron Alexis in an undated photograph provided by Kristi Suthamtewakul, wife of "Happy Bowl" Thai restaurant owner Nutpisit Suthamtewakul.      Melinda Downs, who took in Alexis after he moved out of the Suthamtewkals' house last year, said he told her he suffered from post-traumatic stress after "surviving 9/11 in New York."      And when Alexis was arrested in Seattle in 2004, for shooting at a parked car in what he called an "anger-fueled blackout," he brought up 9/11 during his interrogation and "how those events had disturbed him," police said.      Three years after that arrest, Alexis enlisted in the Navy Reserves and served as an aviation electrician's mate — a third-class petty officer — before he was given an honorable discharge in January 2011.      Military officials acknowledged that Alexis had disciplinary issues including absence without permission, insubordination and disorderly conduct.      Among the problems: an arrest in September 2010 by Fort Worth police after he accidentally fired a bullet into the apartment above him while he was cleaning a gun with slippery hands. Prosecutors determined that there wasn’t enough evidence to bring a recklessness case.      After his discharge, Alexis began an online course in aeronautics with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He worshiped at a Buddhist Temple and was befriended by Suthamtewkal's husband, Oui, who " took him under his wing and took care of him."      He was given a room at their house in exchange for help at the restaurant, where he was one of the more popular waiters.      "Everybody loved him," Kristi Suthamtewkal said.      He spent a lot of time in his room, burning incense, she said. Michael Ritrobato, a handyman at the restaurant, said Alexis played violent online video games but was good-natured, not angry.      After he returned from a contract job in Japan in Nov. 2012, he didn't seem as easy-going, though.      He felt like he had been cheated out of money from the contract and complained that he was mistreated because he was black, Kristi Suthamtewkal said.      "He felt a lot of discrimination and and racism with white people especially," she said.      There was also a growing sense of entitlement and disrespect, she said. "He did have the tendency to feel like people owed him something all the time."      He got annoyed when she couldn't give him rides, and he started eating the couple's food without permission, and ignoring her when she complained, she said. When her cats developed fleas, he was angry.      Mostly, though, she felt like he was fed up with the United States.      Fort Worth Police via Reuters Aaron Alexis in a Fort Worth Police Department handout photo.      “I knew he was not happy with America and he felt slighted as a veteran and he was ready to move out of the country," she said.      When he abruptly left their house in July, he went to live with Melinda and Marvin Downs.      "He would get really quiet sometimes, put his head down," Melinda said. "You would see him in thought but not in rage, not angry at the world."      After he left Fort Worth for a series of jobs on the East Coast, Alexis kept in touch with the Downses. The last they heard from him, on Sept. 9, he said everything was going well in Washington.      Even before Monday morning, though, there were signs that wasn't true.      He sought treatment with the Veterans Administration for paranoia and hearing voices in two states.      In August, Newport, R.I., police were called to a Marriott Hotel room where Alexis said he was being followed by three people and heard voices coming from his closet. He couldn't sleep because he thought they were using a microwave machine to send vibrations through the ceiling, the police report says.      His small circle of friends in Fort Worth say they saw no evidence of mental illness or aggression and struggled to reconcile the accusations against their friend with the man they knew.      "I don't know him as a monster. I choose to rather remember him as being the jokester. An honorable young man — not the one that flipped out and just went off on everybody," Melinda Downs said.      Kristi Suthamtewkal recalled his devotion to the Wat Busayadhammavanaram temple.      "Buddhism is a religion of peace," she said. "It does not make sense."      Pete Williams, Jim Miklaszewski, Richard Esposito, Jonathan Dienst and Shimon Prokupecz also contributed to this report.                  Authorities say the Washington Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis had a history of psychiatric problems and his father told police previously that his son had anger management problems ever since helping people in New York during 9/11. NBC's Pete Williams reports.      This story was originally published on ||||| The Navy was told by authorities in Rhode Island last month of an incident in which Aaron Alexis complained that he was hearing voices, according to a police report on the incident. It is unclear whether the Navy followed up.      Alexis was agitated when police paid him a visit at the Marriott Hotel he had checked into in Newport, R.I.      Local law enforcement had received a harassment complaint from someone in the hotel, and when they tracked down the source of the complaint -- Alexis, the gunman in the Washington Navy Yard massacre on Monday that killed 12 and wounded 8 more -- the police wrote in their report of the incident that he complained about an "unknown party" of people he had never seen. Alexis said these people had been keeping him awake by "sending vibrations into his body" by "using some sort of microwave machine."      FBI looking for those who know more about alleged shooter      Shooting at Washington Navy Yard      Alleged Navy Yard gunman involved in previous minor shootings      While the motive in the Navy Yard massacre is still unclear, a pattern of agitated and unsteady behavior has emerged in the recent history of the suspected shooter. Officials say they're fairly certain the 34-year-old former Navy reservist had no connections to terrorism, but instead had a long history of mental health issues.      Alexis told Newport police in August the unknown party following him around had been sending voices through the walls and ceiling. In their report, police said they tried to find out what the voices were saying, but Alexis wouldn't elaborate. Before parting, police claim Alexis said "he does not have a history of mental illness in his family and that he has never had any sort of mental episode."      Police also said in the report that Alexis told them he had checked out of two other hotels to try to escape the voices before checking into the Marriott.      Newport Police Sgt. Frank Rosa says in the report that he informed the Navy of the Marriott incident. "Based on the Naval base implications," Rosa wrote, "and the claim that the involved subject ... was 'hearing voices,' I made contact with on duty Naval Station Police. I advised of the report and the claims." Rose added that Navy authorities said they would follow up to determine if Alexis was indeed a Navy base contractor.      A look at Alexis' prior arrest record indicates that he has a history of mental health issues.      On June 3, 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle for shooting out the tires of another man's car on May 6 in what Alexis told police was an anger-fueled "blackout." It appeared Alexis may have been angry with construction workers who were using parking spaces in his neighborhood.      On Sept. 4, 2010, Alexis was arrested for allegedly firing a gun inside his Texas apartment because he had been angry about his downstairs neighbor making too much noise. At the time he was a Navy reservist stationed in Fort Worth.      Officials say Alexis also had bouts of insubordination, disorderly conduct and being absent from work without authorization during his four years as a full-time reservist. He frequently complained about discrimination, and officials say his behavior led to an early but honorable discharge in 2011.      When he left the Navy reserves, he managed to keep his security clearance upon becoming a military contractor because his incidents with police never rose to the level of raising an alarm about him being mentally unfit. Additionally, his arrests never gave cause to bar him from buying a firearm, including the shotgun officials say he bought recently in Virginia to carry out the Navy Yard massacre.      At the time of the rampage, Alexis was an employee with a Defense Department subcontractor on a Navy-Marine Corps computer project, authorities told the Associated Press. Alexis had access to the Navy Yard via a valid pass.      The roots of Alexis' issues are still being examined, but after his 2004 arrest in Seattle, both Alexis' father and Alexis himself told police he had been present during "the tragic events of September 11, 2001" and that they had disturbed him. His father told police he suffered from PTSD and that his mental issues stretch back at least a decade.      After the Newport, R.I., run-in with police August, Alexis sought treatment for mental health issues from the Department of Veterans Affairs, officials say.      Until recently, Alexis lived in Fort Worth at the home of Melinda Downs, reports CBS News correspondent Bob Orr. She said Alexis suffered from PTSD and insomnia. She told reporters he loved the military and showed no signs of violence.      "It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, who was this guy?" Downs said. "The guy that I knew was so honorable. It breaks my heart." |||||	– How did a guy who heard voices, felt microwaves, and had multiple gun arrests get security clearance? That's a question lawmakers, and Aaron Alexis' former employer, are asking today. "We would not have hired him" if we'd known, the CEO of The Experts tells the Washington Post. "If I can find this out just by doing a Google search, that is sad." The Defense Department checked Alexis once, in 2007. That check turned up his 2004 arrest for shooting out a car's tires, but Alexis passed the low bar for "Secret" clearance anyway. Secret clearance is generally good for 10 years, even if someone leaves the military. Alexis' Navy record included several unauthorized absences from duty, insubordination complaints, and failed inspections, an official tells the LA Times, but the Navy discharged him honorably—albeit barely—anyway. His arrests never resulted in charges being filed that would show up on a background check, and he was never committed for his mental health problems, the New York Times points out—though Rhode Island authorities did alert the Navy about the "microwave machine" incident, CBS notes.

In other Alexis revelations: Alexis was so frustrated with America that he was "ready to move out of the country" last year, friend and former co-landlord Kristi Suthamtewkal tells NBC News. "He was tired of dealing with the government." Instead, he moved to Virginia and joined The Experts. Alexis was working in the shadow of the Twin Towers when the 9/11 attacks hit. Investigators can't verify his father's claim that he helped in the recovery effort, but Suthamtewkal says he talked often about "where he was and how the buildings had collapsed and … how he was upset with the terrorists for taking innocent lives."

CALLER: -- for al the historical information you give us. Every Fourth of July we read your father's story            RUSH: Thank you very much. That would be the signers of the Declaration of Independence.            CALLER: Yes, sir.            RUSH: Right.            CALLER: We study the Pilgrims intently in our home, and one of the things that you said this morning I took a big issue with. I think I understand where you're coming from. The first Thanksgiving, as we understand it, that the Pilgrim fathers gave and held was not giving thanks to the Indians. It wasn't giving thanks necessarily for the Indians. But it was giving thanks to God -- and one of the benefits and blessings they saw as coming from him was the relationship they enjoyed with the Indians. And so when they held their feast, of course, they invited the Indians to join them --            RUSH: Right!            CALLER: -- and they held it with them, and I think you may be reading too much into it by saying that Obama's trying to perpetuate that entire myth, although I wouldn't put it past him.            RUSH: No! I'm just reading what he wrote in there!            CALLER: Sure. Sure.            RUSH: He said that Thanksgiving is about the Indians saving us, with their agriculture and everything else. The true story of Thanksgiving is socialism failed. Of course we showed them gratitude! We shared our bounty with them, not because we didn't know how to make it. It was because we first failed as socialists. Only when we turned capitalists did we have plenty. The Indians didn't teach us capitalism.            CALLER: That's true. That's true.            RUSH: They did look at Massasoit... Bradford called Massasoit the protector of the Pilgrims and they did recognize that without his protection they might have been toast with the other tribes around, and Massasoit did show great courage in welcoming the Pilgrims. You know, he'd been burned before by a pirate named Black that had stolen away a lot of his tribes members, so for Massasoit to not come in immediately and attack the Pilgrims was a blessing from God, and they recognize that, and so they were thankful. But there also came a time when Massasoit was truly thankful for the Pilgrims, and they actually saved his life on more than one occasion --            RUSH: Right.            CALLER: -- and he was grateful for them. So they enjoyed peaceful relations for 50 years.            RUSH: What have I said that you gives you the idea that I disagree with this. I mean, after all the Indians had to show the Pilgrims where the water sources were. They didn't know any of that stuff.            CALLER: Sure.            RUSH: There had there to be mutual sharing. What did I say that gives you the...?            CALLER: Well, I think to imply that they weren't thankful at all for the Indians or what the Indians had done for them or to say that the Indians did not protect them and weren't in some ways (garbled).            RUSH: No! I didn't say that. They clearly were because they shared the first feast with them. They shared all the bounty with them.            CALLER: Then we have no disagreement.            RUSH: It was free range turkey!            CALLER: You're 99.7% rating is still intact, then.            RUSH: (laughing)            CALLER: (laughing)            RUSH: Look, I enjoy the scrutiny. I'm always interested to know how people hear what I say. Because I'm a professional communicator, and if I fail to communicate what I mean, I need to know that. So you've served a very valuable purpose here because I did not mean to imply that we steamrollered over these people.            CALLER: Well, and I know that much of what you say is also designed to provoke thought and to make people think, to be absurd sometimes and make people go to the limits of absurdity and look at their own beliefs.            RUSH: Well, that's exactly right. We do illustrate absurdity by being absurd here. Those who forget that quickly can lose their minds.

I am not going to be put in a bad mood by you, Snerdley. Of course the rest of the Thanksgiving story is that after the Indians saved the white people, who, after all, did what? They brought syphilis, sexually transmitted diseases, gongorrhea -- as had one high school health teacher pronounced it -- racism, bigotry, homophobia, all these things. Then what are we going to do to show our gratitude? Then we had the guts to swindle 'em out of Manhattan for 24 bucks, and then we stole their land, and we stole their horses, and we moved 'em away from the various things that they had used religiously, peyote and so forth, and they got sick. So then we put 'em in reservations, and after awhile we felt guilty and let 'em run all the casinos outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Well, that is not the true story of Thanksgiving.            By the way, I was reading a book on Theodore Roosevelt recently -- RUSH: Back to the phones, Don in Lake Ronkonkoma, New York, nice to have you with us, sir, hello.CALLER: Hey, mega dittos, Rush.

RUSH: It is. That Thanksgiving story is right out of my second book, See, I Told You So , and we do that in the last half hour of every show on the Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving. It is so at odds with what all of us were taught in school. I'll just give you a little heads-up. If you were like me, what we were taught in school was that the Pilgrims came over, and they were just overwhelmed; they were swamped; they had no clue where they were; they had no clue how to feed themselves; they had to clue how to protect themselves; they had no idea how to stay warm; they had no idea how to do anything. They were just typical, dumb white people fleeing some other place they couldn't manage to live in. And then, out of the woods came the wonderful Indians, who had great compassion, they were at one with the land, they were at one with the spirits, and they saw these incompetent, dupe white people dressed up in these odd, stupid, black and white hats and suits, and they befriended us, and they taught us how to plant corn and how to catch beasts and how to skin beavers to stay warm, and Thanksgiving is where we give thanks to the Indians. That is the exact opposite of -- (interruption) what did I leave out? Well, I was going to get there! This is why, folks, I do not allow the staff to have their own microphones.Everybody, despite 20 years at the top of the heap, thinks they can do this better than I do it. North Carolina mistress, "You shouldn't be talking about that, why don't you bring this up? I can't believe you, you didn't talk about this. You've had it for two days." I am not going to be put in a bad mood by you, Snerdley. Of course the rest of the Thanksgiving story is that after the Indians saved the white people, who, after all, did what? They brought syphilis, sexually transmitted diseases, gongorrhea -- as had one high school health teacher pronounced it -- racism, bigotry, homophobia, all these things.

Then we had the guts to swindle 'em out of Manhattan for 24 bucks, and then we stole their land, and we stole their horses, and we moved 'em away from the various things that they had used religiously, peyote and so forth, and they got sick. So then we put 'em in reservations, and after awhile we felt guilty and let 'em run all the casinos outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Well, that is not the true story of Thanksgiving.By the way, I was reading a book on Theodore Roosevelt recently -- I mentioned this at the top of the show, but I want to go through this again. How many of you believe that we actually swindled Indians when we bought Manhattan from them? I've always thought that 'til I read this book. It's called Commissioner Roosevelt: The Story of Theodore Roosevelt and the New York City Police, 1895 to 1897, by H. Paul Jeffers. And here is the relevant paragraph: "A persuasive case can be made that the city of New York began with a swindle. For generations school children have been taught that a slick trick was played on unsuspecting Indians by the director of the Dutch West India Company, Peter Minuit. In 1626 he purchased the island of 'Manna-hatin' for sixty gilders worth of trinkets, about twenty-four dollars. What Minuit did not know at the time, however, was that his masterful real estate deal had been struck with the Canarsie tribe, residents of Long Island; they held no title to the land they sold to the Dutch. In due course, the intruders from Amsterdam who thought they had pulled a sharp one on the locals were forced into negotiating a second, more costly deal with the true landlords." So it was the Indians that pulled the real estate scam when they sold Manhattan because the ones that sold it didn't own it. We got taken. I have to straighten all of this out on this type of show on this day.            RUSH: Now, the real story of Thanksgiving: "On August 1, 1620, the Mayflower set sail. It carried a total of 102 passengers, including forty Pilgrims led by William Bradford. On the journey, Bradford set up an agreement, a contract, that established just and equal laws for all members of the new community, irrespective of their religious beliefs. Where did the revolutionary ideas expressed in the Mayflower Compact come from? From the Bible," and this is what's not taught. This is what's left out. "The Pilgrims were a people completely steeped in the lessons of the Old and New Testaments. They looked to the ancient Israelites for their example. And, because of the biblical precedents set forth in Scripture, they never doubted that their experiment would work. But this was no pleasure cruise, friends. The journey to the New World was a long and arduous one. And when the Pilgrims landed in New England in November, they found, according to Bradford's detailed journal, a cold, barren, desolate wilderness. There were no friends to greet them, he wrote. There were no houses to shelter them. There were no inns where they could refresh themselves. And the sacrifice they had made for freedom was just beginning. During the first winter, half the Pilgrims -- including Bradford's own wife -- died of either starvation, sickness, or exposure.            "When spring finally came, Indians taught the settlers how to plant corn, fish for cod and skin beavers for coats. Life improved for the Pilgrims, but they did not yet prosper! This is important to understand because this is where modern American history lessons often end. Thanksgiving is actually explained in some textbooks as a holiday for which the Pilgrims gave thanks to the Indians for saving their lives, rather than as a devout expression of gratitude grounded in the tradition of both the Old and New Testaments. Here is the part that has been omitted: The original contract the Pilgrims had entered into with their merchant-sponsors in London called for everything they produced to go into a common store, and each member of the community was entitled to one common share. All of the land they cleared and the houses they built belong to the community as well." They were collectivists! Now, "Bradford, who had become the new governor of the colony, recognized that this form of collectivism was as costly and destructive to the Pilgrims as that first harsh winter, which had taken so many lives.            "He decided to take bold action. Bradford assigned a plot of land to each family to work and manage, thus turning loose the power of the marketplace. ... Long before Karl Marx was even born, the Pilgrims had discovered and experimented with what could only be described as socialism. And what happened? It didn't work! Surprise, surprise, huh? What Bradford and his community found was that the most creative and industrious people had no incentive to work any harder than anyone else, unless they could utilize the power of personal motivation! But while most of the rest of the world has been experimenting with socialism for well over a hundred years -- trying to refine it, perfect it, and re-invent it -- the Pilgrims decided early on to scrap it permanently. What Bradford wrote about this social experiment should be in every schoolchild's history lesson," every kid gets. "If it were, we might prevent much needless suffering in the future." Here's what he wrote: "'The experience that we had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years...that by taking away property, and bringing community into a common wealth, would make them happy and flourishing -- as if they were wiser than God,' Bradford wrote.            "'For this community [so far as it was] was found to breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort. For young men that were most able and fit for labor and service did repine that they should spend their time and strength to work for other men's wives and children without any recompense...that was thought injustice.'" That was thought injustice. "Do you hear what he was saying, ladies and gentlemen? The Pilgrims found that people could not be expected to do their best work without incentive. So what did Bradford's community try next? They unharnessed the power of good old free enterprise by invoking the undergirding capitalistic principle of private property. Every family was assigned its own plot of land to work and permitted to market its own crops and products. And what was the result?" 'This had very good success,' wrote Bradford, "for it made all hands industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been." Bradford doesn't sound like much of a Clintonite, does he? Is it possible that supply-side economics could have existed before the 1980s? ... In no time, the Pilgrims found they had more food than they could eat themselves. ... So they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians.

"The profits allowed them to pay off their debts to the merchants in London. And the success and prosperity of the Plymouth settlement attracted more Europeans and began what came to be known as the 'Great Puritan Migration.'" Now, aside from this program, have you heard this before? Is this "being taught to children -- and if not, why not? I mean, is there a more important lesson one could derive from the Pilgrim experience than this?" What if Bill and Hillary Clinton had been exposed to these lessons in school? Do you realize what we face in next year's election is the equivalent of people who want to set up these original collectivists communes that didn't work, with nobody having incentive to do anything except get on the government dole somehow because the people running the government want that kind of power. So the Pilgrims decided to thank God for all of their good fortune. And that's Thanksgiving. And read George Washington's first Thanksgiving address and count the number of times God is mentioned and how many times he's thanked. None of this is taught today. It should be. Have a happy Thanksgiving, folks. You deserve it. Do what you can to be happy, and especially do what you can to be thankful, because in this country you have more reasons than you've ever stopped to consider.

We were the invaders. The Indians are minding their own business. We were incompetent idiots. We didn't know how to feed ourselves. So they came along and showed us how, and that's what Thanksgiving is all about. Now, he says nothing about the Constitution in his Thanksgiving proclamation, because he's got a problem with it ... Every cliche that is wrong about Thanksgiving shows up in his proclamation      Obama did acknowledge George Washington, who declared the first nationally recognized Thanksgiving when the Constitution was enacted . Limbaugh didn't further clarify why the document from 1787 required a mention, even though the holiday's roots are generally traced back to at least 150 years earlier and it wouldn't become a regular national holiday until more than 75 years later.      [Obama] said that Thanksgiving is about the Indians saving us, with their agriculture and everything else. The true story of Thanksgiving is socialism failed. Of course we showed them gratitude! We shared our bounty with them, not because we didn't know how to make it. It was because we first failed as socialists. Only when we turned capitalists did we have plenty. The Indians didn't teach us capitalism.      Limbaugh punctuated his pre-Thanksgiving show with shots at Native Americans, joking that Obama had said their "rich culture continues to add to our Nation's heritage ... at their casinos and on their reservations." He immediately made it clear he was making that last bit up.      The host also argued that more people have been killed from lung cancer , "thanks to the Indian-invented custom of smoking tobacco," than from the arrival of Europeans and their wars and diseases. "Where are our reparations?" asked the well-known cigar smoker.      And despite his problems evaluating the recent Manhattan real estate market , Limbaugh had another look at the one from 1626 . "We got shafted when we bought Manhattan," he claimed, saying that European settlers initially paid a Long Island tribe that didn't own the land, then had to repurchase it from the actual owners. "We got scammed ... we got hosed ... we paid for Manna-hata twice because a bunch of Native Americans scammed us."      On this day of thanksgiving, it is appropriate that we recall the first Thanksgiving, celebrated in the autumn of 1621. After surviving a bitter winter, the Pilgrims planted and harvested a bountiful crop. After the harvest they gathered their families together and joined in celebration and prayer with the Native Americans who had taught them so much. Clearly our forefathers were thankful not only for the material well-being of their harvest but for this abundance of goodwill as well.      A beloved American tradition, Thanksgiving Day offers us the opportunity to focus our thoughts on the grace that has been extended to our people and our country. This spirit brought together the newly arrived Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe -- who had been living and thriving around Plymouth, Massachusetts for thousands of years -- in an autumn harvest feast centuries ago. This Thanksgiving Day, we reflect on the compassion and contributions of Native Americans, whose skill in agriculture helped the early colonists survive, and whose rich culture continues to add to our Nation's heritage. We also pause our normal pursuits on this day and join in a spirit of fellowship and gratitude for the year's bounties and blessings.      Thanksgiving Day is a time each year, dating back to our founding, when we lay aside the troubles and disagreements of the day and bow our heads in humble recognition of the providence bestowed upon our Nation. Amidst the uncertainty of a fledgling experiment in democracy, President George Washington declared the first Thanksgiving in America, recounting the blessings of tranquility, union, and plenty that shined upon our young country. In the dark days of the Civil War when the fate of our Union was in doubt, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a Thanksgiving Day, calling for "the Almighty hand" to heal and restore our Nation.      In confronting the challenges of our day, we must draw strength from the resolve of previous generations who faced their own struggles and take comfort in knowing a brighter day has always dawned on our great land. As we stand at the close of one year and look to the promise of the next, we lift up our hearts in gratitude to God for our many blessings, for one another, and for our Nation. This Thanksgiving Day, we remember that the freedoms and security we enjoy as Americans are protected by the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces. These patriots are willing to lay down their lives in our defense, and they and their families deserve our profound gratitude for their service and sacrifice.      This harvest season, we are also reminded of those experiencing the pangs of hunger or the hardship of economic insecurity. Let us return the kindness and generosity we have seen throughout the year by helping our fellow citizens weather the storms of our day.      As Americans gather for the time-honored Thanksgiving Day meal, let us rejoice in the abundance that graces our tables, in the simple gifts that mark our days, in the loved ones who enrich our lives, and in the gifts of a gracious God. Let us recall that our forebears met their challenges with hope and an unfailing spirit, and let us resolve to do the same.      NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 2010, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of the United States to come together -- whether in our homes, places of worship, community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and neighbors -- to give thanks for all we have received in the past year, to express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and to share our bounty with others.      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth. |||||	– Don't expect Rush Limbaugh to sit down with any Native Americans to celebrate Thanksgiving. He's miffed they "scammed us" when they sold us Manhattan because they didn't own it to begin with. And to top it off, European settlers were hardly "idiots" saved by "compassionate" Indians, as President Obama painted them in his Thanksgiving proclamation, Limbaugh scoffs. The true tale of the holiday is "failed socialism"—apparently because "collectivist" settlers shared too much of their bounty among their communities and suffered hardships as a result, he claims. "We shared our bounty" with the Indians "not because we didn't know how to make it. It was because we first failed as socialists. Only when we turned capitalists did we have plenty," he said. Earlier he viciously quipped that Native Americans "continue to add to our nation's heritage ... at their casinos and on their reservations." For more on his remarks, click here.
summarize: Here’s an interesting political conundrum: The federal government could re-open tomorrow. But it would end John Boehner’s speakership.      There are currently 19 House Republicans on the record in support of a “clean” continuing resolution, meaning one without any other extraneous measures — like the defunding or delaying of Obamcare — attached. Combine those nineteen with the 200 Democrats who would almost certainly vote as a bloc in support of such a clean CR and you get 219 votes — a majority of the House. The bill has already been passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate, so it would go to straight to President Obama who would sign it. Shutdown over. Easy.      Except one little thing, which is that the only way for that scenario to happen is for Boehner to allow a piece of legislation supported by roughly 7 percent of his conference to come to the House floor for a vote. And, doing that on something as high-profile as a government shutdown/Obamacare, would almost certainly signal either the symbolic (or maybe even practical) end of his speakership.      Why? First a bit of context.      On Jan. 1, 2013, Boehner put the deal to avert the fiscal cliff on the House floor. It passed with 257 votes — just 85 of which came from Republicans. Later that month, the House voted in favor of relief money for Hurricane Sandy victims although just 49 Republicans supported it. Then in February, the House re-authorized the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) with just 87 Republican votes. In all three cases, a minority of Republican House Members backed the measure.      So, there is both precedent and peril in allowing a vote on a measure that lacks the support of a majority of the House Republican conference. Precedent in that Boehner has done it before — although never with so few Republicans “yes” votes guaranteed — and peril in that, well, Boehner has done this sort of thing before.      Remember that Boehner came within a hair’s breadth of being forced into a second ballot vote to be re-elected Speaker at the start of the 113th Congress, and that was before the Sandy relief and VAWA votes. To allow another measure — and this one that not only deals with a government shutdown but also Obamacare — to pass with almost exclusively Democratic votes would be a bridge too far for lots and lots of House Republicans. There could well be an immediate revolt against Boehner and, even if there wasn’t, any chance that he would remain on as Speaker in 2015 (assuming Republicans hold the majority) would be gone.      Boehner knows that reality all too well. Without some sort of major concession — something he can go to his GOP conference with and say, “See, they gave in on this” — it would be political suicide for him to bring up a clean continuing resolution supported by less than 10 percent of his conference.      So, the government will remain shut unless that sort of deal is made or Boehner decides that he’s had enough of being Speaker.      Fixbits:      President Obama met with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the gathering called “cordial but unproductive.”      The National Park service declined the RNC’s offer to keep the World War II Memorial open.      In the Virginia governor’s race, Democrat Terry McAuliffe will release a new ad tying Republican Ken Cuccinelli II (R) to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).      Newark Mayor Cory Booker raised nearly $2.9 million during the latest fundraising period for his Senate campaign, an impressive haul.      Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) said Wednesday that the standoff in Congress that triggered a federal government shutdown is symptomatic of a larger problem that won’t be solved until “structural changes are made.”      Cruz felt the heat from his Senate Republican colleagues.

Must-reads:      “John Boehner, between a rock and a hard place on shutdown and debt limit” — Paul Kane, Washington Post      “Focus shifts to looming debt-ceiling deadline as shutdown talks at White House go nowhere” — Zachary A. Goldfarb, Washington Post ||||| WASHINGTON — It was not enough for Senator Harry Reid to just dismiss Republican offers as “vexatious” or “kid’s stuff” or “one cockamamie, can’t-pass idea after another.” He called the White House and asked it to issue a veto threat, which it promptly did.      It was not enough for Mr. Reid, the majority leader, to accuse his counterpart in the House, Speaker John A. Boehner, of being dragged around by a tribe of rogue “banana Republicans.” He leaked a series of e-mails between their offices in an attempt to humiliate the speaker.      With Congress locked in an intractable budget dispute that kept the federal government shut down for a second day on Wednesday, Mr. Reid is not only acting as the public face of the no-compromise posture of Democrats on Capitol Hill, he is the power behind the scenes driving a hard-line strategy that the White House and Congressional Democrats are hoping will force Republicans to crack.      His tactics have been unapologetically aggressive, even when measured by the fast and loose rules of engagement in a political climate so bitterly polarized.      Continue reading the main story Video      Advisers and Senate colleagues say that Mr. Reid, of Nevada, who at 73 is more wily and scrappy than his stooped posture and shuffling walk suggest, is animated and outraged to a degree they have rarely seen in his 25 years in the Senate. And unlike previous high-stakes budget talks — when he was eclipsed by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader — Mr. Reid is now in command.      Though he has faced seven years of Republican attempts to frustrate his agenda at every turn, this latest fight, which he believes could have been stopped if the party’s leaders had only stood up to their more junior members, has convinced him that he has no viable Republican partners on either side of the Capitol.      Mr. Reid’s passion and pique come from his conclusion that this fight is about something more fundamental than spending resolutions.      “He is not going to let this crisis make us give away something that is part of what we believe in,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and a member of Mr. Reid’s leadership team. “He feels passionately that if we allow our country to be run by hostage-taking — ‘I feel passionately about an issue, and I’m going to shut down the government unless I get my way’ — it is bad for today, it’s bad for tomorrow, it’s bad for democracy.”      Mr. Reid’s tendency to speak without inhibition or filter has created no shortage of complications and may have so alienated Republicans that they see no incentive to work with him. On Wednesday, Republican press offices, including Mr. Boehner’s, and Tea Party groups circulated remarks from Mr. Reid in which he appeared to be dismissive of cancer-stricken children. (In fact, he was ineloquently making a point about the need to fund the entire government, not just parts that Republicans have selected for special appropriations bills as a way to ameliorate the effects of the shutdown.)      Mr. Reid’s strategy to break Republicans depends on keeping his caucus unified, which is no small feat in a party as Balkanized as the Democrats can be. His colleagues said he understood all along that the only way Democrats could come out on top in a spectacle as politically harmful as a government shutdown was if they held together. With negotiations continuing, Mr. Reid declined to be interviewed.      So far, he is the only leader in Congress not to lose any of his members as the pressure rises. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, are both facing resistance from Republicans who represent states that have a mix of conservative and liberal voters. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House, has also lost some members of her conference who hail from Republican-leaning districts and are reluctant to appear as if they are siding with President Obama.      Photo      “From the first time we talked about this, he said, ‘We are not giving in,’ ” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who is one of Mr. Reid’s top lieutenants. “He had an instinctive understanding that this would work as long as Democrats didn’t fall for the bait. We haven’t, and we won’t.”      But Mr. Reid, an amateur boxer in his youth, is more than a smart strategic thinker, Mr. Schumer added: “Harry is a tough guy, and if you cross him he won’t forget it.”      Mr. Reid rebuffed Mr. McConnell last week after the Republican leader called him and urged him to try to strike a compromise with Mr. Boehner. His firm answer was no. Though Mr. Reid did meet with Mr. Boehner, Mr. McConnell and Ms. Pelosi on Wednesday at the White House, he had initially persuaded the president not to hold a similar meeting last week because he was concerned it would appear too accommodating.      Mr. Reid, no one’s idea of a polished, pressed and scripted Washington politician, seems to relish playing such an aggressive hand. At no point was this more evident than this week, when Mr. Reid’s office leaked a trove of e-mails between its staff and Mr. Boehner’s to Politico, a Web site and newspaper devoted to political coverage.      The release of the e-mails, sanctioned by Mr. Reid, was an attempt to embarrass Mr. Boehner for publicly supporting the elimination of health care subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs despite the fact that he and his advisers had privately negotiated a deal to preserve those benefits. The deal later fell apart. The move infuriated Mr. Boehner’s aides, who said they found it particularly destructive coming in the middle of a policy fight that will ultimately have to involve Republicans in some way.      “I’m sure he’s very proud of himself,” Kevin Smith, Mr. Boehner’s communications director, said of Mr. Reid.      Those close to him say that when Mr. Reid says things about Republicans like “they have lost their minds,” he means it. He has stood on his podium on the Senate floor every day this week and vowed to not negotiate with Tea Party “anarchists” and “extremists,” despite advice from his advisers that the word “unreasonable” polls better with voters.      Mr. Reid’s upbringing in tiny Searchlight, Nev., where he grew up in a shack, is never far from his mind, even when he is speaking from his mahogany desk in the Senate chamber.      “He is unique in this city,” said Jim Margolis, a longtime adviser. “And you see it in so many different ways. Is he the best TV talking head? No. He’d be the first to tell you that. Should he smile more? Yes. Should he say goodbye on the phone when he’s done talking to you? Probably. But those are things you’d assume are part and parcel of a polished figure in Washington. That is not Harry Reid.” ||||| A tweet from Glenn Beck’s account responded to news this week that House Speaker John Boehner pushed for exemptions for lawmakers and staffers for Obamacare.      “If you thought John Boehner was fighting for you, you were lied to.

(The Washington Post)      In Play's Jackie Kucinich looks at key players in the fight over the budget -- and why they have every reason not to come to the negotiating table. (The Washington Post)      House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has at his disposal the political tools to reopen the government at a moment’s notice. But he would have to rely on an uneasy coalition of Democrats and a few moderate Republicans to pass a bill to fund federal agencies and national parks for the next six weeks. Such a move could provide a political escape hatch for Republicans who have been shouldering much of the public blame for the shutdown.      But Boehner is stuck.      A host of dynamics in the GOP have forced him to align himself with a camp of hard-core conservatives who, for much of the past three years, have made his life miserable.      Since Boehner became speaker in 2011, these lawmakers, most of them elected in 2010, have challenged his leadership and questioned his conservatism. They have defied him on one big vote after another, often throwing the House and sometimes the country into disarray.      Boehner’s unyielding position on the six-week government funding bill, which the Senate passed, is a testament to the power of that conservative bloc and a concession to its members. The insurgents are now his palace guards.      The speaker’s closest allies say he cannot afford to defy those on his right flank by ending the shutdown with largely Democratic votes.      Doing so would undermine his position among his members going into negotiations with the White House and Democrats over raising the federal debt limit, which Boehner and his leadership team regard as more critical than the impasse on government funding. Coming up empty-handed for conservatives on both would have broader ramifications.      Republicans who support the speaker argue that if he is going to antagonize the conservatives in his caucus, it would make more sense to do so on the debt-ceiling debate rather than on the funding of the government.      As painful as the government shutdown may be to some, the Treasury Department’s ability to use special measures to manage the nation’s finances will run out Oct. 17, setting up a potential default on the $16.7 trillion debt that would wreak far more havoc on the global financial markets than the shuttering of federal agencies and national parks.      Within the increasingly right-leaning GOP caucus, Boehner might survive one big vote that relied heavily on Democratic support. But two important votes — on the government funding and the debt ceiling — with mostly Democratic backing would leave the already embattled speaker on political life support.      The result is that Boehner has thrown in with the most conservative Republican lawmakers. A few dozen of them have urged holding up the government funding legislation to extract concessions from Democrats on President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.      Leaving a nearly 90-minute meeting Wednesday evening with Obama and congressional leaders, Boehner repeated his demand that Senate Democrats appoint negotiators to try to compromise on government funding and provisions of the health-care law, commonly known as Obamacare.      View Graphic Who supports a ‘clean’ spending bill?      “All we’re asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare,” Boehner told reporters.      Democrats are furious about Boehner’s refusal to abandon the “Weird Caucus,” as Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has dubbed the House conservatives.      “John Boehner cannot take yes for an answer,” Reid said moments after the speaker left the White House.      Boehner’s hard line has been surprising to friends as well as foes, especially the conservatives — as many as two dozen of whom once plotted to overthrow him as speaker.      “We’re more united in the conference now than we’ve ever been,” said Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.), a second-term lawmaker. Eighteen months ago, the speaker “couldn’t pick me out of a lineup,” Farenthold said. “He now blows me kisses.”      The blown kiss is one of the speaker’s trademark gestures, delivered to allies and journalists alike with the same sentiment of snapping a towel in a locker room.      Reopening the government by passing the Senate’s version of the funding bill, with no language to curtail the health-care law, would infuriate conservatives such as Farenthold but could be done quickly.      There are 200 Democrats in the House, and Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) pledged Wednesday that “all of ’em” would vote for a bill to fund the government at current levels through mid-November. At least 18 Republicans have vowed to support such a funding resolution, giving a majority of House members support for the Democratic plan.      Boehner’s leadership team has on three occasions this year watched the Democrats effectively become the ruling party by passing key legislation that most Republicans opposed.      On New Year’s Day, the House approved a tax package that preserved lower rates for all workers except the rich, securing just 85 Republican votes, or 40 percent of Boehner’s caucus. A few weeks later, just 49 Republicans supported federal disaster aid for Mid-Atlantic states ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, and in late February, 87 Republicans supported a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.      Those votes left Boehner in as weak a position as any speaker in modern times. By August, he and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) were counseling their rank and file against trying to scuttle the government funding bill, which expired at midnight Monday, the end of the fiscal year. The leaders wanted to pivot to the fight on the debt ceiling, and they kept crafting options that would transfer some of that political energy from the government funding fight to the debt-limit clash.      “They got blown away,” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), one of the agitators against Boehner who opposed the speaker’s reelection bid.      Faced with the rebellion, Boehner joined with the Huelskamp crowd and kept sending the Senate bills that would completely defund or delay the health-care law, knowing it would lead to a shutdown. Along the way, support diminished among Republicans for approving a “clean” resolution — one that wouldn’t weaken the health-care law.      According to lawmakers and senior aides, there may have been 170 GOP votes to approve a clean plan three weeks ago, but now maybe half as many would vote for such a bill — leaving Boehner back where he was on New Year’s Eve.      Now that Boehner has survived several days of the shutdown, his friends say there is no point in moving a clean funding resolution.      They said the shutdown is leverage in talks with Obama and the Democrats about lifting the debt ceiling. The two issues have bled together, they said, adding that reopening the government would weaken the speaker’s hand.      “Why in the world would you do that? You know, that doesn’t encourage anything. That’s basically at this point a surrender to the Democratic position,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a close Boehner ally.      It’s the worst-kept secret that one of the keys to Boehner’s persistence is that he has a position that almost no one else wants.      “He has the toughest job in Washington,” said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), one of the speaker’s most loyal foot soldiers. |||||	– The government shutdown is dragging on thanks in no small part to two men: John Boehner and Harry Reid. Boehner, the Washington Post points out, could almost certainly pass a clean CR and end the shutdown if he wanted to—but he'd have to rely on a coalition of mostly Democrats and a handful of GOP moderates (19 are on record as supporting it). Doing that would weaken his hand in debt ceiling negotiations, blow up his uneasy alliance with the Tea Party, and probably cost him his speaker gig. Reid, meanwhile, is in take-no-prisoners mode; in a cutthroat move yesterday, he leaked email conversations he'd had with Boehner about preserving health care subsidies for Congress, the New York Times reports. That had the predictable effect of angering conservatives, and led Glenn Beck to brand Boehner a "lying thief," according to Politico. Reid has long believed Democrats will get their best deal by holding out in a shutdown. His staff quashed White House talks last week, the Wall Street Journal reports, and he didn't exactly support yesterday's session. "It's not my meeting," he told reporters. Afterward, he said, "We're through playing these little games. … We're locked in tight on ObamaCare." Of course, these two aren't the only ones feeling the heat: Ted Cruz is under fire as well.
summarize: Jefferson Superior Court Judge Michael Hensley explained his decision to deny a warrant request on a stalking charge more than a week after an ongoing domestic abuse case turned fatal.            Hensley issued a statement Monday concerning the stalking case filed against Anthony Russell just days before officials believe he killed his wife before killing himself.            Officials found Anthony Russell, 51, of Deputy, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Oct. 7 in the 800 block of West Second Street. Less than two hours later, police and the Jefferson County Coroner found 44-year-old Laura Russell dead from multiple stab wounds at the Russell residence in Deputy.            Officers went to the home in the 6000 block of North County Road 933-W to notify Laura Russell of her estranged husband’s death.            The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department is investigating Laura Russell’s death as a homicide.            The two deaths came just days before Anthony Russell was due to appear in Jefferson Superior Court for an initial hearing on a felony charge of stalking after allegedly violating a court-ordered no-contact order with his wife.            Prosecutors requested a warrant be issued in the stalking case, but Hensley denied the request and issued a summons for Anthony Russell to appear in court following a three-day holiday weekend.            Hensley’s decision to summons the man to court caused some to question why a warrant wasn’t issued sooner.            In a written statement, Hensley explained the legal procedure behind his decision to deny the warrant request and instead issue a summons to court. His statement in its entirety:            “Out of respect for the family of Laura Russell I have waited until after her funeral before making any comment on her tragic death. I express my deepest condolences to her loved ones. I feel horrible about her death and realize the regret I express and information I provide in this statement do not bring her back.”            “Still, I feel that her family and the public at large deserve to know what procedurally happened. I did not issue a warrant in this case for the immediate arrest of her estranged husband. My role is not to simply grant all warrants without review. Certain legal standards must be met before I can issue a warrant. The reason I did not issue a warrant in this case is that there was not sufficient probable cause. Without probable cause I do not have the power to issue a warrant. I made what I thought to be the correct legal decision. Obviously, I made a decision that had the most tragic result possible.            “I made my decision with full knowledge of the dangers of domestic violence situations. I represented many victims of domestic violence before I was elected Judge, including volunteering as an attorney when victims were unable to pay my fee. I am well aware of the danger in these situations – yet the fact that an elementary school teacher killed his wife and then himself is still hard for me to believe.            “Judges make difficult decisions every day. My goal is to make sure I have every piece of evidence the law allows me to consider before making a final decision on a warrant request. When I do not find probable cause on a warrant request, I will now issue an order for a hearing to be held on the same day as the warrant request. I am hopeful the new procedure prevents a similar tragedy in the future.            “If you or someone you love is being abused there are many people in the community ready to help. Visit the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence at www.icadvinc.org or call the 24-Hour Hotline 800-332-7385.”            Jefferson County Prosecutor Chad Lewis wrote in an email to The Madison Courier that he hopes the judge’s procedural change will prevent tragedy in future cases.            “The prosecutor’s office welcomes any procedure changes the judge is willing to make in an effort to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. The judge acknowledging that court procedure could help prevent another tragic decision is a step forward to combat domestic violence and aid in public safety. We look forward to being involved in that discussion and have several suggested changes.            “As the judge describes in his comments, it is his exclusive decision as to whether to issue a warrant, and his subjective decision as to whether he believes there is sufficient probable cause.            “In Indiana, probable cause for arrest exists where facts and circumstances within an officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested. It is a reasonable ground for belief in certain alleged facts. It is more than mere suspicion, but it does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it is a low standard.            “In filing the criminal charges and seeking an arrest warrant, the prosecutor’s office believed there to be probable cause that a crime had been committed. Commencing a prosecution is not permitted by most ethical standards unless the prosecutor believes probable cause exists to believe that a crime has been committed and that the defendant has committed it. This requirement is not considered lightly. The magnitude of the charging decision does not dictate that it be made timidly, but it does dictate that it should be made wisely and with the exercise of sound professional judgment. It was our office’s professional judgment that probable cause did exist.            “The judge’s October 6 order denying the State’s request for a warrant does not mention that he was not finding probable cause. Based on the judge’s letter to the Madison Courier, he did not agree with the Prosecutor’s office and made his own judgments and what he thought to be the correct legal decision. While we disagree with the court’s decision, we must respect the judicial system, the Court, and its judicial function.”            “The prosecutor’s office will continue our responsibility to seek justice, which can only be achieved by the representation and presentation of the truth. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that the guilty are held accountable, that the innocent are protected from unwarranted harm, and the rights of all participants – particularly victims of crime – are respected. So we will continue to seek arrest warrants in cases of domestic violence and intimate partner violence.” ||||| DEPUTY, Ind. -- An Indiana judge has admitted his decision to deny a warrant request had “the most tragic result possible” after a man accused of stalking his wife allegedly killed her days later, reports the Madison Courier.      Police say they found Deputy, Indiana man Anthony Russell, 51, dead of an self-inflicted gunshot wound Oct. 7 before finding his estranged wife, 44-year-old Laura Russell, dead of multiple stab wounds in her home.      Days before the killing, prosecutors had requested a warrant be issued for Anthony Russell’s arrest on felony charges that he stalked the woman and violated a no-contact order, the paper reports. But Jefferson County Superior Court judge Michael Hensley denied the request and instead ordered Anthony Russell to appear in Jefferson Superior Court following a three-day holiday weekend to answer to the charges.      Both Anthony and Laura Russell were dead before the court date.      According to WHAS, police say Anthony Russell violated the protective order several times — waiting for his estranged wife outside a restaurant and her daughter’s school and following her to her gym — and each time Laura Russell reported it to law enforcement.      “I think she tried all the avenues that she could to stay safe,” Jefferson County Sheriff John Wallace told the station.      After public outcry, Hensley issued a statement to the paper explaining that he did not have enough probable cause to issue a warrant.      “I made what I thought to be the correct legal decision,” Hensley said. “Obviously, I made a decision that had the most tragic result possible.”      He said he made the ruling with “full knowledge of the danger of domestic violence situations.”      Hensley said he will now change his procedure to hold a hearing on the same day as the warrant request when he doesn’t find sufficient probable cause. He offered his condolences to the woman’s family.      “I feel horrible about her death and realize the regret I express and information I provide in this statement do not bring her back,” he wrote. |||||	– Anthony Russell allegedly violated a no-contact order and was due to appear in court in Indiana on a felony charge of stalking his estranged wife, Laura. Laura, 44, had reported to police multiple instances of finding Anthony, 51, waiting for her and following her, CBS reports. Prosecutors requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest, but on Oct. 6 Judge Michael Hensley declined to do so, choosing instead to simply issue a summons for Anthony Russell to appear in court days later, after a long holiday weekend. The day after that ruling, authorities found Anthony Russell dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound; when they went to the Russell home to inform Laura, they found her dead of multiple stab wounds. They believe Anthony killed her and then himself. On Monday, Hensley issued a statement acknowledging that "the most tragic result possible" came of his ruling, and explained why he made it, the Madison Courier reports. "My role is not to simply grant all warrants without review," Hensley said. "Certain legal standards must be met before I can issue a warrant. The reason I did not issue a warrant in this case is that there was not sufficient probable cause. Without probable cause I do not have the power to issue a warrant. I made what I thought to be the correct legal decision." He added that he fully understands the risks involved in domestic abuse situations, but still found "the fact that an elementary school teacher killed his wife and then himself" difficult to believe. In the future, he says, he will issue an order for a hearing on the same day as the warrant request if he can't find probable cause to grant the warrant request. "I am hopeful the new procedure prevents a similar tragedy in the future," he writes. "I feel horrible about her death and realize the regret I express and information I provide in this statement do not bring her back."
summarize: Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Sandford was dramatically arrested during a Las Vegas rally for Mr Trump      A British man has been sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison over his attempt to grab a gun in a bid to kill Donald Trump.      Michael Sandford, 20, pleaded guilty in September to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function.      He was accused of grabbing a policeman's gun at a rally in Las Vegas in order to shoot at the candidate.      His mother says "he is remorseful over what he did".      Sandford, of Dorking, Surrey, had faced up to 10 years in prison over the alleged assassination plot.      The court heard that he could be eligible for release in four months' time, at which point he will be deported to the UK.      The defence team said their client is autistic and suffers seizures and obsession-compulsion anxiety.      In the courtroom - James Cook, BBC News, Las Vegas      Michael Sandford appeared in court in orange prison garb, looking pale and slight, his ankles shackled.      He smiled as members of his family waved to him and mouthed: "I love you."      Sandford then broke down in tears as he apologised for what he had done and for taking up time and costing the taxpayer money.      "I just feel terrible about it," he said.      The judge James Mahan appeared sympathetic, telling Sandford: "I don't think you harboured malice in your heart."      His mother, Lynne Sandford, also addressed the judge, saying her son was "cherished and adored".      "It breaks my heart to see him in this environment," she said, as she appealed for a lenient sentence on the basis that her son needed treatment and the support of his family.      Image copyright PA Image caption Michael Sandford, with his mother Lynne      After Sandford was arrested, he told officers he had planned to shoot the billionaire Republican candidate.      He failed to pull the weapon from an officer's holster, the court heard.      His mother said that she had lost contact with her son after he left home to travel around the US in 2015.      He had previously shown no interest in politics, and she was unable to explain why he would want to shoot Mr Trump.      According to court documents, Sandford, who was homeless and living in the US illegally having overstayed his visa, told the Secret Service that he had driven from California to Nevada with the goal of shooting Mr Trump.      The papers detail how he had been plotting the attack for around a year and had gone to a gun range in Las Vegas the day before the attack to learn how to shoot, firing 20 rounds from a 9mm Glock pistol.      Image copyright Family Handout Image caption Sandford pleaded guilty to lesser charges in order to avoid a lengthy prison sentence      He reportedly told an officer that he had expected to die in the attack but that he also had tickets for a later Trump rally in Arizona in case he needed a second chance.      Judge James C Mahan described the incident as "a crazy stunt".      "You have a medical problem," the judge told Sandford, adding that it is "nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about."      "I don't see you as evil or a sociopath," the judge said, wishing Sandford luck as he rose to leave the courtroom. ||||| A British man was sentenced Tuesday to one year and one day in prison for two felonies stemming from his attempt to grab a Las Vegas police officer’s gun at a Donald Trump campaign rally in June.      With credit for time served and good behavior, Michael Steven Sandford, 20, faces another four months in federal custody under the sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge James Mahan.      Sandford pleaded guilty to in June to one count of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and one count of impeding and disrupting the orderly conduct of government business and official functions. As part of a plea bargain, a second firearm charge was dropped.      After serving his prison time, Sandford will be subject to three years of supervised release, though his defense attorneys expect he’ll instead be deported.      Michael Sandford, who tried to shoot Donald Trump is sentenced to 1 year & 1 day in prison @reviewjournalpic.twitter.com/XddZi0X34H — Bizuayehu Tesfaye (@bizutesfaye) December 13, 2016      Sandford was arrested June 18 at Treasure Island at the Trump rally after he attempted to grab the police officer’s firearm in what he later told investigators was an attempt to shoot and kill Trump.      Sandford had approached the officer and asked about getting Trump’s autograph. As the officer responded, Sandford grabbed his gun with both hands and unsuccessfully attempted to remove it from the holster.      ‘I JUST FEEL TERRIBLE’      No shots were fired and no one was injured in the incident.      “I feel so bad about what I did,” Sandford told the judge, his voice cracking with emotion. “I just feel terrible.”      Sandford’s mental health problems played a role in the sentence, which was less than the 1 1/2 years in prison that federal prosecutors had recommended.      Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Schiess argued in favor of a longer sentence, saying more time behind bars would help ensure Sandford is no longer a threat.      A sentencing memorandum filed by assistant federal public defender Brenda Weksler on Sandford’s behalf says he has a history of mental health problems that dates back to when he experienced hallucinations when he was 8 years old. At the time, he expressed suicidal thoughts and was hyperventilating from “hallucinations of aliens wanting to kill him,” the document says.      He also was diagnosed with autism and an obsessive compulsive disorder that led doctors to recommend that he live alone, records show.      Weksler told the court Sandford has a supportive family and understands the importance of being treated for his mental health problems.      MOTHER URGES LENIENCE      His mother, Lynne Sandford, said in court that he made a “huge error of judgment,” adding “it breaks my heart to see him in this environment.”      “He’s very remorseful for what he did,” she said.      She and other family members declined comment afterward. The mother told the Las Vegas Review-Journal they were under an exclusive contract with another media outlet and could not do other interviews Tuesday.      Mahan urged Sandford to continue getting treatment. Sandford also apologized for taking up so much of the court’s time.      “That’s why I get the big bucks,” the judge responded.      At the time of the incident, Sandford was in the U.S. illegally on a tourist visa that had expired Aug. 30, 2015. He originally visited the U.S. for about a month in January 2015 and returned later in 2015 when his grandmother rented an apartment for him in New Jersey. Sandford’s mother lost contact with him and reported him as a missing person in May 2016. They reconnected after she learned of his arrest.      During questioning, Sandford told police that he believed Trump was a “racist” and “needs to die,” according to a Secret Service report.      When a Secret Service agent questioned him about his intent in trying to grab the officer’s sidearm, Sandford responded: “To shoot and kill Trump,” it said.      Sandford had told law enforcement that he drove from California to kill Trump and was living out of his car while working odd jobs. The day before the Trump rally, Sandford went to a gun range in Las Vegas and took shooting lessons with a rented 9 mm Glock pistol.

Michael Steven Sandford, who has autism, tried to get the weapon at a Las Vegas casino where Trump was addressing supporters during the presidential campaign.      He allegedly told officers after his arrest that he planned to shoot Trump.      'They said my son intended to assassinate Donald Trump. And my world just stopped' Read more      Sandford, of Dorking, Surrey, pleaded guilty in September to charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function.      He could have faced up to 20 years in prison if he had been convicted at trial of both charges.      Judge James Mahan told him: “You have a medical problem. You should not be ashamed or embarrassed about it. You need medication.      “You’re not a hardened criminal. You’re not evil or a sociopath like a lot of people we have. I don’t think you wanted to kill anybody. This was just some crazy stunt that your mind told you to do.�?      A tearful Sandford told the court: “I know saying sorry is not enough. I really do feel awful about what I did. I wish there was some way to make things better. I have cost taxpayers so much money. I feel terrible.�?      Addressing the judge, he added: “I’m really sorry to you and the court for taking up so much time.�?      As he has already been in custody since being arrested, he is not expected to have to spend a further 12 months behind bars.            Sandford did not get hold of the gun before he was arrested, and no shots were fired.            Court documents say that Sandford told a federal agent that he drove from California to Las Vegas with a plan to kill Trump.      His UK lawyer, Saimo Chahal, QC, of Bindmans, had argued that Sandford was delusional at the time.      The court papers also stated that Sandford had gone to a gun range in Las Vegas to learn how to fire a gun, which he had not done before.      Sandford told police he had been in the US for 18 months before the incident. He was unemployed, living out of his car and in the US illegally.      As well as autism, he also has obsessive compulsive disorder, severe depression, seizures, cardiac issues and Crohn’s disease, according to his family.            His mother Lynne Sandford, who travelled to the US for the sentencing with her mother Christine and four-year-old daughter Jessica, had appealed to the judge to allow her son to serve his sentence in the UK so he could get the right psychiatric help.            The family has launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the legal costs relating to their bid to bring Sandford back to the UK to serve his sentence.            “Michael’s actions were completely out of character. He is an extremely vulnerable young man and we believe that he needs to return to the UK in order to serve his sentence,�? his mother wrote.            Until sentencing, Lynne Sandford had only seen her son once since he was arrested.            “During my visit to Las Vegas, I learned that Michael had been on suicide watch several times following numerous mental breakdowns,�? she wrote. “‘Suicide watch’ in the US involves being kept in isolation 24/7 for up to a week at a time. Other prisoners are allowed books, but these are taken away from Michael while he is in isolation. Michael isn’t even allowed toilet paper while he is in isolation.�?       |||||	– A British man who confessed to plotting to kill Donald Trump has been sentenced to a year and a day in federal custody for trying to grab a police officer's gun at a rally in Las Vegas earlier this year.

summarize: President Donald Trump wants an immigration system like Canada's or Australia's, one that's "merit-based" and ensures those entering the country can bolster the U.S. economy, not weigh it down.      "It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially," Trump said Tuesday during his speech to Congress. "Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon."      While there is general support in Washington for such a plan, however, Trump did not clarify what he envisioned by a merit-based system -- a term that could signal a compromise position with broad support or one that critics say may clamp down on even legal immigration to the U.S. even further. The White House press office did not respond to requests seeking further information.      But there are some clues as to how this system would work.      Related: In Arizona, the mandated use of E-Verify has had mixed results      Generally speaking, merit-based systems favor highly-skilled immigrants with some level of higher education.      The U.S. had a version of a merit-based system in place until 1952. At the time, applicants were selected based on the results of a literacy test. But in the 1950s, the U.S. began moving toward a family-based immigration system.      This system, which has been in place ever since, focuses on allowing spouses and relatives of U.S. citizens into the country. The U.S. also issues special visas for workers and refugees, too.      Proponents of a merit-based system say inviting the best and brightest minds into the country will make America more competitive and reduce the number of low-income immigrants relying on public benefits.      "If you decide to come to the United States immediately following college, are you more valuable than if you come a year before your retirement? Are you more valuable if you're educated than if you're not? All of those are just common sense and we're virtually the only desirable country on Earth that doesn't have a merit system," said Rep Darrell Issa, who in 2013 wrote the SKILLS bill, which sought to increase the cap on H-1B and other types of visas for highly skilled workers, among other things. That bill was passed by the House but was not passed by the Senate.      Another compromise that sought to reform both high- and low-skilled immigration was the 2013 Gang of Eight bill that passed the Senate but died in the House. After Trump's speech, Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake suggested that bill could be a "blueprint" for what the president discussed.      But there's another interpretation of merit-based systems, one that was long advocated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he was a senator. He and other advocates for restricting immigration envision a merit-based system where far fewer immigrants are admitted and efforts are made to ensure that those that do get into the country, don't compete with American workers.      Sens. Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and David Perdue, of Georgia, have proposed a bill that would cut U.S. immigration by half, by cutting back on family immigration, lowering refugee visas and ending diversity lotteries. That approach has far less support in the Senate.      In a statement Dan Stein, who is President of Federation for American Immigration Reform, a longtime Sessions ally and like-minded group, said the shift to merit-based immigration would "ensure that we can maximize the benefits of immigration while minimizing the downside."      Critics of merit-based systems say they unfairly favor wealthy immigrants and cut off a crucial supply of low-skilled workers. They also note that immigrants do not rely on public benefits as much as Trump and other conservatives claim they do.      Related: How immigrants helped save the economy of Akron, Ohio      "Family immigration has not ever been proven to be a drain on society," said Leon Fresco, former head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Immigration Litigation during President Obama's administration. "Its entire premise is that the family takes charge of the immigrant."      Those looking for insights into Trump's plan could look to Canada and Australia. Both countries use point-based systems to assess whether a person qualifies to enter the country as a skilled worker. Applicants earn points based on things like their level of education, age, work experience, ability to speak English (or in Canada, French as well) and whether they have a job waiting for them.      Canada's federal skilled worker system, for example, awards a person who has a Ph.D 25 points, while a person with a master's gets 23. If an applicant scores a total of 67 points or higher, they can qualify to immigrate to Canada as a skilled worker.      Fresco said a points-based system may seem appealing, but there is one problem: Without a job offer, once these highly skilled immigrants arrive there is no guarantee that they can get work in their respective field. "If you do it solely on points and not on if the person has a job waiting for them, then you get a lot of 'Ph.D cabdrivers,'" he said.      And focusing solely on highly skilled immigrants won't help industries like farming and construction that rely heavily on low-skilled workers. Many employers in these industries say they are struggling to find workers and it's nearly impossible to find Americans willing to fill the jobs.      Competition for workers in the agricultural industry, for example, has sent average farm worker wages up 5% in the past year, to $12 an hour, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture figures.      One of the biggest hurdles for these industries is that there aren't enough options to help low-skilled workers to legally immigrate to the U.S., said Maria Lorena Cook, a professor of comparative labor at Cornell University.      "It is precisely this lack of legal immigration options for many low-skill immigrant workers, coupled with the structural dependence of broad sectors of the U.S. economy on immigrant workers, that is responsible for the large number of undocumented immigrants in the country today," she said.      Related: Sanctuary restaurants vow to protect undocumented workers      Both Canada and Australia offer avenues for lower-skilled immigrants to enter the country as well, but these are usually dependent on the immigrant having a job offer in hand first.      Canada has a guest worker program which serves the nation's agriculture industry, for example. It also has a Provincial Nominations Program in which its provinces can petition for immigrants who have the skills, education and work experience needed there.      "We still have a lot of question marks for what [Trump's merit-based immigration system] means, but it opens the door for Congress to start having more substantive conversations that could lead to legislation that could provide a legal and stable workforce for our farmers," said Kristy Boswell, director of Congressional relations with the American Farm Bureau Federation. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Time      President Trump reacts after addressing a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 28, 2017. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, AP)      President Trump heaped new praise Friday on Canada's immigration system, which has served as a model for countries around the world because it focuses more on immigrants who can contribute to the economy than those with little more than family ties.      Trump sent out a Tweet after apparently watching a segment on Fox & Friends that featured Nick Adams, a conservative author who the book Green Card Warrior: My Quest for Legal Immigration in an Illegals' System.      During the segment, Adams spoke against "multi-culturalism" and immigrants who enter the country to "milk us," which drew a salute from Trump who described Adams' book as a "must read."      "The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia!" he wrote.      Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017      That tweet followed Trump's comments during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, when he praised the system used by Canada, Australia and many other nations during a portion of his speech that called for reforming an "outdated" legal immigration system that hurts American workers.      "Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits," Trump said. "It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class."      Canada has long used immigration as a way to drive its economic engine, and limits the relatives Canadian citizens can bring in.      About 63% of those granted legal permanent residence in Canada — the final step before becoming citizens — are admitted for their economic skills, with only 24% admitted based on having family members living in the country. The U.S. system is reversed: 63% of green cards are given to immigrants with family connections, and only 13% given based on economic reasons.      Canada was also the first country to use a point system to grade economic immigrants — a 100-point scale introduced in the 1960s that rewards foreigners with PhDs and extensive work experience in specialized fields. It became increasingly popular in the 2000s, as countries that included Australia, Denmark, Japan and the United Kingdom adopted versions of it.      "It was very trendy," said Meghan Benton, a senior policy analyst at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.      Applicants are given a score on a 100-point scale, with points awarded in six categories:      • 28 maximum points for language skills. The more fluent they are in English and French, Canada's two official languages, the more points they get.      • 25 points for education — 5 for a high school diploma, 19 for a two-year college degree, 25 for a PhD.      • 15 maximum points for work experience — the more skilled the job, and the more years spent doing it, the more points.      • 12 maximum points for age — the younger the applicant, the more points awarded.      • 10 points maximum if they have a current job offer from a Canadian employer.      • 10 points maximum for "adaptability," which includes things like family ties to Canadians or past visits to the country.      Those who score 67 points or higher are eligible to immigrate. Immediate relatives of Canadian citizens do not go through the grading process.      Read more:      Benton said the formula has changed over the years, as Canada has recently put more emphasis on foreigners with standing job offers. Canada and others countries, she said, realized that simply admitting people with PhDs wasn't an economic cure-all, since many couldn't find jobs in their fields and were forced to do work far below their education levels.      "You had scientists working as taxi drivers," she said. "Classic brain waste."      The country also made a major revision in 2015, when it allowed Canadian provinces to sponsor immigrants based on labor shortages. The goal was to tie the system more closely to local demands.      The question in the U.S. now is how much Trump wants to emulate Canada's system. "We've been discussing here exactly what he means," Benton said.      Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration, interpreted Trump's comments as a call to shift away from an immigration system that places such a high priority on family-linked migration — allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor not just spouses and children, but also extended family members.      Beck said the U.S. also allows in too many refugees and foreigners chosen through the diversity visa program, which allows 50,000 people to enter the U.S. each year from under-represented countries, mostly from Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. That amounts to less than 5% of the 1.2 million immigrants admitted to the U.S. in 2015.      "He's very clearly saying we should stop importing poverty," Beck said. "He didn't use that term. But he's saying that we're going to stop bringing in people who do not meet some criteria of merit."      Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a group that advocates for immigrants in the U.S., said Trump was clearly embracing a proposal by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to cut all legal immigration in half. She said Cotton's proposal, and Trump's apparent embrace of that model, show what their true end goal is.      "Many Republicans have been trying to hide behind this veneer of, 'We're not against all immigrants, we're just concerned with illegal immigration,'" Martínez-de-Castro said. "They're trying to eviscerate all of it."

"The merit-based system is the way to go," Trump tweeted after watching a story about immigration on Fox & Friends. It's unclear exactly to what extent Trump wants the US to adopt the Canadian model, and the White House declined to clarify his comments on the matter, according to CNN. "He's very clearly saying we should stop importing poverty," says the president of a group that supports limiting immigration. But immigration advocates say that while "merit-based" immigration sounds good, it can be used as a tool to drastically reduce all legal immigration, especially the low-skilled workers necessary for farming and more. Canada adopted an immigration system in the 1960s that awards prospective immigrants points for education, language skills, work experience, and more. The result is that most of Canada's immigrants are there for economic reasons. Meanwhile, most legal immigrants in the US are here because of family connections. Also unlike in the US, immigration is widely popular with Canadians, the New York Times reports. And Canada plans to take in far more immigrants, proportionally speaking, than the US in the coming year. A version of Canada's system has already been adopted by Japan, Denmark, Australia, and the UK.

summarize: President Obama addressed the nation Tuesday regarding the government shutdown, telling Congress to take a vote on a continuing resolution to end the government shutdown. (The Washington Post)      President Obama addressed the nation Tuesday regarding the government shutdown, telling Congress to take a vote on a continuing resolution to end the government shutdown. (The Washington Post)      President Obama, declaring that he is “not budging” on his demand for a debt-limit increase without partisan strings attached, warned Tuesday that there are “no magic bullets” to avoid a devastating default if the ceiling is not raised, and he challenged House Republicans who believe otherwise to go on record by voting on the matter.      If a debt-ceiling increase fails “and we do end up defaulting,” Obama said in an afternoon news conference, “I think voters should know exactly who voted not to pay our bills, so that they can be responsible for the consequences that come with it.”      Shortly afterward, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) complained to reporters that Obama was demanding “unconditional surrender” by Republicans before he would talk to them. Speaking hours after he and Obama talked on the phone to reiterate their positions, Boehner said he was “disappointed that the president refuses to negotiate.”      He insisted that the House will not vote to reopen the government or raise the federal debt limit without unspecified concessions by Obama to curtail federal spending.      “There’s going to be a negotiation here,” Boehner said. “We can’t raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what’s driving us to borrow more money and to live beyond our means.”      Graphic House Republicans have proposed funding that amounts to about one-third of discretionary funding. See the bills here.      Obama used his appearance in the White House briefing room to forcefully state his case that the Republican-controlled House should hold a vote on a short-term spending bill that would immediately end a partial government shutdown, now in its eighth day.      “Let’s stop the excuses,” Obama said. “Let’s take a vote in the House. Let’s end this shutdown right now.”      [Click here for the latest updates on the shutdown.]      Obama said the House also should allow members to vote on increasing the debt limit, because a U.S. default on its debt would “irresponsible,” enormously costly and potentially catastrophic for the U.S. and global economy.      He said a default could “permanently increase our borrowing costs,” adding to deficits and the debt instead of decreasing them. “There’s nothing fiscally responsible about that,” he said.      Obama stressed that he was willing to negotiate with the GOP after threats to the economy were lifted.      “I am happy to talk with him and other Republicans about anything,” Obama said after a phone conversation Tuesday morning with Boehner. “I also told him that having such a conversation, talks, negotiations, shouldn’t require hanging the threats of a government shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the American people.”      “No American president would deal with a foreign leader like this,” he said. “We shouldn’t be dealing this way here in Washington.”      In response to questions, Obama acknowledged that he was “tempted” to accept piecemeal House Republican bills to fund parts of the government in order to “solve at least some of the problems” caused by the shutdown, which began Oct. 1. But he said a “shotgun approach like that” responds only to areas where the Republicans are “feeling political pressure,” leaving less visible programs unfunded.      “You don’t do a piecemeal approach like that when you’re dealing with a government shutdown,” he said.      On the debt ceiling, he said, Republicans now are “aware of the fact that I’m not budging when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States.”      Obama said he has tried all year to negotiate with Republicans on the budget but did not achieve success.      “We’ve been talking all kinds of business,” he said. “What we haven’t been able to get is serious positions from the Republicans that would actually allow us to solve core differences.”      Obama urged Americans not to be complacent about the threat of default.      “As reckless as a government shutdown is, the economic shutdown caused by America defaulting would be dramatically worse,” he said.      “Even though people can see and feel the effects of the government shutdown, there are still some people out there who don’t believe default is a real thing.”      Contrary to what some supposedly business-oriented Republicans say, Obama declared, a default would be “a big deal.” He added: “There’s no business person out there who thinks this wouldn’t be a big deal.”      Saying otherwise “is irresponsible,” Obama said. “It is out of touch with reality.”      The president also ruled out using the 14th Amendment to unilaterally raise the debt limit. He said inviting “legal controversy” about the U.S. Treasury’s authority to issue debt would mean that “the damage would have been done” even if the action were found constitutional.      “There are no magic bullets here,” Obama said.      In opening remarks at the news conference, Obama said: “The last time that the tea party Republicans flirted with the idea of default, two years ago, markets plunged, business and consumer confidence plunged, America’s credit rating was downgraded for the first time.” Actually permitting the government to default on its debt, he said, quoting business leaders and economists, “would be . . . ‘insane, catastrophic, chaos’ — these are some of the more polite words.”      Obama made the comments as House Republican leaders pressed demands for negotiations with Senate Democrats and Obama over bills to fund the government and raise the debt limit, but declined to lay out what they are seeking in the proposed talks.      Speaking to reporters earlier Tuesday after his weekly meeting with House Republicans, Boehner charged that “by refusing to negotiate,” Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) “are putting our country on a pretty dangerous path.” Obama has rejected Republican provisions to curtail or delay his health-care law as part of a short-term government funding bill and has demanded a debt-ceiling increase without “partisan” attachments.      “Listen, there’s never been a president in our history that did not negotiate over the debt limit,” Boehner said. “Never. Not once. As a matter of fact, President Obama negotiated with me over the debt limit in 2011. He also negotiated with the Blue Dog Democrats to raise the debt in ceiling in 2010. So the way to resolve this is to sit down and have a conversation to resolve our differences.”      But Boehner would not specify what he wants in negotiations with the president. In response to questions, he declined to say whether he would support a short-term increase of the debt ceiling or to spell out the level of spending cuts he would support.      “I’m not drawing any lines in the sand,” Boehner said. “There’s no boundaries here. There’s nothing on the table. There’s nothing off the table. I’m trying to do everything I can to bring people together and to have a conversation.”      In a brief news conference late in the afternoon, Boehner said he agrees with Obama “that we should pay our bills” and avoid a default. But he argued that debt-ceiling increases have been used in the past to negotiate “significant policy changes that reduce spending and put us on a saner fiscal path.”      He added: “This isn’t about me, and frankly it’s not about Republicans. It’s about saving the future for our kids and grandkids.”      “What the president said today was if there was unconditional surrender by Republicans, he’ll sit down and talk to us,” Boehner said. That’s not the way our government works.”      In a rare gathering on the Senate floor Tuesday, senior senators implored both parties to come together to reopen the government and increase the debt limit.      “It is time for us, members of this august body, to stand before the American people,” Reid said after he took the rare step of summoning all senators to the floor. The exchange began around the same time that Obama began addressing reporters at the White House.      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has maintained a low profile in recent days, spoke next, reminding Democrats that they will need to negotiate with Republicans in the House to break the impasse.      “The American people have given us divided government. And when you have divided government, it means you have to talk to each other,” McConnell told colleagues.      Earlier, Reid reiterated in a floor speech that he would be willing to negotiate with Boehner once the House passes measures reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling.      “Open the government, raise the debt ceiling, and we’ll talk about anything you want to talk about,” Reid said. “Stop threatening a catastrophic default on the nation’s bills.”      The Senate Democratic leader charged that Boehner reneged on a previous commitment to pass a “clean” government funding bill in the House, with no riders attacking the health-care law, if Democrats would accept the GOP’s budget number. Reid said he told Boehner that Democrats “hate your number” and wanted $70 billion more in spending but eventually agreed as a way to resolve the budget issue for a year.      But Boehner “didn’t live up to what he committed to doing,” Reid said.      Late Tuesday evening, the House voted on two measures that would pay federal employees currently on the job on time and launch a new bipartisan House-Senate working group to negotiate a broader set of fiscal issues. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) presented the plan during a Tuesday morning meeting with the House GOP conference. The bill authorizing payment of salaries to federal workers during the shutdown passed 420-to-0.      The new House-Senate panel would have a makeup similar to a joint congressional committee established in 2011, which was commonly known as the “supercommittee.” But the mandate for the new group would include addressing the debt limit and other fiscal concerns. Proposing a new panel is just the latest effort by Republicans to establish a framework for negotiations with the Senate and Obama.      The bill providing compensation for federal workers would ensure that federal prison guards, U.S. Capitol Police officers and staffers at other agencies currently on the job would be paid as scheduled for however long the partial government shutdown continues.      A separate bill passed by the House over the weekend ensures that furloughed, nonessential personnel would be paid after the impasse ends. That bill is awaiting a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate.      Obama called Boehner at 10:45 a.m. Tuesday, but no progress was reported from the call.      “The president called the speaker again today to reiterate that he won’t negotiate on a government-funding bill or debt-limit increase,” said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck.      According to a White House account of the call, Obama told Boehner he is “willing to negotiate with Republicans — after the threat of government shutdown and default have been removed — over policies that Republicans think would strengthen the country.” Obama expressed willingness to negotiate on “policies that expand economic opportunity, support private sector job creation, enhance the competitiveness of American businesses, strengthen the Affordable Care Act and continue to reduce the nation’s deficit,” the White House said.      Obama urged Boehner “to hold a vote in the House of Representatives on the Senate-passed measure that would reopen the federal government immediately,” the White House statement said. “Citing the Senate’s intention to pass a clean, yearlong extension of the debt limit this week, the President also pressed the Speaker to allow a timely up-or-down vote in the House to raise the debt limit with no ideological strings attached. He noted that only Congress has the authority to raise the debt limit and failure to do so would have grave consequences for middle class families and the American economy as a whole.”      Obama and Senate Democrats tried Monday to break the political logjam, advancing legislation that would raise the federal debt ceiling as soon as possible.      Democrats said they will attempt to force Republicans to agree to a long-term $1 trillion debt-limit increase to ensure that the government does not reach a point this month where it may be unable to pay its bills, risking its first default. They said they also may accept a short-term bill, perhaps lasting only weeks, if necessary to avoid going over the brink.      The Democratic push on the debt limit came as a partial government shutdown entered its second week with no solution in sight. New polling showed that the fiscal standoff is hurting Republicans far more than it is Obama, although no party is faring particularly well.      A Washington Post-ABC News survey found that 70 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Republicans are handling budget negotiations, up from 63 percent last week, with 24 percent approving.      Obama’s approval rating on budget matters ticked up slightly over the same time period — from 41 percent to 45 percent — but 51 percent disapprove. Obama’s Democratic colleagues in Congress are faring worse, with 61 percent of Americans disapproving, up from 56 percent before the shutdown.      In a hastily arranged visit Monday to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Obama said he will not bow to Republicans’ demands that he enter negotiations with them or risk a continued shutdown or a default.      “I cannot do that under the threat that if Republicans don’t get 100 percent of their way, they’re going to either shut down the government or they are going to default on America’s debt,” he said.      Republicans remained undeterred, saying they would neither raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling nor reopen the government without first winning concessions.      Lawmakers have little time to resolve the impasse. After Oct. 17, the Treasury Department says it cannot guarantee that it can pay all of the government’s bills, and independent analysts say the government would have less than two weeks before a default.      Later this week, Reid hopes to open debate on a bill that would raise the debt limit, aides said. To do so, he would need the support of all 54 members of the Senate Democratic caucus, plus six Republicans — a goal that seemed possible Monday, but is far from assured.      Meanwhile, if any senator objects to the proposal, procedural hurdles would prevent the measure from clearing the Senate and reaching the House until Oct. 15 — two days before the Treasury Department’s deadline.      Several Republican senators left the door open to supporting a “clean” debt-limit bill, but said it would depend on whether Democrats were willing to enter talks on broader budget reforms.      “I don’t know what the dynamics are here. I don’t know what’s being offered. It’s too early,” said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), who nonetheless held out hope. “I’m going to have to wait and see.”      But senior GOP aides said any debt-limit proposal in the House is likely to need significant conservative sweeteners to be considered.

Goldfarb and William Branigin contributed to this report. ||||| President Obama will make a statement and take questions from the press at 2 p.m. Tuesday, the White House said in updated guidance.      Obama last took questions from the White House press corps in early September, while traveling abroad in Sweden and Russia. His most recent full-scale press conference was on Aug. 9 in the East Room of the White House, just before he left Washington for a vacation on Martha's Vineyard.      With his long-planned trip to Asia this week cancelled because of the government shutdown, Obama is aiming to show that he's keeping up his involvement in resolving the situation, even as he repeats his refusal to negotiate on bills to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling.      Press conference will be streaming live here: politico.com/live |||||	– This morning's installment of shutdown politics had a familiar ring to it: John Boehner insisted that the White House negotiate on both the shutdown and the debt ceiling, and President Obama insisted he would do no such thing, reports NBC News. In fact, Obama called the speaker personally after Boehner issued his latest plea at a news conference. Obama "repeated what he told him when they met at the White House last week: the president is willing to negotiate with Republicans—after the threat of government shutdown and default have been removed," says the White House. Boehner, at his earlier press conference, kept up the pressure: “Listen, there’s never been a president in our history that did not negotiate over the debt limit,” he said. “Never. Not once. As a matter of fact, President Obama negotiated with me over the debt limit in 2011." Boehner did not spell out what he's looking for in such negotiations, notes the Washington Post. A short-term increase in the debt ceiling, perhaps? "I'm not drawing any lines in the sand," he said. Obama, meanwhile, plans a news conference for 2pm Eastern, notes Politico.

"More [deaths] are expected," the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's chief minister, Pervez Khattak, told state TV about three hours after the quake hit.      Pakistan suffered the worst casualties, with more than 200 people dead and 1,000 or so others reported injured, officials said.      In Afghanistan, 73 people were reported dead and more than 300 were injured.      A map shows the earthquake's epicenter. Google Maps      The toll included about 12 girls who died while trying to flee their school in Afghanistan, an official told NBC News — with some of them crushed in a stampede.      Landslides were reported, and some of the affected regions could not immediately be contacted, authorities said. The quake came just days after rain fell in many parts of Afghanistan, potentially making mud-built dwellings vulnerable.      The temblor struck about 2:10 p.m. (5:10 a.m. ET) in a remote area of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan about 28 miles south-southwest of Jarm, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency later revised its magnitude from a preliminary 7.7 to 7.5.      Witnesses reported a series of aftershocks.

The quake had a magnitude of 7.5 and was centered near Jarm in northeast Afghanistan, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake was felt many miles away in cities including Lahore, Pakistan, where Supreme Court justices were among those running into the street as buildings shook for up to two minutes, NBC News reports. In India, the quake was felt strongly at least as far south as Delhi, and while electricity and phone services have been hit in some areas, there have been no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries, the Times of India reports. In Pakistan, reports of deaths and building collapses are beginning to come in from northern parts of the country and a state of emergency has been declared in some areas, according to the Express Tribune. In Afghanistan, casualty figures are unknown, but the quake could have had a devastating effect: NBC notes that the quake came a few days after rain, meaning the region's mud-built homes are in greater danger of collapse. "There are reports of casualties and destruction" in remote parts of the northern province of Badakhshan, where the quake was centered, a regional official tells the AP.
summarize: President Barack Obama said Tuesday that it was “stunning to me” that Congress did not take real action to tighten gun laws following the late 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.      “My biggest frustration so far is that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage,” Obama said during a question-and-answer session hosted by microblogging platform Tumblr that came hours after a school shooting in Oregon.      Text Size -      +      reset      Mass shootings have become run of the mill, he said. The United States is “the only developed country on earth where this happens and it happens now once a week, and it’s a one-day story.”      (Also on POLITICO: The Obama Paradox)      He added that shortcomings in mental health care failed to account for the unusually high number of U.S. mass shootings relative to other nations. “The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people,” he said.      The president said he supports the Second Amendment but still sees a need for tighter rules. “I respect gun rights but the idea that, for example, we couldn’t get a background check bill in — it makes no sense,” he said. “And I don’t know if anybody saw the brief press conference from the father of the young man who had been killed in Santa Barbara, and as a father myself I cannot understand the pain he must be going through. The primal scream … why aren’t we doing something about this?”      The president’s comments Tuesday were his most extensive on guns in months. He spoke briefly about mental health issues while attending a memorial service following a mass shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, but last spoke at length on gun laws following the Navy Yard shooting last year.      (Also on POLITICO: Hillary Clinton's course correction)      Change on gun policy can only come if the country demands it, Obama said.      “If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change,” he said. “Most members of Congress — I have to say to some degree this is bipartisan — are terrified of the NRA.” ||||| Obama: Nation 'should be ashamed' over gun violence      President Obama (Photo: Associated Press)      President Obama said Tuesday the nation should do "some soul-searching": over its epidemic of deadly gun violence and "should be ashamed" it has been unable to address it.      "We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens," Obama said during a question-and-answer session on the social media website Tumblr.      "And it happens now once a week," Obama added. "And it's a one-day story. There's no place else like this."      While most of the Tumblr questions concerned the president's student loan programs, and higher education in general, Obama turned emotional when one user asked about school shootings. Obama's comments came just a few hours after the shooting death of a high school student in Oregon.      His "biggest frustration" as president, Obama said, has been that "this society has not been willing to take some basic steps" to keep guns away from people who "can do just unbelievable damage."      The president again criticized Congress for blocking a proposal to expand background checks for gun buyers and said too many lawmakers are "terrified" of the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups.      While "our levels of gun violence are off the charts," Obama said, the American people themselves have to demand new laws: "If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change."      Opponents of various gun control proposals said they would be ineffective, and some threaten Second Amendment ownership rights. They also said shootings are a mental health issue, an argument that Obama disputed.      "The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people," Obama said.      Some highlights from the Tumblr session:      5:07 p.m. -- Over and out: "I've had a great time," Obama tells Tumblr users.      5:05 p.m. -- Obama says he knows one thing he'll do after his second term is over: "I'll be on a beach somewhere."      But that won't last long, he adds, saying he wants to work with young people among other things during his post-presidency.      "Guard against cynicism," Obama tells Tumblr users.      5 p.m. -- The topic of school shootings comes up, as a questioner says he knew one of the victims in the recent deadly shooting spree in California.      Obama says the nation has to figure out a way to keep guns out of the hands of mentally unstable people.      He notes that Australia enacted gun control laws after a single mass shooting, and hasn't had one since.      While some people say mental illness is the problem, Obama said "the United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people."      The problem is availability of guns, Obama said, and "this country has to do a lot of soul searching."      4:51 p.m. -- Another issue surfaces: A proposed increase in the minimum wage. Obama talks about the need for more vocational education, from plumbers to carpenters.      4:45 p.m. -- Obama urges Tumblr voters to support a Senate Democratic plan that would, theoretically, help students lower debt loads by using new government loans -- at lower interest rates -- to pay off existing private loans. Republicans call the plan a gimmick, and have vowed to block it.      4:42 p.m. -- Obama discusses his administration's plans for college "scorecards," ranking schools in various ways.      4:37 p.m. -- Tumblr users are asking Obama for career advice, and what kinds of college majors they should pursue.      Obama talks up math and science, but says everybody is different, and people should pursue work "at something you care deeply about."      4:32 p.m. -- Obama stresses the need for more math and science education, while joking about the fact that he was a humanities major.      "The thing about humanities is you could kind of talk your way through classes," Obama notes at one point.      He adds that getting a math or science education "doesn't preclude you from writing haiku at some point."      4:28 p.m. -- Obama highlights the key part of his student debt relief program: Payments can be capped at 10% of income. He signed an executive order Monday for an expansion of that rule.      Not a lot of people know about this program, Obama says, and "I hope that the Tumblr community spreads the word."      4:25 p.m. -- Early questions focus on the rising costs of college -- and one likens Obama's proposals to help with loan repayments to "a band aid on a broken leg."      Obama also cracks wise about the Tumblr handle of one questioner: "Haiku Moon." It could be her real name, Obama muses, adding that "that's a cool name."      4:15 p.m.-- We begin about 15 minutes late, and President Obama explains his reasons for doing Tumblr.      "We are constantly looking for new ways to reach audiences," Obama says, especially young people.      Obama is seated in a chair, facing Tumblr founder and CEO David Karp, who is the moderator. They are in front of a large flat screen television.

(Jordan Stead/seattlepi.com via AP)      A student was shot and killed at a high school outside Portland, Ore., on Tuesday morning. That comes just five days after a student was shot and killed at Seattle Pacific University, which itself came on the heels of a shooting that severely injured a 10-year-old Wisconsin girl on an elementary school playground.      Here’s a particularly depressing number that highlights just how often school shootings are occurring: The shooting near Portland is the 74th school shooting since the Newtown massacre in December 2012, according to the group Everytown for Gun Safety, which is aimed at promoting gun control measures. Fully half of those shootings have occurred so far this year, and it is only the second week of June.      [UPDATE: There has been some backlash over the methodology used in compiling this list. Everytown went back and added a legend showing which shootings involved things like people being injured or killed. My colleague Niraj Chokshi has more here about how to quantify these shootings.]      That list is limited to school shootings where a gun was fired inside a school building or on a school’s campus, and it does include times when guns were accidentally fired, the group reports. That list does not include times when people brought guns to school and didn’t fire them on the school’s grounds. That list is just focused on school shootings the group finds through media reports, so the organization warns that it’s likely under-counting the number of school shootings that may have occurred during this time span.      That list does not include incidents near schools, so it doesn’t count the shooting rampage near the University of California Santa Barbara last month.      That list obviously does not include shootings at shopping malls, movie theaters or military installations, nor does the list include shootings in other public places, like the killing of two police officers and a bystander this week in Las Vegas. And it does not include incidents where schools were locked down and students ordered to shelter in place because there were reports of someone with a gun on the campus.      Here’s a map showing where the shootings occurred.      This post has been updated. ||||| Since the December 2012 shooting in Newtown, CT, there have been at least 142 school shootings in America — an average of nearly one a week. How many more before our leaders pass common-sense laws to prevent gun violence and save lives?      Communities all over the country live in fear of gun violence. That’s unacceptable. We should feel secure in sending our children to school — comforted by the knowledge that they’re safe.      Click here to see a new ad from Moms Demand Action.

Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included.      Over the course of two years, we identified a total of three incidents in which a private citizen discharged a firearm at a school that was ultimately determined to be self-defense — February 4, 2013 at Martin Luther King, Jr., High School in Detroit, MI, January 30, 2014 at Eastern Florida State College, and April 7, 2014 at Eastern New Mexico University.

Last updated: 10/1/2015 ||||| It’s a long-standing tradition for the sitting president of the United States to leave a parting letter in the Oval Office for the American elected to take his or her place. It’s a letter meant to share what we know, what we’ve learned, and what small wisdom may help our successor bear the great responsibility that comes with the highest office in our land, and the leadership of the free world.      But before I leave my note for our 45th president, I wanted to say one final thank you for the honor of serving as your 44th. Because all that I’ve learned in my time in office, I’ve learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.      Throughout these eight years, you have been the source of goodness, resilience, and hope from which I’ve pulled strength. I’ve seen neighbors and communities take care of each other during the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. I have mourned with grieving families searching for answers – and found grace in a Charleston church.      I’ve taken heart from the hope of young graduates and our newest military officers. I’ve seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch, and wounded warriors once given up for dead walk again. I’ve seen Americans whose lives have been saved because they finally have access to medical care, and families whose lives have been changed because their marriages are recognized as equal to our own. I’ve seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees, or work for peace, and, above all, to look out for each other.      I’ve seen you, the American people, in all your decency, determination, good humor, and kindness. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I’ve seen our future unfolding.      All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into that work – the joyous work of citizenship. Not just when there’s an election, not just when our own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime.      I’ll be right there with you every step of the way.      And when the arc of progress seems slow, remember: America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ‘We.’ 'We the People.’ 'We shall overcome.’      Yes, we can.

President Barack Obama |||||	– If today's school shooting in Oregon seemed numbingly familiar, here's why: A group that advocates for gun-control measures counts it as the 74th school shooting in the 18 months since the Newtown massacre, reports the Washington Post. Here is the full list of shootings from Everytown for Gun Safety. Included is any incident in which a gun was fired inside a school or on its campus, even if by accident. Today's shooting comes less than a week after the fatal shooting at Seattle Pacific University. The topic came up today as President Obama fielded questions on Tumblr, and Obama said the US "should be ashamed" about its gun violence, reports USA Today. "We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens," he said. "And it happens now once a week." Obama said his "biggest frustration so far is that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage,” reports Politico. He again criticized Congress for caving to the gun lobby and urged people to step up pressure on their lawmakers.
summarize: SAN DIEGO -- The mediation over the sexual harassment lawsuit against San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has been completed, and the City Council will vote Friday on a proposal that could end the six-week saga, according to City Atty. Jan Goldsmith.      At issue in the mediation talks was the possibility of Filner’s resignation in exchange for the City Council agreeing to pay some of his legal fees and potential damages from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by his former director of communications.      Late Wednesday night, an aide to a City Council member posted a video of Filner loading boxes into an SUV parked outside City Hall, reportedly after cleaning out his office and saying farewell to his staff.      The end of the mediation had come earlier Wednesday evening after three days of closed-door negotiations between Filner, his attorneys, Goldsmith and two City Council members, and overseen by retired federal judge J. Lawrence Irving, who donated his time.      All nine council members and numerous other officials have called for Filner's resignation, and a recall effort is underway. Goldsmith said last week that he was developing an "exit plan" for the mayor.      On Monday, Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred and her client Irene McCormack Jackson also the first of the mediation sessions.      Details of the proposal were kept under wraps Wednesday night, even from council members who were not in attendance at the session. Friday's vote will be taken in a closed session.      More than a dozen women in recent weeks have accused Filner of sexual misconduct, including inappropriate touching. Another woman came forward earlier Wednesday.      Recall leader Michael Pallamary said Wednesday night that the recall will continue "until a resignation has been tendered by Filner."      Filner, 70, was elected in November, the city's first Democratic mayor in two decades. Almost immediately his confrontational, abrasive style resulted in friction with City Council members and business leaders.      Filner made a brief appearance at City Hall to talk to his staff Wednesday afternoon before returning to the last mediation session. He refused to answer questions from reporters.      "Nice to see you guys," he told reporters.      ALSO:      Final Nixon tapes reveal toll of Watergate, support from Reagan      L.A.

Goldsmith said the City Council, which must approve any settlement, will review the proposal on Friday. He said no details would be released until after then.      The city attorney appeared after the third day of mediation being led by retired federal Judge J. Lawrence Irving that many presumed would end with Filner agreeing to resign. In exchange, the city would likely agree to limit Filner’s legal and financial exposure with regard to the lawsuit. A major sticking point had been the reluctance of city leaders to make taxpayers foot the bill for Filner’s alleged wrongdoing.      Joining other city officials and Filner's attorney outside a downtown office building, Goldsmith said Irving called on all parties not to disclose details until after the council session.      Filner's former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the and Filner and the city. She is being represented by high-profile attorney Gloria Allred.      The Democratic mayor has been under siege for the past five weeks since allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior toward women surfaced. More than a dozen women have come forward to accuse Filner of sexual misconduct and unwanted advances, such as kisses, groping and derogatory comments. Additional women have also described awkward encounters with Filner in which he inquired about their relationship status or asked them out. ||||| All nine members of San Diego City Council, California’s two senators and the Democratic National Committee want mayor Bob Filner to step down.      A recent poll of the city’s 1.3 million residents also found 81% think he should go.      But the 70-year-old serial groper is resisting their calls to resign, saying he’s taken an intensive course of behavioural therapy to sensitize himself to the issue and enable him to mend his ways. This is, after all, California.      Meanwhile, the government of the U.S.’s eight-largest city is in an uproar as a seemingly endless parade of women has come forward to claim the mayor made unwanted and improper sexual advances.      Among the accusers are his former communications director, a university dean, a retired Navy rear admiral and a great-grandmother. Some contend he cornered, groped and forcibly kissed them.      He’s not going to go on his own      The latest to go public is Dianne York, owner of a spa in nearby La Jolla. She told CNN Wednesday the 70-year-old fondled her buttocks during a photo shoot in front of several other people.      Mr. Filner already faces a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by his former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, the first woman to accuse him of failing to keep his hands to himself.      She says he made numerous lewd remarks and suggested her work performance would improve if she came to the office without wearing underwear.      Negotiations between the city and Ms. Jackson’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, are reportedly stalled over the amount of money to be paid to her in compensation and whether Mr. Filner should be forced to resign.      The DNC plans to vote on a resolution Friday urging him to step down immediately.      Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chairwoman, urged him to resign in July.      Negotiations on the Jackson lawsuit — she’s also suing the city — began Monday when Mr. Filner was spotted at City Hall, followed by Ms. Allred.      Why would he? He’s a psychopath. He’s a narcissist. He’s a predator. He’s a criminal menace      It was the first time the mayor had been seen in public since announcing about three weeks ago he would undergo therapy after acknowledging he has disrespected and intimidated women. He has denied committing sexual harassment.      But last month, after Ms. Jackson filed her lawsuit, he acknowledged having “failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me,” and admitted he was “embarrassed” by his actions.      Mr. Filner has vowed to remain San Diego’s leader, saying his focus after therapy “will be on making sure that I am doing right by the city in terms of being the best mayor I can be.”      He may not have a choice. The campaign to recall him began in earnest last Sunday, as volunteers fanned out over the downtown Gaslamp nightlife district and the finish line of a half-marathon foot race to gather signatures.      “He’s not going to go on his own,” said Michael Pallamary, a land-use consultant and recall committee chairman, at a rally outside City Hall.      “Why would he? He’s a psychopath. He’s a narcissist. He’s a predator. He’s a criminal menace.”      Organizers have until Sept. 26 to collect 101,597 signatures of registered voters. If the petition has fewer than that, the recall campaign will have 30 more days to gather additional valid signatures.

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has agreed to resign as part of a deal reached this week with city officials, NBC 7 News has learned.      Filner, spotted leaving City Hall with packing boxes Wednesday night, will formally vacate the office following a closed session of City Council Friday, according to several sources.      Filner's attorney has a letter of resignation drafted for his signature upon approval of the tentative settlement by councilmembers.      The mayor said goodbye to his staff Wednesday before he left his office at City Hall in his security detail’s SUV. Sources say the packing boxes in the backseat contained Filner's office effects.      San Diego Mayor Bob Filner Apppears in Public      NBC 7 San Diego cameras captured Mayor Bob Filner as he left the City Administration Building on Wednesday afternoon. (Published Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2013)      City officials announced just before 7 p.m. Wednesday a proposed solution had been reached in the scandal that has consumed the city of San Diego since it first broke July 10.      The firm Payne & Fears issued a statement on behalf of Filner Thursday afternoon: "Due to the confidential nature of mediation and settlement discussions, we are unable to comment or make statements about any of the terms." Read the full statement here      A public announcement will occur following the closed session according to Filner's attorneys but they don't identify who will make the statement.      Images: Mayor Under Fire      “I would encourage people to refer back to the City Attorney’s comments yesterday that much of the speculation cannot be confirmed until the Council is able to meet,” said City Council President Todd Gloria.      “This is a legal settlement we’re considering,” Gloria said.      In the last six weeks, more than a dozen women have come forward with tales of alleged sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances.      Todd Gloria Reacts to City's Mayoral Deal      NBC 7 reporter Brandi Powell asks San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria about his thoughts on Mayor Bob Filner's pending resignation. (Published Thursday, Aug. 22, 2013)      Filner has admitted to disrespecting and at times intimidating women, saying that he needed help. He announced he would enter a treatment program for an undisclosed disorder or illness.      Under investigation for alleged “pay to play” schemes with developers, Filner disappeared from public view for three weeks and surfaced Monday in time for a mediation session with city officials.      Over three days of negotiations in the downtown San Diego high-rise located just blocks from City Hall, officials reached a deal.      Goldsmith: 'We've Reached a Proposed Solution'      After 3 days of mediation with embattled Mayor Bob Filner, San Diego city leaders have reached a "proposed solution" regarding Filner's possible ousting from office. San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith speaks briefly about this latest development on August 21, 2013. (Published Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2013)      U.S. Rep. Scott Peters speculated the agreement involves picking up Filner's legal fees. “The hard thing for the City Council is going to be, he’s not going to leave for free,” Peters said Thursday.      Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents the mayor's former communication director Irene McCormack Jackson, described an agreement that would exchange payment of legal fees for Filner's resignation as “callous and unholy.”      “There should be no payoff for Mayor Filner,” Allred said.      "If the deal required that the city council pays him one dollar, then I for one think they should vote against it."      Councilmember Scott Sherman said he'll need to see the details of the deal before making a decision.      On the one hand, he'd like to see the voters voices be heard through the recall process but it's not guaranteed the recall effort will be successful, he said.      “If we’re looking at a small bit of attorney’s fees and maybe a payout to a couple of these victims and we’re absolved of everything else then yeah, I’d much rather have the mayor out that way,” Sherman told NBC 7 News.      As with any negotiations, until the agreement is approved and signed, it’s still tentative.      At several times during his time as mayor, Filner has come to terms with an opponent only to change his mind.      For example, Filner agreed to a deal with the Tourism Marketing District then refused to adhere to the terms.      He also pulled permits for a remodeling project by Jack-in-the-Box in North Park and meddled in the development of a multi-unit complex called CentrePointe.      Once the agreement is approved by Council and Filner resigns, San Diego city government will enter a period of interim leadership.      Council President Todd Gloria will take on the role of acting mayor under the city charter. According to the charter, Gloria would not give up his position on the Council during this time.      Read the city charter here      There could be at least one primary special election within 60 to 90 days.      Filner, a Democrat, was asked by his own party chairperson to resign amid allegations of inappropriate behavior with women. Earlier this week, The Democratic National Convention leadership announced its members would vote on a resolution regarding Filner Friday at their meeting in Scottsdale, Ariz.      On Friday evening San Diego Councilmember Kevin Faulconer released the following statement regarding Friday's closed meeting:      “Protecting taxpayers has always been my top priority. This case is no different. I joined these mediation discussions to ensure the City gets the best deal possible for taxpayers. We must put this civic dysfunction behind us and return to providing City services to San Diegans.”      Read Related Stories: |||||	– It looks like San Diego Mayor Bob Filner will be out of a job as soon as tomorrow, reports the Union-Tribune. After three days of closed-door negotiations, Filner last night reached a tentative settlement over the many, many, many sexual harassment allegations against him. The city council will formally consider the deal at 1pm tomorrow, but a host of outlets, including NBC San Diego, say it calls for Filner to resign immediately. A special election to replace him could get under way as soon as Saturday. The Los Angeles Times reports Filner was seen loading boxes into an SUV outside city hall last night. Pressure has certainly been mounting since at least 17 women came forward with allegations of groping, headlocks, and inappropriate comments. In addition to the full San Diego city council and the Democratic National Committee calling for his resignation, a recent poll says 81% of San Diego residents want to see Filner take a hike, the National Post reports.
summarize: (CNN) SPOILER ALERT: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR "THIS IS US" BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY AN ARTICLE ABOUT "THIS IS US."      Hello, if you are reading this you probably don't watch "This is Us," because those who do are still choke-sobbing into their shiraz or dismantling their Crock-Pots before their fictional-character-death support meetings. Allow us to explain everything.      Why is everyone talking about "This is Us" right now?      The beloved NBC family drama isn't even through its second season, but it feels like every week brings another emotional climax or character birth/death/breakdown/revelation/triumph so wrenching or life-affirming all of your social media feeds immediately devolve into a series of cry-face emojis.      But one of the biggest moments happened this week when viewers found out how one of the main characters may have died , even though they KNEW he would die at some point for about 20 episodes now, and all of the clues to how he'd probably die were introduced quite clearly a few episodes back.      Regardless, people were still totally satisfied and impressed, as evidenced by all of the cry-face emojis.      Typical "This is Us" twitter reactions      Give me the basic plot details, because from the outside this show just looks like a bunch of people hugging and talking.      "This Is Us" centers around the lives of the Pearson family. Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) are mom and dad. They have three adult children: Kevin (Justin Hartley), Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Sterling K. Brown).      Take a deep breath, because it gets real, fast:      In 1980, Rebecca was pregnant with triplets but one of the babies died. So, she and Jack decide to adopt a third baby who was dropped off at the hospital the same night.      These three children grow up to be three very different people in the present:      Kevin, a dissatisfied hot actor haunted by what may have been      Kate, his equally-haunted twin who's exploring the connection between her emotional trauma and her weight problems      Randall, the adopted brother who's black and brilliant and dealing with serious anxiety and abandonment issues.      Mix all together, stir well, let set and eat by the spoonful whilst crying.      Mandy Moore plays Rebecca and Milo Ventimiglia plays Jack in "This is Us."      That... is a lot.      It doesn't stop there! The show bounces back and forth in time, using younger versions of Jack, Rebecca and company to explore the main couple's love story as well as the small threads of early-life trauma that eventually become giant rat's nests of issues for their children. Oh, and it is by this convenient structure that we learn that dad Jack -- at some point when his kids were teens -- died.      Okay, stop.      AND, we also find out that Rebecca, the love of his life, is now remarried to his best friend... and also Randall meets his biological dad just in time for him to die in Randall's arms and... frankly, there are a lot of alcohol and substance abuse issues all around.      Sterling K. Brown plays Randall and Chrissy Metz plays Kate in "This is Us."      So it's about a complex family dealing with the highs and lows that make us human?      That is a fair assessment, yes.      Why do so many people I know allow themselves to be emotionally victimized by this show?      Die-hards will tell you the tears they shed are a great emotional catharsis. Plus, the constant roller coaster of bad things (Dead dads! Miscarriages! Regrets!) and good things (Family! Good husbands! The Super Bowl!) makes it hard to let go once you've hopped on.      I'm still having trouble pinpointing why THIS show, of all the dramas, pierces people directly in their feelings week after week.      First of all, there are plenty of well-wrought characters in which to invest. There's devoted husband Jack, relatable Kate and inspiring Randall, plus a host of relatives and partners so charming and perfect they'll make all of your current relationships look like trash.      Not only does the large family roster allow for an expanding fractal of dramatic possibilities, the drama is goosed at every opportunity.      There are evocative piano interludes. There are long, contemplative shots of everyday tableaux suddenly rendered so tender and precious you'll find yourself sobbing over a 10-second camera pan of wainscoting.      Oh, and the music! "This is Us" has basically weaponized Sufjan Stevens. If there is a sparse, melancholic folk ballad to be found, "This is Us" will find it. And it will use it against you.      Here we have a typical scene from "This is Us," in which people who love each other have long emotional arguments about how much they love each other.      This frankly sounds awful.      Tell it to the trophy case! The show is ridiculously well-regarded, and has snagged SAG Awards, Golden Globes, Emmys and other accolades during its two-year existence.      It also has a loyal and vocal following. The season 2 premiere brought in 12.9 million viewers -- some seriously solid numbers for a sophomore debut.      Mostly, though, it's about the crying.      If sobbing until you puke is your idea of a healthy emotional endeavor, this is the show for you and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you have enough angst in your life and can barely stand to witness your own family talk out their occasional issues, let alone a fictional family doing so on a weekly basis, you might want to skip.      Noted. So wait, how does Jack die?      It's looking like.. .house fire by busted Crock-Pot      Haha, what?      Yes! And it happens during a montage set to " To Build a Home " by The Cinematic Orchestra, a song so soft and sad you'll listen to it once and then choke up at the mere mention of the title for years to come. This show ruins good music AND kitchen appliances!      JUST WATCHED 'This Is Us' reveals cause of Jack's death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'This Is Us' reveals cause of Jack's death 01:10      I find this hard to believe.      Then you'll love the Super Bowl tie-ins! The Pearson triplets are conceived during a Super Bowl. The Crock-Pot inferno goes down after a Super Bowl! In "This is Us" world, the Super Bowl is a legitimate and weighty narrative touch point and even worse, everybody roots for the Pittsburgh Steelers.      Okay, I'm a masochist and I'm in. When can I find out what happens next?      The details of Jack's demise and the future of the Pearson family will be revealed -- we kid you not -- on February 4 right after... the Super Bowl. ||||| Tuesday’s episode of This Is Us didn’t just bring us thisclose to the very moment in which Jack Pearson will die — a raging fire was headed up the staircase — it also revealed the cause of said blaze. You can semi-blame it on friendly neighbor George, who gave Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) his trusty old Crock-Pot, which he explained to them had a switch that you kinda had to fiddle with, but no worries, it still works. While cleaning up the kitchen following a busted Super Bowl Sunday celebration 17 years later, Jack turned off the Crock-Pot, but after he left the room, the switch somehow activated, sparking up, igniting a dish towel and creating an inferno that quickly worked its way through the kitchen. And, of course, with no batteries in the smoke alarm, a true tragedy was in progress.      After the episode aired, This Is Us fans were quick to post on social media, taking out their anger/grief/sadness on the Crock-Pot, with some saying that they were throwing theirs out so they, too, didn’t perish in a fire. One fan wrote on the Crock-Pot Facebook page that she hoped that Crock-Pot was planning a can’t-miss Super Bowl ad, given that people were tossing their slow cookers; she received this response from the brand: “Jack Pearson was our Valentine so we equally understand your pain with his loss. We love him and we love you too. Don’t further add to our heartbreak by no longer using Crock-Pot Slow Cookers, rest assured our products have been generationally tested by your family and friends.” Another fan named Ruthie pressed the brand for a response to the matter, noting that “so many people are worried now. Crock-Pot replied: “We’re heartbroken over last night’s episode too!… [W]e’re innocent until proven guilty.”      NBC      Later in the day, Crock-Pot issued this lengthier and rather technical statement:      “Crock-Pot understands the concerns brought up by last night’s episode of This Is Us, and we too are heartbroken by the latest development in Jack’s storyline. However, it is important that our consumers understand and have confidence that all Crock-Pot slow cookers exceed all internal testing protocols and all applicable industry safety standards and regulations as verified by independent third-party testing labs. For nearly 50 years, with over 100 million Crock-Pots sold, we have never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed in last night’s episode. In fact, the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible.      “In addition, and most relevant to the concerns consumers are having after watching the recent This Is Us episode, our Crock-Pot slow cookers are low current, low wattage (typically no more than 200 or 300 watts) appliances with self-regulating, heating elements. The product is designed to cook foods over a longer period of time at low temperatures and the switches connect to only 1 side of the power line voltage, so there is never a high voltage applied directly across our switches. The switches within our slow cookers are subjected to additional internal testing, which includes a Rotary Knob Endurance test, Rotary Knob Force Test and Flame Burning Test and constructed of self-extinguishing, flame resistant material.      “Our hope is that the team at NBC’s This Is Us will help us spread factual information regarding our product’s safety. While we know their primary mission is to entertain — something they have continued to excel in — we also feel they have a responsibility to inform. Just like many fans, we will be watching next week’s episode to see how Jack’s story progresses and, regardless of the outcome, we want consumers first and foremost to know they are safe when using their Crock-Pot.”      Asked what words of advice he had for Crock-Pot’s public relations team in the wake of fears of fire-prone slow cookers, This is Us creator Dan Fogelman told EW, “I just literally just sent out a tweet — because I was reading this morning the reactions to the episode — reminding everybody that this was a fictional Crock-Pot with a faulty switch that was 20 years old. So, I don’t think the entire Crock-Pot community should be blamed for this.”      Taking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch?

(Ron Batzdorff/NBC)      A friendly warning: Spoilerspoilerspoiler.      “This Is Us,” NBC’s award-winning blockbuster series, is known for its tear-jerking tendencies. Call it mawkish. Call it manipulative. The most cynical might call it emotional terrorism.      [You need a hug and a good cry, America, and that’s what ‘This Is Us’ was made for]      But now it’s come to, um, this? Culinary terrorism?      The show’s two-season path to revealing how — spoiler reminder! — patriarch Jack died firmly placed the blame in Tuesday’s episode on a faulty secondhand slow-cooker, the humble, downright beloved American appliance.      [‘This Is Us’ just revealed another major clue about Jack’s death. Here’s everything we know so far.]      As my colleague Elahe Izadi summarized:      Serious or not, viewers had things to say.      I get married in less than 2 months and suddenly I feel the need to remove the crockpot from the registry. WE. DONT. NEED. IT. 😭 #ThisIsUs — Lauren Luna (@_vivalaluna) January 24, 2018      If you closely analyze the footage — this is why they pay us the big bucks — you’ll notice the appliance is merely shown to say “slow cooker.” For better or, now, worse, the Crock-Pot brand has become synonymous with slow cookers, so it became a natural target for people’s ire and tears. We inquired with Crock-Pot about how the company’s day had been going. Here’s what it had to say:      Crock-Pot understands the concerns brought up by last night’s episode of “This Is Us,” and we too are heartbroken by the latest development in Jack’s storyline.

Let's not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together. #ThisIsUs — Dan Fogelman (@Dan_Fogelman) January 24, 2018      Fogelman seems to have a bit of a thing for cooking tools. He also wrote the screenplay for “Tangled,” in which Rapunzel wields a frying pan — cast-iron, we’d say based on sound and appearance — as a weapon. Y’all didn’t throw out your Lodge skillets then, huh?      Crock-Pot and other slow cooker manufacturers have spent decades trying to persuade people that it’s okay to leave the appliances on for long periods of time unattended. (Frankly, the prospect of undercooked food is what gives me the heebie-jeebies even more, but the USDA has a handy tip sheet if you’re in the same camp.) Good luck now, guys!      The Consumer Product Safety Commission has a page on which it has collected slow cooker safety recalls, at least as far back as 2003. Two that mention a fire hazard were tied to control panels that could overheat and melt; another pegged improperly installed wiring as the culprit. No injuries — and certainly no massive conflagrations or fatalities! — were reported as a result of fires (and just one resulted from a shock in the case of the bad wiring). More burn injuries were reported in recalls for appliances that suffered from broken handles.      We doubt that would have made for dramatic TV. |||||	– If you own a Crock-Pot, don't freak out (but be warned that spoilers follow, TV lovers). Crock-Pot maintains its devices aren't likely to kill you, though some This Is Us fans aren't so sure. CNN reports the NBC show has promised the way in which a main character died would be revealed, and Tuesday's episode suggests a faulty slow cooker that triggered a house fire is responsible for Jack's demise. Assuming the fictional device came from Crock-Pot, some viewers responded with promises to kick their own Crock-Pots to the curb, prompting the company to respond, per the Washington Post. "We're heartbroken over last night's episode too" but "we're innocent until proven guilty," it wrote to one Facebook user before issuing a longer statement, per Entertainment Weekly. Crock-Pot has "never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed." In fact, "the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible," the company said. "Our hope is that the team at NBC’s This Is Us will help us in spreading factual information regarding our product’s safety."

(Associated Press)      ANCONA, Italy (AP) — Michele Scarponi, who won the Giro d'Italia in 2011, died after a collision with a van while training on Saturday. He was 37.      Scarponi was training near his home of Filottrano, near Ancona, when he was hit by a van at a crossroad, Team Astana said.      According to Italian media reports, the Astana cyclist died on the spot and was unable to be revived by emergency services which arrived promptly.      Team Astana called it "a tragedy too big to be written" in a statement.      "We left a great champion and a special guy, always smiling in every situation, he was a real mile stone and a landmark for everyone in the Astana Pro Team," it added.      Scarponi is survived by a wife and twin sons.      He had returned home after finishing fourth in the Tour of the Alps on Friday in Trento. He won the first stage on Monday.      Scarponi had posted a photo on Twitter on Friday night, with his sons on his back and the caption: "Even if only for a day I thought I'd bring home two leaders' jerseys."      Scarponi was awarded the 2011 Giro trophy after Alberto Contador was stripped of the title because of doping.      The Italian had also faced doping sanctions. He was banned for 18 months in July 2007 following the long-running Operation Puerto doping scandal, while he served a three-month suspension from the end of 2012 after working with the banned physician Michele Ferrari.      Scarponi had been named as Astana's leader for the upcoming Giro d'Italia, which starts in less than two weeks, after Fabio Aru pulled out with a knee injury.      "An infinite tragedy. Words don't exist. Rest in peace my friend," Aru tweeted.      Former teammate Vincenzo Nibali wrote: "I don't know, I can't cope! I don't have words my friend..."      Scarponi was one of the most liked riders on the circuit, with his sense of humor and jovial disposition. He often started training rides with his parrot on his shoulder, posting videos which quickly went viral.      "Yesterday he was racing. He came up to me. Michele was smiling, as ever," Italy team coach Davide Cassani wrote on Twitter. "He was happy for (Monday's) win. He was talking about the Giro. And now I'm here crying for him.

Average prices for regular gas were less than $2 in 36 states, according to AAA, with Missouri posting the lowest average at $1.66. Oklahoma was close behind at $1.67, followed by Arkansas and South Carolina at $1.70. California had the most expensive gas with an average price of $2.82 for regular. Prices were highest in Southern California, and GasBuddy.com listed stations in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas as selling regular for more $3 a gallon and a handful of Los Angeles stations at more than $4.      For months California motorists have experienced price spikes brought on by unscheduled refinery outages and supply issues that were exacerbated by the state's strict emissions rules requiring specific gasoline blends. Prices have declined in California the past two weeks, but the average for regular is still 25 cents higher than a year ago. Gas in neighboring Nevada is 15 cents higher than a year ago at $2.46.      In contrast, Hawaiians are paying 73 cents less than at this time in 2015, with the statewide average at $2.67. California and Hawaii were the only two states that averaged more than $2.50 as of Thursday morning. Alaska, New York, Vermont and the District of Columbia also are among the big losers, and motorists are saving more than 40 cents a gallon compared with a year ago.      At this time last year gas prices were nearing the end of a record 123 straight daily declines before regular bottomed out at the end of January at $2.03 per gallon.      At $1.94 for a national average, regular is 16 cents lower than a year ago, while at $2.18 diesel is 79 cents cheaper. Gas prices usually fall during the winter due to lower demand, and diesel prices rise because some of the heavier oil used for diesel is diverted to make home-heating oil. Mild winter weather and the glut of oil have put that pattern on hold, and diesel prices have continued to decline along with gas. |||||       HOUGHTON LAKE, MI - An apparent price war in a Northern Michigan town drove gas at several stations to under $1 per gallon on Sunday, according to GasBuddy.com.            Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at the gas price-tracking site, said a handful of stations in Houghton Lake lowered their per-gallon price to under a buck - the first stations in the country to hit that mark in years.      A price of 78 cents per gallon was recorded at Beacon & Bridge Market, while DeHaan said the nearby Marathon station was selling gas for 95 cents per gallon.      By later Sunday, those prices had risen to around $1.50 per gallon. |||||	– It didn't last long, but some residents in Northern Michigan saw gas prices drop below $1 on Sunday. The site GasBuddy.com first picked up on the news at several stations in Houghton Lake, where an apparent price war temporarily drove prices below the milestone level, reports WXYZ. "It appears these stations are currently the first stations in the country to see prices under $1 per gallon in years," says GasBuddy. Prices of 95 cents, 78 cents, and, incredibly, 47 cents a gallon, were reportedly spotted, and NBC 25 reports that police were directing traffic as a result. However, prices at the stations rose back up to levels of about $1.50 later Sunday, reports MLive. The price of gas is falling quickly all across the US, with the national average dropping to $1.94 last week, down 6 cents from the previous week, reports cars.com. The price plunge comes amid a backdrop of falling oil prices—a barrel is now below $29, the lowest level in more than a decade.
summarize: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is facing arrest for violating a Swedish law about sex without condoms, rather than a mainstream interpretation of "rape." Yet that's the charge reports often levy against him. Behold the smear campaign.      The New York Times wrote about the case on Thursday, noting that Swedish authorities were hunting Assange on charges of "rape, sexual molestation, and unlawful coercion." It commented on the alleged offense, stating claims by two women that "each had consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange that became nonconsensual."      The Swedish charges aren't exactly new, though. Some of the media had reported "rape" allegations back in August, and the Daily Mail even asserted the first alleged illegal act occurred when a condom broke, and the woman concerned "whatever her views about the incident," then "appeared relaxed and untroubled at the seminar the next day." At this seminar, Assange met the second alleged victim and "a source close to the investigation said the woman had insisted he wear a condom, but the following morning he made love to her without one."      Assange has questioned the "veracity" of the two women's statements, as the Times report notes. Assange's former lawyer yesterday "confirmed" the charges were to do with sexual misconduct concerning sex without condoms. Assange's current lawyer then revealed Swedish prosectors had told him they were not seeking Assange for "rape" at all, instead the alleged crime is "sex by surprise," which carries a penalty of a fine, although the details of the allegations haven't been revealed yet.      Then came the Interpol warrant, and with it, a new life for the previous rape accusations.      But few outlets are as concerned as the Times with nuance. Washington's Blog, to its credit, does report that the Swedish arrest warrant--and the following Interpol alert, adding Assange to its "most wanted" list--makes no reference to "rape." Instead Assange is being sought for sexual "coercion," after engaging in what was an allegedly non-consensual sex act with two women on two separate occasions within a short space of time. The act in question was sex without a condom, seemingly without the consent of the two women involved. Assange is also alleged to have been reluctant to submit to medical tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The two women reported him to the police, together, leading to the first arrest warrant for "rape," from a duty prosecutor, which was quickly canceled, then a later warrant for "sexual coercion."      A Google search for "Julian Assange rape" returns over 445,000 responses. See the above wordcloud generated from the top 50. The stand-out word is obvious. And while some of these results include Assange's statements alleging a "dirty tricks" campaign, there are more damning mainstream links, such as a September 1st story from the Associated Press, picked up by the Huffington Post and headlined, "Julian Assange Rape Investigation Reopened: Sweden Probing Wikileaks Founder." The body of the text mentions Sweden's chief prosecutor's comments noting there was "no reason to suspect that Assange, an Australian citizen, had raped a Swedish woman who had reported him to the police," and the AP notes that the new warrant was for "sexual coercion and sexual molestation" which "overruled a previous decision to only investigate the case as 'molestation,' which is not a sex offense under Swedish law." In other words, the AP's text implies no mention of "rape" but the hot eye-grabbing headline does--it's an old libel loophole. The "rape" part technically describes the investigation, not what Assange allegedly did.      We're absolutely not condoning non-consensual sex acts in any way, but arguably this story isn't about subtleties of semantics and centers on the labyrinthine--and seemingly nation-specific--laws Assange has violated. Yet the very Internets that Assange is using to crusade against government secrecy have enabled an almost unavoidable link between the words "Assange" and "rape" regardless of the precise nature of the allegations against him. Assange's character is thus extensively digitally smeared whether or not he is actually found guilty in court.      Call it a trial by Internet, a jury of Assange's peers.

Assange, 39, was attending a seminar in Stockholm earlier this month when he found himself facing charges of rape and sexual molestation - charges that were then, amid much confusion, withdrawn and which he strenuously denies.            What does not seem to be in dispute is that he had sex with the two women within four days.      The scandal made headlines around the world, forcing the usually strident campaigner to go to ground in Stockholm, claiming it was a smear campaign, possibly initiated by the CIA or the Pentagon.            His supporters pointed out that the allegations came just a few weeks after WikiLeaks became embroiled in a dispute with the Pentagon over its publication of classified war documents, which the U.S. says endangers the lives of its soldiers and their Afghan allies.            The website plans to release more documents.            Sources in Sweden take a different view - they insist it was Assange’s louche behaviour and his chauvinistic attitude that led to the charges.            One of the women claimed in a Swedish newspaper: ‘The responsibility for what happened to me and the other girl lies with a man who has a twisted attitude to women and a problem taking no for an answer.’      Adding to the confusion was the seemingly speedy decision by the Swedish police and prosecution service to charge Assange and issue a warrant for his arrest, even before formal statements had been taken from the women, only to have the rape charge dropped 24 hours later.      The sexual molestation charge was then reduced to one that is punishable by little more than a slap on the wrist.      As ever when such cases are mired in conflicting claims, the truth can take a long time to surface.      But The Mail on Sunday has managed to obtain copies of the women’s police statements, which are made available to the media in Sweden.      Denial: Mr Assange admitted having sex with two women within four days of each other      Though heavily redacted, with details of the sex allegations blacked out, they make uncomfortable reading.            Assange had flown into Stockholm on Wednesday, August 11, where several of the WikiLeaks internet servers are based, to speak at a seminar organised by the Social Demoratic Party, the equivalent of Britain’s Labour Party, three days later.            It has been reported that the Australian lives a nomadic life, but curiously he applied for a visa to work permanently in Sweden soon after his arrival.            Woman A, who works for the Christian branch of the party, was the main organiser but they had never met before.      The attractive twentysomething, described by friends as hardworking and fun-loving, offered to let him stay in her one-bedroom flat in Sodermalm, Stockholm.            She planned to visit her family on the other side of the country and would be away until the Saturday seminar.      But she returned on the Friday, anxious about the amount of work still to do for the seminar.      According to a police source: ‘They had a discussion and decided it would be OK to share the living space, then went out together for dinner.            'When they got back they had sexual relations, but there was a problem with the condom - it had split.            'She seemed to think that he had done this deliberately but he insisted that it was an accident.’      Whatever her views about the incident, she appeared relaxed and untroubled at the seminar the next day where Assange met Woman B, another pretty blonde, also in her 20s, but younger than Woman A.      In her police statement, Woman B described how, in the wake of the Afghanistan leaks, she saw Assange being interviewed on television and became instantly fascinated - some might even say obsessed.      She said she thought him ‘interesting, brave and admirable’.            Over the following two weeks she read everything she could find about him on the internet and followed news reports about his activities.            She discovered that he would be visiting Sweden to give a seminar, so she emailed the organisers to offer her help.      She registered to attend and booked the Saturday off work.      She appears to have dressed to catch his eye, in a shocking-pink cashmere jumper. But, she says, among the grey-suited journalists who filled the room, she felt uncomfortably out of place.            Undeterred, she bagged a seat in the front row and was asked to buy a computer cable for Assange.            No one bothered to thank her, she later complained.      Assange, dressed in grey jeans and a suit jacket, spoke earnestly for 90 minutes on the theme ‘The first victim of war is the truth’.      He could not have failed to notice the attractive blonde taking photographs of him.      What unfolded could be described as akin to the meeting of a groupie and a rockstar. The woman loitered outside the building before approaching a member of his entourage, who invited her to join a lunch at a modest local eatery called Bistro Boheme.      The party consisted of two Social Democrats, a freelance journalist friend of Assange, the man himself and Woman B - who was the only female.            'He has a twisted attitude to women'      One of the men present recalled her as a person of a seemingly nervous disposition who didn’t fit in.      ‘She was a little bit strange,’ he said. ‘Definitely an odd character and keen to get Julian’s attention.’      The woman admitted trying to engage her hero in conversation.            Assange seemed pleased to have such an ardent admirer fawning over him and, she said, would look at her ‘now and then’. Eventually he took a closer interest.            She explained in her statement that he was tucking into cheese served on Swedish crispbread when she asked if he thought it was good.            Assange looked at her directly and started to feed her.      His next move was pure computer geek - he told her that he needed a charger for his laptop, and she eagerly offered to help.            Assange smiled, put his arm around her back and said: ‘Ah yes, it was you who gave me a cable.’            They went on a vain search for the charger. She bought him a travel card for the metro because he said he didn’t have any money.            On the train he was recognised by a young man who gushed in admiration about WikiLeaks.            If she felt a thrill from this brush with fame, Woman B doesn’t say.      They ended up at the city’s Natural History Museum, where Assange headed to a computer console and, to the woman’s clear annoyance, twittered about his day.            At 6pm they entered a bijou cinema to watch a short film about the ocean, called Deep Sea. In the darkness Assange became amorous.            At one point they moved to the back row, where it is clear from the woman’s statement that the pair went far beyond kissing and fondling.            After the show, they wandered towards a park. He turned to her and said: ‘You are very attractive ... to me.’      Assange said he had a traditional Swedish crayfish party to attend and needed a power nap, so they lay side by side on the grass and he fell asleep.            She stayed awake and woke him about 20 minutes later. When she asked if they would meet again, he replied: ‘Of course.’      What he did not tell her was that the party was being hosted by the woman he had slept with two nights before and whose bed he would probably be sleeping in that night.            By the time she had arrived home, 46 miles outside Stockholm, and charged her mobile phone, there was a message from Assange asking her to call.            He was still at the party.            The next day Woman B tried to call him but his phone was turned off. She eventually spoke to him on the Monday when he agreed to meet her in the evening and suggested they spend the night at her flat.            She wanted to go to a hotel, but he said he would like to see her home.            Again she bought his £10 train ticket because he had no cash and said he didn’t want to use his credit card in case his movement was being tracked.            He spent most of the 45-minute journey surfing the internet on his laptop, reading stories about himself and twittering or texting on his mobile phone.            ‘He paid more attention to the computer than to me,’ she said bitterly.      It was dark by the time they arrived in her suburb and the atmosphere between them had cooled.            ‘The passion and attraction seemed to have disappeared,’ she said.      Most of what then followed has been blacked out in her statement, except for: ‘It felt boring and like an everyday thing.’      One source close to the investigation said the woman had insisted he wear a condom, but the following morning he made love to her without one.      'The passion seemed to have disappeared'            This was the basis for the rape charge. But after the event she seemed unruffled enough to go out to buy food for his breakfast.            Her only concern was about leaving him alone in her flat. ‘I didn’t feel I knew him very well,’ she explained.      They ate in an atmosphere that was tense, though she said in her statement that she tried to lighten the mood by joking about the possibility that she might be pregnant.      They parted on friendly terms and she bought his train ticket back to Stockholm. When she asked if he would call, he said: ‘Yes, I will.’      But he did not and neither did he answer her calls.      The drama took a bizarre and ultimately sensational turn after she called the office of Woman A, whom she had briefly met at the seminar.      The two women talked and realised to their horror and anger that they had both been victims of his charm.      The issue of unprotected sex left a fear of disease. It is believed that they both asked him to take a test for STDs and he refused.            Woman B was especially anxious about the possibility of HIV and pregnancy.      And it was in this febrile state that the women, who barely knew each other, walked into a police station and began to tell their stories.      Woman A said afterwards that she had not wanted to press charges but had gone to support the younger woman, who wanted police advice on how to get Assange to take a medical test.      In any event, the police woman at the reception and two male officers, one from the sex crimes unit, believed there was enough evidence to call the female duty prosecutor, who issued the warrants.      The story was leaked to a Swedish tabloid and Assange’s high profile led to the case being taken over by a senior female prosecutor who, after reading the statements, concluded there was no evidence of rape.      She agreed to the sexual molestation charge related to the first woman, but even that was watered down last week. Some legal observers now believe that will also disappear.      Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer representing the women, said they were upset about the way the case had been handled.            ‘This case is a regressive sign for women that it’s not worth reporting when something like this happens,’ she said.      ‘I was struck by the senior prosecutor’s statement that it’s not that she didn’t believe it but that she didn’t feel it was a crime.            'That’s why I’m going to a higher prosecutor to demand that the case is reopened.’      Assange’s lawyer Leif Silbersky said yesterday that he was unable to comment about the case until Tuesday.            It is expected that the Swedish prosecution service will issue a statement about the case then.      Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain – Assange’s attempts to portray himself as an online saint, exposing the secrets of the superpowers, has been dealt a damaging blow. |||||	– By now, you’ve probably heard that Julian Assange is wanted for “rape” in Sweden. Heck, you probably read it here on Newser. You can hardly blame us; sources from CNN to the New York Times have said that Assange is charged with “rape, sexual molestation, and unlawful coercion.” There’s just one problem: It’s not true. Assange’s lawyers tell Aol News that prosecutors have told them he’s wanted not for rape but for “sex by surprise,” a minor crime punishable only be a fine. “We don't even know what 'sex by surprise' even means, and they haven't told us,” the lawyer says. It seems that two women have accused Assange only of not using a condom after they had asked him to do so, Fast Company explains, pointing to an old Daily Mail report indicating that in the first case, the condom simply broke. These complaints did initially lead to an arrest warrant for rape, but that warrant was swiftly canceled. The current warrant against him does not mention rape, but "sexual coercion."
summarize: An Air India technician died after being sucked into the engine of an aircraft parked at the Mumbai airport on Wednesday.      The mishap occurred when the co-pilot of Mumbai-Hyderabad flight AI 619 mistook a signal for starting the engine and the victim, Ravi Subramanian, got sucked into it at bay 28 of the Chhatrapati Shivaji domestic airport around 8.40pm.      “An Air India technician died in a mishap during pushback of flight AI 619; the incident is being investigated,” Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani said. “We are deeply saddened and regret the tragic incident at Mumbai airport,” he added.      “The body is still stuck in the engine, efforts are going on to retrieve it,” an airport official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.      An Air India source said a probe has been ordered into the incident. “At the moment, we are absolutely clueless on how this person was near the aircraft. Only an inquiry can establish whose negligence it was and whether the engine should have been switched on at that time,” the official said.      The local police, the airline and other authorities have launched independent investigations into the case. Officials from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), too, were investigating the episode, an airport source said.      A similar incident had occurred in the late 1990s in Chennai when a bird scarer was sucked into the engine after he ran towards the plane, while it was preparing for take-off.

The incident occurred as the Mumbai-Hyderabad flight AI 619 began its pushback at 8.46 pm. The technician, Ravi Subramanian, got pulled into the engine and died instantly. Hours later, the process of extricating the severely mutilated body was still underway.      An investigation was announced by Air India immediately. The DGCA also ordered an inquiry.

Express Photo/Vasant Prabhu Aircraft parked at the Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, where a technician was killed Wednesday night. Express Photo/Vasant Prabhu      In a statement, Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani said, “We are deeply saddened and regret the tragic incident at Mumbai airport this evening when an Air India technician died in a mishap during pushback of flight AI 619. The incident is being investigated.”      Speaking to The Indian Express, Lohani said, “The flight was already boarded. It was ready for take-off. While it was pushing back to come on the airstrip, he (Subramanian) was working on the ground. His body got entangled in the engine.”      Pushback is the process of using tugs or tows to move an aircraft backward before it taxies out.      Subramaniam, 56, was a Vashi resident and worked as a service engineer. His job included disconnecting the pushcart from the aircraft before it moves towards the runway.      When the accident happened, an aircraft maintenance engineer was also with him.      According to the standard operating procedure, a maintenance engineer first gives clearance to the pilot by waving a red flag, after which the pilot can start the engine for taxiing out.      According to an eyewitness, it appeared that the flight captain may have started the engine before the clearance, though officials could not confirm this immediately.      Subramanian was near the nose wheel along with the pushcart when the engine started and he was sucked in.      The Mumbai Police is also investigating the accident. “Prima facie evidence indicates a case of accidental death, no one appears to be at fault,” Virendra Mishra, zonal DCP, said. A case of accidental death has been registered at the Sahar police station.      For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App ||||| MUMBAI: In a freak accident, an Air India service engineer died after he got sucked into the live engine of an A-319 aircraft at Mumbai airport on Wednesday evening. The engineer, identified as Ravi Subramanium, was in his forties. At the time of going to the press, the body was yet to be recovered from the engine.The incident took place around 8.30pm when the aircraft which was to operate the Mumbai-Hyderabad AI flight 619 was being pushed back from the parking bay before take off. An aircraft can only move forward and so needs external help to reverse from the parking bay. A tow van is used to push back the aircraft and the process is carried out with an engineer positioned in front of the aircraft nose, so as to be visible to the pilots. The flight was being piloted by a new co-pilot and a seasoned commander A G Sharma. Subramanium, the technician (service engineer), was supervising the push back. "No one knew what happened. All of a sudden we hear that we heard that the technician has been sucked into the engine," said an airline source. A CISF official said "the body has been badly mutilated".Many of the around 100 passengers who were on the flight are said to have been traumatized by the incident.In an A-319 aircraft the distance from the nose to the engine is about 30 feet. "When an aircraft is being pushed back, the engine, even when if it has been started is on idle thrust, that's about ten per cent of its total thrust. During taxiing its never more than 35%. Ground staff and technicians know quite well the area that should be kept clear in front of the engines," said an airline official.Airline sources said that the aircraft's auxillary power unit (APU) was not working and so the engine start-up procedure being followed was not a regular one. When on ground, an APU supplies power to keep the passenger cabin air conditioned, to provide electricity and to start the engines. "But most APUs on AI's narrow-body aircraft don't work. To start an engine, you have to crank the engine, rotate the engine fan. If APU is not functional, pilot starts one engine, before push back, when the aircraft is in the bay with the help of an external power source. Once the engine is started, the power source is disconnected, the aircraft is pushed back then the live engine has to be revved up for the other engine to be started," said a commander. The accident seems to have occurred during one of these procedures. During a regular start-up, once the aircraft has been pushed back and is ready to start taxiing, the ground control gives start-up clearance to start engine number one and then two after ensuring that no one is near the engines.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has initiated an inquiry into the accident. Air India chairman Ashwani Lohani will be leaving for Mumbai on Thursday morning to examine the accident and take follow up action. "We are deeply saddened and regret this tragic incident. This is being investigated. Our heartfelt condolence to the bereaved family," Lohani said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone Vlll) Virendra Mishra confirmed the accident and said that the Sahar police are in the process of registering a case of accidental death.This is the second tragedy of its kind at Indian airports. In 1995, a person was crossing the Hyderabad runway on his moped when an aircraft (VT-EPM) landed there. Since the engines were on and the person was dangerously close on the runway, he got sucked in. "That person was a bystander who was neither working at the airport, not with any airline. He borrowed an airport pass from a policeman posted at the airport who happened to be his relative and that is how got access to crossing the runway on his moped. That was the time airport security was not very stringent and access was not tightly controlled," said an old timer. ||||| FILE - In this May 18, 2012, file photo, Air India planes are parked on the tarmac at the Terminal 3 of Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, India.

Airport authorities are investigating the death of a 56-year-old Air India employee who met such a fate at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on Wednesday, reports the Indian Express. Air India's chairman tells the AP that a pilot of an A319 misread a signal and switched on an engine as the plane was being towed from a gate before takeoff. The engine then sucked in maintenance engineer Ravi Subramanium and killed him instantly, reports the Times of India. He'd been supervising the move near the nose of the plane, 30 feet away from the engine. "The body is still stuck in the engine, efforts are going on to retrieve it," an official tells the Hindustan Times. Airport officials were following an irregular engine startup procedure at the time because the aircraft's auxiliary power unit wasn't working, reports the Times of India. Still, "ground staff and technicians know quite well the area that should be kept clear in front of the engines," says an airline official. "We are absolutely clueless on how this person was near the aircraft," an Air India official tells the Hindustan paper. "Only an inquiry can establish whose negligence it was."

(Photo: Mandi Wright/Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo      Sitting in the pediatrician's office with their 6-day-old daughter, the two moms couldn't wait to meet the doctor they had picked out months before.      The Roseville pediatrician — one of many they had interviewed — seemed the perfect fit: She took a holistic approach to treating children. She used natural oils and probiotics. And she knew they were lesbians.      But as Jami and Krista Contreras sat in the exam room, waiting to be seen for their newborn's first checkup, another pediatrician entered the room and delivered a major blow: The doctor they were hoping for had a change of heart. After "much prayer," she decided that she couldn't treat their baby because they are lesbians.      • Doctor's letter:Why she wouldn't care for baby with 2 moms      "I was completely dumbfounded," recalled Krista Contreras, the baby's biological mother. "We just looked at each other and said, 'Did we hear that correctly?' .... When we tell people about it, they don't believe us. They say, '(Doctors) can't do that. That's not legal.' And we say, 'Yes it is.'"      The Contrerases of Oak Park are going public with their story to raise awareness about the discrimination that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community continues to face. There is no federal or Michigan law that explicitly prohibits discrimination against LGBT individuals.      For months, the couple kept quiet about what happened to them and their baby — Bay Windsor Contreras — at Eastlake Pediatrics last October.      But the pain and frustration wouldn't go away. So they broke their silence.      "We want people to know that this is happening to families. This is really happening," said Jami Contreras, 30, who was blindsided that fall day in the doctor's office. "It was embarrassing. It was humiliating ... It's just wrong."      Doctor apologizes      The pediatrician at issue is Vesna Roi, 49, who has been practicing pediatric medicine for 19 years.      Roi said that she could not comment on the case, citing the federal HIPAA law, which requires medical providers to protect the privacy of patients. But she did defend her commitment to pediatric medicine and helping children.      "My life is taking care of the babies," Roi told the Free Press on Tuesday. "I love my families, my patients. I love my kids. And I have become very close with all my patients."      Roi, meanwhile, has apologized to Jami and Krista Contreras in a handwritten letter, which was obtained by the Free Press. It states:      "Dear Jami & Krista, I am writing this letter of apology as I feel that it is important and necessary. I never meant to hurt either of you. After much prayer following your prenatal (visit), I felt that I would not be able to develop the personal patient doctor relationship that I normally do with my patients."      The letter, dated Feb. 9, did not explain why Roi felt that way, nor did it mention anything about the two women being lesbians. It did, however, state that the Contrerases were "always welcome in our office" and that they could still get care from another pediatrician who was on staff.      Buy Photo (Photo: Mandi Wright/Detroit Free Press)      Roi also apologized for not telling the Contrerases about her decision in person.      "I felt that it was an exciting time for the two of you and I felt that if I came in and shared my decision, it would take away much of the excitement. That was my mistake," the letter stated. "I should have spoken with you that day."      The letter concluded:      "Please know that I believe that God gives us free choice and I would never judge anyone based on what they do with that free choice. Again, I am very sorry for the hurt and angry feelings that were created by this. I hope that you can accept my apology."      Decision not illegal      Krista and Jami Contreras are not suing Roi. They concede that Roi did nothing illegal — which is precisely what they have a problem with: There are few laws on the books that protect the LGBT community from discrimination.      "There's no law that prohibits it," Wayne State University Constitutional Law Professor Robert Sedler said of Roi's actions. "It's the same as a florist refusing to sell flowers for a same-sex wedding."      Currently, 22 states have laws that prohibit doctors from discriminating against someone based on their sexual orientation. Michigan is not one of these states.      Michigan does have its own anti-discrimination law known as the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. But it doesn't cover LGBT individuals. Neither do federal employment laws included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibit hiring or employment discrimination on the basis of a person's"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin," not sexual orientation.      Legislative efforts to add LGBT individuals to federal and Michigan anti-discrimination laws have been made over the years, none successfully.      Sedler, who teaches equality issues at Wayne State University, said Roi didn't violate any laws.      "Basically, the pediatrician handled this in an appropriate way," Sedler said. "She turned them over to another doctor."      However, Sedler added, Roi's actions as a licensed doctor raise an ethical issue.      "Here you have a doctor saying I won't treat a baby of a lesbian couple … I think that's very troubling," he said. "It's clearly not illegal, but it certainly raises an ethical question."      Attorney Dana Nessel, who is handling the Michigan same-sex marriage case that's about to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, believes the laws need to change. If not, she said, more families like the Contrerases will be mistreated by the medical profession.      "It's a very scary thing," Nessel said of doctors being allowed to refuse to treat patients. "What kind of a society are we that we would allow this to happen?"      While Michigan doctors can refuse to treat a gay person, or their children, citing religious freedoms, the medical profession strongly opposes it.      The American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics have taken a strong stance against this practice and have prohibited it in their ethics rules, which are only advisory.      "Respecting the diversity of patients is a fundamental value of the medical profession and reflected in long-standing AMA ethical policy opposing any refusal to care for patients based on race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other criteria that would constitute invidious discrimination," said a statement from Dr. Gregory Blaschke, chair of the AMA's LGBT Advisory Committee. It added that the AMA encourages "diversity, awareness and cultural sensitivity in the medical profession."      For Jami and Krista Contreras, the medical policies are comforting, but they're not enough. It's time, they said, for the laws to change so that no LGBT person experiences what they did that fall day in the pediatrician's office. Roi, they said, gave no signs that she was opposed to their lifestyle when they met her. She told them to schedule an appointment when the baby was born, they said. And they did just that.      Then came the blow.      "You're discriminating against a baby?" Jami Contreras said. "It's just wrong."

But after waiting for their newborn’s first checkup, Dr. Vesna Roi refused to see them.

summarize: CHICO — Joseph Igbineweka, 23, president of the Associated Students at Chico State University, was the victim of an apparent racially motivated attack early Sunday morning as he was returning home from a party on West Sacramento Avenue.      He is in stable condition and recovering at Enloe Medical Center.      Chico police said the suspects reportedly made racial comments before the attack. Igbineweka moved to the United States from Nigeria and is attending Chico State after attending high school in Richmond.*      At approximately 2:17 a.m., Igbineweka was walking home alone when two males approached and began to threaten him and make racial slurs, according to a press release from the Chico Police Department.      "I was just minding my own business," Igbineweka said from his hospital bed Sunday afternoon. He said the two men continued to follow him, even though he continued to walk away from the situation. "One of them said, 'Dude, you don't want to get shot.'"      Igbineweka said he turned around and saw something in the man's hand, but was able to confirm it wasn't a gun and kept walking. At that point, he said, the two men jumped him and he was able to knock down one of them before the other began to stab him.      "I didn't know what the object was, but I knew he had something in his hand," he said. "He was pretty much stabbing me wherever he could."      A friend of Igbineweka's, identified as "Mike," saw the incident and      Advertisement      attempted to help. Igbineweka said he realized he was "gushing blood," and stopped fighting while Mike tied the wounds with his shirt and called 9-1-1.      Igbineweka suffered injuries to the left side of his neck, the left of his chest, cuts on his abdomen and a particularly deep cut on his left arm, wrist and hand. He said the cut on his left hand is so deep that it has damaged the nerve endings and he cannot feel his left ring finger or pinkie finger.      Chico police were able to apprehend Barry Sayavong, 19, at the corner of West Sacramento and Citrus avenues minutes after the attack. Sayavong was arrested and booked into the Butte County Jail in Oroville on charges of attempted murder and a hate crime.      Chico police confirmed that Sayavong is a Chico resident and a Butte College student. However, police said there is also no evidence that Sayavong and his unknown accomplice knew who Igbineweka was at the time of the attack.      According to county jail officials, Sayavong's court date has been set for this Thursday. He is being held on $250,000 bail.      "I'm just happy they caught one of the guys," Igbineweka said. "It'd be much more painful if they hadn't caught him. I'm praying they give this guy maximum punishment."      Joe Wills, director of public affairs for Chico State, said the attack is "very distressing."      "We're obviously happy that Joe has survived this attack and is in the hospital and doing a little better. I know that our students and our entire campus hopes the best for him and our thoughts are with him today," he said.      Wills described the attack's classification as an attempted homicide and as a potential hate crime as "very, very disturbing."      The apparent hate crime against Igbineweka comes on the heels of another crime involving a Chico State student running for AS President, whose campus election posters were defaced with racial slurs just a week ago.      David Buckley, Associated Students executive director, visited Igbineweka in the hospital Sunday afternoon.      "We were shocked and concerned about Joseph when we heard this morning," Buckley said. "I think, for all of us, we're all really concerned for him."      Igbineweka said his experience shouldn't scare students, but they should walk in groups at night and not alone, as he was doing.      "It's as safe as much as you want it to be here in Chico," he said.      Staff writer Robin Epley can be reached at 896-7761 or repley@chicoer.com.      Correction, Mon., April 19, 2010: The original version of this story incorrectly stated Igbineweka's status as a student. He moved to the United States from Nigeria and is attending Chico State University after going to high school in Richmond. Return to corrected sentence. ||||| (CNN) -- The student body president of California State University, Chico, was recovering Monday from stab wounds suffered in what police believe was a hate crime, officials said.      Joseph Igbineweka, who was born in Nigeria, was stabbed early Sunday while walking in a Chico neighborhood near the college where mostly students reside, Chico police Sgt. Rob Merrifield said.      Igbineweka passed two men who began to make racial slurs, Merrifield said. He ignored them and continued to walk, but they followed him and continued to yell at him.      Igbineweka eventually turned around, and one of the men struck him, Merrifield said. He fought back, but the man pulled a pocket knife and stabbed him at least four times, in the neck, chest, stomach and arm, according to Merrifield. The attacker fled on foot.      Several police officers were in the area and were alerted to the situation, Merrifield said. An officer found Igbineweka and was able to get a description of the attacker and alert other officers in the area.      A suspect, 19-year-old Barry Sayavong, was found and arrested a few blocks away, Merrifield said. Sayavong, of Chico, is facing charges of attempted murder and a hate crime, according to Merrifield.      Igbineweka was hospitalized Monday but is expected to recover, Merrifield said. His worst injury was a deep gash on his arm.      Igbineweka was in stable condition, said Joe Wills, spokesman for the university, which is commonly known as Chico State.      "While violent crimes happen in this and other communities, this is very disturbing," Wills said. "Lots of people know Joe." The student body president is akin to a public figure in Chico, a university town of about 100,000 people, he said.      Igbineweka "is very well known in the local community," Wills said. "This is a hate crime and a very big deal."      Wills said the mood on campus "is one of shock and sadness and concern for Joe."      "And also there is looking forward to what people can do so that these kinds of crimes aren't repeated," Wills said.      "Today, our thoughts are with Joseph hoping for his full recovery," said a statement from Chico Mayor Ann Schwab and university President Paul Zingg. "We, and several others, have visited with him. ... He is in good spirits considering what he has been through."      Igbineweka "is looking forward to getting back on campus and looking for solutions to reduce violence in the community," Wills said. "He is motivated to stay active."      Igbineweka moved to the United States at the age of 15, and is from Richmond, California, Wills said.      The attack "is an assault on the values of civility and respect for other people that both Chico State and the city of Chico work so hard to ensure," Schwab and Zingg said in their statement. "We choose not to be defined by hate-filled and criminal acts."      "From his hospital bed, Joseph urges us to 'continue the conversation' around violence and prejudice," the two said. "We assure Joseph we will do that."      An open forum was set for Monday afternoon for anyone wishing to address the incident and discuss efforts for the community to move forward, they said.      CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report. |||||	– The student body president of the California State University in Chico was stabbed and wounded in what police say was a racially motivated hate crime.

summarize: CLOSE President Obama's $3.99 trillion budget aims to help working class families, but Republicans say this isn't the way to do it. VPC      President Obama speaks at the Department of Homeland Security about the administration's fiscal 2016 budget request released Feb. 2, 2015. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)      WASHINGTON — President Obama submitted his $4 trillion budget wish-list to a Republican Congress Monday, calling for a return to increased domestic and military spending to be paid for in part by higher taxes on the wealthy.      The plan includes a $478 billion public works infrastructure program for roads, bridges, and transit systems, to be financed by taxes on overseas earnings. The budget calls for new tax credits and other initiatives devoted to education, child care, paid leave, and infrastructure, with tax hikes resulting from the closure of tax loopholes. The president also wants to put an end to the automatic across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, calling for a 7% increase in spending over the budget levels he agreed to in a 2011 compromise with Republicans.      "I want to work with Congress to replace mindless austerity with smart investments that strengthen America," Obama said in a speech at the Department of Homeland Security. "I'm not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. It would be bad for our security, and bad for our growth."      Republicans spared no rhetorical flourish in deriding the budget proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called it "another top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left and never balances— ever." House Majority Whip Peter Roskam, R-Ill., compared it to the Seattle Seahawks' disastrous second-and-goal pass in Sunday's Super Bowl.      And more than a few Republicans noted that the budget release deadline happened to fall on Groundhog Day, suggesting a sense of deja vu in Obama's budget.

(Photo: Oliver Douliery, Getty Images)      Modern presidential budget proposals are as much political documents as accounting ones, often declared "dead on arrival" in Congress by opposing political parties. The result has been a series of spending bills funding the government temporarily.      Congress has funded the federal government through the end of the fiscal year in September, with one exception: The Department of Homeland Security. Republicans want to attach conditions on DHS spending that would roll back Obama's executive actions that would defer low-priority deportations for for immigrants not authorized to be in the United States.      Monday, Obama went to the DHS headquarters to tour its operations center and call on Congress to fund the department — and in so doing attempted to cast his economic proposals as vital to national security. He said thousands of Border Patrol agents, airport security screeners, customs personnel, Coast Guard members, and Secret Service agents won't get paid if spending authority expires at the end of the month.      "We need to put politics aside, pass a budget that funds our national security priorities at home and abroad and gives middle class families the security they need to get ahead in the new economy," Obama said. "This is one of our most basic and most important responsibilities of our government."      But Republicans said Obama was the one playing politics with the budget. "Americans are looking for real solutions, not political stunts," said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. He said the House bill funds the Department of Homeland Security while blocking Obama's "executive overreach" on immigration.      Though Republicans dismissed the budget, White House officials said they remain optimistic that individual proposals could still get GOP support.      "The bottom line is infrastructure is traditionally a bipartisan issue," said Jeff Zients, director of the National Economic Council. "Everyone agrees our infrastructure is outdated and needs to be modernized. It's also a twofer in that it supports good paying jobs, good-paying middle class jobs right away and at the same time it sets us up for long-term competitiveness in this global marketplace."      The proposed infrastructure program — $478 billion over six years for roads, bridges and other transit systems — would be financed by a one-time 14% tax on overseas profits, according to the budget.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)      The budget also includes defense spending of $561 billion, some $38 billion over sequestration levels. Defense priorities include the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, resisting Russian aggression in Ukraine, and a "good governance" project in Central America. There, too, the White House hoped to find common ground with Republicans who were always less enthusiastic about the impact of across-the-board budget cuts on defense spending.      "I also think it's important to remember that national security is dependent on more than just the Department of Defense budget," said Shaun Donovan, the White House budget director. "In fact, in the non-defense category is all of the commitments we've made to our veterans. It includes the homeland security budget, which obviously is a critical part of protecting our country."      The projected deficit for Obama's proposed budget is $474 billion. Even given a 10-year budget window, Obama's budget does not balance, and the total national debt would increase from $18.1 trillion today to $26.2 trillion by 2025. But Donovan noted that as a share of gross domestic product, the deficit would under 3%, and "it starts to bend that curve on debt so it stabilizes and then begins to reduce debt" in relation to the size of the economy.      The budget proposes to raise tax revenue by closing loopholes on items involving carried interest, capital gains and trust funds.      Recent years have seen a government shutdown, near-shutdowns and a debt limit crisis, ending with the passage of resolutions that fund the government temporarily, as opposed to a specific budget.      Anyone involved in the process "would acknowledge that this is the beginning of a negotiation," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. "But it's important — budgets are important because they're a way that we can codify our values and our priorities."      Among the economic plans in the proposed budget:      • An expanded child care tax credit of up to $3,000 a child.      • $750 million for a Department of Education preschool development program, an increase of $500 million.      • More than $3 billion for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education.      • A $500 tax credit for "second earners" in working families.      • A $2.2 billion grant program that would encourage states to adopt paid leave programs for employees      • Two years of community college tuition for qualified students, a program that would cost $60 billion over 10 years.      • $1 billion for a "long-term, comprehensive strategy" to develop a Central America "that is fully democratic (and) provides greater economic opportunities."      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1DwelpZ ||||| President Barack Obama’s $4 trillion budget — to be released Monday morning — is best understood as the opening bid in a long hostage negotiation.      It’s Obama’s most muscular effort yet to break free of the strict appropriations caps first imposed in the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 and then greatly tightened in March 2013 after Congress failed to reach agreement on a promised deficit reduction plan.      Story Continued Below      Many Republicans will surely be reluctant to give up this leverage, but the GOP’s own priorities, including defense spending, are caught in the same squeeze. Each party could have an interest, then, in some compromise. But changing the law is a tall order, one that requires Obama’s signature on a Republican-backed bill that can get past a 60-vote point of order in the Senate.      As the caps stand now, appropriations in 2016 would be effectively frozen for a second year at about $1.017 trillion. Obama would increase that to $1.091 trillion — a $74 billion increase that would be split evenly between defense and domestic spending.      In nominal terms, the revised appropriations cap is a level not seen since Democrats last controlled Congress in 2010. But when adjusted for inflation, it’s closer to a midpoint in 2012 when Republicans held the House. And Obama has crafted his numbers so that two-thirds of the additional money would go to defense, veterans and international affairs — all priorities for key Republican players on the Senate Budget Committee.      Indeed, the president’s new populist rhetoric about “middle-class economics” seems to apply more to how he would pay for the new appropriations — not the spending itself.      His budget calls for hiking taxes on capital gains, ending a loophole for inherited wealth and taxing corporate profits stashed abroad. But the spending itself is more down the middle. And Obama would argue that Republicans are only hurting themselves and the nation if they insist on keeping the low caps until he is gone in 2017.      The choices illustrate a larger tension in Washington’s budget battles: how to operate the government in the here-and-now, in the face of political stalemates over the future and seemingly intractable deficits down the road.      For Obama, this has been doubly burdensome since he inherited the financial collapse of 2008 and felt compelled to spend heavily at the outset until the Federal Reserve could step in and stabilize the economy. Those decisions helped spur the rise of the tea party wing in the GOP, and the caps became a way of holding the government hostage until Obama relented on the entitlement reductions demanded by Republicans.      In the years since, the president has been famously feckless about appropriations, but he is back now showing more commitment and boldness.      An 11 percent boost in revenues has helped Obama bring down the deficit to $474 billion — a fraction of what he faced in his early years. And one longtime observer described Obama’s new posture as “a sea change.”      Last year at this time, Obama played with the concept of adding $55.4 billion in what was loosely billed as his “Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative.” This round is much more real. It’s as if the president woke up in November to an epiphany: the gritty world of appropriations is one arena where he still has some leverage with a Republican-controlled Congress.      The much-publicized White House rollout played to the latest headlines to try to make the new spending more relevant.      The budget would offer more money to fight diseases in the wake of the Ebola crisis and new aid for Central America, from which thousands of children fled last year. It promises help for Ukraine, beset by Russia-backed rebels, and more cybersecurity to protect the U.S. at home. Obama will speak Monday at the Department of Homeland Security, which finds itself at center stage in the immigration debate and would get $41.2 billion for the coming year — a healthy increase over its current funding.      For sure, the president’s budget promotes his own climate change and education agenda. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, formerly led by the new budget director, Shaun Donovan, is promised $41 billion, a $6.2 billion increase that would help address the cost of expiring housing vouchers under the Section 8 low-income housing program.      But the $534.3 billion Obama is proposing for the Pentagon stands out most and reflects a two-part strategy for the administration.      The first step is to pump up the base budget for the military. But second, Obama seeks to rein in the Republicans from going around the spending caps by adding off-budget dollars through the overseas contingency operations account.      OCO began as a budgeting tool for overseas military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. But it can be used to pad Pentagon spending at home — a favorite practice for the GOP to placate its hawks. Unless Obama can close this escape route, he will have a harder time bringing Republicans to the table.      Thus, his core Pentagon appropriations request goes up by 8 percent, a $38.2 billion increase to improve readiness but also to begin long-term investments in modernizing submarine and nuclear forces. But Obama’s OCO request is $13.3 billion below what Congress approved in December for 2015.      The White House readily admits that the full $74 billion increase in the president’s budget is too rich for Republicans to swallow. But the bigger problem for Obama may be the offsets he proposes to cover the costs.      Here again, the economy limits the president’s options. The GOP most wants reforms in the costly entitlement programs that make up the larger social safety net. A report last week by the Congressional Budget Office predicts spending will go up by $2.5 trillion over the next decade, of which 60 percent is driven by Social Security and health care programs. The growth in interest costs alone will be greater than the rest of the government. ||||| President Barack Obama released a $4 trillion budget Monday designed to convince Americans that they can have it all: more tax breaks for the middle class, more spending on government programs, and just enough cuts and tax hikes to keep the nation’s deficits under control.      To pay for it, Obama proposed raising a number of taxes on wealthy taxpayers or businesses — some of them already dismissed as nonstarters by the Republican Congress. They include fees on big banks and taxes on companies that do business overseas — plus spending cuts on health programs and other savings — to cover the costs of all the new initiatives.      Story Continued Below      Obama isn’t suggesting enough cuts or tax increases to eliminate deficits completely, not to mention the long-term debt. But he’ll make the case to Americans that bringing deficits down to “sustainable” levels — below 3 percent of the nation’s economic output — is good enough to keep the debt manageable, a senior administration official said.      “We can afford to make these investments while remaining fiscally responsible,” Obama said Monday. “We’ve just got to be smarter about paying for our priorities.”      Obama is using the budget to challenge Republicans on middle-class issues, as well as national security funding. He made his budget pitch during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security, where he warned Republicans that they’ll undermine the nation’s security and hurt the federal workers who work at those agencies — including the Border Patrol, airport screeners, law enforcement officials, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service — if they don’t send him a “clean” funding bill that doesn’t try to block his immigration executive actions.      “Don’t jeopardize our national security over this disagreement,” Obama said. “These Americans aren’t just working to keep us safe – they have to take care of their own families. The notion that they would get caught up in a disagreement around policy that has nothing to do with them makes no sense.”      Republicans wasted no time rejecting Obama’s budget. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it “another top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left and never balances—ever.” House Speaker John Boehner said it “would impose new taxes and more spending without a responsible plan to honestly address the big challenges facing our country.”      And Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi and House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, in a joint statement, declared that “a proposal that never balances is not a serious plan for America’s fiscal future.”      The budget calls for $1.091 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2016, $74 billion above the “sequestration” spending caps that Obama wants to eliminate. The additional spending — $38 billion for defense, $37 billion for domestic programs — would produce a $474 billion deficit for next year.      Obama said the sequestration cuts have been bad for economic growth and national security, and warned: “I’m not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward … I will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and our economic security.”      Administration officials say Obama’s budget would produce $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years, including $400 billion in health savings — mainly by delivering health care more efficiently, building on experiments that are already being tried under Obamacare — and $640 billion in net revenue from capital gains tax increases and other tax changes.      That includes $95 billion in higher tobacco taxes over 10 years to pay for two initiatives: an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program — which ends this year if Congress doesn’t revive it — and Obama’s ongoing proposals to guarantee universal access to preschool. The proposal would nearly double taxes on cigarettes and small cigars to about $1.95 per pack from about $1.01 per pack, and index the tax for inflation.      The budget also counts on savings from getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse — including $32 billion in savings from more frequent reviews of people who get Supplemental Security Income benefits, which are supposed to go to low-income people with disabilities.      The goal is to replace “mindless sequestration cuts with smart reforms,” Office of Management and Budget director Shaun Donovan told reporters at a briefing.      There’s $82 billion in mandatory spending over 10 years to help the families of 1.1 million children afford child care, as well as $1.5 billion in additional funding for Head Start. It also asks Congress to give states more than $2 billion to help them start paid family leave programs.      And Obama wants a 5.5 percent increase in funding for research and development — a total of $146 billion over 10 years — including more money for the National Institutes of Health, scientific research at the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, and a Precision Medicine initiative that will try to develop more personalized approaches to medical treatments and cures.      Obama’s budget is full of taxes and other requests that are likely to come to a screeching halt in a Republican Congress, though — including the higher capital gains tax rate, the tobacco taxes and the closing of what White House officials call the “trust fund loophole,” a provision that allows huge amounts of inherited capital gains to go untaxed.      Obama to Congress: Put politics aside get budget 'done'      It also asks for $239 million to help the Environmental Protection Agency fight climate change, despite the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have promised to block some of the agency’s biggest rules, including a proposed rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions.      And there’s a 7.8 percent increase for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a request that will present a political dilemma for Republicans: Do they want to give more money to the scandal-plagued agency that’s still reeling from last year’s revelations of long waiting lists for veterans’ medical care?      The White House is also counting on $160 billion in savings from comprehensive immigration reform — the same immigration reform proposals that stalled among Republicans last year and are even more dead now that Obama has infuriated the GOP by issuing executive actions to reduce deportations.      Administration officials say it’s in the budget because Obama still supports it, and because the broader immigration legislation would save money by adding younger workers to the workforce, helping to balance out the costs of an aging population. It would also extend the life of the Social Security trust fund by providing more workers to pay taxes into the program.      Donovan insisted that including immigration reform, along with the $400 billion in health savings, proves Obama is serious about cutting the costs of entitlements, despite the lack of major initiatives like raising the Medicare eligibility age or the “chained CPI” proposal Obama has floated in the past to change the formula for Social Security benefits.      “I think we have a strong argument that the president has been focused from the beginning on the key drivers of the costs of our entitlements,” Donovan said.      The Obama team believes it will win over the public with $277 billion in “middle-class and pro-work tax cuts” — including a tax credit for working spouses, a tripling of the maximum child-care tax credit to $3,000 and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit to include low-wage workers without children. Senior administration officials say the tax package will help 44 million families, with an average benefit of $600 per household. They argue that Republicans have previously endorsed ideas similar to some of those proposals.      White House officials say their goal is to keep deficits stable relative to the gross domestic product and bring the long-term debt down slightly. The $474 billion deficit for next year would be about 2.5 percent of GDP, and it would end up in about the same place for 2025 even though the dollar amount would rise to $687 billion. The federal debt — the cumulative total of deficits that the government owes — would start at 75 percent of GDP in 2016 and ease down to 73.3 percent in 2025.      The $400 billion in savings administration officials say they’ll get from mandatory health spending programs — mainly Medicare — are similar to the ones Obama proposed in last year’s budget. They'd cut spending mainly by reducing payments to doctors and other health care providers — going beyond the cuts already included in Obamacare — and by discouraging seniors from buying generous Medigap policies that don’t encourage them to be cost-conscious.      There are other recycled proposals from past budgets that didn’t get anywhere in Congress even when Democrats controlled the Senate. Obama’s budget includes the “Buffett rule,” which would require people with incomes between $1 million and $2 million to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. It would also save money by cutting crop insurance subsidies by $16 billion over 10 years, reviving a proposal from past budgets that never gets any traction in Congress.      Obama’s team says it doesn’t matter if his proposals have stalled out before because his budget should be an expression of his priorities, not the outlines of a final deal with Congress. “The fact that they didn’t pass the first time doesn’t mean they’re not good ideas,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest.      Besides, he said, any budget deal would have to be a compromise between a Republican Congress and a Democratic president, and “anything that emerges from those discussions on the budget will require an effort to find common ground.”      Earnest wouldn’t say whether Obama would veto spending bills from Congress that don’t get rid of the sequestration cuts, but he said the threat of the next round of cuts “does have a negative impact on our ability to help the middle class, and it does have a negative impact on the ability of the men and women of our military to keep the country safe.”      Even though most Republicans have already been blasting the basic framework of the budget — suggesting it’s full of tax increases and will never fly with their side — they haven’t ruled out all hope of dealing with Obama. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan suggested Sunday that he’d like to find “common ground” on corporate tax reform.      Democrats said the budget would give Republicans a serious political challenge. “If the GOP takes this budget and sticks it in a drawer, they’ll be making it crystal clear that they’re more interested in helping special interests than middle class families,” said Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York.      And from early signs, Obama seems to have avoided angering disgruntled liberals with too many compromises on spending.      “If we are serious about rebuilding the disappearing middle class, we need a budget which creates millions of decent-paying jobs, raises wages, makes college affordable and demands that the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations start paying their fair share of taxes,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. “In all these matters, the president’s budget begins to move us in the right direction.”      Brian Faler and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this story. |||||	– President Obama has unveiled his fiscal 2016 budget, and it's not likely to receive a warm welcome from Republicans, Reuters reports. The $3.99 trillion plan for the budget year that begins Oct. 1 is founded on higher taxes both for the wealthy and corporations; some money will come from closing loopholes, USA Today reports. The budget aims "to bring middle-class economics into the 21st century," the White House says. Among its key points: That $3.99 trillion in spending meets with projected revenues of $3.53 trillion, for a deficit of $474 billion, or 2.5% of GDP. The AP reports the plan doesn't zero out the deficit over the next decade, but the administration maintains that various actions on health care, immigration, and taxes would trim the deficits by about $1.8 trillion over that period, leaving the red ink at manageable levels. Indeed, the goal is a "sustainable" deficit below 3% of GDP, Politico reports. Companies like General Electric and Microsoft would face a one-time 14% tax on what's thought to be $2.1 trillion in profits "piled up abroad," Reuters reports; firms would owe 19% on foreign profits in the future. Sequestration spending ceilings would end, USA Today reports, and domestic and military spending would climb by 7%, with infrastructure and education seeing benefits. Some $3 billion would go to science and math education. The bill would also cover two years' tuition for some community college students at a cost of $60 billion over 10 years. Also put forward: an up-to-$3,000 child care tax credit. The plan also puts forward $14 billion for upping cybersecurity, proposes paid-leave programs, and calls for $1 billion put toward a "fully democratic" Central America. Though much of the plan will be distasteful to Republicans, Obama has included significant boosts for GOP priorities like defense, Politico reports, calling the bill an "opening bid in a long hostage negotiation."

(Associated Press)      The fighting took place in an al-Qaida stronghold in western Yemen, haven for a group that attacked the U.S. Embassy here in 2008, killing 10 Yemeni guards and four civilians. A government statement said at least one suspected militant was arrested during the clashes.      "The (Interior) Ministry will continue tracking down al-Qaida terrorists and will continue its strikes against the group until it is totally eliminated," Deputy Interior Minister Brig. Gen. Saleh al-Zawari told senior military officials at a meeting in Mareb, another province believed to shelter al-Qaida fighters.      Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, an offshoot of Osama bin Laden's group, claimed it was behind the attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound airliner. Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old passenger, was arrested Friday after he allegedly tried to bring down the Northwest Airlines flight, carrying 289 people.      U.S. investigators said Abdulmutallab told them he received training and instructions from al-Qaida operatives in Yemen. Yemen's government has said Abdulmutallab spent two periods in the country, from 2004 to 2005 and from August to December of this year, just before the attempted attack.      Abdulmutallab's Yemen connection has drawn attention to al-Qaida's growing presence in the impoverished and lawless country, which is located on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula across the Gulf of Aden from Somalia.      Wednesday's clashes took place in Hudaydah province, an al-Qaida stronghold along the Red Sea coast. A security official said the target was a house owned by an al-Qaida sympathizer. The official said the owner was arrested, a suspected al-Qaida member was injured and several militants who fled were being pursued. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.      Before Wednesday's clashes, Yemeni forces backed by U.S. intelligence carried out two major strikes against al-Qaida hideouts this month, reportedly killing more than 60 militants.      The U.S. has increasingly provided intelligence, surveillance and training to Yemeni forces during the past year, and has provided some firepower, according to a senior U.S. defense official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject.      Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman said Yemen received $67 million in training and support under the Pentagon's counterterrorism program last year, second only to some $112 million spent in Pakistan.      He said the program was not a new one.      "We are going to work with allies and partners to seek out terrorist activity, al-Qaida, wherever they operate, plan their operations, seek safe harbor," he said. "This is an effort that is years old now."      In Holland, the Dutch government issued a preliminary report Wednesday calling the airliner plot professional, but describing the execution as "amateurish."      Dutch Interior Minister Guusje Ter Horst told a news conference Abdulmutallab apparently assembled the explosive device, including 80 grams of PETN, in the aircraft toilet, then planned to detonate it with a syringe of chemicals. She said the explosives appeared to have been professionally prepared and then given to Abdulmutallab.      President Barack Obama has demanded a preliminary report by Thursday on what went wrong in the Detroit case. Obama said the intelligence community should have been able to piece together information that would have raised "red flags" and possibly prevented Abdulmutallab from boarding the airliner.      Abdulmutallab had been placed in one broad database, but he never made it onto more restrictive lists, despite his father's warnings to U.S. Embassy officials in Nigeria last month.      Abdulmutallab attended a two-week seminar in Houston in August 2008 that was conducted by the AlMaghrib Institute, a Web-based Islamic education center, said Waleed Basyouni, vice president of the institute. The institute is cooperating with authorities, he said.      Meanwhile, officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday that a man tried to board a commercial airliner in the Somali capital of Mogadishu last month carrying powdered chemicals, liquid and a syringe in a case bearing chilling similarities to the Detroit airliner plot.      The Somali man _ whose name has not yet been released _ was arrested by African Union peacekeeping troops before the Nov. 13 Daallo Airlines flight took off. It had been scheduled to travel from Mogadishu to the northern Somali city of Hargeisa, then to Djibouti and Dubai.      The aborted attack in Detroit was launched almost a year after al-Qaida's operations in Yemen and Saudi Arabia united to form Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, making Yemen its base.      Shortly after Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was formed, Saudi Arabia announced a list of 85 most wanted militants outside its borders. It said 11 of them were former Guantanamo detainees who had gone through its rehabilitation program. Three were confirmed to have gone to Yemen. They included Abu al-Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi, who later surrendered in Yemen and was handed over to Saudis, Said al-Shihri, the group's No. 2 and Youssef al-Shihri, who was killed in a clash with Saudis in southern Saudi Arabia.      The Yemeni roots of the attack threaten to complicate U.S. efforts to empty the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, where nearly half the remaining detainees are from Yemen.      Finding a home for them is key to Obama's pledge to close the prison, but emerging details of the plot are renewing concerns about Yemen's capacity to contain militants and growing al-Qaida safe havens.      Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., noted that of the 90 men remaining at Guantanamo, more than 60 have been identified as dangerous by the Pentagon.      "Yet, in the past few weeks, the Obama Administration has overseen the repatriation of six Yemenis from Guantanamo back to their home country," he said. "As we learn more about Abdulmutallab's ties to Yemen and AQAP, it is increasingly clear that the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo is a flawed process demanding immediate review."      Abdulmutallab spent about five months in Yemen leading up to the airliner attack and a year before that in 2004-2005, Yemeni officials said.      Administrators at the San'a Institute for the Arabic Language said he was enrolled at the school during both periods to study Arabic. But staff and students said he spent at most one month at the school starting in late August. His time through December is unaccounted for.      Acquaintances described the strict Islamic life he led, rejecting music, TV and mixing with women. All of them expressed surprise that the quiet man they knew would even consider to carry out such an act.      "I saw him once tenderly kiss a baby," said Ahmed Mohammed, a teacher at the institute. "Today, he's turned into a monster who would have killed children if the operation had succeeded."      ___      Abu-Nasr contributed from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Adam Schreck from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ||||| The US is planning retaliatory strikes in Yemen against al-Qaida over its attempt to blow up a transatlantic flight on Christmas Day.      American officials say intelligence efforts are focused on identifying and tracking down those who plotted to put Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on the plane with enough explosive in his underwear to bring down the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam. But they warn that finding those responsible is unlikely to be swift and say that identifying other "high-value" al-Qaida targets for retaliatory attack would also be a priority.      "First we have to find out who put Abdulmutallab on the plane with the bomb," said a US official working alongside intelligence organisations. "He's providing some leads and we're not dealing with an unknown quantity here. We've been watching and listening to what goes on in Yemen and we may have pieces of the puzzle already and just need to fit it together.      "If and when we identify them then we plan how to deal with them. Who they are is one thing, where they are is another.If they're still in Yemen and we can get a lock on them then it won't be too difficult to know what to do. But they know who they are and won't be standing out. After that we can move with the president's authorisation. I don't think there's much doubt that authorisation will be forthcoming, but no one should think all of this is going to happen overnight."      The official acknowledged that there was likely to be political and public pressure on Barack Obama to strike back at al-Qaida, particularly with Republican opponents breaking with the usual solidarity on national security issues to accuse him of weakness and making America vulnerable to attack.      "The people we want are the ones who put Abdulmutallab on the plane. Until we can get them there are other high-value targets that will make the point that attacking America does not go unpunished," said the official.      But given the regular attacks against al-Qaida in Yemen, these may have a greater impact on American public opinion than on the extremist group.      The US has been conducting a covert assault with drone attacks on al-Qaida bases for about a year, while CIA agents inside the country help direct ground operations. American special forces have been training the Yemeni military and may have been involved in raids.      General David Petraeus, the American regional commander, and John Brennan, the president's counterterrorism adviser, both visited Yemen this year.      Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate's homeland security committee, who visited Yemen in August, described the country this week as a focus of the assault on al-Qaida. "Yemen now becomes one of the centres of that fight. We have a growing presence there – and we have to – of special operations, Green Berets, intelligence," he said.      Yesterday, Yemeni forces targeted Nasser Ahmed al-Ahdal, a former prisoner released after renouncing violence but believed to have renewed links to al-Qaida. One man was injured and captured but Ahdal and two others escaped.      Several al-Qaida members killed in raids by Yemeni forces in the past fortnight had been released or had escaped from prison. Others who have left jail to rejoin the fight include Nasser al-Wahayshi, the Yemeni leader of al-Qaida, who escaped along with 22 others from prison in Yemen in 2006. His deputy, Saeed al-Shihri, joined al-Qaida in Yemen last year after being released to Saudi Arabia from Guantánamo.      While intelligence officials plan how to hit back abroad, they are under pressure at home after Obama blamed intelligence failings for Abdulmutallab being allowed to board a plane to the US.      The president has ordered that a preliminary report be delivered to him today tomorrow explaining how the young Nigerian managed to smuggle the explosives on to the flight.      The criticism is focused on the CIA and the national counterterrorism centre (NCC) established after 9/11. The CIA is under scrutiny because it picked up intelligence from Yemen that a Nigerian was involved in a forthcoming attack at about the same time that Abdulmutallab's father told US diplomats in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, that his son had become radicalised in Yemen and was a possible threat. That information was shared with CIA officials in Abuja who passed it on to the NCC, but it was apparently not matched with the intelligence from Yemen. On Tuesday Obama condemned the failure to share information and other intelligence failings as "totally unacceptable". |||||	– The US is planning fresh drone strikes on al-Qaeda leaders in Yemen in the wake of the attempted Detroit Christmas bombing. Officials say they are working to identify the militant leaders responsible for the "underwear bomber," and will strike any militant leaders are soon as they are located, the Guardian reports. "The people we want are the ones who put Abdulmutallab on the plane," said one official. "Until we can get them, there are other high-value targets that will make the point that attacking America does not go unpunished." Yemen's government has vowed to wipe out the country's al-Qaeda offshoot group. Security forces raided an al-Qaeda hideout in western Yemen today and killed at least one militant, AP reports.
summarize: A dying goldfish suffering from a head tumour will live to swim another day after undergoing life-threatening surgery.      George, a standard goldfish, was admitted to Lort Smith Animal Hospital in North Melbourne last week to undergo surgery for a tumour that was "affecting his quality of life".      Dr Tristan Rich, who performed the intricate surgery, said 10-year-old George was unable to swim and eat properly, and was starting to "really suffer".      "I gave then owner the option of trying to take [the tumour] off, or putting him to sleep," he said.      He said George's owner, a woman, was "quite attached" to the fish, and wanted to do everything she could for him.      The surgery, which included putting the fish under general anaesthetic, took about 45 minutes, Dr Rich said.      Advertisement      "It's a very fiddly procedure, and you have to be very careful about blood loss," he explained.      The surgery cost about $200, which is the same amount a dog or cat owner would pay.

"Every day I'll do something different like this - operate on a little frog, or treat budgies, lizards, snakes and wildlife," Dr Rich said.      Despite their size, he said goldfish could live up to 30 years if looked after properly.

On its Facebook page, the Lort Smith Animal Hospital explains how Dr. Tristan Rich knocked George out by putting him in a bucket of anesthetic-laced water, removed the tumor, and then sealed the wound with sutures and tissue glue. The 10-year-old fish is now swimming around again and could live for another 20 years, the animal hospital says. The fish's owner was "quite attached" to the pet and decided to pay $200 for the surgery instead of having him put to sleep after he was starting to "really suffer" from the tumor and couldn't swim or eat properly, the vet tells the Sydney Morning Herald. The vet adds that the main cost was the anesthetic and the procedure would have cost about the same for a dog or cat.

summarize: BEIJING — A woman who was forced by local officials to abort a seven-month-old fetus this month and whose case has spurred a national discussion about China’s one-child policy said on Tuesday that she was “under a lot of pressure” and was being watched by guards in a hospital, who do not allow her to leave.      The woman, Feng Jianmei, has been in a county hospital in Shaanxi Province since her child, a girl, was stillborn after officials induced labor on June 2. Ms. Feng’s sister-in-law, also at the hospital, said Tuesday that her brother — Ms. Feng’s husband — was beaten last week and that local officials had led peasants in a march to denounce the family members as “traitors.”      The reported harassment came despite the fact that local officials were punished for the forced abortion after a photograph of the bedridden mother and the bloody fetus was posted on the Internet in mid-June. Xinhua, the state news agency, reported Tuesday night that after an investigation, two county-level or lower officials were fired, and five others received warnings or demerits. The report also said the county government had been ordered to give a living subsidy to Ms. Feng.      Ms. Feng’s case has been a topic of intense discussion on the Internet.      Hu Xijin, the chief editor of Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often prints nationalistic editorials, wrote on his microblog on June 12 that what Ms. Feng had endured was “barbaric.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “We should promote civilized family planning,” he wrote. “However, I am against using this one incident to reject China’s family planning policies. Family planning has served China rather than harmed it.” ||||| Image caption A banner was hung up reading "beat the traitors, drive them from the town" as the couple left hospital      The husband of a Chinese woman forced to have a late-term abortion has gone into hiding and her family are being harassed, a relative has said.      Feng Jianmei was made to terminate her pregnancy at seven months as she could not pay the fine for violating China's one-child policy.      Photos showing her with the foetus caused widespread condemnation when they were leaked on the web.      Officials apologised, but the couple are now apparently being hounded.      A relative of the theirs told reporters that the family had been harassed since leaving hospital, possibly with the tacit encouragement of local government officials who have been embarrassed by the scandal.      She said Ms Feng's husband Deng Jiyuan had gone into hiding on Sunday.      'Sanctioned violence'      Pictures circulating on the internet appear to show a large red banner saying "beat the traitors, drive them from the town" strung up in the family's town in Shaanxi province.      "On Sunday evening, we decided to go home [from hospital] and a lot of people had gathered outside," the relative, who wished to remain anonymous, said.      "They hung banners on a bridge and many people came and shouted that we were traitors. Now wherever we go, people follow us."      China's one-child family planning policy aims to control the country's population, which now stands at around 1.3bn.      Rights groups say the law has meant women being coerced into abortions, which Beijing denies.      "Feng Jianmei's story demonstrates how the one-child policy continues to sanction violence against women every day," said Chai Ling of the US-based activist group All Girls Allowed.      The group says it spoke to Ms Feng and her husband Deng Jiyuan after the incident. Mr Deng said his wife had been forcibly taken to hospital and restrained before the procedure. |||||	– The Chinese couple forced into a late-term abortion that prompted international anger over China's one-child policy have been facing relentless harassment for being "traitors"—abuse that has driven the husband into hiding, a family member tells the BBC. The 23-year-old wife, Feng Jianmei, is still in the hospital, and she tells the New York Times that she is "under a lot of pressure" and that guards won't let her leave. Recounts the other family member to the BBC: "They hung banners on a bridge and many people came and shouted that we were traitors. Now wherever we go, people follow us." An image shows a local banner reading "beat the traitors, drive them from the town." Local officials apologized over the abortion, but the family fears they are tacitly encouraging the protesters. The husband was reportedly beaten while on his way to see a civil rights lawyer.

Edwards died of congestive... (Associated Press)      Grammy-winning Blues musician David "Honey Boy" Edwards, believed to be the oldest surviving Delta bluesman and whose roots stretched back to blues legend Robert Johnson, died early Monday in his Chicago home, his manager said. He was 96.      Edwards had a weak heart and his health seriously declined in May, when the guitarist had to cancel concerts scheduled through November, said his longtime manager, Michael Frank of Earwig Music Company.      Born in 1915 in Shaw, Mississippi, Edwards learned the guitar growing up and started playing professionally at age 17 in Memphis.      He came to Chicago in the 1940s and played on Maxwell Street, small clubs and street corners. By the 1950s Edwards had played with almost every bluesman of note _ including Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Charlie Patton and Muddy Waters. Among Edwards' hit songs were "Long Tall Woman Blues," "Gamblin Man" and "Just Like Jesse James."      Edwards played his last shows in April at the Juke Joint Festival in Mississippi, Frank said.      "Blues ain't never going anywhere," Edwards told The Associated Press in 2008. "It can get slow, but it ain't going nowhere. You play a lowdown dirty shame slow and lonesome, my mama dead, my papa across the sea I ain't dead but I'm just supposed to be blues. You can take that same blues, make it uptempo, a shuffle blues, that's what rock `n' roll did with it. So blues ain't going nowhere. Ain't goin' nowhere."      Edwards won a 2008 Grammy for traditional blues album and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2010. His death represents the loss of the last direct link to the first generation of Mississippi blues musicians, Frank said.      "That piece of the history from that generation, people have to read about it from now on," Frank said. "They won't be able to experience the way the early guys played it, except from somebody who's learned it off of a record."      Edwards was known for being an oral historian of the music genre and would tell biographical stories between songs at his shows, Frank said. He was recorded for the Library of Congress in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1942.      "He had photographic memory of every fine detail of his entire life," Frank said. "All the way up until he died. He had so much history that so many other musicians didn't have and he was able to tell it."      Edwards gathered those stories in the 1997 book "The World Don't Owe Me Nothing: The Life and Times of Delta Bluesman Honeyboy Edwards." He wrote in the book that his father bought a guitar for $8 from a sharecropper and Edwards learned to play in 1929.      "I watched my daddy play that guitar, and whenever I could I would pick it up and strum on it," Edwards wrote.      Edwards was known for his far-ranging travels and played internationally. In his 90s, he was still playing about 70 shows a year. Edwards would visit with the audience after every show, taking pictures, signing autographs and talking with fans, Frank said.      Edwards earned his nickname "Honey Boy" from his sister, who told his mother to "look at honey boy" when Edwards stumbled as he learned to walk as a toddler. He is survived by his daughter Betty Washington and stepdaughter Dolly McGinister.      "He had his own unique style," Frank said. "But it was a 75-year-old style and it was a synthesis of the people before him and in his time."      ___      Online: http://www.davidhoneyboyedwards.com/ ||||| Photo      David Honeyboy Edwards, believed to have been the oldest surviving member of the first generation of Delta blues singers, died on Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 96.      His death was announced by his manager, Michael Frank.      Mr. Edwards’s career spanned nearly the entire recorded history of the blues, from its early years in the Mississippi Delta to its migration to the nightclubs of Chicago and its emergence as an international phenomenon.      Over eight decades Mr. Edwards knew or played with virtually every major figure who worked in the idiom, including Charley Patton, Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf. He was probably best known, though, as the last living link to Robert Johnson, widely hailed as the King of the Delta Blues. The two traveled together, performing on street corners and at picnics, dances and fish fries during the 1930s.      “We would walk through the country with our guitars on our shoulders, stop at people’s houses, play a little music, walk on,” Mr. Edwards said in an interview with the blues historian Robert Palmer, recalling his peripatetic years with Johnson. “We could hitchhike, transfer from truck to truck, or, if we couldn’t catch one of them, we’d go to the train yard, ’cause the railroad was all through that part of the country then.” He added, “Man, we played for a lot of peoples.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Edwards had earlier apprenticed with the country bluesman Big Joe Williams. Unlike Williams and many of his other peers, however, Mr. Edwards did not record commercially until after World War II. Field recordings he made for the Library of Congress under the supervision of the folklorist Alan Lomax in 1942 are the only documents of Mr. Edwards’s music from his years in the Delta. |||||	– The last survivor of the original Mississippi Delta bluesmen has died at the age of 96. David "Honeyboy" Edwards, whose sharecropper parents taught him the guitar as a child, played with all the genre's big names during his 80-year career, including "King of the Delta Blues" Robert Johnson, the New York Times reports. Edwards and Johnson traveled the country together in the '30s, performing on street corners and at picnics and dances. After decades on the road, he made his home in Chicago in the '50s and performed frequently in the city's clubs. Edwards, who won a 2008 Grammy for traditional blues and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2010, performed more than 70 shows a year into his 90s and was still playing occasionally until earlier this year.

The work, led by Marilyn Cornelis, a research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found a total of eight genes, two of which had been identified in prior work by Cornelis and others. Two of the new genes were related to metabolism of caffeine and two were related to its psychoactive effects.      The two remaining genes are related to lipid and glucose metabolism, but their role in coffee consumption is unclear. They present a possible avenue of investigation, Cornelis said.      The discoveries provide insight on why caffeine affects people differently, and how these effects influence coffee-drinking behavior, Cornelis said. One person, for example, may feel energized on a daily cup of coffee, while another might need four cups to feel the same effect. If the one-cup-a-day person consumes four cups, Cornelis said, he or she might feel jittery or experience digestive issues, discouraging that level of consumption going forward.      Though there has been disagreement over coffee’s health effects in the past, Cornelis said evidence of its benefits has been mounting. In fact, Cornelis herself — who never liked coffee — has been persuaded to try to cultivate the habit.      “I’m not a coffee drinker; I hate the taste of it,” Cornelis said. “If there were more people like me in the study we wouldn’t have found those genes.”      The new genes explain about 1.3 percent of our coffee-drinking behavior, Cornelis said. Though that may seem like a small amount, it is about the same as that reported for other habitual behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, she said.      Culture is a probably sizable influence, researchers said, but there’s also a strong chance that additional genes remain to be found, perhaps many more. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.      The work was conducted by the international Coffee and Caffeine Genetics Consortium, which was launched two years ago, Cornelis said, by investigators who had published parallel work on caffeine-related genes. The researchers joined forces and recruited additional investigators, with each team contributing DNA samples and data sets, including surveys of the coffee-drinking habits of 120,000 people of European and African-American ancestry.      The analysis involved searching for consumption patterns and single “letter” changes in the genetic code called single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. The study’s senior author, Daniel Chasman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in a statement that the work is an example of how genetics can influence habitual behaviors.      The genes found so far might represent only the tip of the iceberg on coffee consumption, Cornelis said. Not only may there be more genes involved in caffeine metabolism, coffee is rich in active compounds in addition to caffeine, some of which may also have physiological effects.      “The next question is who is benefiting most from coffee,” Cornelis said. “If, for example, caffeine is protective, individuals might have very similar physiological exposure to caffeine, once you balance the metabolism. But if coffee has other potentially protective constituents, those levels are going to be higher if you consume more cups, so they might actually be benefitting from non-caffeine components of coffee. So it’s a little bit complex.” ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — How much coffee do you drink every day? One cup in the morning? Or do you gulp it all day?

Now a huge study has identified some genes that may play a role.      Their apparent effect is quite small. But variations in such genes may modify coffee's effect on a person's health, and so genetic research may help scientists explore that, said Marilyn Cornelis of the Harvard School of Public Health. She led the research.      The project analyzed the results of about two dozen previous studies with a combined total of more than 120,000 participants. Those participants had described how much coffee they drink a day, and allowed their DNA to be scanned. The new work looked for minute differences in their DNA that were associated with drinking more or less coffee.      Researchers found eight such variants, two of which had already been linked to coffee consumption.      Four of the six new variants implicate genes that are involved with caffeine, either in how the body breaks it down or in its stimulating effects, the researchers said in a paper released Tuesday by the journal Molecular Psychiatry.      The two other newly implicated genes were a surprise because there's no clear biological link to coffee or caffeine, Cornelis said. They are instead involved with cholesterol levels and blood sugar.      Marian Neuhouser, a nutrition researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and study co-author, said identifying genes related to consumption may one day help doctors identify patients who need extra help in cutting down on coffee if recommended. For example, pregnant women are advised to consume only moderate amounts of caffeine because of risk of miscarriage and preterm birth, she said.      None of the identified genetic variants was related to how intensely a person tastes coffee, and Cornelis said that surprised her.      She doesn't drink coffee, she said, because she can't stand the stuff.      ___      Online:      Molecular Psychiatry: http://www.nature.com/mp      ___      Malcolm Ritter can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/malcolmritter |||||	– Whether you drink a cup or a pot of coffee per day depends in part on your DNA, as scientists have previously shown. Now, however, a research team has gone further, naming eight specific genes—six of them newly identified—that play a role in your coffee intake, the AP reports. In a paper out today in Molecular Psychiatry, the researchers explain that two of the newly found genes deal with how your body metabolizes caffeine; two are connected to its psychoactive properties, the Harvard Gazette reports. The other two new genes haven't been biologically tied to caffeine—or even coffee—at all, the AP reports; they're connected to cholesterol and blood sugar. The identified genes don't account for a huge proportion of your habits: They're responsible for about 1.3% of how much you guzzle. Still, that's comparable in size to the known role of genetics in alcohol and tobacco use, says head researcher Marilyn Cornelis. One's culture could play a more significant role, the Gazette notes, and the researchers think there may be more related genes out there. The study's data combined information from many previous studies, covering about 120,000 people.
