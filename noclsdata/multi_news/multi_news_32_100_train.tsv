summarize: A Florida teacher is being investigated after parents said he had students participate in the drowning of raccoons and chickens at school on Monday.      A Forest Hill High School parent told FOX51 that her son took photographs of the harrowing acts with the animals. Her son told her the creatures were trapped in cages as they were being drowned.      “My son stood in the background, hid his phone and watched as they filled these trash cans full of water, and held these raccoons down in trash cans in the cages,” the parent told the station. “I was disgusted. At first, I was in shock, of course, but I watched the video, and it’s horrific. It’s disgusting, and I can’t believe it happened at school."      The teacher was identified as agriculture teacher Dewie Brewton, according to the Ocala Star-Banner. He was removed pending an investigation.      “We received statements that the teacher drowned multiple animals in front of students, and with student participation, because the animals were nuisance animals to the [agriculture] program at the school,” Marion County School District spokesman Kevin Christian told the Star-Banner.      The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission launched an investigation after parents notified the agency, according to FOX51.      “The FWC takes these matters seriously,” the agency said in a statement. ||||| OCALA, Fla. -- An investigation is underway after a teacher at a Florida high school was accused of drowning wild animals in a garbage can while students watched and assisted, CBS Orlando affiliate WKMG reports. A Florida mother said her son was made to stand with his fellow high school classmates this week and drown two raccoons and an opossum.      "It made me sick. It made me sick to my stomach," said the mother, who asked to remain anonymous.      The woman said one raccoon ate a chicken that students at Forest High school in Ocala, Florida, were raising. The teacher then caught raccoons in cages, "took the cages, filled up large trash cans full of water, and had the children drown the raccoons in the cages inside the water, inside the trash cans," she said.      Pictures and video taken by the student show a raccoon in a metal trap, which the teacher and students lifted into a garbage bin while it filled up with hose water, WKMG reported. One video shows the tip of a raccoon's snout sticking out just above the surface of the water.      "When the raccoons tried to come up for air they had metal rods and they held them down with metal rods and when the raccoon would try to pop its head up they held water hoses in its face to drown it," said the mother, who said her son came home from school in tears after the incident, the station reported.      WARNING: Viewers may find this video disturbing      She said two raccoons were killed Monday and that an opossum found later was killed "just for sport," WKMG reports.      The teacher of the agriculture class was placed on paid leave Tuesday. Marion County Public Schools officials said they are investigating.      "While law enforcement tells us the teacher did not do anything illegal, his actions before students are certainly questionable," a spokesperson said. "Until our investigation is complete, I cannot share further details. The district is determining the status of the teacher at this moment."      The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is looking into how the raccoons were killed, according to a spokesman. Those findings will be presented to officials with the state attorney's office, who will decide if criminal charges are appropriate.      In March, a junior high biology teacher in Idaho reportedly fed a puppy to a snapping turtle in front of students. ||||| Students also participated, according to Marion County Public Schools.      A Forest High School agriculture teacher was placed on administrative leave with pay on Tuesday after students said the teacher drowned nuisance animals in class.      Dewie Brewton, the school's agriculture teacher, was removed from the class "pending the outcome of a district investigation," officials said.      "We received statements that the teacher drowned multiple animals in front of students, and with student participation, because the animals were nuisance animals to the ag program at the school," said Kevin Christian, School District spokesman.      The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission issued a statement Tuesday saying that it "is looking into an incident that occurred at Forest High School in Marion County involving a raccoon."      The agency said its officers are investigating to determine the legality of what occurred.      "The FWC takes these matters seriously," the statement says.

According to his biography page on the Forest website, Brewton has been the school FFA adviser since 2006. He also lists "FNGLA Industry Certification." FNGLA is short for Florida Nursery, Growers and Landscape Association.      In 2010, he was Forest's nominee for Golden Apple Teacher of the Year. |||||	– A Florida high school agriculture teacher has been accused of drowning wild animals in a trash can as students watched and participated, CBS reports.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., a Russian lawyer and others, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.      The sources also said special counsel Robert Mueller had convened a grand jury in Washington to investigate allegations of Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections. ||||| The increased financial focus hasn't gone unnoticed by Trump, who warned Mueller, via an interview with The New York Times , that his financial dealings were a red line that investigators shouldn't cross. But the order establishing the special counsel makes clear Mueller is authorized to investigate any matters that "arose or may arise directly from the investigation."      In response to this CNN story, the President's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said, "President's outside counsel has not received any requests for documentation or information about this. Any inquiry from the special counsel that goes beyond the mandate specified in the appointment we would object to."      In 2015, the FBI began investigating cyber breaches targeting US political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee.      In the summer of 2016, US intelligence agencies noticed a spate of curious contacts between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian intelligence, according to current and former US officials briefed on the investigation. James Comey, in his Senate testimony, said the FBI opened an investigation into Trump campaign-Russia connections in July 2016. The strands of the two investigations began to merge.      In the months that followed, investigators turned up intercepted communications appearing to show efforts by Russian operatives to coordinate with Trump associates on damaging Hillary Clinton's election prospects, officials said. CNN has learned those communications included references to campaign chairman Paul Manafort.      A year later, the FBI is reviewing financial records related to the Trump Organization, as well as Trump, his family members, including Donald Trump Jr., and campaign associates. They've combed through the list of shell companies and buyers of Trump-branded real estate properties and scrutinized the roster of tenants at Trump Tower reaching back more than a half-dozen years. They've looked at the backgrounds of Russian business associates connected to Trump surrounding the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. CNN could not determine whether the review has included his tax returns.      In recent weeks, investigators have also started looking into the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower and how the White House responded to news of that meeting. The session included Trump Jr., Manafort, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a Russian attorney.      Trump has denied any collusion and maintains that his business empire has "no involvement with Russia" and that he has "no loans, no nothing" from Russia. His lawyers have detailed a few exceptions, including the Miss Universe pageant he held in Moscow and the Florida mansion he sold to a Russian oligarch in 2008. Trump earned more than $100 million from those deals, according to his lawyers.      "This is like any investigation," says one person briefed on the probe. "You start at the core and then move to the periphery. You have to explore the finances. Where this is going is no different from any investigation."      The Mueller Team      Since his appointment in May, Mueller has quietly gathered a team of more than three dozen attorneys, investigators and other staff in a nondescript office in Washington. Officials familiar with the probe describe it as akin to a small US attorney's office, with FBI agents and prosecutors assigned to separate groups looking into various aspects of the investigation.      These include groups of investigators and lawyers focused separately on Russian collusion and obstruction of justice, as well as the investigations focused on Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, according to a US official briefed on the investigation. Some of the investigators have been pulled from field offices across the country to join the Mueller team in Washington. Others left high-paying jobs at law firms. Many of the investigators have backgrounds in investigating fraud and financial crimes. There are 16 attorneys assigned to the probe, according to a spokesman for Mueller.      Mueller reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but there's a measure of separation from Justice Department headquarters to keep the probe independent.      CNN has learned some of the investigators involved in the probe are buying liability insurance out of concern they could become targets of lawsuits from those who are being investigated, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. The Justice Department covers legal fees for employees sued in the course of their duties, but some of the lawyers want extra protection.      The Justice Department and special counsel's office both declined to comment on the liability concerns.      Bait and Switch      The possible financial ties between Trump and Russia were part of the concerns for US intelligence and law enforcement officials from the beginning, according to one current law enforcement official and one former US intelligence official.      In some cases, the FBI was pursuing others who did business with the Trump organization, including alleged mobsters who controlled key contractors used by many real estate developers in New York during the 1980s. The flow of Russian money in real estate -- and concerns that some buyers were making the purchases to illegally launder money -- had also drawn some attention by US authorities to the Trump business.      The international real estate business is a part of the global economy where foreigners can still use cash with fewer questions asked about the sources of money. Terrorism financing concerns long ago put more stringent rules on banking and other businesses. But the rules are looser in the business of buying and selling high-end real estate, US officials say.      Investigators are looking both at whether financial laws were broken and whether there are any dealings that could put the President or his associates in a compromising position.      "There's always been a concern about his exposure to blackmail in his financial dealings," says the person briefed on the investigation.      Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has no enduring financial ties to Russian interests.      But some of the people who are now under scrutiny by Mueller see a bait and switch. Instead of collusion, many believe the Mueller probe will instead end up being about past financial troubles.      "They launch an investigation into collusion in the election," says one person whose client is among those being scrutinized by the Mueller investigators. "Then they go after people because of old business matters that have nothing to do with collusion."      Missing Links      Even at the FBI, there's a measure of frustration over the investigation.      After a highly contentious year investigating Hillary Clinton's private email servers and being accused of swinging the election against her, the FBI finds itself again where officials tried not to be: amid a politically treacherous investigation that has hobbled a new President.      Worse yet, some FBI officials fear the question of whether there was any criminal coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia may never be answered.      One challenge is that tantalizing pieces of intelligence are missing key links because they did not develop long enough for investigators to determine their significance. These include intercepts monitored by US intelligence that showed suggestions of illegal coordination but nothing overt.      Those missing links mean that the FBI and Mueller's prosecution team may not have enough evidence to bring charges related to possible illegal coordination with a foreign intelligence service. Instead, prosecutors could pursue financial crime charges unrelated to the election.      Investigators also face a big hurdle: those participating in the intercepted communications were foreigners, outside the reach of the FBI, who may be exaggerating or lying about events.      Some FBI officials also blame media coverage dating back to last summer for prompting some communications to cease, and making it more difficult for investigators to monitor the interactions of Russians and campaign associates.      Scrambling to react      By last July when Russian intelligence began releasing troves of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, the FBI had been aware of the DNC intrusion about a year.      Until the stolen emails were weaponized in their release via WikiLeaks and the Russian intelligence's own site DCLeaks, intelligence and law enforcement officials believed the cyber-intrusion was an intelligence-gathering effort, like many of those that occurred before past elections.      Over the next four months, the Obama administration officials and law enforcement and intelligence agencies debated how to respond.      "You had an administration that didn't want to look heavy-handed" in favor of Hillary Clinton, one senior former US official involved in investigation said.      At the White House, Obama officials scrambled last summer for a strategy on how to respond to what they already knew were Russian actions, well before the administration was willing to point the finger publicly.      Michael Daniel, the White House cyber-security coordinator, ordered staff in August to draw up a list of possible retaliatory measures, according to a former administration official briefed on the matter. These included planting malware in Russian infrastructure that could be activated if the Russian actions escalated, according to the former official.      But shortly after Daniel gave the order, White House officials raised other concerns. Top officials including Susan Rice, national security adviser, and Lisa Monaco, homeland security adviser, led efforts by the White House to make sure the government could prevent any move by Russian intelligence to tamper with the voting infrastructure and sow chaos on Election Day.      Daniel, in an interview, declined to discuss specifics about measures considered in response, because much of the information remains classified. But he said one top concern for White House officials was "it not appear we were trying to be partisan in what we were doing."      The partisan concerns were exacerbated by interactions between the White House and congressional leaders. Monaco traveled to Capitol Hill to try to get top leaders of both parties to send a letter to state governors to urge shoring up of their defenses of election infrastructure. But they were rebuffed by Republican leaders, who viewed the request as partisan, according to current and former officials briefed on the discussions.      Daniel told CNN he and his cyber-response group worked quietly, reducing the number of people allowed in meetings to avoid leaks. "We didn't need to do the Russians work for them," Daniel said. "We needed to develop diplomatic options first, and we [put] the other options on the back-burner."      After the election, the Obama administration unveiled a series of measures , including expulsion of diplomats and seizure of Russian diplomatic compounds allegedly used for espionage. The technical staff also released a trove of information on Russian cyber-intrusion techniques and malware that current and former officials say forced the Russians to spend time and money coming up with new methods.      Four Targets      The approach to the Manafort and Flynn probes may offer a template for how investigators' focus on possible financial crimes could help gain leverage and cooperation in the investigation.      CNN has learned that investigators became more suspicious when they turned up intercepted communications that US intelligence agencies collected among suspected Russian operatives discussing their efforts to work with Manafort, who served as campaign chairman for three months, to coordinate information that could damage Hillary Clinton's election prospects, the US officials say. The suspected operatives relayed what they claimed were conversations with Manafort, encouraging help from the Russians.      Manafort faces potential real troubles in the probe, according to current and former officials. Decades of doing business with foreign regimes with reputations for corruption, from the Philippines to Ukraine, had led to messy finances      The focus now for investigators is whether Manafort was involved in money laundering or tax violations in his business dealings with pro-Russia parties in Ukraine. He's also been drawn into a related investigation of his son-in-law's real estate business dealings, some of which he invested in.      Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing.      In response to questions about CNN's reporting, his spokesman, Jason Maloni, says it "is becoming increasingly apparent that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russian government."      Maloni offered further comment to CNN after the initial publication of this story, saying: "Paul Manafort did not collude with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election or to hack the DNC. Other than that comment, we aren't going to respond to anonymous officials illegally peddling second hand conspiracy theories. But the Justice Department, and the courts if necessary, should hold someone to account for the flood of unlawful government leaks targeting Mr. Manafort."      Flynn drew suspicions in late 2016 when US spy agencies collecting the communications of Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak found Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, discussing the subject of US sanctions on Russia. That appeared to contradict White House claims that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Kislyak.      On January 24, Andrew McCabe, then the deputy FBI director, called Flynn at his White House office. He told the retired lieutenant general that he was sending a couple of FBI agents to discuss a matter with him, according to people familiar with what unfolded. Flynn spoke to McCabe without his lawyer present.      At the FBI, the decision to approach Flynn was debated at the highest levels, including by Comey, according to sources familiar with those discussions. FBI officials considered the visit by agents a "duty to warn" matter, a not-uncommon effort by the FBI to warn a US official that foreign spies may be trying to target them.      The agents asked Flynn about the Kislyak calls, in part out of concern that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail over the content of the conversations. Flynn gave a wobbly explanation of events. He initially denied the sanctions discussions, then later claimed he couldn't remember.      Despite the conflicting accounts, FBI investigators have leaned against seeking charges over the Kislyak discussions. The investigators don't consider Flynn's answers to be intentionally dishonest.      Flynn's lawyers have criticized media reports about his connection to the Russia investigation as peddling "unfounded allegations" and "outrageous claims."      More troublesome for Flynn, investigators have focused on his lobbying work for the Turkish government , which the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief didn't initially disclose as required by law. Flynn's lawyers have since retroactively registered his lobbying.      Page had been the subject of a secret intelligence surveillance warrant since 2014, earlier than had been previously reported, US officials briefed on the probe told CNN.      When information emerged last summer suggesting that the Russians were attempting to cultivate Page as a way to gain an entrée into the Trump campaign , the FBI renewed its interest in him. Initially, FBI counterintelligence investigators saw the campaign as possible victims being targeted by Russian intelligence.      Page denies working with any Russians as part of the Kremlin's election meddling, though he admits interacting with some Russians during the campaign.      Stone denies collusion and says his conversations with Guccifer 2.0, which he since posted online, were innocuous.      Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional comments from Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, that were given to CNN after the initial publication. |||||	– Experts say Robert Mueller's investigation into President Trump, his associates, and Russia shows no sign of wrapping up, with sources telling the Wall Street Journal the special counsel has impaneled a grand jury in Washington DC. Grand juries allow prosecutors to subpoena documents, have witnesses testify under oath, and pursue indictments. “This is yet a further sign that there is a long-term, large-scale series of prosecutions being contemplated and being pursued by the special counsel,” a University of Texas law professor says. The news—a sign the investigation will likely continue for months—comes as lawmakers in both parties are seeking to make it more difficult for Trump to fire Mueller. Meanwhile, Reuters reports Mueller's grand jury has issued subpoenas tied to Donald Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer, who claimed to have information damaging to Hillary Clinton, and others. And sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that investigators are beginning to focus on possible financial crimes committed by Trump and others, some of which have nothing to do with the 2016 election. Mueller has the authority to look into anything that "may arise directly from the investigation," and sources say investigators now believe financial crimes are more likely to lead to prosecutions than possible collusion with Russia during the election. Trump has called the entire investigation a "witch hunt."
summarize: The iPad is a potential source of nickel allergy reactions, say pediatricians who suggest parents choose a metal-free cover for the electronics.      Allergic contact dermatitis is becoming more common in children, especially nickel, dermatologists say. In Monday’s issue of the journal Pediatrics, doctors in the U.S. describe the case of an 11-year-old boy with dermatitis that didn’t respond to standard ointment.      He tested positive in a skin patch test for nickel allergy. At an avoidance counselling session, doctors became aware that the family had bought a first-generation iPad in 2010 and that the patient was using it more frequently.      After covering his iPad and avoiding nickel, including through diet, the dermatitis improved significantly for five months, Dr. Sharon Jacob of Loma Linda University in California and Dr. Shehla Admani of the dermatology department at the University of California, San Diego, said.      Allergic reactions to Apple laptops and iPhones have been reported, but the iPad hasn’t come up as a potential source of nickel sensitization in children before, the researchers said.      They suggested patients could reduce contact between skin and devices either by using a case or cover that is nickel-free or simply applying duct tape to create a barrier.      Doctors should also consider "metallic-appearing electronics and personal effects" as potential sources of nickel exposure, Jacob and Admani said.      In 2008, dermatologists warned, people who use their cellphones for long periods may develop a rash on their ears or cheeks.      It is not clear whether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel. Apple spokesman Chris Gaither said the company had no comment. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine      This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds)      The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| CHICAGO (AP) — Unexplained rash? Check your iPad. It turns out the popular tablet computer may contain nickel, one of the most common allergy-inducing metals.      This undated photo provided by American Academy of Pediatrics shows a rash on an unidentified 11-year old boy from a nickel allergy. Case reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from personal... (Associated Press)      Recent reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from a variety of personal electronic devices, including laptops and cellphones. But it was an Apple iPad that caused an itchy body rash in an 11-year-old boy recently treated at a San Diego hospital, according to a report in Monday's Pediatrics.      Nickel rashes aren't life-threatening but they can be very uncomfortable, and they may require treatment with steroids and antibiotics if the skin eruptions become infected, said Dr. Sharon Jacob, a dermatologist at Rady Children's Hospital, where the boy was treated. Jacob, who co-wrote the report, said the young patient had to miss school because of the rash.      The boy had a common skin condition that causes scaly patches, but he developed a different rash all over his body that didn't respond to usual treatment. Skin testing showed he had a nickel allergy, and doctors traced it to an iPad his family had bought in 2010.      Doctors tested the device and detected a chemical compound found in nickel in the iPad's outside coating.      "He used the iPad daily," she said.      He got better after putting it in a protective case, she said      Whether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel is uncertain; Apple spokesman Chris Gaither said the company had no comment.      Nickel rashes also have been traced to other common products including some jewelry, eyeglass frames and zippers.      Jacob said evidence suggests nickel allergies are become more common, or increasingly recognized. She cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus about 17 percent a decade ago.      She said doctors need to consider electronic devices as potential sources when patients seek treatment for skin rashes.      ___      Online:      Pediatrics: http://www.pediatrics.org      ___      AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner |||||	– Nickel frequently causes allergic reactions, and the metal is found in all kinds of gadgets. Case in point: an iPad. An 11-year-old boy suffered a rash so bad he had to stay home from school and was eventually treated at a hospital in San Diego, and it turns out the culprit was a first-generation iPad purchased in 2010, which he used "daily," says Dr. Sharon Jacob, a dermatologist at the hospital that treated him. The rash spread across his body and didn't respond to standard treatments, the AP reports by way of Pediatrics. Putting the iPad in a case and wiping nickel from his diet solved the problem, Jacob says. Apple hasn't commented on the situation, and it's not clear whether all iPads contain nickel, the AP notes. In the boy's case, doctors tested the device and identified a chemical compound found in nickel in the iPad's outside coating. But many items do contain the metal, including some jewelry and zippers. Nickel allergies are on the rise, says Jacob, who points to data showing 25% of kids who are skin-tested for allergies show a nickel allergy, up from 17% a decade ago. Pediatricians suggest parents put iPads in metal-free cases, CBC notes.
summarize: President Donald Trump did not refer to any specific comments from San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz that indicated she had “come back” from her criticism of the federal response.      Trump says San Juan mayor has 'come back a long way'      President Donald Trump said as he departed for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday morning that the mayor of San Juan, who he strongly criticized over the weekend, has “come back a long way.”      San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz was outspoken last week in her pleas for more support from the federal government, criticizing the rosy recovery picture painted by acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke and appealing directly to the president in an interview on CNN.      Story Continued Below      Although she expressed gratitude for Trump’s help and did not attack him directly, her words were enough to prompt the president into a Twitter spree in which he said the mayor had shown “such poor leadership ability.” At the outset of his Tuesday morning trip to the island, Trump suggested Cruz had begun to come around.      “Well, I think she's come back a long way. And you know, I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done and people are looking at that,” the president told reporters before boarding Marine One on the White House’s south lawn. “whether it's her or anybody else, they're all starting to say it. I appreciate very much the governor and his comments. He has said we have done an incredible job, and that's the truth.”      Trump did not refer to any specific comments from Cruz that indicated she had “come back” from her criticism of the federal response.      It was a significantly warmer tone toward the mayor than the president expressed over the weekend, when he wrote online that Cruz “who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump” and that she and other Puerto Rican leaders “want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”      The president on Tuesday praised the work of first responders and federal teams from FEMA and the military who have worked to aid Puerto Rico, but he doubled down on a complaint he issued online over the weekend, that Cruz and other Puerto Rican officials “are not able to get their workers to help.”      “Now the roads are cleared. Communication’s starting to come back. We need their truck drivers,” Trump said. “Their drivers have to start driving trucks. We have to do that. So at a local level, they have to give us more help.”       ||||| President Donald Trump came face to face with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who he derided on Twitter as “nasty” and lacking leadership skills.      The President and First Lady Melania Trump came to Puerto Rico on Tuesday, where they will meet with hurricane victims and participate in briefings with numerous officials, including Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp.      According to a pool report, Trump and the Mayor exchanged greetings before the briefing. Although there was applause several times, she did not join in.      “I have accepted the invitation on behalf of the people of San Juan and out of respect for the American people represented by the Office of the President of the United States,” Cruz wrote in a statement posted on Facebook. “This is about saving lives, not about politics.”      On Saturday, Trump slammed Cruz on Twitter. “The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” he said. “Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.”      The day before Trump’s Twitter spree, Cruz held a news conference in which she urged the federal government to help the U.S. island territory, and asked Trump to ensure someone from his administration is “up to the task of saving lives.”      “If anybody out there is listening, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency,” she said.      Trump said on Tuesday that Cruz has come a “long way.”      “I think it’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done, and people are looking at that,” he told reporters before leaving for Puerto Rico.      Trump has faced criticism beyond Cruz for his response to Puerto Rico. Rossello has called the destruction a “humanitarian disaster,” and officials estimate it will be months before the island fully regains power. The President of Oxfam America, an international organization devoted to alleviating poverty, said it is getting involved in the relief effort because of the U.S. government’s slow response.      “Oxfam rarely responds to humanitarian emergencies in the U.S. and other wealthy countries, but as the situation in Puerto Rico worsens and the federal government’s response continues to falter, Oxfam has decided to step in to lend our expertise in dealing with some of the world’s most catastrophic disasters,” Abby Maxman, President of Oxfam America, said in a statement Monday.      Cruz had said that she would be happy to meet with the President. “If he asks to meet with me, of course I would with him. I mean, you know, anything that can be done and anyone that can listen,” she said on ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos last Sunday.      White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that the administration had invited Cruz to participate in events with the President during his visit to Puerto Rico.      “This administration, as well as other members on the ground, have reached out to her. We hope that she will join with us in those efforts and be a part of things,” Sanders said. |||||	– President Trump says San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz has "come back a long way" from her criticism of the federal response to Hurricane Maria. "I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done and people are looking at that. Whether it's her or anybody else, they're all starting to say it," Trump told reporters Tuesday before flying to Puerto Rico, per Politico. It marked a friendlier tone than Trump had used days earlier when stating Puerto Rican officials "want everything to be done for them." He said Tuesday, however, that although roads are cleared and communications are being restored, "at a local level, they have to give us more help." The White House said Monday that Trump would come face-to-face with Cruz on Tuesday after the mayor accepted an invitation to attend events alongside him, per Time. "I have accepted the invitation on behalf of the people of San Juan and out of respect for the American people represented by the Office of the President of the United States," Cruz wrote on Facebook. "This is about saving lives, not about politics." Previously, she has been openly critical of the federal government's response, and Trump lashed out at her over the weekend.
summarize: Advertisement Continue reading the main story      BEIJING — Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, ordered officials across the country on Friday to avert the kind of events that led to the deaths of four children who drank pesticide this week, possibly to kill themselves, in an impoverished corner of the southwest.                              The youths, three sisters and a brother between the ages of 5 and 13, were among the many “left-behind children” in China. Their father was a migrant worker who sought jobs elsewhere and had been away from home for long periods of time, while their mother had also been absent for some reason in recent years. The siblings lived in a house in Guizhou Province, one of the poorest areas in China; their village, Cizhu, is under the administration of the city of Bijie.      Because of a strict household registration system in China, many people cannot receive meaningful social benefits if they live and work outside their hometowns. So migrant workers often leave their children behind to be raised by grandparents or other relatives, because the children are not eligible for proper schooling and health care in other cities.      An initial police investigation explored the possibility that the children had committed suicide, according to state news media reports. At 11 p.m. on Tuesday, someone found the boy, 13, lying in front of his three-story home, according to a report in China Youth Daily. About 20 minutes later, local officials and health workers arrived and discovered that the boy was dying. His sisters, ages 5, 8 and 9, were nearby. The girls were brought to a hospital, but they died there.      The brief official news reports on Mr. Li’s orders had few details and did not mention when or where he had given them. The report by Xinhua, the state-run news agency, said that Mr. Li had mentioned there would be “strict punishments and severe consequences” if officials were found to be delinquent in taking care of the needy.      A district government under Bijie City announced online on Friday that two lower-level officials had been dismissed from their posts and that three others had been suspended and were under investigation. The report also said six other people would be punished after the investigation was concluded.      The China Youth Daily article said that some villagers had considered the four children introverted and had noted that the parents were often absent or would fight with each other when they were home together.      One villager, Pan Ling, told the newspaper that the children’s father, Zhang Fangqi, began working in other places in China years ago. The mother left home in 2013, Mr. Pan said. She came back to visit the children last year, and the father was home over the Lunar New Year holiday in February. But he left again two weeks after the end of the holiday to seek work, the paper reported.      On Friday, Guizhou Province published a report online that said the family had lived for years in Hainan, another southern province, before moving back to Bijie in 2011. While in Hainan, the father, Mr. Zhang, and his wife, Ren Xifen, beat the children, the report said. The beatings by the father were so brutal that the arm of the son, Zhang Qigang, was dislocated on one occasion, and his ears were torn, the report said. After the couple moved back, Mr. Zhang regularly beat Ms. Ren, and she ended up in the hospital at least once, the report said.      When the couple left Bijie separately, the boy took care of his three sisters and the family’s pigs. Local officials and other villagers said the family was more prosperous than others in the area. The parents had saved some money from government benefits, and their home was worth about $16,000, the official report said. But one relative told The Paper, an investigative news organization, that the family had no money and that the children had to grind corn to eat the flour because they were so poor.      After 2013, when both parents left Bijie, the four children’s personalities changed, the report said. They would stay in their home with the door locked and not open it even when relatives tried visiting, the report said.      Mr. Zhang and Ms. Ren could not be reached for comment on Friday.      In November 2012, five boys died in a trash bin in Bijie after they sought shelter there from the cold. They had started a fire with charcoal inside to warm themselves and died from carbon monoxide poisoning. ||||| Police investigating the deaths of four Chinese children who drank pesticide after being abandoned by their migrant worker parents say they have found a suicide note near the eldest victim’s body.            “Thanks for your kindness. I know you mean well for us, but we should go now,” the note said, according to the state-run China News Service.      The four siblings, a boy and three girls aged five to 14, were found dead on Tuesday at their home in a rural village outside the city of Bijie in Guizhou, one of China’s poorest provinces.      Initial reports suggested they had poisoned themselves after their parents abandoned them and left the village to find work elsewhere.      There are an estimated 60 million “left behind” children in China, who are often put into the care of elderly relatives or unsupervised when their parents migrate to the cities looking for work.      The mother of the four children returned to the village on Friday from Guangdong province, China’s manufacturing heartland, where she had been working in a toy factory.      “I did not shoulder my responsibility for them,” Ren Xifen, 32, told China’s official Xinhua news agency, after arriving home to see her children’s bodies before their cremation.      “I have truly failed them,” she added, according to the China Youth Daily newspaper. “How I wish I could go with them.”      Ren admitted she had left them behind in early 2014 after a dispute with her husband involving domestic violence. “I didn’t dare not go home,” she said.      In March this year, the siblings found themselves completely alone after their father also left the village. “I am illiterate and cannot even write my own name. I wanted them to perform well in school, unlike me, living a hard life,” Ren said.      State-controlled media outlets have sought to downplay the government’s possible responsibility for the tragedy, but at least two local officials have been sacked.      Facing public outrage over the deaths, China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, was forced to step in on Friday to promise an urgent inquiry. “Such a tragedy cannot be allowed to happen again,” he said.      Investigating officers have determined it was a mass suicide, Xinhua reported on Saturday, citing the letter police said they had found at the children’s home. Liu Xin, a senior police officer, told the China News Service his team had used handwriting analysis to determine that the couple’s 14-year-old son had written the note.      “I made a vow that I wouldn’t live over the age of 15,” the note said, according to the news agency. “I’m 14 now. I dream about death, and yet that dream never comes true. Today it must finally come true.”      Chinese bloggers reacted to claims about the existence of a suicide note with suspicion. “It is still uncertain whether there is a note or whether its contents have been tampered with,” Xu Xin, a law professor from the Beijing Institute of Technology, wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent to Twitter.      The deaths are the second tragedy involving “left behind” children in Bijie in recent years. In 2012, five young boys from the same area died after lighting a fire in a dustbin inside which they had taken shelter from the cold.      Additional reporting by Luna Lin ||||| GUIYANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Friday marked a grim, tear-filled reunion for Ren Xifen and her four children, who died last week after drinking pesticide in southwest China's Guizhou province.      Ren, 32, returned to her hometown of Cizhu village in Qixingguan District, Bijie City, to visit the bodies of her children on Friday, after working and living in south China's Guangdong province for more than a year.      Her children, aged 5 to 13, died after swallowing pesticide on Tuesday in their home in Bijie, one of the poorest areas in the mountainous province. The police determined it was a mass suicide. The bodies were cremated on Friday.      Ren admits she made only one phone call to her husband and children shortly after arriving in Guangdong in March 2014. Since then, she has not contacted the children.      "I did not shoulder my responsibility for them. I had to come back for a final look at them," Ren said in an interview with Xinhua on Friday.      "If there were one more chance, I would have made proper arrangements for them at any cost."      A government employee who accompanied Ren to the visitation said she had been weeping most of the day.      Ren left home to work at a toy plant in Guangdong after a long and bitter dispute with her husband Zhang Fangqi. Zhang moved away from the village in March this year, leaving the children behind.      Local officials have been searching for him in Guangdong following the children's deaths.      Ren said she had high expectations for her only son, the oldest of the siblings.      "He was very lovable. Everyone liked him," Ren recalled, describing him as diligent.      "I am illiterate and cannot even write my own name. I wanted them to perform well in school, unlike me, living a hard life."      But the frequent quarrels between Ren and her husband disrupted family life. Ren said she had not returned to see the children for fear of being beaten by her husband, although she missed them very much.      While investigating the deaths, police found a note from the son which read "thanks for your kindness, but it is time for us to go..."      China has more than 60 million children in rural areas who are left to live with relatives, usually grandparents, as the country's urbanization drive draws millions of parents away from their rural homes to cities for work.      It has become such a common occurrence that they are now referred to as "left-behind children".      In the case of Ren's family, no grandparents were still alive to watch the children, so they were left to fend for themselves, receiving money remitted from the father to a bank account entrusted to the oldest child.      Such arrangements are not uncommon. According to a 2013 report released by the All-China Women's Federation, nearly 3.4 percent of all left-behind children live alone, often falling victims to tragedies such as suicide and human traffickers.      "I hope my family's tragedy will not occur again. If parents take care of their children and guide them, such tragedies will not happen," Ren said.      In 2012, five street children - also from Bijie - died of carbon monoxide poisoning after burning charcoal for warmth in a roadside dumpster.      The unfortunate incident reflects the lack of adequate parental care and social services for thousands of left-behind children.      Following the news of the most recent deaths, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has urged strengthened supervision on relevant affairs, calling on government departments responsible to do solid and meticulous work in caring for those in need.      Li said such tragedies should not happen over and over again, and negligent officials should be held accountable.      Several local officials have been fired or suspended because of the latest tragedy. |||||	– Four children who fatally drank pesticide last week in China were apparently abandoned by their parents, and investigators now report they found a suicide note near the body of the oldest child, per the Guardian. The youngsters, whose ages ranged from 5 to 13 or 14, were said to have been distraught after their parents left them in their rural home in one of China's poorest provinces, while they sought work in urban areas. "I dream about death, and yet that dream never comes true," China News Service says the note read, per the Guardian. "Today it must finally come true." Meanwhile, China Premier Li Keqiang has demanded an inquiry, proclaiming "such a tragedy cannot be allowed to happen again." The Guardian notes there are about 60 million of these "left behind" children in China, abandoned when their parents leave them with relatives or on their own so they can find work in cities. The New York Times points out China's rigid social-benefits system, which prevents children from receiving certain benefits, like health care and schooling, if they live outside their hometowns. In the case of these four children, their mother was said to be working in a toy factory in Guangdong province and had been afraid to come home for at least a year due to past domestic violence incidents, per both the Guardian and Xinhua; the Times cites a government report that says the kids were beaten by both parents, and that the father also "regularly" beat the mother. The father left the family home in March to find work elsewhere, the Guardian notes. The children's mother came back to see her children's bodies before they were cremated Friday and told Xinhua that "I did not shoulder my responsibility for them," adding to the China Youth Daily newspaper that "I have truly failed them. How I wish I could go with them."
summarize: A video showing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, known for his love of classic hard rock, dancing to the song American Boy by the Russian pop group Kombinatsia is going viral on the Russian internet.      The video was added on Youtube on April 19.      "We are rocking at a student university reunion. The dances\the music - they fit in with the past," the president said on his Twitter microblog on Wednesday when one of his followers wrote that the video had lifted her spirits.      Over 6,400 people have seen the video so far and more than 300 have commented on it. The majority of comments are positive; however, some have called the video "stupid."      Some critics have compared Medvedev's dancing abilities to the notorious 1990s clips in which then-President Boris Yeltsin was dancing drunk on stage with second-rate singers and directing an orchestra.      MOSCOW, April 20 (RIA Novosti) ||||| From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Kombinaciya (Russian: Комбинация) is a Russian female pop band. The name means "combination," but the Russian word is a double entendre which also refers to a woman's frilly slip,[1] and at the group's 1988 performance in Moscow they were forced to perform under a different name because "Kombinaciya" was considered too suggestive a band title. As former band member Svetlana Kostyko recalled: "A group with this name just had to make a sensation." ("группа с таким названием просто должна была произвести фурор.").[2]      History [ edit ]      Kombinaciya was co-founded in 1988 by manager/producer Alexander Shishinin (Александр Шишинин) and classically-trained composer Vitali Okorokov (Виталий Окороков) in Saratov, Russia. Shishinin, who reportedly was inspired after viewing a performance of Mirage, recruited six local girls, ages 16 to 20, to form the band. Lead vocalist Alena Apina (Алёна Апина) had trained at the Saratov State Conservatory. The other original members of the group were vocalist Tatiana Ivanova (Татьяна Иванова), keyboardist Svetlana Kostyko (Светлана Костыко), guitarist Tanya Dolganova (Таня Долганова), bass guitarist Olga Akhunova (Ольга Ахунова) and drummer Julia Kozyulkova (Юлия Козюлькова). The group underwent various membership changes over the years, with only Tatiana Ivanova continually remaining in the group since its founding. Later band members included Inessa Topiani (Инесса Топиани), Nura Kovaleva (Нюра Ковалева), Svetlana Kashina (Светлана Кашина), Elena Molchanova (Елена Молчанова), Galya Lezina (Гала Лезина), Svetlana Molchanova (Светлана Молчанова), Katerina Bolotova (Катерина Болотова) and Natalia Pushkareva (Наталья Пушкарева).      Lead singer Alena Apina later recalled Kombinaciya's first major concert, which took place on the big stage of the Sports Palace in Volgograd. "When you come out and feel all the tremendous energy of the seven thousand people. It's an indescribable feeling." ("Когда ты выходишь и чувствуешь всю огромную энергию этих семи тысяч человек. Это непередаваемое ощущение.")[3]      In 1990 the group performed two songs in the Russian film "Mordashka" ("Мордашка").[4]      The band's popularity peaked between 1989–1993, with major hits such as "Russian Girls", "American Boy", "Accountant" (Бухгалтер), and "Two Slices of Sausage" (Два кусочека колбаски). The latter was a Russian drinking song initially disliked by the group. As former vocalist Svetlana Kashina recalled later, "It was a huge success at the concerts; the fans were chanting: 'Sausage! Sausage!' ...We had to sing it. After each time, I spat." ("Она имела бешеный успех, на концертах поклонники скандировали: 'Колбасу! Колбасу!'...пришлось ее петь. Каждый раз плевались после нее.")[5] "Accountant", about a woman's love for a simple Russian accountant, seems to have been Kombinaciya's most enduring popular song.[6][7]      A major setback to the group occurred in 1991, when lead vocalist Alena Apina left the band to pursue a successful career as a solo performer. Negotiations were being finalized for Kombinaciya to produce an English album and embark on a tour of America, but with Apina's departure from the group those plans were dropped.      Another big setback to the group occurred on March 5, 1993, when manager/producer Alexander Shishinin was murdered, a still-unsolved crime that was rumored to be linked to Russian Mafia influence in the music industry.[8] Without Shishinin's guidance, the band's subsequent new material had limited success, but Kombinaciya continued to intermittently tour using the enduring popularity of its earlier big hits. In 2008, Alena Apina and Tatiana Ivanova reunited for several Kombinaciya 20th anniversary reunion concerts.[9]      In 2007, Tatiana Ivanova successfully sued the music distributor Boomba Music for copyright infringement, after the company reissued Kombinaciya albums without paying royalties.[10]      "American Boy"[11] was one of Kombinaciya's major hit songs, released in 1990[12] when the Soviet Union was dissolving and most Russians were experiencing deteriorating living conditions. The song, about an unhappy Russian girl wishing that an American Boy would take her away with him and leave Russia behind, captured public sentiment at that pivotal time in Russian history. The song was mentioned in mainstream American newspapers.[13][14] Later, scholarly books[15][16] and journal articles[17] discussed cultural aspects of the song's viewpoint. The verses of the song are in Russian, but the title and portions of the chorus are in English. A 2008 remake by Ukrainian electropop group Stream was sung with English verses.[18] The song captured public attention in 2011 after Russian president Dmitry Medvedev was recorded dancing to it at a university reunion.[19]      Album Discography [ edit ]      Knight's Move (1988) ( Ход конем )      (1988) ( ) Russian Girls (1990) ( Русские девочки )      (1990) ( ) Moscow Residence Permit (1991) ( Московская прописка )      (1991) ( ) Two Slices of Sausage (1993) ( Два кусочека колбаски )      (1993) ( ) The Best, The Best (1994) ( Самая, самая )      (1994) ( ) Let's Talk (1998) (Давай поболтаем) ||||| National September 11 Memorial MuseumArchive-It Partner Since: Dec, 2007Organization Type: Museums & Art LibrariesOrganization URL: http://www.national911memorial.org The National September 11 Memorial Museum is committed to documenting the events, immediate aftermath, and continuing repercussions of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and February 26, 1993.

Residential streets in Denver are only swept once per month where posted (not every block has restrictions), so please be sure to move your vehicle according to the signs on your block to avoid a $50.00 parking citation. ||||| A Glendale man with permanent brain injuries has sued the city of Denver, claiming a street sweeper overtook him either intentionally or recklessly as he pedaled his bicycle to avoid being struck by the machine.      Archibald Allen Lee Hegner was tossed in the air by the street-cleaning machine and knocked unconscious, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Denver U.S. District Court.      Hegner’s lawsuit names the city of Denver and streetsweeper Rodney Ray Fresquez as defendants. Hegner is seeking payment to compensate him for personal injuries and emotional distress, medical costs totaling $116,072 and attorney’s fees.      Denver denied Hegner’s claims on Sept. 1, on the basis of sovereign immunity, says the lawsuit filed by Edgewater attorneys Brett Huff and Richard Leslie.      A spokeswoman for the city attorney’s office said Denver has not yet been served with the lawsuit. “Once we receive the complaint, we will evaluate the claims and respond to them.”      The collision involving Hegner happened on Feb. 29, 2016, on a section of South Jackson Street, between Yale and Iliff avenues, that does not have centerline marks, the lawsuit says.      At 1:50 p.m., Hegner was pedaling north on South Jackson as he approached a stationary street-sweeping machine. He heard the engine idling, the lawsuit says. Hegner was going about 7 mph. Suddenly the engine noise increased substantially and Fresquez began driving, the lawsuit says.      “Fresquez engaged its engine and accelerated, apparently intending to overtake and pass (Hegner on his) right side,” the lawsuit says. The machine quickly caught up with Hegner.      Hegner moved to the left and sped up to about 10 mph to avoid a collision while the street sweeper passed. The lawsuit says, Fresquez sped up and passed Hegner while throwing dirt, leaves and small branches at the bicyclist. To avoid the debris, Hegner sped up again and passed the machine on the left, the lawsuit says. Frequez sped up a third time and passed Hegner again and moved ahead.      “Fresquez … suddenly, inexplicably and without warning, executed a 180-degree (turn) to reverse direction and head south on South Jackson and directly at (Hegner),” the lawsuit says.      Hegner swerved toward the sidewalk in an unsuccessful effort to avoid a collision, the lawsuit says. The street sweeper struck Hegner, throwing him into the air and partially on the gutter and partially on the sidewalk, it says.      Fresquez’s actions were deliberate and Hegner tried but couldn’t avoid the crash, the lawsuit says. Hegner suffered traumatic brain injury, two broken ribs, a fracture of the sacrum and a large hematoma extending from his armpit to his waist. |||||	– "Show your pride and move your ride on street sweeping day," proclaims the city of Denver in regard to its street-cleaning program. Archibald Allen Lee Hegner says he was trying to do just that a year ago when he was struck—he alleges deliberately—by a street-sweeping machine. Now he's suing the city and the driver, Rodney Ray Fresquez, seeking compensation for emotional distress and the $116,000 cost of treating collision-related injuries, which the suit catalogs as including a traumatic brain injury, two broken ribs, a fractured sacrum, and a torso-length hematoma, the Denver Post reports. The lawsuit filed in US District Court on Monday describes something that sounds like a game of chicken. On the afternoon of Feb. 29, 2016, Hegner alleges he biked up to an idling street-sweeping machine and steered left around it, only to hear the engine rev and Fresquez begin driving. Fresquez passed Hegner on the right, then Hegner says he biked harder and again passed on the left to avoid the dirt and branches being kicked his way. Then, the suit says, Fresquez passed him again and "suddenly, inexplicably, and without warning" flipped the vehicle around 180 degrees, heading directly at Hegner. Hegner claims he tried to bike up on the sidewalk to get out of the machine's path, but failed and was struck, causing a "permanent impairment of his ability to enjoy a full and complete life," per the suit. A rep for the city attorney's office had no comment.

Mr. Ri reiterated North Korea’s longstanding demand that both the United States and North Korea should take “simultaneous actions and phased steps” toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula while simultaneously improving bilateral relations.      Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim held their historic summit meeting in Singapore on June 12, signing a document in which Mr. Kim committed to work toward a “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Mr. Trump promised to provide security guarantees to the North and to build “new” bilateral relations. They recognized that “mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”      But frustration has since mounted on both sides, as each accused the other of not living up to the Singapore agreement. North Korea accused the Trump administration of making a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization” after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, last month to urge the country to take more steps like handing over an inventory of its nuclear weapons and facilities and dismantling some of them.      North Korea “stands firm in its determination and commitment for implementing the D.P.R.K.-U.S. joint statement in a responsible and good-faith manner,” Mr. Ri said on Saturday, referring to the Singapore agreement. “What is alarming, however, is the insistent moves manifested within the U.S. to go back to the old, far from its leader’s intention.”      Mr. Pompeo, who also attended the same security forum, shook hands and chatted briefly with Mr. Ri when participants gathered for a group photo, but he was not present when Mr. Ri made his statement. An American diplomat later handed Mr. Ri a letter from Mr. Trump to Mr. Kim. ||||| North Korea has flouted the cap on exports of coal, petroleum, weapons, and other products through illegal ship-to-ship transfers, rendering the sanctions hailed by UN 'ineffective'      Published 2:48 PM, August 04, 2018      UNITED NATIONS – North Korea has resorted to a "massive increase" of illegal ship-to-ship transfers of oil products at sea to evade UN sanctions and enlisted a Syrian arms broker to sell weapons to Yemen and Libya, a UN report said Friday, August 3.      In a 62-page report sent to the Security Council, the UN panel of experts also listed violations of a ban on North Korean exports of coal, iron, seafood and other products that generate millions of dollars in revenue to Kim Jong-un's regime.      The transfer of petroleum products to North Korean tankers at sea remains "a primary method of sanctions evasion" involving 40 vessels and 130 associated companies, said the report seen by AFP.      North Korea "has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs and continued to defy Security Council resolutions through a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, as well as through transfers of coal at sea during 2018," said the report sent to the council.      The violations have rendered the latest batch of sanctions "ineffective" by flouting the cap on oil, fuel and coal imposed in a raft of UN resolutions adopted last year, it added.      Arms peddling through Syria      North Korea also "attempted to supply small arms and light weapons (SALW) and other military equipment via foreign intermediaries" to Libya, Yemen and Sudan, said the report.      It named Syrian arms trafficker Hussein Al-Ali who offered "a range of conventional arms, and in some cases ballistic missiles to armed groups in Yemen and Libya" that were produced in North Korea.      With Ali acting as a go-between, a "protocol of cooperation" between Yemen's Huthi rebels and North Korea was negotiated in 2016 in Damascus that provided for a "vast array of military equipment."      The panel continues to investigate the military cooperation that would be in violation of an arms embargo on North Korea.      North Korea continued to receive revenue from exports of banned commodities, for instance deliveries of iron and steel to China, India and other countries that generated nearly $14 million from October to March.      "Financial sanctions remain some of the most poorly implemented and actively evaded measures of the sanctions regime," said the panel.      North Korean diplomats play a key role in sanctions evasion by setting up multiple bank accounts, it added.      Despite a ban on joint ventures with North Korea, the panel has uncovered more than 200 such jointly-run firms, many of which are involved in construction and other businesses in Russia. (READ: U.S. slaps sanctions on Russian bank over North Korea dealings)      The panel is tasked by the council with monitoring the implementation of the raft of sanctions imposed in response to North Korea's 6th nuclear test and ballistic missile tests.      The United States last month asked a UN sanctions committee to order a halt to all deliveries of oil products to North Korea after reporting that Pyongyang had exceeded the cap on fuel supplies through the illegal ship supplies.      Russia and China however put a 6-month hold on that request.      The report cited US figures estimating that North Korea had procured over 500,000 barrels of petroleum products in the first 5 months of 2018, meaning that it would now be in violation of sanctions resolutions. – Rappler.com |||||	– North Korea sent the US an unexpectedly sharp message Saturday: These talks aren't working, and you're the problem. Speaking at a regional security conference in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat said his nation is taking steps in the right direction while Washington fails to reciprocate, the New York Times reports. Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's minister of foreign affairs, said in a closed-door meeting that North Korea has taken steps toward denuclearization—like dismantling a nuclear test site and stopping nuclear tests—but America hasn't reciprocated by curbing sanctions or declaring the Korean War officially over. "The United States, instead of responding to these measures, is raising its voice louder for maintaining the sanctions against the DPRK," he said in part. Ri was friendlier while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remained at the conference, shaking his hand and exchanging pleasantries for a photo op, the Washington Post reports. "There are many productive conversations to be had," Ri told him. Ri was also given a letter from Trump that followed up on a missive last week from Kim Jong Un (the contents remain private, but Trump recently tweeted thanks to Kim for "your nice letter" and added, "I look forward to seeing you soon!"). Another tidbit: Before flying to Indonesia, Pompeo told Russia not to help North Korea get around UN sanctions that Moscow had approved. Meanwhile, the UN warned Friday that North Korea is skirting UN sanctions with illegal transfers of oil products and has hired a Syrian middleman to sell weapons to Libya and Yemen, AFP reports. (Pyongyang has accused Washington of being "gangster-like.")
summarize: Built for the pharaoh Khufu about 4,500 years ago, the Great Pyramid at Giza is considered a wonder of the ancient world.      The Great Pyramid of Giza may be a Wonder of the Ancient World, but it's not perfect: Its base is a little lopsided because its builders made a teensy mistake when constructing it, new research reveals.      The west side of the pyramid is slightly longer than the east side, scientists have found. Although the difference is very slight, it's enough that a modern-day research team, led by engineer Glen Dash and Egyptologist Mark Lehner, was able to detect the small flaw in a new measuring project.      "The base is not quite square," Dash said. The project is being carried out by the Glen Dash Research Foundation, led by Dash, and Ancient Egypt Research Associates (AERA), led by Lehner. AERA has been mapping and excavating the Giza plateau for about 30 years. [Photos: Amazing Discoveries at Egypt's Giza Pyramids]      The Great Pyramid was built for the pharaoh Khufu about 4,500 years ago. Called a "wonder of the world" by ancient writers, it is the largest of the three pyramids located on the Giza Plateau.      The Great Pyramid was originally covered in casing stones, though just a few survive today (and are shown here). Credit: Mark Lehner      When the Great Pyramid was first constructed, it was clad in a limestone casing, much of which is now gone. Much of the casing was reused for building projects in past centuries. Without the casing, scientists have had a tough time getting accurate measurements of the pyramid as it originally stood.      "What is the exact size and orientation of the Great Pyramid? Archaeologists, scientists, engineers and mystics have sought answers for centuries," Dash wrote in a reportpublished in the most recent issue of the newsletter Aeragram, which chronicles the work of AERA.      "Most of those casing stones were removed centuries ago for building material, leaving the pyramid as we see it today, without most of its original shell," Dash wrote. [In Photos: Inside Egypt's Great Pyramids]      Researchers took measurements of the Great Pyramid's edges and platform, showing what one of the corners may have looked like when built. Researchers noticed a "corner socket," or a cutting in the rock, whose purpose remains unclear. Credit: Image courtesy of Glen Dash      To determine the lengths of the original pyramid sides, Lehner led a search for surviving casing stones whose edges still touched the platform that the Great Pyramid was built on. They also searched for marks on the platform that would provide clues as to where the edges were. In total, they found 84 points along the pyramid's original edges. These points were marked on a grid system that AERA has been using to map all of the features on the Giza Plateau.      Then, the team used a statistical method called linear regression analysis to determine those lengths. They found that the east side of the pyramid originally measured somewhere between 755.561 and 755.817 feet (230.295 to 230.373 meters), while the west side of the pyramid originally measured somewhere between 755.833 and 756.024 feet (230.378 to 230.436 m).      This means that, at most, the west side was only 5.55 inches (14.1 centimeters) longer than the east side. Though that would leave the pyramid not quite square, it's a remarkable level of precision for a monument constructed more than 4,500 years ago, the researchers noted.      "The data show that the Egyptians possessed quite remarkable skills for their time," Dash wrote in the report. "We can only speculate as to how the Egyptians could have laid out these lines with such precision using only the tools they had." [How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built?]      Dash thinks the ancient Egyptians laid out the pyramid on a grid. The pyramid's north-south axis (or meridian) runs 3 minutes 54 seconds west of due north while its east-west axis runs 3 minutes 51 seconds north of due east, he told Live Science. The east-west axis also runs through the center of a temple built on the east side of the pyramid. These measurements mean that the Great Pyramid is oriented just slightly away from the cardinal directions, the degree of error from north-south and east-west being almost the same.      The fact that the degree of error is almost the same and that it is so small provides "good evidence that the pyramid and its associated temple were laid out on a common, very precisely oriented grid," Dash said.      The researchers will continue analyzing the data they gathered to find more information on the design and construction of the Great Pyramid.      "We hope to eventually figure out how the Egyptians laid out the pyramid with such precision and, in doing so, hope to learn much about the tools and technology they had at their disposal," Dash wrote.

But one scientist recently discovered that the base, which appears to be square, isn’t quite as perfect as it looks, according to Live Science, which is significant in part because it helps suggest how ancient Egyptians built the pyramids given the tools of the time.      To make the latest measurements, scientists first searched to find the original edges of the pyramid, which have eroded over the years. They then plotted, using a statistical analysis, the true length of the east and west sides of the pyramid’s original base, finding that the west was around 5.55 inches longer than the east.      Coming up short by so little on a project of this scale is impressive, Glen Dash, one of the scientists who calculated the number said, and he thinks it also shows that the pyramid was built with a grid as a sort of blueprint.      That’s because the pyramid’s positional axis is also off by tiny, but similar amounts. However you measure it, though, Dash said the Egyptians’ achievement remains what it was in ancient times: a wonder of the world.      “We hope to eventually figure out how the Egyptians laid out the pyramid with such precision and, in doing so, hope to learn much about the tools and technology they had at their disposal,” Dash said, according to Live Science. |||||	– Scientists scanning and mapping the Giza pyramids say they've discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest of the world's Seven Wonders, is a bit lopsided. And really, just a bit. The pyramid's exact size has stumped experts for centuries, as the "more than 21 acres of hard, white casing stones" that originally covered it were removed long ago. Reporting in the most recent issue of the newsletter "AERAGRAM," which chronicles the work of the Ancient Egypt Research Associates, engineer Glen Dash says that by using a new measuring approach that involved finding any surviving remnants of the casing in order to determine where the original edge was, his team found the east side of the pyramid to be a maximum of 5.55 inches shorter than the west side. The question that most intrigues him, however, isn't how the Egyptians who designed and built the pyramid got it wrong 4,500 years ago, but how they got it so close to perfect. "We can only speculate as to how the Egyptians could have laid out these lines with such precision using only the tools they had," Dash writes. He tells Live Science his working hypothesis is that the Egyptians laid out their design on a grid, noting that the great pyramid is oriented only slightly away from the cardinal directions (its north-south axis runs 3 minutes 54 seconds west of due north, while its east-west axis runs 3 minutes 51 seconds north of due east)—an amount that's "tiny, but similar," Atlas Obscura points out.

summarize: Japan dolphin-killing town to open marine park, serve dolphin meat      By Agence France-Presse      Monday, October 7, 2013 7:04 EDT      The Japanese town made infamous by the Oscar-winning documentary “The Cove”, will open a marine mammal park where visitors can swim with dolphins, but will not end its annual slaughter, an official said Monday.      The town of Taiji has begun researching a plan to section off part of a cove and turn it into a place where people can swim and kayak alongside small whales and dolphins, Masaki Wada told AFP.      But, Wada insisted, far from having caved in to pressure from conservationists who want an end to an annual hunt that turns waters red with blood, the project was aimed at helping to sustain the practice.      “We already use dolphins and small whales as a source of tourism in the cove where dolphin-hunting takes place,” he said.      “In summer swimmers can enjoy watching the mammals that are released from a partitioned-off space,” he said.      “But we plan to do it on a larger scale. This is part of Taiji’s long-term plan of making the whole town a park, where you can enjoy watching marine mammals while tasting various marine products, including whale and dolphin meat,” he said.      The park will be separate from Hatakejiri Bay, the place into which the fishermen of Taiji corral dolphins, select a few dozen for sale to aquariums and marine parks, and stab the rest to death for meat.      The plan calls for the creation of a whale amusement park stretching roughly 69 acres by putting up a net at the entrance to Moriura Bay in northwestern Taiji, the official said.      The 2009 film “The Cove” brought Taiji to worldwide attention, winning an Oscar the following year, after graphically showing the killing, including by using underwater cameras. Activists continue to visit the town to protest the hunt.      Taiji, in western Wakayama prefecture, is looking to open part of the park within five years, the Wada said.      Black whales and bottlenose dolphins caught in waters near the town would be released into the pool, which would be developed as a nature park that also includes beaches and mudflats, he said.      Wakayama prefecture said the town caught 1,277 dolphins in 2012 and has licence to capture 2,026 this season, which began in September and runs until August next year.      ['Two Dolphins Swim In The Pool' via Shutterstock] ||||| Now, the Japanese town Taiji has unveiled controversial new plans to open a marine park where visitors can swim with dolphins – while the annual hunt of the animals continues in a nearby bay.      Town officials have outlined plans to section off part of the cove and transform it into an entertainment spot where people can swim and kayak alongside small whales and dolphins.      However, they were quick to emphasise that the establishment of the park was not a result of pressure from conservationists keen to end the annual dolphin hunt, but was aimed at helping to sustain the practice, according to AFP.      “We already use dolphins and small whales as a source of tourism in the cove where dolphin-hunting takes place,” said Masaki Wada, a local government official.      "In summer swimmers can enjoy watching the mammals that are released from a partitioned-off space.      "But we plan to do it on a larger scale. This is part of Taiji's long-term plan of making the whole town a park, where you can enjoy watching marine mammals while tasting various marine products, including whale and dolphin meat.”      The town’s plans consist of the establishment of a whale safari park spanning around 69 acres to open within five years, with a net installed at the entrance to a bay in the northwest of Taiji.      Not far away, however, is Hatakejiri Bay, where the fishermen of Taiji regularly turn the waters pink as they lure dolphins into nets before they are slaughtered.      The dolphin-hunting practice dates back 400 years and is fiercely protected by locals as an important whaling and culinary tradition which they argue is no different from killing cattle.      The town was cast into the spotlight - and international controversy – when the practice was captured in graphic detail in the popular 2009 documentary The Cove, resulting in widespread criticism.      Plans to open a marine park were quickly condemned as exploitative and “unfortunate” for the town by environmental activists, who frequently visit Taiji to protest agains the slaughter.      Nanami Kurasawa, the secretary general of Iruka & Kujira (Dolphin & Whale) Action Network, said: "The whole plan is based on the concept that they can exploit dolphins and whales freely as their resource, but the mammals don't belong to Taiji.      "Marine mammals migrate across oceans, and internationally public opinion is that wildlife should be allowed to live as they are. The plan will only ignite more protests over dolphin-hunting.” |||||	– Taiji, the dolphin-slaughtering Japanese town documented in The Cove, has no plans to end its annual dolphin hunt ... but it is opening a super-fun-sounding amusement park, where you can swim with the dolphins and then stop by a food stand and chow down on them. "This is part of Taiji’s long-term plan of making the whole town a park, where you can enjoy watching marine mammals while tasting various marine products," an official explains to AFP. Whale meat will also be on offer. Taiji, where hunters round up dolphins, sell some to aquariums and marine parks, and kill the rest for meat, has come under quite a bit of scrutiny following the documentary. But the 69-acre marine park, set to open within five years, will help the town to keep the controversial hunt alive by drawing in tourists, the official says. Environmental activists, not surprisingly, are calling the plan exploitative, the Telegraph reports.

Kevin Whitney says he lost his iPhone last October.      "I had it in my pocket and I bent over to work on a copper bottom door and it fell out of my pocket into my grain pit and went up the elevator," said Whitney.      It disappeared into a bin full of 280,000 pounds of grain.      “I thought I'll never see that phone again," said Whitney.      Little did Kevin know, his iPhone would take a nine month journey halfway around the world before making it back to the palm of his hand.      From Chickasha it was driven by truck to another grain facility in Inola, Oklahoma. Then it traveled along the Arkansas River. From there, it sailed down the Mississippi River by barge to Convent, Louisiana. Finally, the iPhone made its way to Kashima, Japan by ship.      It was mixed in with 2 million bushels of grain sorghum.      Then just days ago Kevin got a call.      "The man on the other end said, 'is this Kevin Whitney?' I said yeah this is Kevin. He said, 'did you lose a cell phone?' I said yeah I lost a cell phone last fall."      A worker at a grain mill in Japan mailed the phone back to Louisiana and from there it was sent to Kevin in Chickasha.      "It’s crazy I can't believe it.

(Associated Press)      Whitney, the manager of the Apache Farmers Co-Op in Chickasha, Oklahoma, lost his phone in October after it slipped out of his shirt pocket as he was unloading grain from a truck into a silo holding roughly 290,000 bushels of grain.      "I knew it was lost forever and there was no retrieving the thing," said Whitney, 53.      Whitney went out and bought a replacement phone the next day. But the loss of the phone was tough: Pictures of family photos from his daughter's wedding and vacation were stored on there.      What Whitney didn't know was that his phone was just beginning its journey.      The phone traveled to another Oklahoma grain facility before going down the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers to a depot in Convent, Louisiana. From there, the grain was loaded onto ships bound for another grain depot on the island of Hokkaido, Japan.      In late May, Whitney received a phone call from Eric Slater with the Zen-Noh Grain Corporation.      "Lo and behold, I get a call from a guy who works with this grain company in Convent, Louisiana, saying a guy at a feed mill in Japan found the phone," Whitney said.      Slater, manager for Zen-Noh's terminal in Convent, said he charged the phone and scrolled through to find Whitney's pictures and called him.      "I knew if that was my phone, I'd probably want it back," said Slater, who added it's not uncommon for cellphones to accidentally fall into grain shipments. "Frankly, I field about a phone a month."      Whitney was shocked the phone made it through such an ordeal in pristine condition.      "It's crazy because everyone's walking around with a cracked iPhone," he said.      After its global odyssey, the "old" phone came back in June, and is sitting in Whitney's desk drawer, safe at home.      Whitney said he's still shocked he got the phone back.      "It's amazing he didn't just throw it in a Dumpster or something, let alone send it back to somebody," Whitney said. |||||	– When Oklahoma farmer Kevin Whitney's phone slipped out of his pocket into a silo containing 290,000 bushels of grain, he figured it was gone for good—but it was just beginning a journey around the world.

His alleged accomplice, Mary Craig Rice, surrendered to authorities. USA TODAY NETWORK      William Boyette (Photo: Special to the News Journal)      WEST POINT, Ga. — Authorities say one of two people wanted in the deaths of four women has killed himself, ending a Tuesday standoff at a west Georgia motel and a multi-state crime spree.      Escambia (Fla.) County Sheriff David Morgan said William Boyette died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and that another suspect, Mary Rice, surrendered and is in custody. The pair is charged with killings that sparked a manhunt throughout southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, where the crimes occurred.      Deputies in Florida responded to a citizen tip Tuesday afternoon and found Boyette and Rice holed up at the West Point Motel in West Point, Ga., along with a car that was stolen Monday morning from Kayla Crocker's home in Pensacola, Fla. Crocker, 28, was shot and died Tuesday afternoon at an area hospital.      According to Sgt. Smith with Troup County Sheriff's Office, police made multiple attempts to contact Boyette and Rice inside the hotel with no luck.      Rice came out of the motel room where she was holed up with Boyette shortly after the Georgia SWAT team arrived. Within minutes of Rice being put in handcuffs and led away from the motel, police heard a single gunshot from inside the motel room, according to Troup County Georgia Sheriff James Woodruff.      Officers entered the room and found Boyette dead, Woodruff said.      The tip was received at about 2:30 p.m. today from a citizen who spotted the car that was being discussed in the media and on social media, Woodruff said. An officer was dispatched to the motel and confirmed it was the car stolen from Crocker.      A clerk at the motel told deputies that Rice checked into the motel Monday night under her own name. Deputies confirmed there were people inside the room because Boyette and Rice opened the curtains periodically and waved at law enforcement.      Deputies set up a perimeter around the hotel and just as SWAT was preparing to enter, Rice came outside, Woodruff said.      “We are always glad when something this seriously is resolved and no one is injured and no one is killed,” Woodruff told media gathered outside the motel. “We knew going in, them having killed several people already, that this could end very badly.”      Dominic Guadagnoli of the U.S. Marshals Service said federal, state and local law enforcement officials were on the scene.

(Photo: Tony Giberson/tgiberson@pnj.com)      The shooting of Crocker Monday morning in her home was the most recent attack in the crime spree that began Jan. 31.      Two women, Alicia Greer and Jacqueline Moore, were killed at the Emerald Sands Inn in Milton, Fla., on Jan. 31. Boyette and Rice are are then thought to have killed Peggy Broz at her Lillian, Ala., home the morning of Feb. 3 in order to steal her vehicle.      Baldwin County (Ala.) Sheriff’s Office information officer Anthony Lowery confirmed that a warrant for capital murder had been issued for Boyette and Rice for the ambush and killing of Broz.      It’s alleged that Rice and Boyette followed Broz to her home early on the morning of Feb. 3, where they shot and killed Broz in her front yard. Lowery said BCSO has found no other connection between the suspects and the victim other than the fact she had a vehicle they wanted.      “We believe at this point that obviously they selected her to prey on, they don’t have any ties that tie them together at this point,” he said.      Mary Craig Rice (Photo: Special to the News Journal)      Broz worked at Baptist Hospital in Pensacola, but Lowery wasn’t able to confirm whether Boyette and Rice had followed Broz all the way from Pensacola to her home, or whether they were already located in Alabama when they found her.      In a press conference at the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office Tuesday morning, Sheriff Bob Johnson said a warrant for accessory after the fact to capital murder has been issued for Rice, who Johnson says is a "willing participant."      Records show that Boyette was a habitual violent offender, having been accused of beating and stabbing previous girlfriends in the years leading up to his killing spree and eventual death.      The prosecution was forced to drop a number of charges as the victims either couldn’t be located or recanted their statements on Boyette’s abuse, and as such he never served more than a year in jail for his domestic violence accusations.      Boyette had only been out of jail four months for a probation violation when he allegedly committed the Milton double homicide.      Aside from the known relationship between Boyette and Greer, police can’t point to any other connection between Boyette and Rice to the other three victims.      State Attorney Bill Eddins said Rice faces charges of accessory after the fact to capital murder in the Milton double homicide, and charges are still pending in the attack on Crocker.      Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office public information officer Anthony Lowery said Rice is facing charges of capital murder in the Alabama jurisdiction for her involvement with Broz’s killing.

ECSO Public Information Officer Andrew Hobbs confirmed that Boyette is deceased and Rice has been captured by the Troup County Sheriff's Office in Georgia.      The TCSO said that Boyette died from what they believe to be a self-inflicted gun shot wound. Investigators are processing the scene at the West Point Motel at this time.      On Tuesday afternoon, the TCSO in Georgia reported that Boyette and Rice were inside of the West Point Motel in Georgia.      Troup County officials said that there was an active scene at the motel located at 7800 West Point Road in West Point, Georgia.      The Troup County Sheriff's Office along with multiple support agencies were attempting to make contact Boyette and Rice.      The TCSO said that while they tried to bring the situation to a peaceful resolution, they wanted people avoid the area of the motel.      Earlier, Baldwin County Schools reported that they would continue to have increased security measures in place until Boyette and Rice were apprehended by authorities.      During a press conference on Tuesday morning, Santa Rosa County, Florida District Attorney William "Bill" Eddins said charges for Rice, 37 had been upgraded to accessory after the fact to premeditated murder.      "We are asking her to turn herself in," said Eddins.      Eddins went on to say that the other suspect, Boyette, had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault charges in Santa Rosa County in 2003 and served a stint in jail.      Boyette was arrested and face state charges in Florida for possession of a firearm by a felon after being released from jail. Eddin also hinted at not being able to charge Boyette with domestic violence in Santa Rosa County on several occasions because his spouse would not cooperate.      A warrant for capital murder was also issued Tuesday morning in Baldwin County for the arrest Rice by investigators with the Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit.      Rice is charged with capital murder and first-degree robbery in the death of Peggy Phillips Broz of Lillian, Alabama.      BCSO investigators have determined that Rice was with William "Billy" Boyette, 41, when they shot and killed Broz during the early morning hours of Friday (Feb. 3).      After the murder, both suspects are believed to have stolen Broz' vehicle and fled to Florida.      That news came a few hours after the Escambia County Sheriff's Office reported that Crimestoppers has increased the reward to $21,000 for a tip that can lead to the arrest of Boyette and Rice.      The ECSO made the announcement on their Facebook page just after 8:00 p.m. Monday night.      The previous reward had reached $11,000 over the weekend when Boyette became the suspect in the deaths of Alicia Greer and Jacqueline Moore in Milton, Florida and Broz.      The ECSO also released a portrait-view photo of Boyette's suspected accomplice, Mary Rice.      The photo highlights the gap between her upper-middle teeth.      Authorities are still considering Boyette and Rice armed and dangerous. They are urging residents in Escambia County and Baldwin County to avoid approaching the pair if spotted and to call 911 immediately.      The duo are still believed to be traveling in a white 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt with Florida license plate number: 9613BJ.      The vehicle was stolen during a home invasion in the Beluah, Florida area on Monday morning when Kayla Crocker was shot and left in critical condition at a local hospital. Her 2-year-old son was unharmed during the home invasion.      A relative of the victim, Loretta Crocker, has set up a donations page to help Kayla's family while she recovers. ||||| Just One More Thing...      We have sent you a verification email.

"I didn't even find out that my daughter was murdered until Wednesday," Stockhill said.      She called the death of Boyette "some relief."      "He's off the streets," Stockhill said. "He's not going to hurt anybody else." |||||	– A fugitive murder suspect who vowed he wouldn't be taken alive killed himself after being cornered at a Georgia motel Tuesday, police say. William "Billy" Boyette died of what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound moments after alleged accomplice Mary Rice surrendered at a motel in West Point, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Cops believe the pair murdered Alicia Greer and Jacqueline Moore at a motel in Milton, Fla., on Jan. 31 before killing Peggy Broz in Lillian, Ala., on Feb. 3 to steal her car. A fourth victim, Kayla Crocker, was shot in Pensacola, Fla., on Monday and died from her injuries on Tuesday, USA Today reports. Rice has been charged with robbery and first-degree murder. Police say they found the pair and that a standoff at the Motel West Point began after they received a tip from a citizen who spotted Crocker's car outside the motel at 2:30pm. The vehicle was stolen after a home invasion in which Crocker was fatally wounded but her 2-year-old son was left unharmed, AL.com reports. Boyette was confirmed dead and Rice was arrested at around 6:15pm. Boyette was in a relationship with Greer, but police say there was no known connection between him or Rice and any of the other three victims. "There is nothing to make sense of this. He needed a car, and he did not care 'cause he's an evil person," Broz's father-in-law tells NBC News.

(Associated Press)      ATLANTA (AP) — A potentially life-saving kidney transplant has given a Georgia family a lot to be grateful for this Thanksgiving, nearly two months after the operation was controversially delayed.      A.J. Burgess, who will be 3 in January, was born without kidneys. His parents got word about 8 p.m. Tuesday that a kidney from a dead donor was available, and the toddler had a successful transplant Wednesday morning, said Mawuli Davis, a lawyer for A.J.'s parents.      The boy will have to stay in the hospital for about a week, including the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, but his parents are "excited about giving thanks for his new kidney," Davis said in a phone interview.      The transplant comes after a setback last month when Emory University Hospital told the family it was delaying a transplant of a kidney from A.J.'s father, Anthony Dickerson, who was a perfect match.      Dickerson has repeatedly been in trouble with the law and was arrested again in September. That didn't initially seem to be an obstacle. A letter to the Gwinnett County jail from Emory's Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program requested his temporary release.      "If Mr. Dickerson could be escorted to Emory for blood work and a pre-operative appointment tomorrow, September 29, we will be able to continue with the scheduled surgery," the Sept. 28 letter says.      But then A.J.'s mother, Carmellia Burgess, received a letter from the hospital saying the surgery would be delayed until Dickerson could provide documentation from his parole officer showing compliance for the next three months.      "We will re-evaluate Mr. Dickerson in January 2018 after receipt of this completed documentation," the letter said.      Burgess told news outlets her child's life was being unfairly endangered because of his father's mistakes. The story resonated with people around the country and the local community rallied around the family, demanding justice for A.J.      Emory Healthcare officials and physicians met with A.J.'s parents, their lawyers and community supporters on Nov. 2. A statement from Emory said the meeting was meant to open the lines of communication and to have an open and honest discussion about how best to help A.J.      "In reviewing our communication with the family, Emory Healthcare wants to acknowledge and apologize for a breakdown in communication on our part," the statement said.      Emory and the family continued to communicate, and A.J. remained on a list for a donated kidney even as his father went through the process to be able to donate his kidney, Davis said. When a kidney became available Tuesday, the doctors decided it was in the boy's best interest to go ahead with the dead donor's kidney, he said.      The transplant doctors said the surgery Wednesday went very well and that A.J. was in recovery and would be moved to the intensive care unit, Davis said. ||||| Story highlights Two-year-old AJ Burgess was in kidney failure, and his father was a perfect match      The hospital originally denied the transplant due to the father's incarceration      The boy had surgery Wednesday, and his new kidney is already working      (CNN) Two-year-old AJ Burgess received a new kidney Wednesday after a prolonged battle with hospital officials who postponed his original October surgery when his father, a perfect donor match, violated his parole and was arrested.      "This is an unexpected Thanksgiving miracle," family attorney Muwali Davis said while the baby was in recovery at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. "To watch this child that no one expected to live, and now for him to have a chance at a healthy life, it's unbelievable.      "His parents and family are overwhelmed with gratitude," Davis added. "They want everyone to know that with faith, all things are possible. When the situation was very bleak, it was their faith and the support of the community that pulled them through this."      According to AJ's mother, Carmellia Burgess, the boy was born prematurely without working kidneys. On a GoFundMe page Burgess established, she says AJ's father, Anthony Dickerson, was "found to be a perfect match" and volunteered to donate one of his kidneys.      Emory Healthcare in Atlanta was set to remove Dickerson's kidney on October 3, according to Burgess, and soon after, AJ would undergo the transplant at Egleston.

That's the message from a lawyer representing a 2-year-old Georgia boy, who was temporarily blocked from receiving a lifesaving kidney, after the toddler underwent a successful transplant Wednesday, reports CNN. AJ Burgess was born without functioning kidneys. However, his father, Anthony Dickerson, was a perfect match and offered to provide one of his own. A transplant was initially scheduled, but it was canceled last month when Dickerson was arrested for a parole violation and weapons possession. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta then said Dickerson had to comply with his parole for three months, showing he could adhere to the aftercare requirements in compliance with "stringent" national guidelines for living donors, before the transplant could take place. Family members feared AJ wouldn't survive the three months, but their anxious waiting ended Tuesday when the hospital called to report that a kidney was available from a deceased donor, per the AP. A successful surgery was performed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta on Wednesday, says family attorney Mawuli Davis. "To watch this child that no one expected to live, and now for him to have a chance at a healthy life, it's unbelievable," he says. "His parents and family are overwhelmed with gratitude." In a Wednesday Facebook post, AJ's mom said the kidney was already producing urine. AJ is expected to return home in a week. In the meantime, Davis says the family will "celebrate Thanksgiving in the hospital with him and his new kidney." They'll get there in a new car—a gift from Tyler Perry, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
summarize: Archaeologists made a stunning, if not stinky discovery during their excavations of I Vilhelm Werners square in Odense on Funen.      The digs revealed numerous latrine barrels dating back to the 1300s and still filled with their intended content, proving – among other things – that human excrement still has a putrid odour even if it is centuries old.      Many of the barrels, which were found during 2013, are in excellent condition and their contents can provide a unique insight into the dietary habits of people living some seven hundred years ago.      READ MORE: Danish research gives new details on Ice Age extinction      Huge urban dig      But what’s also interesting is that the barrels were usually used for something else before becoming latrines, and the markings on the barrels reveal who owned it and whether it was used for the transportation of goods or storage of fish.      The dig, which is ongoing and is one of the largest urban archaeological excavations in Danish history, also uncovered three barrels stacked on top of one another that turned out to be a well. The barrels were tied together and packed with clay, and at the bottom archaeologists found a system of pipes.

The findings paint a less than pretty picture of the health and hygiene of crusaders stationed on the Mediterranean island 800 years ago. Poor sanitation likely meant that food and water supplies were contaminated by fecal material, allowing parasitic infections to spread, the study suggests.      Short-lived latrine      Researchers from the University of Cambridge dug into the pit of dried-out waste under a latrine in the remains of Saranda Kolones (Greek for "Forty Columns") at Paphos, a city at the southwestern tip of Cyprus and a UNESCO World Heritage site. [Through the Years: A Gallery of the World's Toilets]      Overlooking Paphos harbor, and next to a complex of Roman villas with remarkably intact floor mosaics, Saranda Kolones was long thought to be a temple because of the granite columns that littered its ruins. But excavations in the 1950s revealed that it was actually a short-lived concentric castle.      English King Richard the Lionheart sold the island of Cyprus to the Frankish crusader Guy de Lusignan in May 1192. Archaeologists believe the Franks built Saranda Kolones to defend Paphos harbor soon after their occupation of the island began. But in 1222, the city was rocked by a powerful earthquake thought to be at least 7.0 in magnitude. Much of the fortress was left in ruins, never to be rebuilt, but the latrines on its lower floors survived.      These toilets were carved to fit the human form, with a half moon-shaped hole in the seat leading to a sewer below. Cambridge researchers Evilena Anastasiou and Piers Mitchell, who study ancient parasites, collected samples from one of those cesspools, rehydrated the waste and strained it through a micro-sieve to catch parasite eggs, each smaller than a tenth of a millimeter.      Worms in the waste      Under a microscope, the researchers saw that the samples contained the eggs of two of the world's most common and widespread intestinal parasites: whipworms (Trichuris trichiura), which cause the infection known as trichocephalus, and giant roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), the largest of the nematodes found in human intestines, with adults that can grow to more than 1 foot (30 centimeters) long.      People with a light load of these worms may experience no symptoms. But when whipworms and giant roundworms heavily colonize the digestive tract, they compete with their hosts for food, siphoning off the nutrients that would normally be absorbed in the intestines. Eggs of the parasites pass through the feces and spread to other hosts by ingestion (say, when a human doesn't wash their hands and spreads the parasite to food or other objects that get consumed). That means infections are most common in places with poor hygiene and sanitation as well as areas where human waste is used as fertilizer or where people defecate in the soil.      Mitchell has estimated that during a two- or three-year crusade expedition, noblemen and clergy were just as likely to die in battle as they were to succumb to malnutrition and disease. Presumably, the risk of malnutrition would have been even worse for poor foot soldiers with fewer resources. The new study suggests that parasites likely contributed to the demise of many soldiers who died of starvation or disease.      "In these circumstances [it] is quite likely that medieval soldiers with a heavy parasite load would have been at increased risk of death from starvation during famine episodes such as long sieges or expeditions when supplies ran out," the researchers wrote. "This is because they would have had to share the limited available food with their parasites."      Studying feces is a rather unglamorous but useful way for archaeologists to reconstruct the diets, health and lifestyle of ancient people. The parasites described in this study are hardly the oldest ever found in Cyprus. A recent analysis of human waste up to 10,000 years old revealed roundworms, whipworms and tapeworms at the Neolithic Cypriot sites of Khirokitia and Shillourokambos.      The research was detailed in the International Journal of Paleopathology.      Follow Megan Gannon on Twitterand Google+. Follow us @livescience, Facebook& Google+.

And yes, they still smell bad," an archaeologist explains. The team stumbled on what appears to be a 14th-century communal toilet area in the medieval town of Odense, unearthing a number of medieval barrels filled with human waste. And in case you were wondering, the poop the barrels contained was in "excellent condition," reports Discovery News, with the Copenhagen Post explaining that its "putrid odor" hadn't diminished over the centuries. But it's more than just stinky. It actually tells researchers a lot about how the people of the time lived. (LiveScience notes latrine samples from roughly the same period in Cyprus revealed the intestinal parasites that plagued the crusaders there.)

summarize: Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees has produced five litres of petrol since August when it switched on a small refinery that manufactures gasoline from carbon dioxide and water vapour.      The company hopes that within two years it will build a larger, commercial-scale plant capable of producing a ton of petrol a day. It also plans to produce green aviation fuel to make airline travel more carbon-neutral.      Tim Fox, head of energy and the environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London, said: "It sounds too good to be true, but it is true. They are doing it and I've been up there myself and seen it. The innovation is that they have made it happen as a process. It's a small pilot plant capturing air and extracting CO2 from it based on well known principles. It uses well-known and well-established components but what is exciting is that they have put the whole thing together and shown that it can work."      Although the process is still in the early developmental stages and needs to take electricity from the national grid to work, the company believes it will eventually be possible to use power from renewable sources such as wind farms or tidal barrages.      "We've taken carbon dioxide from air and hydrogen from water and turned these elements into petrol," said Peter Harrison, the company's chief executive, who revealed the breakthrough at a conference at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London.      "There's nobody else doing it in this country or indeed overseas as far as we know. It looks and smells like petrol but it's a much cleaner and clearer product than petrol derived from fossil oil," Mr Harrison told The Independent.      "We don't have any of the additives and nasty bits found in conventional petrol, and yet our fuel can be used in existing engines," he said.      "It means that people could go on to a garage forecourt and put our product into their car without having to install batteries or adapt the vehicle for fuel cells or having hydrogen tanks fitted. It means that the existing infrastructure for transport can be used," Mr Harrison said.      Being able to capture carbon dioxide from the air, and effectively remove the principal industrial greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, has been the holy grail of the emerging green economy.      Using the extracted carbon dioxide to make petrol that can be stored, transported and used as fuel for existing engines takes the idea one step further. It could transform the environmental and economic landscape of Britain, Mr Harrison explained.      "We are converting renewable electricity into a more versatile, useable and storable form of energy, namely liquid transport fuels. We think that by the end of 2014, provided we can get the funding going, we can be producing petrol using renewable energy and doing it on a commercial basis," he said.      "We ought to be aiming for a refinery-scale operation within the next 15 years. The issue is making sure the UK is in a good place to be able to set up and establish all the manufacturing processes that this technology requires. You have the potential to change the economics of a country if you can make your own fuel," he said.      The initial plan is to produce petrol that can be blended with conventional fuel, which would suit the high-performance fuels needed in motor sports. The technology is also ideal for remote communities that have abundant sources of renewable electricity, such solar energy, wind turbines or wave energy, but little in the way of storing it, Mr Harrison said.      "We're talking to a number of island communities around the world and other niche markets to help solve their energy problems.      "You're in a market place where the only way is up for the price of fossil oil and at some point there will be a crossover where our fuel becomes cheaper," he said.      Although the prototype system is designed to extract carbon dioxide from the air, this part of the process is still too inefficient to allow a commercial-scale operation.      The company can and has used carbon dioxide extracted from air to make petrol, but it is also using industrial sources of carbon dioxide until it is able to improve the performance of "carbon capture".      Other companies are working on ways of improving the technology of carbon capture, which is considered far too costly to be commercially viable as it costs up to £400 for capturing one ton of carbon dioxide.      However, Professor Klaus Lackner of Columbia University in New York said that the high costs of any new technology always fall dramatically.      "I bought my first CD in the 1980s and it cost $20 but now you can make one for less than 10 cents. The cost of a light bulb has fallen 7,000-fold during the past century," Professor Lackner said. ||||| Pioneering British firm produces 'petrol from air' in breakthrough that could solve the world's energy crisis      Institution of Mechanical Engineers hails the process as a potential 'game changer' in battle against climate change      Stockton-on-Tees-based Air Fuel Synthesis claims they can make petrol directly from water and carbon dioxide in the air      Within two years the company hopes to have a commercial-scale plant capable of producing up to a ton of fuel a day            A British firm has produced the first 'petrol from air', it emerged today - in a pioneering scientific breakthrough that could end mankind's reliance on declining fossil fuels.      Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees, Teesside, claims to have made five litres of petrol since August using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour.      Experts have hailed the incredible breakthrough as a potential 'game-changer' in the battle against climate change and solution to the globe's escalating energy crisis.      Scroll down for video      Last year, British researchers claimed that they had also found the 'holy grail' of the green economy by producing petrol from air for the first time. Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees, Teesside, made petrol using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour      While the company is still developing their process and still need to take electricity from the national grid, it believes it will eventually be possible to power the synthesis entirely from renewable sources.      Within two years it hopes to build a commercial-scale plant capable of making a ton of petrol a day and expand into producing green aviation fuel to make airline travel more eco-friendly.      The technology involves mixing air with sodium hydroxide, then electrolysing the resultant sodium carbonate to release pure carbon dioxide.      This is then reacted with hydrogen electrolysed from water to make a hydrocarbon mixture, with the reaction conditions varied depending on the type of fuel desired.      The fuel that is produced can be made ready for use in any petrol tank with the addition of the same additives currently added to fuel.            Alternatively it can be blended directly with gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel.      Development stage: The company claims to have made five litres of petrol over the past few months, but they hope to move to a commercial-scale plant producing a ton a day within two years This diagram illustrates the pioneering process for creating petrol from water Peter Harrison, the company's chief executive, revealed the breakthrough at a conference at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London this week. 'We are converting renewable electricity into a more versatile, usable and storable form of energy, namely liquid transport fuels,' he told the Independent.            WATER INTO PETROL: THE PROCESS Air is blown into a tower filled with a mist of sodium hydroxide solution. The carbon dioxide in the air reacts with some of the sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate.      This sodium carbonate is then electrolysed to release the carbon dioxide, which is collected and stored.      A dehumidifier condenses water out of the same air passed into the tower, with this condensed water then passed into an electrolyser where it is split into hydrogen and oxygen.      The carbon dioxide and hydrogren are reacted together to make a hydrocarbon mixture, with reaction conditions varied depending on the kind of fuel required.      The product can then be mixed with the same additives used in current fuels to ease starting, burn cleanly and avoid corrosion problems. Otherwise it can be blended directly with gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel.      'We think that by the end of 2014, provided we can get the funding going, we can be producing petrol using renewable energy and doing it on a commercial basis.'      Extracting carbon dioxide from air - effectively removing the principal industrial greenhouse gas from the atmosphere - has been described as the 'holy grail' of the emerging green economy.      However, recycling that extracted carbon dioxide into fuel usable in existing engines has the potential to transform the world's environmental and economic landscape.      Mr Harrison said he planned to be producing petrol on a commercial basis using renewable energy by the end of 2014.

summarize: It’s a good thing that Neanderthals didn’t have tartar-control toothpaste.      What looks to us like unsightly buildup has turned out to be a goldmine for microbiologists who study human evolution. Hardened plaque harvested from Neanderthals is loaded with genetic material from plants and animals these prehistoric hominins ate, as well as remnants of microbes that reveal a surprising amount about how they lived and even what made them sick.      Researchers extracted the ancient DNA and bacteria from the jaws of three Neanderthal individuals from Belgium and Spain, and described the results in a paper published today in the journal Nature.      Origins: The Journey of Humankind airs Mondays 9/8c on National Geographic.      Watch: OUR FIGHT AGAINST DEATH From the "dark arts" to the scientific method to cracking our own genetic code, humanity's endless pursuits in medicine have made us not only modern, but superhuman.      The Belgian individuals ate a heavily meat-based diet, indicated by DNA from wooly rhinoceros and wild sheep. Meanwhile, the Spanish Neanderthal seemed to have eaten mostly vegetable material, including moss, pine nuts, and mushrooms.      Perhaps more intriguing, though, were the microbial riches Weyrich’s team found preserved in the calcified plaques: The team recovered DNA from these prehistoric individuals’ microbiomes, communities of bacteria and fungi living on and inside their bodies.      “It gives us a picture of a wide variety of things they were exposed to in their daily lives, including diseases and the medicines they were using to treat them,” says study leader and University of Adelaide microbiologist Laura Weyrich.      For instance, the individual from El Sidrón, Spain, seems to have had some bacterial strains that gave him a hard time, and it’s possible the hominin turned to botanicals to treat them.      The Spanish Neanderthal was suffering from a dental abscess, possibly caused by a subspecies of the bacterium Methanobrevibacter oralis. Poplar found in the sample likely provided salicylic acid—the active ingredient in aspirin—for pain relief. (Read “Neanderthal Gums Relieved by Toothpicks.”)      The individual was also dealing with diarrhea and vomiting caused by a different pathogen, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and may even have turned to antibiotic-producing molds for treatment. Genetic material from Penicillium rubens was found on plant matter in this Neanderthal’s teeth.      Digesting the Data      The idea of looking at tooth plaques for clues about life in ancient times has been around for decades; study co-author Keith Dobney has been working on some form of the technique since the 1980s.      But it wasn’t until the advent of super high-powered microscopy and precision genetics tools that researchers were able to drill down into prehistoric plaques to really perceive what might be lurking there.      View Images A closeup of the Neandertal teeth shows dental calculus deposits as a rind on the tooth enamel. Photograph by Royal Belgian Institute of Nature Sciences      Worse, says Weyrich, until the last 10 to 15 years, calcified tartar would routinely be cleaned away from new specimens at museums and labs, because scientists then were more interested in growth and wear patterns on the teeth themselves.      The idea that Neanderthals ate both meat and vegetables or self-medicated with plants isn’t strictly new. This study backs up results from earlier examinations of nitrogen isotopes found in tooth enamel and physical plant remains found jammed between their teeth.      What really grabbed Weyrich and her group in the new data was the fact that the meat-eaters’ overall microbiomes differed from the vegetarian’s, and that they differed altogether from the microbial mashups that live inside modern humans.      What the various groups were eating may be the key to these differences. And with this ancient reference point, scientists can now better track the way diet impacts the microbiome over time, and how those effects have shaped our evolution.      “Looking at how dietary changes cause changes in the microbiome is really hard to do with modern medicine—you’d have to get millions of people eating the same thing for months on end,” Weyrich says.      “But using Neanderthals as a model—people who are stuck in one place and limited to the food sources those places provide—we can determine what they were doing that might have caused a change in their microbiome.”      Dobney, an archaeologist with the University of Aberdeen, says he’s hopeful that being able to compare post-agricultural biomes with those of prehistoric people can offer ideas for how to combat modern dietary blights.      “Microbiomes have evolved over millions of years with us, and we can’t live without them,” Dobney says. “Obesity, diabetes—these don’t come out of nowhere. This will give us some serious insight on how changes in migration and diet have impacted human society.”      The work could even offer fresh clues to why Neanderthals ultimately died out.      “The [Belgian] Neanderthals we looked at were some of the last that existed, so if there’s a signal in the changes in their microbiome that contributes to their health, then these are the ones we’d want to look in,” Weyrich says.

Photograph by Royal Belgian Institute of Nature Sciences      Weyrich’s group also sequenced the entire genome of the gum-disease causing Methanobrevibacter bacteria—at 48,000 years old, it’s by far the oldest bacterial genome sequenced to date.      They found that the Neanderthal strain originated around 125,000 years ago, at the time when Homo sapiens and Neanderthals are thought to have been interbreeding. The modern form of this bacterium is transmitted from person to person via saliva, so the find raises interesting questions about how humans and Neanderthals may have interacted during such intimate moments.      “Breeding encounters have often been thought of as brash, rough events, but these are oral microorganisms, transferred through kissing or food-sharing,” Weyrich says. “That we’re finding them in the mouths of these Neanderthals tells us more about how they would have potentially gotten along with humans. And that’s just one microorganism in the mouth.”      While there’s more work to be done to determine exactly how the bacterium moved across populations, the concept intrigues Lawrence Straus, a University of New Mexico anthropologist who has studied European Neanderthals for 45 years.      “It would be truly fantastic to see evidence of the passing of specific bacteria from Neanderthals to Homo sapiens,” says Straus. ||||| Some Neanderthals Were Vegetarian — And They Likely Kissed Our Human Ancestors      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Abel Grau/ComunicaciÃÂ³n CSIC Courtesy of Abel Grau/ComunicaciÃÂ³n CSIC      Now, it's no surprise that Neanderthals didn't brush their teeth. Nor did they go to the dentist.      That means bits of food and the microbes in their mouths just stayed stuck to their teeth. While not so good for dental hygiene, these dental plaques are a great resource for scientists interested in understanding more about Neanderthal diet and lifestyle.      Luckily for researchers, there is an abundance of Neanderthal teeth in the fossil record. "We have complete jaws with teeth, we have upper jaws with skulls with teeth intact, isolated teeth," says Keith Dobney, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool.      He and his colleagues have been studying Neanderthal dental plaques — or rather, the hardened version of plaque, tartar, or what scientists call dental calculus. They scraped off some of the calculus and analyzed the DNA that was preserved in it for clues to what the Neanderthals ate.      They looked at plaques from the teeth of three Neanderthals living in Europe about 50,000 years ago. One individual was from a cave in Spy, Belgium, and the other two were from El Sidrón cave in Spain.      As they report in a study published in this week's Nature, the Belgian individual ate mostly meat. "We found evidence of woolly rhino. We found the DNA of wild sheep," says Dobney.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Royal Belgian Institute of Nature Sciences Courtesy of Royal Belgian Institute of Nature Sciences      The researchers also found evidence of mushrooms, but this was certainly a meat lover. This isn't that surprising to scientists who study Neanderthal diets. After all, the butchered bones of woolly rhinos, mammoths, horses and reindeer had been found in the Spy cave and other sites, suggesting a meat-heavy diet.      There had also been other indirect sources of evidence of carnivory, like high levels of a certain nitrogen isotopes, which suggested meat- and/or mushroom-heavy diets.      "Most Neanderthals that had been analyzed [before] were really heavy meat eaters," says Laura Weyrich, at the Australian Center for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide, Australia, and the lead author on the new study. She says those previous studies had suggested that "Neanderthals were as carnivorous as polar bears."      And this is where the new study offered a big surprise. According to the DNA in dental plaques, the Neanderthals in Spain ate no meat at all.      "We find things like pine nuts, moss, tree barks and even mushrooms as well," says Weyrich. "It is very indicative of a vegetarian diet, probably the true Paleo diet." (Not all of the region's Neanderthals were necessarily vegetarians: The El Sidrón cave also contained grisly evidence of cannibalism.)            She says the difference in diets reflects the fact that the two groups lived in two very different environments.      Northern Europe, including Belgium, had wide open spaces with grasslands and many mammals. "It would have been very grassy, and kind of mountainous," says Weyrich. "You can imagine a big woolly rhino wandering through the grass there." Perhaps tracked by hungry Neanderthals looking for dinner.            But farther south in Spain, the Neanderthals lived in dense forests. "It's hard to imagine a big woolly rhino trying to wedge themselves between the trees," says Weyrich. And so, she says the Neanderthals there feasted on all kinds of plants and mushrooms. "They're very opportunistic, trying to find anything that's edible in their environment."      "Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that Neanderthals are adapting to local conditions and varying their diets," says Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London. He studies human origins, but wasn't involved in the new study.      For example, Neanderthals living on the coast of Gibraltar "were collecting molluscs and baking them," he says. "They were butchering at least one seal. There [was] dolphin material at the site. That may have been stranded dolphin that they scavenged."      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Royal Belgian Institute of Nature Sciences Courtesy of Royal Belgian Institute of Nature Sciences      Stringer says it was the Neanderthals' adaptability that allowed them to thrive for tens of thousands of years across Europe and Asia.      "They were very evolved humans," he says. "They lived over a range of very different environments. They lived in different climatic conditions."      But Stringer cautions that the new study's findings probably don't reflect everything about the diets of these Neanderthals. "Not everything that you eat has an equal chance of getting incorporated into the calculus," he says. "And not everything has a chance of being preserved long term."      Perhaps more surprising than the clues about diets is what the DNA revealed about other aspects of Neanderthal life. The scientists uncovered the identities of more than 200 different species of microbes that lived in the mouths of these Neanderthals. It also gave clues to some diseases that might have ailed them.      One of the individuals in Spain seems to have had a painful tooth abscess and was suffering from a stomach bug. "We saw that he also had Microsporidia, which is a gastrointestinal pathogen," says Weyrich.            That means he probably had diarrhea and was throwing up. "He was a sick individual," says Weyrich. "He was a young adolescent male. He was mostly with ... females. So we like to think of him as this sick boy that the females were dragging along with them."            But what's more remarkable, she says, is that DNA in his dental plaque suggests he was self-medicating by eating the bark of poplar trees. "And poplar bark contains salicylic acid, one of the natural sources of what we call aspirin," she says.            Even more surprising was that they also found evidence of Penicillium in his plaque. That's the mold that makes the antibiotic penicillin. "It's pretty phenomenal that these guys were so in tune with their environment and to know what was going on and how to treat things," says Weyrich.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Paleoanthropology Group MNCN-CSIC Courtesy of Paleoanthropology Group MNCN-CSIC      But the surprises didn't end there. Weyrich and her colleagues also identified the DNA of a microbe that causes gum disease in humans today. "We were able to track back that this particular microorganism was actually obtained from humans, likely about 120,000 years ago." Weyrich and her colleagues don't believe the microbe caused disease in Neanderthals, but they think it tells a fascinating story about how the two species — our ancestors and Neanderthals — interacted.      Genetics has shown that the two interbred and swapped genes. "A lot of these breeding interactions had been thought to be rough interactions, something that wouldn't be sensual or enjoyable," says Weyrich. But if they were swapping microbes in their mouths, that suggests a different story: "It suggests that there's kissing — or at least food sharing — going on between these two groups. So we really think that those interactions were probably more friendly, and much more intimate, than what anyone ever imagined before."      Weyrich and her colleagues think that in the years to come, we will learn a lot more about Neanderthals and other human ancestors, just by studying the ancient DNA trapped in their dental plaques.      "It's a very exciting paper," says Jean-Jacques Hublin at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, who was not involved in the new study. "It opens a new window into the past, a new way to investigate [the] life and behavior of Neanderthals." |||||	– Scientists are thrilled to have discovered a gross buildup on a few fossilized teeth, and with reason. Not only were they able to discern the three Neanderthals' diets (two ate primarily meat, one primarily plants), they're also feasting their eyes on prehistoric microbiomes that are shedding more light on their lives. As recently as 10 to 15 years ago, scientists studying ancient teeth would routinely wipe off the plaque in their search for wear patterns on the structures of the teeth, but with modern microscopy, it's the stuff coating the teeth that reveals the most, reports National Geographic. For instance, one ancient bacterium suggests Neanderthals were kissing humans, or at least sharing food with them, reports NPR. And Neanderthals self-medicated using an early version of aspirin. The research is "very exciting," an unaffiliated scientist says. "It opens a new window into the past." Reporting in the journal Nature, the researchers note that the vegetarian, found in present-day Spain, had a dental abscess and appeared to be chewing tree bark in an attempt to relieve pain. The telltale clue was salicylic acid, which is found in poplar bark and is the active ingredient in aspirin. What's more, the researchers think this same individual ate molds that functioned as a primitive version of penicillin, suggesting Neanderthals had a sophisticated awareness of the bacteria ailing them. Their microbiomes, largely distinct from ours, could even provide clues about which diseases ailed them, and maybe even why they died off. (Here's a new piece in the puzzle of our family tree.)
summarize: A 67-year-old blind woman is facing eviction and claims she was never notified that someone bought the house in a tax sale.      A blind woman is facing eviction from her northwest Indiana home of 55 years after the land it sits on was bought at a tax sale for $43 without her knowledge.      "She got screwed on this bad," said Lake County Treasurer John Petalas.      The new owner has filed eviction papers in court and, in the meantime, is charging Dolores Pittman, 67, $300 to remain in the house in Cedar Lake, about 50 miles from Chicago. She has been paying that amount since May but it's a hardship, she said. Previously she had been paying $10 a year to the town to rent the land.      "If I had money, I'd just say to hell with it and go off someplace," said Pittman, a former librarian. An attorney is looking into the matter but has told her it doesn't look good.      Pittman said she moved into the home with her parents when she was 12.      "It was four days before Christmas and my little brother was 4. And we moved in during a snowstorm and the first thing I put up was the Christmas tree because it was important that Santa knew where to come," Pittman said. "It was security that we had a house. My mother said she just wanted a house that she knew she could die in."      At first, her parents rented the home from a church, the Lake Region Christian Assembly, which used the land as a retreat. The home -- but not the land -- was sold to her family for about $16,000 in the late 1970s or early 1980s, she said. The family paid a $10 annual rental fee to the town of Cedar Lake, who they believed had acquired the property from the church, she said.      But over the years, the church claimed to still own the property. The church did not pay property taxes.      "[The church] just didn't pay the taxes, I never got a notice," she said. "All the time they (the town) were saying they owned the property. I was paying rent to the town."      Pittman said she was never told that the dispute was eventually settled in the church's favor, and she continued paying the $10 to the town. "I was still paying rent. . .They were cashing my checks. It's like breach of contract. We signed contracts with them to continue paying the $10 rental each year but they couldn't bother with say, 'Oh, we don't own that.' "      About three years ago, the land was sold at a tax sale for $43. Pittman said she was never notified by officials.      Petalas, the Lake County treasurer, said the church had conveyed land to the town but not – it turned out -- the property underneath the home. "The land underneath the home was still owned by the church."      Until 2005, the church was not responsible for paying property taxes because it had a non-for-profit status, he said. Then changes in state law removed such status from vacant property and the church was issued tax bills, he said. But the church never paid them.      "So in 2009, the land went to a county commissioner sale and [it was bought]," Petalas said. "They (the church) just ignored it. They never called the county to say, 'Hey, we don't want this property' or at the very least, they never called this lady."      Cedar Lake's town manager Ian Nicolini could not explain why the town still collected a rental fee from Pittman when it no longer laid claim to the property. He declined further comment on the tax sale, saying the town is being sued by the person who bought the land.      The owner could not be reached for comment.      Nicolini said officials have been working to "make the transition" comfortable for Pittman. He said they are also working to get her assistance.      Pittman said that, with her Social Security and pension checks, she receives a little more than $1,000 a month. She lives with her brother, who is a mechanic. An infection caused Pittman to start losing her sight about 30 years. She went completely blind about five years ago.      While she appreciates people who want to help her, Pittman said through tears that she doesn't want to leave her home: "I want to know, am I going to be in here on Christmas or am I going to be out?"

She says she was never notified that someone bought the property in a tax sale.      Dolores Pittman, 67, has been blind for nearly 30 years. Now she could be kicked out of the home that she has lived in almost all her life, and where knows every nook and cranny.      Pittman is caught in the middle after the property her house is on was sold.      Pittman thought the land was owned by the town of Cedar Lake. She paid $10 a month to them, but Lake County thought a church group owned it.      In the middle of all this confusion the property was sold and the new owner is charging Pittman $300 a month — something she cannot afford.      “My Social Security and my pension is $1,068.23 a month,” she told WGN. “With all my bills I don’t have anything left.”      She says sometimes she only has about $6 a month left, and she is on the verge of being evicted. She thinks she may have only about 30 days.      Her attorney just sent her a letter and they are still going through the court system, but it is not looking good for her. She is hoping that somebody can pull through for her and she can stay in her home.      UPDATE: A fund has been established to help Ms. Pittman.

That's because the land beneath her northwest Indiana home was sold for $43 at a tax sale a few years ago—a sale Pittman didn't know about, the Chicago Tribune reports. Now, the new owner is charging Pittman, who is blind, $300 a month to stay in the house after filing for her eviction. "My income with a pension and social security is $1,000. Tell me where I'm going to find a place to rent," Pittman says, per ABC 7. The story behind the sale is convoluted: Pittman's family bought the home in the 1970s or 1980s, she says, after renting for years from a local church. But the family didn't buy the land, instead paying $10 a year to the town to rent it. (And that's the amount Pittman had been paying, before being charged the $300 rent.) They thought the town had taken over the land, but the church apparently still owned it—yet the church didn't pay taxes on the property, which were levied beginning in 2005 due to a change in state law regarding non-for-profits and vacant land. "So in 2009, the land went to a county commissioner sale" without Pittman's knowledge, says the Lake County treasurer. The church, however, "just ignored it. They never called the county to say, 'Hey, we don't want this property,' or at the very least, they never called this lady." Pittman's attorney says prospects are grim, WGN-TV reports.
summarize: Guam on Wednesday became the first U.S. territory to allow gay marriage after its attorney general directed officials to immediately begin processing same-sex marriage applications, according to a memo obtained by the Los Angeles Times.      Atty. Gen. Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson's instructions came two days after a lesbian couple, Kathleen Aguero and Loretta Pangelinan, filed a legal challenge to the territory's marriage laws after being barred from submitting an application for a marriage license.      "The right to marry the person of one's choice and to direct the course of one's life in this intimate realm without undue government interference is one of the fundamental liberty interests protected for all by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to United States Constitution," the couple's lawsuit asserts. "This exclusion from marriage and relegation to second-class status inflicts serious and irreparable harms upon [the] plaintiffs and other same-sex couples and their children."      Barrett-Anderson cited a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision as the basis for her directive. The appeals court in October found that state bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional.      "The ultimate decision on whether Guam's statute is constitutional will be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in June," according to a news release from Barrett-Anderson's office. "The Supreme Court's decision, however, to lift the stay in the [U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals] decision permits individuals in all nine states [covered by the circuit court] and Guam to the enjoyment of their right to marry regardless of gender."      Barrett-Anderson said the Department of Public Health and Social Services should treat “all same-gender marriage applicants with dignity and equality under the Constitution.”      Guam is the first of five U.S. Pacific and Caribbean territories to allow gay marriage.      A lawsuit challenging Puerto Rico's law defining marriage as between a man and a woman is pending before a federal appeals court in Boston. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Tuesday it would await the Supreme Court's decision on the issue before scheduling oral arguments in the Puerto Rico case.      Puerto Rico's Justice Department previously has defended the law in court, but Justice Secretary Cesar Miranda said last month that the department would no longer do so.

Eddie Baza Calvo's office in a statement said, "While this current legal issue is being reviewed, if it is the will of the people of Guam to make same-sex marriage legal on Guam, then the Guam Legislature, the people of Guam's representatives, can take action to change the law, or a referendum can be held giving the people of Guam a direct voice in this issue."

The current "severe' level means intelligence officials believe an attack is highly likely.

"He was staring at me," Delattre said. "He was confused and mumbling and didn't know what he was doing. He just kept saying, 'We were attacked, we got down on the floor, and we managed to get out.

She says the victims encountered "murderers who hate precisely this life of freedom."      Merkel said her country stands ready to help France in whichever way it can because the attack "was aimed not just at Paris, it targeted and it hits all of us."      ___      9:30 a.m.      French President Francois Hollande is meeting top government and security officials after suicide bombers targeted a stadium, concert hall and Friday night cafe crowds in attacks that killed at least 120.

Hollande declared a state of emergency — the first such move in a decade — and ordered 1,500 additional troops deployed.      The attacks raise concerns about international events that France is hosting, such as a UNESCO forum in Paris on Monday with world leaders, and major climate talks in Paris in two weeks.

Soldiers were deployed at key sites around Paris, including Parliament buildings and religious sites. ||||| Several suspects have been arrested in Belgium following a series of police raids linked to the terror attacks in Paris.      Up to three properties in the Molenbeek district of Brussels were reportedly searched on Saturday.      Koen Geens, the justice minister, told the VRT network that the arrests came after a car with Belgian license plates was seen close to the Bataclan concert hall, where Isis militants shot at least 80 victims dead at an Eagles of Death Metal concert.      He said "there were arrests relating to the search of the vehicle and person who rented it", numbering the number of people detained as“more than one.”      Timeline of Paris attacks      The Belgian public broadcaster, RTBF, was told by a source close to the operations that there had been “between two and three searches, linked to the Paris attacks”.      Police in Paris were also searching for a foreign car wanted in connection with the suicide bombings and shootings.      It is a black Seat with the numberplate GUT 18053 and five-spoke alloy wheels. Members of the public have been warned not to approach it.      President Francois Hollande said the attacks were an "act of war" that had been "prepared, organised and planned from abroad" with assistance from within France.

Additional reporting by Reuters |||||	– "A number of arrests" were made in Brussels Saturday in connection with Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris, according to Belgium's justice minister. The Independent reports police raided three properties in the city, arresting at least one man. The raids came after a rental car with Belgian license plates was seen near the Bataclan Friday night, according to the AP. "There were arrests relating to the search of the vehicle and person who rented it," the Belgian minister says. In addition to the arrests in Brussels, some possible details about a number of the other attackers have begun to leak out. The Independent reports a Syrian passport was found near a body believed to be that of one of the suicide bombers. The holder of the passport—which has not been proven to be authentic—entered Greece with dozens of refugees last month and was fingerprinted at that time, according to the Telegraph. An attacker who blew himself up inside the Bataclan is believed to be a French citizen known to authorities. Reports say two attackers may have been Belgian. While the Independent states an Egyptian passport was found at the scene of one of the explosions.
summarize: The two men participated in a cheating scheme that involved placing high-risk phantom bets at Bellagio’s craps tables      Two men have been added to Nevada’s “black book” of banned casino players after scamming Bellagio of nearly $1.2 million by placing the so-called hop bet in a series of craps games, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.      Anthony Grant Granito and James Russell Cooper will no longer be able to play at any of the state’s casinos after their names have been placed on the list of banned gamblers maintained by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.      Granito and Cooper were part of a group of four men who jointly carried out a sophisticated scheme to cheat the glitzy Strip casino. The scam took place between August 2012 and July 2014 and also involved Jeffrey Martin and Mark Branco. Branco and Cooper were craps dealers at the Bellagio at the time. According to court papers, it was Branco who led the group of four and concocted the scheme. The scam was discovered and reported by another craps dealer who noticed suspicious behavior and reported it to casino officials.      The scheme involved Branco and Cooper working at the same table. When a shooter tossed the dice, Martin or Granito had to mumble something that very much sounded like a hop bet (a risky oral proposition in which players wagered that a specific number would fall next). One of the dealers participating in the scam would pay out as if Martin or Granito had wagered correctly on whatever came up next.      It is important to note that at the time, the felt on the craps tables at the targeted casino had no designated spot for hop bets. To avoid attention and prevent their wrongdoing from being discovered, the two players would lose thousands of dollars on actual bets they placed. However, they would always walk away with a profit thanks to the phantom bets.      All four participants in the fraudulent scheme were charged with theft and cheating at gambling and sentenced to prison by the Clark County District Court in 2016. As mentioned above, Granito and Cooper have recently been placed on the list of people banned from gambling at Nevada’s casinos.      How Was the Scam Discovered?      As mentioned earlier, it was believed that Branco was the mastermind behind the fraudulent plan. The group of four accomplices carried out with the scam for two years between August 2012 and July 2014.      A third craps dealer at the Bellagio reported suspicious activity to the casino’s management. Casino authorities themselves noticed a winning streak of wagers they said defied 452-billion-to-1 odds. According to a statistician employed by MGM Resorts International, Bellagio’s parent company:      Granito’s average bet was $4,400. He played 1,624 rounds and wagered $7.1 million. He would have been expected to lose $459,539. Instead, he won $498,500. Martin wagered $5.1 million over 2,295 rounds. Bellagio should have expected to come away with $252,490 of his money. Instead, he won $587,900. Overall, they would have been expected to lose $712,029…but they won a total of $1,086,400.      Casino officials examined every roll of the dice visible on surveillance while Branco and Cooper were at the tables to find enough evidence about their wrongdoing. Cooper eventually cooperated with authorities, revealing the scam’s details.      Follow us on Facebook and Twitter to stay up to date on the day’s top casino news stories.

Granito was sentenced to prison for his role in a two-year $1 million craps scheme at the Bellagio. (Ronda Churchill/Las Vegas Review-Journal)      Two men who were part of a group that scammed Bellagio of an estimated $1.2 million in craps games have been placed on Nevada’s list of excluded persons, commonly called the “black book.”      Anthony Grant Granito and James Russell Cooper became the 33rd and 34th persons to be placed on the state Gaming Control Board’s list of people banned from entering Nevada casinos.      Granito and Cooper were part of a group of four men who teamed up between August 2012 and July 2014 to cheat the Strip casino. Granito, Cooper, Jeffrey Martin and Mark Branco were convicted of theft and cheating at gambling in 2016 in Clark County District Court and sentenced to prison.      Branco, a former Bellagio craps dealer who led the scheme, is still incarcerated, but Granito, Cooper and Martin have since been placed on probation. Granito and Cooper declined a commission hearing, but Martin requested one and it’s expected to be conducted at the commission’s December meeting.      The cheating was discovered in 2014 when casino authorities noticed a series of winning wagers that defied 452 billion-to-1 odds.      Cooper cooperated with authorities and explained before a grand jury how the scam worked.      Cooper and Branco would have to be working the same table, according to Cooper’s grand jury testimony. As a shooter tossed the die, Granito or Martin would mumble something that sounded like a hop bet — a wager that specific numbers would come up on the next roll — and one of the dealers would pay out as if they had correctly wagered on whatever fell.      At the time, the felt on the craps table at Bellagio had no designated spot for such bets.

Anthony Grant Granito and James Russell Cooper just became Nos. 33 and 34, thanks to their role in scamming the Bellagio out of $1.2 million or so at the craps table, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Granito, Cooper, and two other men—Jeffrey Martin and Mark Branco—were convicted in 2016 of theft and cheating in gambling for a nearly two-year scheme in which they placed something called a "hop bet" at the craps table Branco ran at the Bellagio. All four men ended up being sentenced to prison (Branco is still behind bars; the other four are now on probation), and Cooper ended up cooperating and telling the grand jury exactly how the foursome pulled off the cheat, which ran from August 2012 to July 2014. How it worked: Branco, said to be the mastermind, and Cooper, also a craps dealer, would be working the same table when Granito and Martin would wander over and mumble a hop bet, what Casino News Daily describes as "a risky oral proposition in which players wagered that a specific number would fall next." Branco and Cooper would pretend that whatever was mumbled was what came up on the thrown dice. The problem: There was no designated spot at the Bellagio craps table for such bets. The men, who would also purposely wager and lose thousands of dollars on fair bets to make the scheme look more legit, were busted when another craps dealer became suspicious and made a report. The casino itself had already begun wondering about the men's streak, which had 452 billion-to-one odds. (The gambling "nerd" with the winning algorithm that reportedly netted him a billion dollars.)

Jeremie Tronet is a professional kite surfer living in the Grenadines, a picturesque island chain that forms part of St Vincent and Grenada.

Jeremie Tronet Zoe had to have surgery and is not going to be able to walk for at least two months      Zoe Schaffer-Jennett had to be moved to Martinique for surgery, during which three screws were inserted into her bone.      She can't walk yet and will have to go through months of rehabilitation before she's back to normal - but without health insurance, they can't send Zoe to a specialised physiotherapy centre.

She ruptured her femoral neck completely in her leg by sliding and falling in a concrete ditch at night.      As some of you know, we live in the little Caribbean island of Union Island where you cannot get appropriate health care.      We had to fly her to Martinique island for an emergency surgery, she was in a lot of pain the whole time.      After a four hour long surgery, the surgeon placed three screws and connected everything back.      She is now at the hospital slowly recovering from the surgery.      Unfortunately this very rare case of bone fracture at a young age (Zoe is only 27 years old) require a very long recovery process in a specialized center.      Zoe is from an English dad and Austrian Mom, she was born in Martinique and lives in the Caribbean, She has the Austrian nationality but doesn’t have any national healthcare for Austria.      Unfortunately because of her complicated status she doesn’t have the appropriate insurance to help her pay for the recovery process.      Now the recovery process requires her to not put any pressure on her damaged leg for at least 2 months.      During these two months she will need to get assistance from a physiotherapist and get proper leg movement done by them.      After the two months she will theb have to learn how to walk again, this could take 3 more months of proper rehabilitation in a specialized center.      Unfortunately such centers cost a huge amount of money and Zoe doesn’t have any insurance that can cover this.      We are now looking at different options, first one would be to do the rehabilitation directly on Union island with her staying home in her bed and have a full time Physiotherapist at home taking care of her recovery process (see Job offer below)      Our second option is to find out if any national insurance would cover the cost (doesn’t look that way).      The third option will be to create a gofundme page to request everyone’s support but we want to keep this option only if we require it.      I will do everything necessary to make sure she can walk properly again.      Job offer for physiotherapist !      Would you like to jump on an opportunity to come Work and learn to kite in the Grenadines all expenses paid?      We are looking for a friendly Physiotherapist to work on Zoe’s daily recovery in Union Island after a her femoral head surgery. (More info below this job offer).      The surgeon has placed three screws in her femoral head to reattach it to the bone.      The rehabilitation time can take a few months in such cases and if we decide and are allowed to do the recovery at home she will require an everyday assistance of a physiotherapist to help her regain mobility and learn to walk again.

Does it involve strolling down postcard-perfect beaches, sipping rum punch and ditching your cell phone signal on a remote island?      If you’re an orthopedic surgeon or physical therapist, you might just get to do it all. For free.      Jeremie Tronet, the 29-year-old owner of Union Island’s Snack Shack and a professional kiteboarder (yes, that exists), will pay for one lucky person — and their plus one — to travel, stay, eat and kitesurf in the Caribbean for five whole months.      There’s just one condition: You need to help his girlfriend walk again.      Why Jeremie Tronet’s Funding a Caribbean Dream Trip      Tronet and his girlfriend, 27-year old Zoe Schaffer-Jennett, live a picturesque life on a remote island in the Grenadines.      And when I say picturesque, I mean it: If you casually browse his Facebook photos, you’ll see a lot of supernaturally blue ocean vistas, complete with sea turtles.      The couple spends most of their time soaking up the sun and enjoying watersports on the beach.      But while poking enviously around Tronet’s Facebook, you’ll also learn about the disaster that recently interrupted the couple’s idyllic island life.      Schaffer-Jennett fell into a ditch and suffered a serious leg injury, forcing her to undergo surgery — and leaving the active young woman bedridden.      Schaffer-Jennett’s mixed lineage and the remoteness of her island home mean she doesn’t have health insurance.      After flying to Martinique for an emergency, four-hour surgery to install three pins in her hip, Tronet and Schaffer-Jennett faced another serious expense: months of physical therapy to get her back on her feet and into the water.      Plus, she didn’t want to leave her family and friends to fly off to a more developed place and spend six months in a rehabilitation center.      So Tronet hatched a brilliant plan, capitalizing on their exotic locale: He’s inviting an expert to come stay with the couple on Union Island.      The lucky recipient would be responsible for providing rehabilitation and therapy in exchange for free travel, room, board and… well, being in the Caribbean for five months, expenses paid.      Oh, and free kiteboarding lessons, of course.      Are You a Physical Therapist?      Read the whole story and offer at Tronet’s Facebook page.      If you think you have the skills to get this young woman back to her sporty self, send an email to zoesurgery@gmail.com with your CV.      But be warned: This story’s gone understandably viral, so Tronet and Schaffer-Jennett are probably already buried in applications.      Still, reaching out can’t hurt — and in fact, every message is already helping the pair heal.      “Thank you so much for the incredible support,” Tronet writes in an update to the original offer. “You’ve made Zoe smile all day.”      Your Turn: Will you apply for this dream vacation and help a young woman get back on her feet?

There's a catch, but it comes with good karma: provide a woman with physical therapy for the duration of the stay.            Jeremie Tronet, a professional kite surfer who lives in the beautiful Grenadines, has taken to the Internet to find help for his girlfriend, Zoe. She recently broke her femur, which has left her unable to walk.            Unfortunately, the couple does not have health insurance, so getting the physical therapy Zoe needs would be extremely costly and require her to travel to Martinique for the duration of the therapy.            So Jeremie took to Facebook to enlist the help of any qualified physiotherapist who would be able to help her. This way, Zoe would be able to fully recover in the comfort of her own home.            On top of the free trip and food, Jeremie is also offering to set the volunteer up with free kite surfing lessons.

Well, if you're a qualified physical therapist or orthopedic surgeon, you just might be in luck. Professional kite surfer Jeremie Tronet lives in the Grenadines island chain with his girlfriend, Zoe, who recently fell and broke her femur. She had surgery to fix it, but she needs to stay off it for two months and will then need to be rehabilitated. The couple don't have health insurance, so the physical therapy she'll need would be quite pricey, AOL reports. Zoe would also have to travel to Martinique for the entire five- to six-month course of therapy. So Tronet had an idea: Convince a therapist to come to her. He made the offer earlier this month on his Facebook page and his website, informing interested parties that their travel, food, accommodations, and other expenses would be covered—and they can bring along a plus-one, the Penny Hoarder reports. Plus, they can take free kite-surfing lessons and fun excursions, Yahoo News reports. "We are very happy to see the story being share[d] by everyone as we hope it will inspire a lot of people in thinking positive what ever happens in life," reads a follow-up post on Tronet's Facebook page, which also notes that the couple are hearing from hundreds of people per day and haven't yet decided who will come help Zoe out. If you still want to take a shot, send your resume and a photo to zoesurgery@gmail.com, the Mirror reports. (You could also try to win a chance to use the Eiffel Tower as a vacation home.)
summarize: A monitor screen flashes a U.S. dollar-Japanese yen exchange rate, above, and the Nikkei stock average at a foreign exchange firm in central Tokyo on Wednesday Aug. 10, 2011. Asian stock markets jumped... (Associated Press)      Global stock markets rose Wednesday following a surge on Wall Street triggered by a Federal Reserve pledge to keep interest rates super low for the next two years to help the ailing U.S. economy.      Oil prices rose to near $82 a barrel, while the dollar slid against the yen and the euro. European shares were slightly higher in early trading after a restorative rally in Asia.      Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.2 percent to 5,177.23. Germany's DAX was 0.9 percent higher at 5,977.73 while the CAC-40 in Paris dipped 0.3 percent into negative territory at 3,153.01.      Meanwhile, Wall Street appeared set to capitulate after sizable gains the day before. Dow Jones industrial futures drooped 134 points, or 1.2 percent, to 11,060 and broader S&P 500 futures gave up 12.90 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,158.80.      On Tuesday, the Dow finished with a 429-point gain after the Fed said it would keep its key interest rate at a record low of nearly zero through the middle of 2013. The index dived 634.76 points the day before after Standard and Poor's cut the U.S. government's credit rating, sending shock waves through global markets.      Analysts warned investors to brace for more sharp swings in markets amid a dearth of signs of improvement in the global economy.      "There is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the market, and negatives will add to that. So if we see an increase in unemployment from the U.S., that is going to cause an increase in volatility," said Samuel LeCornu, portfolio manager at Macquarie Funds Group in Hong Kong.      Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.1 percent to close at 9,038.74 following a 7.6 percent loss in the last three days. Export shares, however, continued to struggle because of the strong yen, which hurts the country's export-driven economy by reducing the value of foreign earnings.      Honda Motor Co. lost 2.2 percent and rival Toyota Motor Corp. was down 0.9 percent. Consumer electronics giant Sony Corp. fell 2.2 percent.      Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.3 percent to 19,783.67. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 2.4 percent.      The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.9 percent to 2,549.18 and the smaller Shenzhen Composite Index gained 1.4 percent. Indexes in Taiwan and India also gained.      South Korea's Kospi, which at one point Tuesday plummeted nearly 10 percent, added 0.3 percent to 1,806.24.      Gains in Asia were broad-based, with banking shares among the key movers. Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. was 4.6 percent higher and National Australia Bank Ltd. soared 6.1 percent. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's biggest bank by market value, gained 1 percent.      Shares in airlines, benefiting from expectations that lower oil prices will reduce jet fuel costs, were also sharply higher. Hong Kong-listed Air China climbed 4.3 percent. South Korea's Asiana Airlines rose 2.1 percent and Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp. bounced up 5.5 percent.      Worries about the U.S. economic recovery have been building since the government said that economic growth was far weaker in the first half of 2011 than economists expected. In a reversal of earlier forecasts, economists now believe there is a greater chance of another U.S. recession because the economy grew much more slowly in the first half of 2011 than previously thought.      The manufacturing and services industries barely grew in July. The unemployment rate remains above 9 percent, despite the 154,000 jobs added in the private sector in July.      Economies across the globe are also struggling.      Concerns are growing that Spain or Italy could become the next European country to be unable to repay its debts. High inflation in less-developed countries, which have been the world's main economic engine through the recovery, is another concern. China's inflation rose to a 37-month high in July.      Benchmark oil for September delivery was up $2.55 to $81.82 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London, Brent crude was up $2.81 to $105.40 per barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.      The dollar sank to 76.67 yen from 77.01 yen late Tuesday in New York. The euro strengthened to $1.4350 from $1.4222. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fear returned to Wall Street on Wednesday, sending the S&P 500 to another 4 percent decline, triggered by worries that Europe’s debt crisis could engulf French banks and spill onto the U.S. financial sector.      Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, August 10, 2011. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid      Trading was once again marked by sharp moves on heavy volume. For a fifth straight day, the Dow industrials fluctuated in a range of more than 400 points.      “What you’re seeing is a very short-term, direction-oriented market,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.      Worries about the strength of French lenders, including Societe Generale, triggered a selloff in European and U.S. banks. Rumors about SocGen’s financial health, which the bank denied, sent its shares tumbling 14.7 percent.      An index of European banks dropped 6.7 percent and the KBW index of U.S. bank stocks slid 4.9 percent as fear grew of a possible contagion of any French crisis. Bank of America Corp lost 10.9 percent to $6.77 and Goldman Sachs slid more than 10 percent to $110.34.      The Dow Jones industrial average lost 519.83 points, or 4.62 percent, to 10,719.94. The S&P 500 fell 51.77 points, or 4.42 percent, to 1,120.76. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.47 points, or 4.09 percent, to 2,381.05.      Wednesday’s drop came a day after stocks rallied on the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates near zero for at least two more years.      Even after Tuesday’s snap-back rally, the S&P 500 is down almost 18 percent from its 2011 closing high set April 29.      The losses came against the backdrop of recent weak U.S. economic data, the United States losing its triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and the inability of lawmakers to address worries that another recession may be on the way.      About 15.1 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, almost double the year’s estimated daily average of 7.8 billion.      Volume once again spiked in the last hour of trading, and the market closed near its session lows. Of late, overleveraged investors with losses on their books have been forced to sell shares near the end of the day.      “Between 3 and 3:20 (p.m.) you have people getting margin calls, and on days like today there’s some nervousness about what those calls will look like,” said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York, referring to the volatility of the final hour of trading.      Slides in the value of stocks may increase the cash needed in margin accounts, which can spark further selling.

After the closing bell, Cisco Systems Inc’s shares jumped nearly 12 percent after its quarterly results edged past Wall Street’s scaled-back expectations.      Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones during the regular session on the NYSE by a ratio of more than 8 to 3, while on the Nasdaq, almost five stocks fell for every one that rose. |||||	– Global stocks were up early today following an uptick on Wall Street in the wake of the Fed's pledge to keep interest rates low. But it wasn't clear if the rebound would hold. Asia rates climbed and modest hikes marked Britain's FTSE 100 index (up .2%) and Germany's DAX (up .9%), though the CAC-40 in Paris was down .3%, and the the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips opened higher but was down .4% by mid-morning. Falling futures indicated possible trouble ahead still for Wall Street. Futures for the Standard & Poor's 500 were down 1% and Down Jones futures were off .9%, Reuters reported early today.

(Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — A rising college basketball coaching star accused of throwing a punch that killed a New York City tourist who had apparently mistaken him for an Uber driver pleaded not guilty Thursday to an assault charge.      Wake Forest University assistant coach Jamill Jones attacked digital marketing guru Sandor Szabo around 1:15 a.m. last Sunday in Queens, causing him to fall and smash his head on the sidewalk, police said.      Szabo, visiting from Boca Raton, Florida, banged on the window of Jones' SUV while looking for his ride after his stepsister's wedding, police said.      A person familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that Szabo may have been drunkenly knocking on car windows before Jones allegedly confronted him. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed to speak publicly.      The coach got out, followed Szabo to the sidewalk, clocked him and sped off, police said. Szabo never regained consciousness and was taken off life support Tuesday.      Jones, 35, of Kernersville, North Carolina, turned himself in to police Thursday, accompanied by a lawyer. He was arraigned Thursday night on a misdemeanor assault charge and released on his own recognizance after entering his plea. The coach's next court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 2, the Queens District Attorney's office said.      Jones was with his family after the court session, his attorney, Alain Massena, told the AP.      "This was a tragic accident, and Mr. Jones and his family send their deepest condolences and their thoughts and prayers to the Szabo family," Massena said.      In a statement, Wake Forest said the school would comment further once it gathered more information.      Jones, a Philadelphia native, joined the Demon Deacons staff in May 2017 after coaching at Central Florida, Virginia Commonwealth and Florida Gulf Coast and playing at Arkansas Tech and North Platte Community College in Nebraska.      Wake Forest head coach Danny Manning said at the time that Jones was a "well-respected bright mind" in the coaching world and brought "new blood" and "new perspectives" to Wake Forest.      Szabo, also 35, was "super outgoing, friendly, and an incredibly smart businessman," said his company, at What If Media Group, based in Fort Lee, New Jersey.      "He was always upbeat, positive, kind and caring," the company said in a Facebook post. "He was fun to be with, interesting, and always interested. He was a really good person."      Szabo, who lived in Boca Raton with his brother, always had a bright smile and shared a love of fishing, cooking and family, the company said.      "His beautiful spirit and his love of life will remain with us," the company said. "We are going to miss him dearly." ||||| His brother told the Daily News he may have thought the SUV was a cab, and he was trying to get the Jones’ attention. Instead, the North Carolina hoops coach punched him, sending him flying backward, cops said. His head slammed into the sidewalk, and he never regained consciousness, authorities say. |||||	– A single punch may have destroyed the life of a rising college basketball coach—and ended the life of a Florida man who was visiting New York City for his stepsister's wedding. Police say Jamill Jones, an assistant coach at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, surrendered to police early Thursday after learning that they were looking for the man who punched Boca Raton resident Sandor Szabo in Queens around 1am Sunday, CNN reports. Szabo—who'd apparently been knocking on the windows of vehicles looking for an Uber he ordered before his phone died—fell backward, hit his head on the sidewalk, and died in the hospital Tuesday after being taken off life support. Police believe an irate Jones punched Szabo because the man had banged on the window of his SUV. The coach, who was released on his own recognizance, faces a misdemeanor assault charge and it's not clear whether more charges are likely, the New York Daily News reports. Jones—who is 35, the same age as Szabo—previously coached at Central Florida, Virginia Commonwealth, and Florida Gulf Coast, the AP reports. His attorney, Alain Massena, described the incident as a "tragic accident" after a court appearance Thursday. "The Jones family sends their deepest condolences and sympathies to the Szabo family," he said. "We won't be making any further comments."
summarize: A detail from Nympheas, a 1906 painting by Claude Monet. A final bid of £29m meant it went unsold. Photograph: AP      It was Europe's most valuable ever art auction and the script had been prepared for an evening of supernova prices. But the world's richest art buyers refused to follow it. Last night they might even have been described as … prudent.      Christie's in London hosted one of the most anticipated sales for years, selling art with a total presale estimate of £163m-231m.      The two stand-out jewels among the 63 lots were a blue period Picasso and a Monet waterlily painting, both with estimates of between £30m-40m and even higher expectations. But the Picasso sold at its low-end estimate – for £31m – and a final bid of £29m for the Monet meant it went unsold. In total, 16 lots were unsold. But the messages were mixed. Amid the disappointing lots was the fact that £152.5m was paid overall, a record for an art auction in the UK.      Thomas Seydoux, Christie's international director of impressionist and modern art, said he was "very surprised" at the failure of the Monet to sell. "It's a seminal picture," he said.      The auction was at times slow. Seydoux said: "It's a bit like hill climbing on a bicycle, buyers are cautious at the beginning and once they get in a rhythm and they feel other bikers are with them then they get going."      Last night, for the big lots, no one seemed prepared to make the break. "People were quite cautious, nothing was crazy. It was measured," Seydoux said.      The Picasso was being sold by Andrew Lloyd Webber with all profits going to his charitable foundation. He released a statement last night expressing satisfaction with the price in such "austere" times.      The painting dates from 1903 – the pinnacle of Picasso's blue period – and is of the artist's good friend Angel Fernández de Soto. The work's other title, which may explain the sitter's languid expression, is the Absinthe Drinker.      Lloyd Webber had attempted to sell it in 2006 but the auction was aborted after lawyers for a German academic, Julius Schoeps, claimed the painting had been forcibly sold to the Nazis before the war. That claim was dismissed by a court in New York and it was revealed in January that a confidential agreement had been reached in which all claims were relinquished.      Some observers had thought it might be a record-breaker and before the sale Christie's president, Jussi Pylkkänen, called it "one of the most important works of art to be offered at auction in decades". It might not have broken records but it still represented a considerable return on the composer's investment of £18m in 1995.      The Monet waterlily painting, Nymphéas, 1906, had a less bumpy ride to auction and Christie's experts were puzzled at its failure to sell. Painted in his garden at Giverny, the work was part of a famous exhibition of waterlily paintings held at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris in 1909.      The Christie's sale followed another mixed message sale at Sotheby's on Tuesday where £112m was spent and seven auction records set.      The stand-out lot of Tuesday's sale in London was an important self-portrait by the father of impressionism, Édouard Manet. It sold for £22.4m, an auction record for the artist beating the previous high of £16.3m, set in 1989.      It was one of three paintings to sell for more than £10m – only the second time that has happened in London.      The others were a fabulously vibrant André Derain painting, Arbres á Collioure, which sold for £16.3m and Henri Matisse's Odalisques jouant aux dames, which sold for £11.8m.      Melanie Clore, a co-chairman at Sotheby's, said the results "demonstrate the strength of the international demand for top quality works".      She added: "To sell three works for over £10m is testimony not only to the vitality of the impressionist and modern art market but also the pivotal role that London plays within the international auction market."      But again, more had been expected, particularly for the Manet. Bidding began at £15m and it slowly crept up to what was the lower end of its £20m-30m estimate.      Other highlights from Christie's last night included a Vincent Van Gogh, Parc de l'hôpital Saint-Paul, painted during his voluntary confinement in an asylum after his troubles in Arles (not least his fight with Gauguin and the unfortunate ear incident). Its hammer price was £8m, just on its low estimate.      There was also a sensational Gustav Klimt: Portrait of Ria Munk III. The subject had shot herself six years earlier because of a row with her lover, people tended to be more melodramatic then, and Klimt was still working on the picture when he himself died in 1918. Its hammer price was £16.7m – in the middle of its estimate.      Expectations had been raised by the astounding prices realised at auctions earlier this year with record prices for any work of art being made first in February, when a Giacometti 'walking man' sculpture sold for £65m and then in May, when a Picasso sold for £70m.      It seemed as if the market was resurgent. Clore had predicted: "London is about to witness one of the most thrilling seasons of sales it has ever had."      Before last night, Pylkkänen, who was also auctioneer, spoke of a group of extremely rich collectors, eager to buy the very best.      They were, he said, the "new Medicis" and were from across the world: Europe, the US, the Middle East, Russia, China and yes, even Britain.      These secretive people are assiduously courted by the auction houses with Christie's, last week holding a dinner for nearly 60 of them to mark the opening of a public exhibition of some of the jewels in its forthcoming sales.      The lesson for the auction houses may be that this group of buyers have not made their money by spending over the odds.      Not quite the sale of the century      • Hopes had been high for Picasso's Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto. Painted in 1903, the height of the artist's Blue Period, the work is also known as The Absinthe Drinker. It was estimated at £30-40m and sold for £34.8m.      • Monet's Nympheas (pictured) was the other highlight with the same estimate: £30-40m. But bidding was painfully slow from £22m to £29m, leaving it unsold. One man in the audience was overheard blaming the painting's lack of colour.      • Gustav Klimt's Portrait of Ria Munk III was the second highest seller: a joyful, beautiful painting to look at until you realise you're looking at a portrait of a woman who shot herself after a lovers' tiff. Klimt died before completing it. It sold for £18.8m. ||||| Andrew Lloyd Webber's charity sold a haunting Pablo Picasso portrait for GPB 34.7 million ($51.2 million) at Christie's in London on Wednesday, four years after heirs of the artwork's first owner claimed the painting had been sold under pressure by the Nazis.      The Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation was given permission to offer up the 1903 work, "Portrait d'Angel Fernandez de Soto," after settling privately with the heirs of German banker Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy a few months ago. Mr. Webber paid Christie's $29.1 million for the Blue-Period portrait of the artist's friend in 1995. This time around, the auction house priced it to sell for at least £30 million, or $44 million.      The painting lent its moody tone to Christie's £152.6 million ($226.5 million) evening sale of Impressionist and modern art. The overall total nearly quadrupled the house's $60.4 million sale last June, but the sale felt deflated because 16 of its offerings went unsold. These included a Claude Monet waterlily work, "Nympheas," that was expected to sell for over £30 million along with works by Kees van Dongen, Marc Chagall, Paul Klee and Balthus.      Collectors are still reconciling their expectations about how quickly art prices should rise amid the recovering art market, dealers say. Sellers want prices to return to their boom-era levels overnight, yet buyers remain wary of anything deemed overinflated. This disconnect also beset Sotheby's £112 million sale on Tuesday, in which a similar number of works went unsold.      Bidders still competed hard for the rarest works in Christie's sale, including Gustav Klimt's brightly colored 1917-18 "Portrait of Ria Munk III" that sold for £18.8 million, just over its high estimate. Picasso's Astroturf-green depiction of a loving couple, "The Kiss," also sold for £12.1 million, its high estimate.      Vincent van Gogh's 1889 view of a rustling cypress tree on his asylum grounds, "Park at the Saint-Paul Hospital," sold for £9 million. It was priced to sell for at least £8 million.      Surrealism—a recent favorite of newly wealthy Chinese collectors— enjoyed a strong showing at Christie's sale. Rene Magritte's row of trees formed with giant leaves, "The Mysterious Barricades," sold for £5 million, well over its £4 million high estimate. Salvador Dali's "The Knight of Death" fetched £1.6 million, within its £1.5 million to £2 million estimate.      Alberto Giacometti's pieces have also soared lately, but he isn't invincible to the vagaries of the marketplace. A foot-high bust of the sculptor's brother, "Diego (Head and Collar)," cast in 1980—14 years after the artist died—was priced to sell for at least £700,000 but found no takers.      Overall, 46 of the sale's 62 found buyers, helping the sale achieve 74% of its presale potential. Next week Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips de Pury & Co. will hold sales of post-war and contemporary art in London.      Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com |||||	– Mixed news for the world of art today out of London: A 1903 Picasso (Portrait d'Angel Fernandez de Soto) sold for a healthy $51.2 million, but 16 of 62 paintings went unsold at Christie's major auction. The big non-seller was a Monet waterlily painting (Nympheas) expected to fetch $30 million. Dealers tell the Wall Street Journal that buyers remain wary and aren't convinced the art market has fully recovered. The Guardian sums up the auction in a fairly negative tone: "It was Europe's most valuable ever art auction and the script had been prepared for an evening of supernova prices. But the world's richest art buyers refused to follow it. Last night they might even have been described as … prudent."
summarize: Between launching a charity-friendly buying program, announcing Sunday deliveries, and gearing up for the first wave of frenzied holiday shoppers, Amazon has been busy these past few weeks. But that didn’t stop CEO Jeff Bezos from spending a decent chunk of time talking to Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes about something, well, new.      60 Minutes has been more than happy to tease the unveiling with a clip of Bezos leading Rose into a room to show him something that elicited an “Oh my God!” from the veteran TV journo. The exclamation seemed to stem from a place of pleasure rather than worry, but the segment just aired and the truth is out.      So what did Bezos have up his proverbial sleeves? Amazon Prime Air drones that could feasibly be used as autonomous delivery vehicles. To hear the chief executive tell it, those electric drones — or “octocopters” as he referred to them — could make for delivery times as low as 30 minutes. Naturally, the size of those drones means there’s a strict upper limit to how much cargo they can carry, but Bezos says they can carry packages of up to five pounds for round trips as long as 10 miles. Thankfully for Amazon, that means nearly 86 percent of the items that it carries can be lashed onto one of its sky-bound couriers.      Just don’t expect to see one of them land on your doorstep any time soon. The FAA still hasn’t given its blessing to domestic drones yet (though it just recently laid out its vision for such a situation), which means the earliest that Amazon will be legally able to bring Prime Air online is in 2015 — a launch window that Bezos says is “optimistic” at best. There’s also no word on what company (if any) Amazon is working with to develop its fleet of drones, but at this stage, there’s no shortage of players eagerly working to bring drones into the world of business.      The rest of the report didn’t shine too much additional light on what makes Amazon tick, though it did afford us mere mortals a closer look at how its gargantuan fulfillment centers work. They’re stunningly large models of efficiency — the one 60 Minutes toured was 1.2 million sq. ft. and the workers packing products into parcels were able to do so with remarkable speed.      Sadly, since the segment was filmed over the span of a month, there’s no official response on the recent BBC report that took aim at Amazon UK for warehouse working conditions that could potentially cause “mental illness and physical illness”.      More on Amazon Air Prime:      Rentals Delivered By Drone Could Make Ownership Obsolete      I, Drone ||||| Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had a big surprise for correspondent Charlie Rose this week. After their 60 Minutes interview, Bezos walked Rose into a mystery room at the Amazon offices and revealed a secret R&D project: "Octocopter" drones that will fly packages directly to your doorstep in 30 minutes.      It's an audacious plan that Bezos says requires more safety testing and FAA approvals, but he estimates that delivery-by-drone, called Amazon "Prime Air," will be available to customers in as soon as 4-5 years.      When Charlie Rose walked in and saw the Prime Air drones sitting on a tabletop for the show-and-tell, he exclaimed "Oh, my God!" It was a genuine reaction-- Rose and the 60 Minutes team weren't in on the secret beforehand. The story had been in the works for months before the Amazon representatives started hinting that a new project might be revealed to 60 Minutes.      "I only knew that there was a surprise coming. I had no idea what it was," says 60 Minutes producer Draggan Mihailovich. "They kept saying over and over again, 'Whatever you think it is, it isn't.'" Mihailovich grew skeptical when the Amazon PR team began to hype their surprise behind the scenes. "How great can this be?" he thought.      60 Minutes associate producer Nathalie Sommer says even Bezos built up the surprise during breaks in filming the 60 Minutes segment. During a tape change, Bezos told the producers, "If you can guess what it is, then...I will give you half my fortune and send you to Vegas with it."      When Rose, Mihailovich, and Sommer finally saw the drones, they were perplexed.      "I had no idea what its purpose was at first glance," Rose told 60 Minutes Overtime. Mihailovich thought they resembled giant, flying tarantulas: "They actually look like something out of a Philip K. Dick novel."      Then Bezos played a Prime Air demo video for the 60 Minutes team that showed how his octocopters will pick up packages in small yellow buckets at Amazon's fulfillment centers and whiz through the air to deliver items to individual customers 30 minutes after they hit the "buy" button online at Amazon.com.      COMMENT:      What do you think of Amazon Prime Air? Can Bezos bring his vision of octocopter package delivery to life-- and can he do it safely? |||||	– No joke: Amazon has been working on delivery drones and CEO Jeff Bezos believes they could be zipping goods through the air to customers less than five years from now as part of its "Prime Air" service. The "Octocopter" unmanned aerial vehicles in development are capable of flying packages from Amazon warehouses to customers' doorsteps in as little as 30 minutes from the time the customer hits the "Buy" button, Bezos told CBS' 60 Minutes. Before the big surprise, Bezos told producers, "If you can guess what it is, then ... I will give you half my fortune and send you to Vegas with it." He says the drones can carry packages up to five pounds, which accounts for around 86% of the items Amazon sells, notes TechCrunch. In its FAQ, Amazon predicts that one day seeing Prime Air vehicles in the sky "will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today"—and it will be ready to go whenever the FAA introduces regulations for private drones, which could be as soon as 2015.
summarize: Urban-education programs prepare them for imperative contemporary conversations with students.      After a rash of police killings last summer, H. Richard Milner, a professor of urban education at the University of Pittsburgh, set out to answer a question that had been gnawing at him for some time. As a noted expert on race in education, he frequently received calls from journalists seeking comment on how to help teachers talk about race in the classroom, typically following the fatal police shooting of a black victim. And he always thought the questioning was misguided and inadequate. “Rather than asking me how to help teachers … we should be asking teachers if they believe race is salient … something [they] should be interrogating and thinking about [in the classroom].”            So in early fall 2016, he surveyed 450 pre-service and current public-school teachers on their beliefs about race. Despite the small sample size, the preliminary findings from the nationally representative group revealed an intriguing disconnect. Teachers overwhelmingly agreed that race should be discussed in classrooms; they felt woefully unprepared to lead such      conversations; and they strongly rejected discussing racial violence, which Milner called “central to working with … black and brown students” who are frequently the victims of police shootings. “Basically, teachers said ‘You’ve twisted my arm. We should talk about race. Nope, I don't feel prepared to do      that. And I'm definitely not going to [talk about] violence against black bodies.’ That’s where we are in 2017.”            With a profession that’s characteristically white, female, and middle class—and with students of color and children in poverty rapidly making up the majority of the public-school population—teachers equipped and willing to talk about race and racism has become a necessity. The mere mention of these topics can be awkward and difficult, yet various research findings point to the need to confront the discomfort to improve student learning. Increasingly, that duty has fallen to urban-education programs—a special category of teacher preparation that is reimagining how teaching candidates are prepared and disrupting the race and class stereotypes surrounding urban students and communities.            The dictionary definition of “urban” relates specifically to cities and people who live in them, but population shifts have rendered the term somewhat imprecise. According to federal education data from 2013, some 14 million students (29 percent of total enrollment) attended public schools in cities during the 2010-11 school year. The city classification, however, ranged from urban areas with a population of less than 100,000 to those with 250,000 residents or more—and spanned school districts as geographically diverse as Anchorage, Alaska, and Baltimore to Nashville and New York.            More commonly, urban schooling is defined by bleak statistics and the prejudices encoded in the adjective “urban” rather than official government categories. A 2015 report from the Center for Reinventing Public Education offered a stark glimpse of the state of urban public schools, including one in four students not graduating from high school in four years. Additionally, a study probing the intersections of race and teaching found the word urban was regularly used as shorthand for unfavorable characteristics associated with students of color.            “People generally [believe] that if it's urban, it's negative,” said Milner, the director of Pitt’s Center for Urban Education, noting that includes student teachers from all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Much of his work—in this case, training undergraduates—is concentrated on cultivating “the skills, the attitudes, and the dispositions” to be effective in urban environments. “That means we think about this notion of urban [and] teachers' belief systems about who these students are and what their capacity happens to be.” ||||| JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

(Associated Press)      On Monday, four days after the ship vanished, the Coast Guard concluded it sank near the Bahamas in about 15,000 feet of water. One unidentified body in a survival suit was spotted, and the search went on for any trace of the other crew members.      Survival suits help mariners float and stay warm. But even with the water temperature at 85 degrees, hypothermia can set in quickly, Coast Guard Capt. Mark Fedor said. He noted that the hurricane had winds of about 140 mph and waves topping 50 feet.      "These are trained mariners. They know how to abandon ship," Fedor said. But "those are challenging conditions to survive."      The ship, carrying cars and other products, had 28 crew members from the U.S. and five from Poland.      Coast Guard and Navy planes, helicopters, cutters and tugboats searched across a 300-square-mile expanse of Atlantic Ocean near Crooked Island in the Bahamas, where the ship was last heard from while on its way from Jacksonville to Puerto Rico.      A heavily damaged lifeboat from the El Faro was discovered, no one aboard, Fedor said. The ship had two lifeboats capable of holding 43 people each.      "We are still looking for survivors or any sign of life," he said.      Also spotted were an oil sheen, cargo containers, a partly submerged life raft — the ship carried five rafts, each capable of holding 17 people — life jackets and life rings, authorities said.      Phil Greene, president and CEO of ship owner Tote Services Inc., said the captain had a plan to sail ahead of the hurricane with room to spare.      Greene said the captain, whose name has not been released, had conferred with the El Faro's sister ship — which was returning to Jacksonville along a similar route — and determined the weather was good enough to go forward.      "Regrettably he suffered a mechanical problem with his main propulsion system, which left him in the path of the storm," Greene said. "We do not know when his engine problems began to occur, nor the reasons for his engine problems."      The last message from the ship came Thursday morning, when the captain reported the El Faro was listing slightly at 15 degrees in strong winds and heavy seas. Some water had entered through a hatch that popped open.      The captain, who has 20 years' experience on cargo ships, calmly told company officials the crew was removing the water.      The Coast Guard was unable to fly into the ship's last known position until Sunday, because of the fierce hurricane winds.      Steven Werse, a ship captain with 31 years' experience on the seas, said merchant vessels have access to up-to-date weather forecasting and technology that allow them to avoid most storms.      If the El Faro had not lost engine power, he added, it would probably still have been powerful enough to make it through Joaquin.      Without power, it was a sitting duck.      "The ship really is at the mercy of the sea. You have no means of maneuvering the ship. You would be rolling with the seas," said Werse, secretary-treasurer of the Master Mates and Pilots Union in Linthicum Heights, Maryland. The union has no connection to the El Faro or its crew.      Abandoning ship would be difficult, he added, because the lifeboats might not be accessible on a listing ship and life rafts could be torn apart or blown away.      "Sometimes circumstances overwhelm you. You can do all the planning you want," Werse said.      Bernard Ferguson, a commercial fisherman who was at his home on Crooked Island during the hurricane, said it must have been a nightmare for the crew.      "It's impossible for any kind of vessel to take that kind of beating for that length of time, maybe an hour or two, yes," Ferguson said. "But taking 36 hours of beating, there's no way."      Anxious family members, gathered at the Seafarers union hall in Jacksonville, tried to remain optimistic, but some wondered why the ship sailed into such a potent storm.      "What we've all questioned from the very start is why the captain would take them through a hurricane of this magnitude, or any hurricane," said Barry Young, uncle of crew member Shaun Riviera.      Terrence Meadows, a junior engineer and union member, said the captain and company made a poor decision to go to sea. He added there is often pressure for captains to stay on schedule.      "I personally believe that should not have happened," Meadows said. "We are the most important cargo on that vessel, not the cars" and other cargo.      Fedor said the National Transportation Safety Board and Coast Guard will investigate the sinking. The Coast Guard did not immediately release safety records requested by The Associated Press for the ship and its company.      ____      Kay reported from Opa-Locka, Florida. Associated Press writers Curt Anderson in Miami and Ben Fox in the Bahamas contributed to this story. |||||	– The captain of the El Faro planned to sail ahead of Hurricane Joaquin, but the cargo ship was doomed by a mechanical failure that left it at the mercy of the storm, according to the vessel's owner. The CEO of Tote Services says the captain, who was last heard from on Thursday morning, had determined that the weather was good enough to follow a sister ship's path back to Jacksonville, Fla., the AP reports. "Regrettably he suffered a mechanical problem with his main propulsion system, which left him in the path of the storm," the CEO says. "We do not know when his engine problems began to occur, nor the reasons for his engine problems." The Coast Guard believes the ship, with a crew of 28 Americans and five Poles, sank in 15,000 feet of water near the Bahamas. Mariners tell the AP that the ship would probably have been able to make it through the worst of the storm if it had engine power, but without it, it would have been helpless and even abandoning ship would have been extremely difficult. Such disasters are extremely rare, reports the Atlantic. Until the El Faro, more Boeing 777s had been lost at sea than large cargo ships over the last five years, and, amid a huge volume of maritime traffic, only six were lost in the decade from 2005, although dozens more ran aground or sank with some warning. Searchers are now looking for survivors instead of the ship itself, though all they have found so far is debris and a survival suit with "unidentifiable" human remains.
summarize: If ever there was an exam tailored to measure future professional success, it's the Graduate Management Admission Test. Graded by a software program called E-rater, GMAT essays are given high marks, regardless of content, not only for lengthiness and sentence complexity, but also for unintelligible wording and extensive application of such terms as "since" and "therefore," commonly associated with solid reasoning. To bluff that computer, in other words, you need not be a scholar, but simply must master the tools used to defraud investors.      It's a formula. As former New York Times editors Patricia T. O'Conner and Stewart Kellerman note, there's no need with E-rater "to sweat over creativity, individuality and style -- the things a real reader looks for in writing." Alas, the advice they dispense in "You Send Me: Getting It Right When You Write Online" can only result in prose equally dull and mechanical.      Perhaps that's inevitable, given the authors' oft-stated premise. Like many people who grew up in another era, O'Conner and Kellerman see e-mail simply as the latest trend in letter-writing, a technological advance which, like the invention of the fountain pen, has made life a little easier and people a little lazier than they were in the age of the quill. They write that "e-mail has single-handedly revived the epistolary tradition," yet that "much of what passes for writing in cyberspace is dreadful. The spelling in e-mail is rotten, the grammar is atrocious, the punctuation -- don't ask."      But rather than examining why online writing is so undisciplined and attempting to appreciate the virtue of such impertinence, O'Conner and Kellerman are determined to impose on electronic communication all the limitations of the forms to which they're already accustomed. "Right now online writing is pretty much in its Wild West stage," they write, "with everybody shooting from the hip and no sheriff in sight. The outlaws claim that rules are so 'analog,' so 'print,' so 'old media.' But law and order will gradually replace frontier justice, and now is our chance to have a say in what the laws will be."      What rules would they instate? Some of their ideas are simply quaint remnants of an earlier time, as harmless as our vestigial tails: include "a friendly greeting, a polite closing, and a name at the end." Extraneous as all that may be, what with the "To" and "From" fields that head every e-mail, it's the sort of gesture that inevitably will go the way of the dinosaur.      Occasionally, O'Conner and Kellerman even give a good suggestion. One anecdote they relate, of a professor who deleted any e-mail that came to him from a Hotmail address -- he believed it to be from a porn site -- indicates the degree to which a screen name makes an impression. But such attention to online communication as a medium in its own right is, in this book, inexplicably uncommon.      The majority of the advice in "You Send Me" is either so banal that it insults the intelligence of the reader or so inappropriate that it calls into question the competence of the writers. Into the former category we can place the suggestion to "Say it once. You might come up with three terrific ways to say something, but an e-mail or other online message isn't the place for all three." These words of wisdom, lest they be forgotten, are rephrased 39 pages later: "Did you get right to the point?" -- which is almost verbatim a reprise of the advice 44 pages earlier to "Get to the point."      One might think this an attempt at subtle satire, were the authors not so ham-handed with their humor elsewhere. Almost invariably, the chapter subheads are puns ("Mail Bonding," "Clone Rangers," "Call Me Modem"), offering a superficial levity sometimes extended into the text ("Simply follow these steps and develop the comma touch"). While hardly witty, such trite wordplay would simply be forgettable were there something useful being said. Instead, when the authors take the space to be substantive, they merely offer a round-about repackaging of Strunk & White.      It should be said that William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White's "Elements of Style" could easily be extended to many times its current 105 pages. Ideally, an annotated edition would explain why we have the rules of grammar that we do and how the exceptions originally came into being. A history of English grammar would help us to use rules with greater precision, or more originality, as happens when we know the etymology of our words. O'Conner and Kellerman don't give grammar that chance. While their advice is sometimes easier to apply than that found on a high school composition class mimeograph, they allow the deeper reasons for most rules to remain as opaque as ever. "If a sentence ends with an aside in parentheses, the period goes outside. ... But if the entire sentence is in parentheses, the period goes inside." Why? They don't say, although it would be easy enough to explain that a period indicates the end of a sentence as a whole; when a clause enclosed in parentheses is only part of a larger sentence, the period goes outside. But if the parenthetical is a full sentence, unless you want your period to serve as a clause in its own right, it goes inside.      Mindlessly memorizing rules, you find yourself at the service of language rather than the other way around. If that happens to enough people, language is immobilized, effectively dead. The Internet, so long as it remains in what O'Conner and Kellerman call its "Wild West stage," offers an opportunity for the unwashed masses to rethink the accepted rules of grammar, to reclaim them and to reinvent them to suit new meanings.      "We think the computer may be the best thing that's happened to writing since the printing press," the authors of "You Send Me" claim, presumably referring to its ability to facilitate mass communication. What they ignore, though, in their lists of words with 'e' before 'i' that "you'll just have to memorize" is the remarkable plurality of approaches to spelling and grammatical strategies to be found in incunabula, from the Bible to Shakespeare. (Consider the effect of the technical misuse of "whom" for "who" in the King James Bible: "But whom say ye that I am?" Christ asks Peter in Matthew 16:15, adding a glint of majesty to his question, an implied answer, that would be lacking in, e.g., "But who say ye that I am?") In the 16th and 17th centuries, there was a looseness to language that gradually was driven out by schoolteachers and proofreaders until modernism had to break each rule intentionally, a sort of reverse-engineered ignorance, deliberately building an alternate history of literature on self-conscious idiosyncrasies.      It was an exercise that, at its most profound, brought us Gertrude Stein's "3 Lives," and, at its most silly, an entire novel written exclusively with words lacking the letter 'e'. Language opened up in certain circles courtesy of the experimental novel, but that expansion was always artificial.      Through the Internet, language can be revivified in a way that is universal and natural. O'Conner and Kellerman want us to "resist the temptation to show off typographically with bizarre lettering or graphics or spelling or punctuation," when those are precisely the things with which we ought to be experimenting. Addressing the perils of punctuation, they write that, "It hasn't helped that those cutesy emoticons people use online are tiny pictures made of punctuation marks. After a while, folks start thinking of hyphens as noses, parentheses as smiles or frowns, colons as eyes (and semicolons as winks)."      Point well taken, but is this honestly a bad thing? The authors claim earlier that, "Asking an e-mail to carry your message is sometimes asking a lot ... In a face-to-face meeting, body language, tone of voice, and facial expression help people to communicate." Certainly ;-) doesn't match the nod-and-a-wink of a professional comedian, nor does 0:-) evoke angelic innocence as well as a Raphael painting does, but such symbols do suggest that, if people need to gesture in a textual environment, they can innovate.      We can do this by ignoring old rules and inventing at our keyboard without the worry that we're committing a cardinal sin. Emoticons are as insipid as air kisses and should be avoided by anybody whose name isn't Tammi or Brandi. But we can only address our need to punctuate what we write online with an indication of how we feel about it -- to create a language of emotional subtext -- if we recognize that need in the first place. And we will recognize it only if we learn from what we see online rather than trying to teach the Internet to behave like an older technology.      Already we've seen the PC held back by the desktop metaphor -- the persistence of folders and trash bins -- that has made us wary of any organizational scheme designed to take advantage of the differences between a digital and an analog world. Having rejected DOS, we're paranoid about anything that isn't "user-friendly," that requires some adjustment on our part and a commitment to meet the technology halfway. It's as if Henry Ford rigged a bridle and set of leather reins to his Model T instead of a steering wheel and clutch, and to this day we were still driving our cars the way a 19th century groomsman would handle a horse and buggy. The automobile works better because we allowed the technology to take on a form of its own and adjusted our habits to make the most of it. Except perhaps among early enthusiasts of the Altair, that never happened with computers.      This paranoia about innovation now extends into online communication. "Software is out there that can track your every move," O'Conner and Kellerman write, "from the Web sites you visit to the books you buy to the songs you download to the e-mail you answer. Yes, there are programs that can foil casual snoopers. ... But it's safer to operate on the assumption that virtually anyone can find out virtually anything you do in the virtual world."      In other words, because the technology allows the possibility that you'll be monitored, you should respond by never saying anything substantive -- let alone, God forbid, something ungrammatical. And as for expressing yourself with even a whiff of whimsy: "Assume that someone with absolutely no sense of humor is hunched over a desktop computer in an office down the hall."      Assume that no one will understand you, everyone will forward what you write to those you want least to read it and that the whole Internet is a virtual fishbowl. Don't put a semicolon inside your quotation marks, don't write "a lot" as a single word and never ever send another e-mail that's not about correct grammar, and you may live your life unnoticed by all. If that's your idea of a worthy existence, then this is your book.      Already, generations have suffered under the strictures of "good grammar." We've been running scared for too long. It can be seen in the way that people use "I" instead of "me" at every possible opportunity: The constant correction of "Pat and Stewart and me went to the library" has resulted in a fear of ever being caught saying "me" -- a source of trauma for Pat and Stewart and I -- or, rather, for Pat and Stewart and me.      More proper than we are, our grammar has caused us to second-guess everything we say. The Internet is the Wild West. Let's not treat it like Westminster Abbey. ||||| To Oxford comma, or not to Oxford comma? That is the question which has been taxing the internet over the past 24 hours, after it emerged – erroneously, as it later turned out – that the Oxford comma was being dropped by the University of Oxford style guide.      The punctuation-related hooha arose after US publishing site GalleyCat was alerted by @RantyEditor's tweet that "Oxford Style Guide ditches the Oxford comma. I have strong feelings about this, none of them good". "As a general rule, do not use the serial/Oxford comma: so write 'a, b and c' not 'a, b, and c'," it advises, on the Oxford University website.      Cue widespread wailing and gnashing of teeth, and vows to carry on using the Oxford comma forever, regardless. "I am absolutely not a flawless user of any kind of punctuation," wrote Linda Holmes on NPR. "And yet, even the rumbling of a distant threat to the Oxford comma (or 'serial comma') turns me instantly into an NFL referee, blowing my whistle and improvising some sort of signal — perhaps my hands clasped to my own head as if in pain — to indicate that the loss of the serial comma would sadden me beyond words." "Are you people insane? The Oxford comma is what separates us from the animals," tweeted another punctuation obsessive, as the Twittersphere took off with collective punctuation woe.      Fortunately for fans, it has since emerged that 30 June was not the day the Oxford comma died. The Oxford University guidelines are only for staff writing press releases and internal communications, a spokesperson has said, and Oxford University Press has asserted that the Oxford comma lives on, just the same as it ever was.      While I'm not a particular fan of the Oxford comma (the Guardian style guide allows its use in potentially confusing circumstances), finding that it breaks up the flow of a sentence, I am strangely moved by the fact that so many people are. Happy days indeed, that punctuation can be such an emotive subject. Sorry, Vampire Weekend, but it turns out that we do give a fuck about the Oxford comma. |||||	– Grammar fiends took a ride on an emotional roller coaster this week on news, erroneous as it turned out, that Oxford University was ditching its famous comma rule. (It requires a comma before the word "and" in a series: Not "a, b and c" but "a, b, and c.") Writers rallied to the rule's defense, including Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. It "is one of the sanest punctuation usages in the written language," she writes. "It gives each element of a series its own distinct place in it, instead of lumping the last two together in one hasty breath." It also played out on Twitter, notes AP, where one user demonstrated how the comma can avoid ambiguity: “For teaching me that the Oxford comma resolves ambiguity, I'd like to thank my parents, Sinead O'Connor and the Pope.” (O'Connor and the pope are most definitely not his parents.) After the outcry, Oxford said everyone had overreacted, explaining the style change applied only to press releases and internal communication—and that it's actually a few years old. Writes Alison Flood at the Guardian: "While I'm not a particular fan of the Oxford comma ... I am strangely moved by the fact that so many people are. Happy days indeed, that punctuation can be such an emotive subject."
summarize: Image copyright AFP Image caption Nairobi National Park is on the southern edge of Kenya's capital      A lion has attacked an elderly man in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, after straying from a nearby national park.      The animal became agitated with people hooting their horns and taking selfies, a wildlife official said.      The lion has returned to the park and the 63-year-old man is in hospital, Paul Udoto, spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service said.      The city was put on high alert last month after several lions escaped from the park, causing panic.      A video circulating on social media appears to show the lion wandering along a busy road during morning rush hour.      Rangers are still on the streets of the city in case there are other lions around that have not been spotted, Mr Udoto added.      The park is separated by a main road from densely populated neighbourhoods, including Kibera slum, in the south of the city.      A loss of habitat for lions in the city means they are increasingly coming into conflict with human populations, putting their survival at risk, Kenyan conservationist Ali Kaka told the BBC.      "If there is no prey or there isn't enough prey in the park the animals may decide to wander out," he added.      Nairobi National Park is fenced in on the city side but is open elsewhere to allow for the annual wildlife migration.      In 2012, four cubs had to be placed in an orphanage after a similar incident led to their mother being killed.      What to do if you spot a lion:      Do not confront the animal      Do not make noise      Do not throw anything at the animal      Do not run      Do not panic as the animal may sense this and react      Advice from conservationist Ali Kaka ||||| FILE - In this Saturday, Jan. 25, 2014 file photo, a male lion looks out over the savannah at dusk prior to being shot with a tranquilizer dart, in order to fit a GPS-tracking collar, by a team led by...

(Associated Press)      NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A lion left Nairobi National Park, walked alongside a highway full of rush-hour traffic and mauled a 63-year-old pedestrian Friday before being captured, officials said.      The man had been "clawed in two areas, on the front of the chest and on the back of the shoulder. He sustained lacerations, quite deep cuts in the left shoulder region and has sustained a small fracture in one of the bones in the area," said Victor Ng'ani, the director of Mater Hospital.      The lion went by The Star printing press. Wellington Lwenya, a plumber there, said it was terrifying to come face-to-face with the lion, the newspaper reported.      The lion attacked after becoming agitated by motorists honking their horns, said Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udoto.      A video circulating on social media show the lion walking on a sidewalk amid a cacophony of honking horns.      Some Nairobi residents are getting concerned by the growing number of such incidents.      "We are worried for our lives," said Michael Kimani, a Nairobi resident who saw the lion.      Nairobi National Park, which covered 117 square kilometers (45 square miles) on the outskirts of Nairobi, is home to endangered black rhinos, lions, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes and diverse birdlife. It is partly surrounded by an electric fence.      In February, six lions walked out of the park and roamed through the city, scaring residents for a few hours before the big cats returned to the reserve.      Occasionally lions clash with people on the southern side, which is not fenced.      In 2012, six lions were killed after the pride of eight lions attacked and killed eight goats of Maasai herdsmen. Only about 2,000 lions are left in Kenya after years of hunting and then poaching.      The government has announced plans to build a railway that will traverse part of the reserve. Conservationists have opposed the railway line, saying it will further damage wildlife habitat.      __      This corrects spelling of Maasai. ||||| A 63-year-old man was injured during a lion attack on Friday after the animal wandered out of Kenya's Nairobi National Park onto a major highway during the height of morning traffic, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) reported.      Paul Udoto, a KWS spokesman, said the black-maned lion swiped at the man after it became agitated by horn-honking from passing cars.      "People were there, hooting their horns, taking selfies and all that, and the lion got agitated," Udoto said. He added that the injured man was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.      Following the incident, the male lion returned to the park, followed by rangers who encouraged it to move deeper into the reserve.      "The lion is safely back, but our teams are still on the ground in case there are any others around that have not been spotted," Udoto said.      Lions 'on the loose' or humans too close?      A video circulating on social media shows commuters incessantly honking their horns as the large lion runs along Mombasa Road, a traffic-packed four-lane highway in Nairobi. Some looked on at the lion from behind a closed iron-bar gate.      Animals in Nairobi National Park roam just 10 kilometers (six miles) from downtown Nairobi. Kenya's big cats are increasingly strained as the fast-growing city of over three million expands onto the animals' ancient migration routes and hunting grounds.      Conservationists argue that lions are neither "escaping" from the parks nor "straying" into human settlements; lions, they say, predate people in the area and people have moved into the lions' home ranges.      Last month, two lions spent a day wandering through Kibera, a densely packed Nairobi slum, before returning to the park. Although lion sightings are becoming more common in the bustling capital, it is unusual for anyone to be injured during the animals' outings.      rs/jm (AP, Reuters) |||||	– A warning: When a lion is on the loose, it's best to keep your distance and skip the selfies. A 63-year-old man is recovering in a hospital after a lion strayed from a national park in Kenya on Friday. The black-maned lion was spotted prowling beside a four-lane highway in Nairobi during morning rush hour, reports the BBC. A rep for the Kenya Wildlife Service tells Deutsche Welle that it clawed the man—who suffered a broken bone and deep cuts to his shoulder, per the AP—because people were "hooting their horns, taking selfies and all that, and the lion got agitated." The lion was later escorted back to the reserve.
summarize: America's Most Dangerous Cities For Women      We analyzed crime data for U.S. cities to find the most dangerous metro areas for women. The following 10 cities have the highest violent crime rates and incidences of forcible rape in the nation.       ||||| Twenty-seven-year-old Army specialist Casey Bogenrief was set to deploy from Fort Wainright in Fairbanks, Alaska, in a few days when he met a young woman who invited him to her apartment to have a drink and sing karaoke. Shortly after arriving, the soldier is said to have become violent and demanded to have sex with the woman before slamming her head against a door and assaulting her.      While his attorney says that any sexual contact was consensual, Bogenrief stands trial this week for rape, putting him among the hundreds of annual perpetrators of the crime in the city that’s been called a hotbed for sexual violence. For a metro area that the FBI measures at just 38,307, an incredibly high rate of rape (more than double the national metropolitan average) lands Fairbanks among the top three most dangerous cities for women in the United States at 193 reported rapes per 100,000 residents.      To calculate cities where women are at risk for becoming victims of both violent crimes and sexual assault, we analyzed data from the FBI Uniform Crime Report, which tallies crime data for each of the country’s metropolitan statistical areas, regions that usually consist of a large city and its suburbs or clusters of closely linked smaller cities, and metropolitan divisions, which are core areas within some of the larger MSAs.      We used the FBI’s numbers for violent crimes including murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault in addition to reported incidences of rape in each metro area. While the FBI warns that reporting can be troubling for ranking purposes (particularly as they only measure cases of “forcible rape” which discounts date-rape, statutory rape and other sexual assaults), and RAINN stresses that reported cases of rape barely scratch the surface of the true magnitude of the crime, the numbers are clear in one thing: for women in Alaska and Michigan, the threat of sexual assault is clear and present.      Only four months into the calendar year there have been 274 rapes in Detroit, Mich., in 2012 including four cases of serial rapists in the city. But surprisingly, the smaller city of Saginaw, some 90 miles from the auto manufacturing capitol suffers even higher incidences of the crime at 76 rapes for every 100,000 people in the metro area that the FBI measures at 197,310. Added to a troublingly high rate of nonsexual violent crimes (870 per 100,000), that number makes Saginaw, Mich., the country’s most dangerous city for women.      In Pictures: The 10 Most Dangerous Cities For Women      Meanwhile, according to a 2011 survey, more than 37% of Alaskan women report that they've suffered some form of sexual assault in their lives. And Fairbanks isn’t the only Alaskan city to top our ranking. Anchorage suffers the highest violent crime rate in the state, (812 reported for every 100,000 residents) in addition to a staggeringly high incidence of rape. According to numbers from the FBI Uniform Crime Report, more than 85 rapes are committed annually per 100,000 citizens, which makes Anchorage No. 2 on our list.      Scott Berkowitz, the president of RAINN (the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) says that while data on reported incidences of rape is often unreliable, researchers and advocates have historically seen higher rates of sexual violence in native communities. In Alaska, where nearly 15% of the population is American Indian or Alaskan Indian, Berkowitz says this could be a key factor. Research points to as many as one in three Indian women will be raped or sexually assaulted in her lifetime--a rate 3.5 times higher than any other racial groups.      The fourth most dangerous city as ranked by our list is Springfield, Ill., a metro area of 200,000 four hours south of Chicago where the FBI reports 855 violent crimes and 70 rapes each year per 100,000 citizens. Despite its dangerous ranking, the state of llinois has made great strides to respond to violent crimes against women; Illinois currently has more than 33 24-hour rape crisis centers and in 1992 was one of the first states to include rights for victims of violent crime in its state constitution.      In Pictures: The 10 Most Dangerous Cities For Women      At No. 5 on the 2012 list of the most dangerous cities for women is Redding, California, where there were 797 incidences of violent crime and 65 rapes for every 100,000 citizens. For a metro area whose population is just over that number at 182,000, a total of 120 rapes occurred over 12 months. Redding, a Northern California city located in Shasta County, is also becoming proactive about rape prevention. At a recent Sexual Assault Awareness Month event, spokeswoman Jean King of the Shasta women’s Refuge noted that the county suffers twice as many sexual assaults as the rest of the state of California. "We don't want to have that in our community,” she said before continuing that by making the issue a local one she hopes to see a decline.      Flint, Michigan, has also seen rape numbers on the rise, and falls at No. 6 on our list of dangerous cities. Kim Hurst with the Wayne County Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners Program, known as SAFE, told local authorities that her Detroit branch has seen 60 girls in April alone and that her metro numbers are in the hundreds. More foreboding: all the attacks are becoming more violent. "I have to say we do recently seem to have seen potentially more physical injury with our victims that are coming in," she says.      *Readers in the comments section have pointed out that populations for Saginaw County, MI, and Fairbanks, AK., are off. Upon further research, the numbers provided in the FBI Uniform Crime Report are not identical to U.S. Census counts. Please note that population numbers are reflective of the FBI count and NOT official Census data. |||||	– Rape statistics are notoriously unreliable, so Forbes has analyzed a wider swath of FBI crime data to create a list of America's most dangerous cities for women. Add robbery and aggravated assault statistics to forcible rape, and you get: Saginaw, Michigan: 90 miles from Detroit, Saginaw has 76 rapes for every 100,000 people in the metro area. The city's shockingly high instance of nonsexual violent crimes (870 per 100,000) puts Saginaw at the top of the list. Anchorage, Alaska: More than 37% of Alaskan women say they've suffered sexual assault, according to a 2011 survey. In Anchorage, the rape rate is 85 per 100,000; the violent crime rate, 812 per 100,000. Fairbanks, Alaska: This city has fewer violent crimes per 100,000 (193) than Anchorage, but a staggeringly high rape rate, topping both Anchorage and Saginaw: 193. Springfield, Illinois: The state has made strides in reducing crimes against women, with more than 33 round-the-clock crisis centers, but Springfield's numbers remain high: 70 rapes and 855 violent crimes per 100,000 residents.

summarize: The Rules of Golf can strike down in brutal fashion, and the U.S. Amateur is only the most recent tournament in which that was the case.      After shooting 73 in the first round at Riviera Country Club, Chris Crawford was gunning for a solid second round Tuesday at Bel Air Country Club to advance to the match play portion of the U.S. Amateur. During that second round, according to Philly.com, he became aware his caddie had used the slope function on his distance measuring device. This is a violation of Rule 14-3.      Crawford alerted a rules official of his caddie’s misstep, which would normally dock him two strokes. The only problem was that his caddie used the slope function multiple times during the round, which brought the punishment even further: disqualification.      Chris Crawford was competing in his fifth U.S. Amateur and was in good position to make the cut for match play when he was disqualified. Getty Images // Gregory Shamus      ESPN’s Bob Harig tracked down Crawford for a comment Tuesday evening. "I was a little flustered and knew something was wrong," Crawford told Harig. "I asked my caddie what the deal was with his range finder. When he said it had a slope adjustment, I knew instantly that I had to disqualify myself. I notified the walking scorer in my group, and after getting in touch with a rules official I learned it would have been a 2-shot penalty if I had used it just once, but the second time is a disqualification. I have my own range finder and I know the rule, but I didn't think his would have that."      According to Harig’s report, Crawford was 2 under for his second round (1 over overall) when the disqualification occurred. Eventually, 4 over was good enough to advance to a playoff for the match play competition.      "I didn’t gain an advantage, but I know the Rules," he told Harig. "I knew what the rule was and I didn’t have a choice." ||||| Golf's complicated rulebook found another victim Tuesday, this time at the U.S. Amateur, where former Drexel golfer Chris Crawford was disqualified for using a distance-measuring device that had an activated slope reader accessed by his fill-in caddie.      Crawford, 23, who lives outside of Philadelphia, got off to a good start earlier in his second round of stroke-play qualifying at Bel Air Country Club in Los Angeles and was in position to make the 64-player match play when he heard his caddie mention something about slope when getting a yardage from his distance-measuring device.      "I was a little flustered and knew something was wrong," Crawford said via phone on Tuesday night. "I asked my caddie what the deal was with his range finder. When he said it had a slope adjustment, I knew instantly that I had to disqualify myself. I notified the walking scorer in my group, and after getting in touch with a rules official I learned it would have been a 2-shot penalty if I had used it just once, but the second time is a disqualification. I have my own range finder and I know the rule, but I didn't think his would have that."      A slope reader can be on a distance-measuring device, but it cannot be accessed. The information that Crawford was given caused him to believe it was being used; he checked and it was on. If it had been turned off, there would have been no violation. But instead, Crawford was deemed in violation of Rule 14-3 "for multiple uses of a distance-measuring device with the slope feature activated by his caddie," according to the United States Golf Association, which administers the tournament.      In 2014, the USGA began allowing the use of such devices as part of a local rule that has been adopted for all of its amateur events but not the U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open or U.S. Senior Open. Distance-measuring devices are not allowed on the PGA, European or LPGA tours, and not on the Web.com Tour except in some experimental instances.      The stroke-play rounds of the U.S. Amateur were contested at Bel-Air and Riviera Country Club, where the match-play portion of the tournament begins Wednesday.      Crawford said he had intended to bring his own caddie to Los Angeles for the tournament, but that he became ill. So he hired a local caddie on Monday at Riviera, where he shot 73, and another Tuesday at Bel-Air, where he was 2 under for his round and 1 over for the tournament when he discovered the infraction.      "I was so upset and flustered by the situation," said Crawford, who did not name the caddie. "I know some people in that situation would have gone berserk. I'm obviously mad. I still am right now and will be for quite a while. I didn't say anything to him. What can I really say at that point?"      Crawford, who qualified for the U.S. Open last year at Oakmont and this year at Erin Hills (he went through local and sectional qualifying to make it and missed the cut in both events), said this was his fifth U.S. Amateur and he had never qualified for match play.      Asked if the slope device on the range finder really would have given him an advantage -- and if anyone would have known had he not said anything -- Crawford said he never considered playing on.      "I didn't gain an advantage but I know the rules," he said. "[The late amateur] Bobby Jones said you might as well congratulate a man for not robbing a bank [if you applaud him for disqualifying himself] in that situation. I knew what the rule was and I didn't have a choice. I know nobody else would have known. But I knew. I knew what the rules was. It's just the way it is."      Crawford, who has pro aspirations and will assess his path soon, said he traveled to California with his mom, Karen.      "This is the biggest amateur tournament, and it's a commitment financially," he said. "To have it end in such a disappointing way is pretty crushing."      Thirteen golfers who posted a score of 4 over for 36 holes will compete in a playoff Wednesday morning for the final eight spots in the match-play field. Hayden Wood, of Edmund, Oklahoma, was stroke-play medalist after rounds of 64-67. |||||	– For the first time in five attempts, amateur golfer Christopher Crawford looked poised to qualify for the 64-player match-play tournament at the United States Amateur Championship in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Then his game went, well, downhill. While preparing for a shot, 23-year-old Crawford realized his caddie was using the slope function on his distance-measuring device to read the course at Bel Air Country Club, reports ESPN. Though measuring instruments are permitted, Crawford's caddie—a last-minute fill-in for his regular caddie, who was sick—apparently didn't realize slope-reading was banned. What was Crawford to do? "I know nobody else would have known," he says. But "I knew instantly that I had to disqualify myself." Had the slope reader been used once, Crawford would have been given a two-shot penalty. But Crawford's caddie had used the feature repeatedly and USGA rules state "multiple uses of a distance-measuring device with the slope feature activated" are grounds for disqualification, per Golf.com. "This is the biggest amateur tournament, and it's a commitment financially" so "to have it end in such a disappointing way is pretty crushing," Crawford tells ESPN. Still, he doesn't want praise for his sportsmanship. "You might as well congratulate a man for not robbing a bank," he says. He's getting it anyway. "Tournament finishes ultimately get lost to history. A player's character, however, withstands the test of time," writes Joel Beall at Golf Digest.
summarize: All around us, every day, things are disappearing—birds, butterflies, coral reefs, islands. Places we used to live. Things we used to eat. But what if there was a way to bring some of it back? Well, it turns out there is. A few miles north of San Diego, scientists are gathering up specimens of every living thing they can get their hands on in a last-ditch effort to save the planet from an unstoppable predator: us      I. Nobody Say “Jurassic Park”      A few weeks ago, a humpback whale arrived in a FedEx box. Dr. Oliver Ryder removed the vial containing the whale from the package. He used its cells to grow more cells. Then he froze it. “And you know how hard it is to get a sample of a whale, legally?” It's hard. There are rules about this sort of thing, shipping whales across national borders. Nevertheless, more boxes—full of deer, ibis, flamingos, desert tortoises, rhinos—arrive every day. They are unboxed, grown anew. Then they go into the Frozen Zoo to be saved.      It's unassuming, the Frozen Zoo—just north of San Diego, deep in California inland nothingness, where it is housed at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research. The institute is like any other academic building: low-slung, quiet, smells of cleaning supplies. The Frozen Zoo itself is even less glamorous. A room full of big frozen steel tanks fed by vacuum jacketed pipes pumping liquid nitrogen. Every time you open one of the freezers you get a witchy puff of smoke. Inside the tanks are the animals.      Ryder points at a tank, which he says contains nearly all of the Frozen Zoo's individuals. Almost 10,000 of them. “They compress to a pretty small space,” he says. Each individual has its cells split up, placed into multiple tubes. “Half of the vials of an individual are in that freezer. Half of the vials are in a freezer in another place, so even if this building is destroyed we won't lose the collection.” Ryder will not disclose the whereabouts of this other place. An undisclosed location.      Ten thousand individuals. Representing about a thousand species and sub-species. In this regular-looking steel tank. “And it's the size of a refrigerator?” Ryder asks rhetorically. “That's the densest vertebrate biological diversity on the planet.”      It's an ark, in other words: Ryder's building an ark. An ark in a freezer! The mission of the Frozen Zoo, Ryder says, is to preserve “a legacy of life on Earth” at the precise moment that life, in all its glamorous and tedious and ungainly forms, is disappearing from our orb at an alarming rate. We're losing big charismatic mega-fauna like elephants. Also vital little soldiers like bees. And, increasingly, actual people. We're running out of water, out of food, out of bees. We're running out of the life that makes other life. It's going away. Maybe we're going away. So Ryder is building an ark.      Some of the animals whose genetic material is stored in the ark are still here on Earth, alive, walking around. Many are long dead. Some represent species that are endangered—the ancient Przewalski's horse, which looks, with its long block head and placid eyes, like a living cave painting. One species in the Frozen Zoo, the po‘ouli, a portly Hawaiian bird, is extinct. The only place it lives on—“lives” is probably not the right word, or at least not yet—is here, in the Frozen Zoo.      What is the ark for? That depends on how you look at it. From one angle, it's a museum: a catalog of what we have, or—increasingly—what we had, here on Earth. With a microscope, it's the Met. From another angle, it's a research resource. This is its primary use. “We've sent thousands of samples to hundreds of investigators,” says Ryder, with his cheerful beard and his fleece vest and plaid shirt and baggy pants. “It's not a time capsule. It is used.” But the Frozen Zoo also has a third purpose. For a while Ryder didn't like to talk about this fact. Visitors would come to the zoo and throw around words like “Jurassic Park.” They'd ask the obvious questions about bringing animals back to life, dead but for the cells and DNA that live on in the Frozen Zoo. Is that possible? Or will it be, someday?      “People would ask us about that,” Ryder says. “I avoided that question because I considered it spurious and I didn't want to deal with sensationalism. I wanted to acquaint people with the real problems of trying to save species today, not like fantasy solutions for the future.”      A long pause. “But there's been kind of a convergence, and the technology has developed.”      So, yes, the third purpose of the Frozen Zoo is this: Resurrection. Reanimation. Whatever you want to call it. (Nobody at the Frozen Zoo, nobody anywhere with any kind of serious scientific background, calls it any of those things. If they have to say something, they say de-extinction.) The technology exists. To create clones, basically—to take the still-living cells of a dead animal from a dead species and reprogram those cells into sperm or eggs. To combine sperm and egg. To put that fertilized egg into a surrogate host, which will then give birth. To take what was dead and gone and give it life again. Scientists have done it with a mouse already—siphoned off blood from a mouse's tail, extracted white blood cells, turned them back into stem cells, built a whole new mouse. “It's been the realm of science fiction, but here we have it, here it's going to be used and we're deciding now what we do next,” Ryder admits grudgingly. “Each current generation understands they can't bring back what was lost, you know? Then they go through their own sense of loss. We can mitigate some of that.”      Imagine: through history, things just vanishing around us. The common estimate is that 99 percent of what has ever lived on this Earth has since vanished. Over 5 billion species, gone forever. That process now accelerating to a frightening speed, on account of us. So much loss that it outpaces our capacity for grief, if that makes sense. But for how long? The world is shrinking, closing in on us. Life is fading away.      Nobody's ever systematically gathered the material you could use to re-create that life, Ryder says, swiveling in his office chair one warm March day. “This is the first time. Move forward a thousand years or ten thousand years: What's that going to mean for the structure of life on our planet? I don't think it will be an incidental footnote. I think it's going to have huge utility.” The return of lost ecosystems. Abundance prevailing, against the odds, over scarcity. Mankind not dying en masse, even.      The reality, our reality, is simple: Keep on going as we have and soon there will be no more us. But what if we could reverse the tide? Get back what we've lost, before we lose ourselves?      II. A Brief History of Lost Things      Extinction is old but it's also new. (Don't worry, we can do all this in a paragraph.) Throughout the 1700s, gentleman scientists were finding bits of fossilized skeleton in the ground that made no sense, had no corollary on the planet that they could find. Thomas Jefferson, for one, was obsessed with the mastodon. He kept trying to get his hands on some bones. But he also assumed the creature was still alive, somewhere in the American interior. He hoped Lewis and Clark might find one. The idea that things like mastodons and mammoths could wink into and then out of existence went against God, as far as he and pretty much everyone else were concerned. Even Charles Darwin didn't believe things just up and disappeared; he figured they evolved, improved, natural-selected themselves into their next form. It took a skeptical Parisian, Georges Cuvier, to posit the existence of espèces perdues: lost species. That was right around 1800. (Like I said: one paragraph.)      So it's only been 200 years, really, that anybody on this planet has had to walk around with the poison knowledge that a thing they love, or fear, or take for granted, or hunt for food may one day get swept away in the breeze, never to return. And for most of those 200 years, mankind has been on a pretty chill clock. Yes, species may go extinct, but in the droplet of geologic time that is a human lifetime? What are the odds? For a while, not very high. But now? After cars and airplanes and air conditioners and the vast depredation of our rain forests? After Amazon and SUVs and your 6-year-old kid developing a taste for raw bluefin tuna? Pretty damn high.      Things are gloomy out there. Right now Australia's koalas, whose numbers are already declining, are suffering from a debilitating chlamydia epidemic that may do in the remnant. In the last 30 years we've lost about half of the coral in the Great Barrier Reef. The tiny armored truck that is the Chinese pangolin—whose keratin scales are rumored to help women lactate—is being driven to extinction by poaching. We're losing our butterflies. Only an estimated 40 Amur leopards are left in Russia. Maybe 40 Asiatic cheetahs in Iran. Four hundred Iberian lynxes. The bullet that took the life of Internet meme Harambe also took one of our remaining western lowland gorillas. The spoon-billed sandpiper, the saola, royal turtles, certain lemurs—they're not going to make it. All around us, on our dinner plates and in our backyards and on our ecotourist vacations to Antarctica, it's all vanishing. We're not quite the first generation to grow up with this knowledge, but we might be the first to really see it in action.      But…that's just a list of animals! you say. Chlamydia, LOL! You may not care, as is your right. Most of us don't. (Though let's pause to just notice that: your inevitable reaction, not to care. The same way that when you're drowning, after a certain point, you no longer think of air.) But consider for a second: A place you loved and can never go again. A particular taste, some smoky sense memory from a faraway coast. The infinite possibilities the world has to offer becoming finite. Because of us.      Take the northern white rhinoceros. A classic study in the many ways humans can make something disappear. Once, northern whites—dim-sighted, clumsy, peaceable, one of two subspecies of white rhinoceros, along with southern whites—roamed over much of East and Central Africa. But they were poached. The rhino's horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, as a cure for fever, gout, snakebites, food poisoning, demonic possession. They grind it or shave it into a powder, drink it with boiling water. In Vietnam they use it to cure hangovers. More recently the horn has become a status symbol, an ostentatious way of possessing what the rest of us could not or would not dare to possess. By the end of the 1970s, some estimates had the northern white population in the wild as low as 15 animals, all clustered in Garamba National Park, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Anti-poaching initiatives brought them back, briefly, before they unraveled due to corrupt government officials, militia groups out of Darfur, and rebel organizations like Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army. The rhinos were trapped there, in the Congo, as humans fought it out. Sometimes their horns helped fund the fighting. By the early 2000s there were only a handful left. The last northern white was sighted in Garamba in 2006. They've now vanished from the wild, and nearly from this planet.      Only three remain. Three. The fourth, Nola, used to live here, right next door to the Frozen Zoo, in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. She died last November, at the advanced age of 41. Four or five decades is about as long as any white rhino lives. The trio are kept in a wildlife preserve in Kenya called Ol Pejeta: Najin, Fatu, and the last male northern white rhino on the face of this Earth, Sudan. The three have failed to reproduce. (They are also, it should be said, related: Najin is Sudan's daughter, Fatu his granddaughter. Incest is their best defense against extinction. Make of that what you will.) Sudan is 43; his sperm count is perilously low. In 2015, doctors determined that neither of the two females was capable of breeding. Maybe the concrete floor of the zoo where they lived before coming to Ol Pejeta wrecked their hips.      Dr. Barbara Durrant, San Diego Zoo Global's director of reproductive physiology, who also works on the Frozen Zoo with Ryder, is attempting an in vitro workaround—northern white sperm and northern white ovarian tissue harvested from the live northern whites, combined into a fertilized embryo, and then re-implanted back into one of the two females. They're practicing on southern whites now. But there is still much that is mysterious about the reproductive cycles of rhinos. “No embryo transfer has ever been attempted in any rhino species,” says Durrant. And time is running out.      They are ghosts. Even now they're disappearing into what's known as the extinction vortex: “the notion,” Ryder explains, “that we have that a population can be doomed but there's still numbers of them around. The numbers get smaller and it becomes a feedback loop. Like water going down a drain: It's deterministic. Or a mass entering a black hole. Once you hit the event horizon, you're out of here.”      The northern whites are out of here.      III. How to Bring Them Back      Let's say in vitro fails. Let's say northern whites have hit the event horizon. This is where the Frozen Zoo really comes in. It begins with cells. You gotta collect them. So, first clean the site: Shave one tiny part of the animal, ideally while it's alive and anesthetized. Next, as Ryder explains, “take sterile tweezers and a sterile scalpel and you take a little piece. It doesn't have to be any bigger than a grain of rice. Then you take that material and you make a cell suspension out of it”—meaning, basically, that you put those cells in flasks, in a broth that's designed to encourage them to multiply. You fill up a flask. And then you divide the suspension in half and put it into two flasks. “One becomes two, two becomes four,” Ryder says. Soon, “we've got enough to freeze eight vials.”      The multiplied cells in the vials are called fibroblasts—the common, connective tissue that makes up all animals, including us. Now, reprogram those cells into what are known as induced pluripotent stem cells. “That means you have taken that cell and kind of turned back time to when it was a stem cell,” Durrant says. “So it can't make everything in the body, but it can make all three of the germ layers that you would see in an early embryo. It can make any of those.”      One of those germ layers is what eventually becomes sperm or eggs. “It's very complicated, every step of the way, and there are many steps,” Durrant says gently, reading the look of total incomprehension on my face. But the gist is: Collect the cell, turn it back into a stem cell, tell that stem cell how and what to become anew. Namely: sperm and eggs.      Finally, the easy part of this whole terribly difficult exercise in playing God: You take those sperm and eggs, combine them, then fertilize and implant the egg into a surrogate—something close to the original, such as a southern white. The southern white gives birth to a northern white. From cells, life. From life, more life. The rhinos wink out. They wink back on.      IV. Life and Death in the Extinction Vortex      The frozen zoo is both a monument to and a counterforce against the extinction vortex. The zoo and its staff are poised at the edge of existence, that shadowy plane where things are sort of alive and sort of dead, where the arrow could point both ways. All the doctors at the zoo have stories about what it's like to labor in this sad zone. What it was like to be there when Nola died, for instance. The northern whites are of particular interest to the Frozen Zoo's researchers. Durrant routinely works with species right on the brink. She is freckled, kind-faced, forthright. “There was a lot of grief” when Nola died, she says.      Her other passion is the Yangtze River giant softshell turtle. Rafetus swinhoei. Only two are known to remain, both at the Suzhou Zoo, both over 100 years old. Durrant is working on getting them to reproduce. “There was an additional male in Vietnam—he just died in the last few months. Unfortunately, no one was allowed to collect sperm from him, so nothing was saved. There was a lot of superstition. As long as that animal was alive, then everything was good in the country. When it died, politically and socially and spiritually things changed. No one there was allowed to actually cut into that animal. No one outside was allowed to do it, and they were not willing to do it themselves because there was a lot of superstition about that. One veterinarian had done something with one of those animals in the past, and within 24 hours he was in a motorcycle accident and lost his hand.”      The turtle lived in a lake. “He was alone, he was revered. He was sacred. It was just out of the question that we would do anything with him. No one was allowed to touch him. Even in death we were not allowed to touch him.”      Durrant knows not everyone shares her love for our animal brethren. “I think people talk about it abstractly, but they're not connected to those animals. They don't feel it the way we do.” But their decline, she says, is “a sign of what's happening. It's going to happen more and more and more.” Species dwindling from 1,000 to 500 to 100 to 10 to 5, circling the beveled edge of the extinction vortex like the northern whites already are. Take a slightly longer view and we might all be poised there. Right on the edge.      I wanted to see what that in-between state looked like: here but already gone. And I wanted to understand the incredible—and incredibly expensive, and debatably worthwhile—human effort to save the rhinos and their endangered peers. Ryder and Durrant's work is controversial. “The Frozen Zoo is basically re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,” the eminent Stanford scientist Paul Ehrlich told The Washington Post last year. Ehrlich's argument—and he is far from alone—is that this is all a waste: all that money and energy and time, to maybe save a handful of animals. Why not redirect those resources to lobbying Congress, or preserving rapidly shrinking habitats?      “I don't see Sudan enjoying life anymore,” James says. “The fact that he's the only one, it's not a lovely life. Knowing you're the last male standing—it's really sad.”      There's a psychological undercurrent to the skepticism, too: If you tell lazy humans that we can just bring these animals back, will anybody work to save them in the first place? No. We'll eat them at twice the rate, grind their bodies into jet fuel so that we might run up a few more frequent-flier miles, and count on science to save us when they're gone. Science is like: Nah, fuck that.      Plus, anyone who studies this stuff seriously knows the godlike feat of de-extinction is only the first step of many. Bring back the dodo and here's what will almost certainly happen next: A human will club that animal right back into extinction. Then build an oil rig on top of its habitat. To truly rescue species from extinction, we need to save not just them but also the conditions that allowed them to live in the first place. We need to give them back the world we're destroying. From this perspective, mankind—greedy, violent, wasteful—needs a reboot just as badly as the northern whites do. More so, even. This is the crux of the anti-Frozen Zoo argument: Shouldn't we fix ourselves before we fix anything else?      I bought a plane ticket, Los Angeles to Amsterdam to Kenya. I wanted to see the rhinos before they went. For what they represented, sure. But also just to see them. To look upon something that will vanish before I will. Tens of thousands of gallons of planet-wrecking, habitat-destroying jet fuel for no better reason than the one I just gave.      Like I said: Mankind. Something broken there.      V. The Last Male Standing      Morning coming on amid the sleepy terminals at Wilson Airport, the equatorial heat drifting in on the breeze. Last night, I came in through Nairobi's other airport, Jomo Kenyatta International, a low-lit smear in the dark. We'd driven through the city, every traffic light switched off. Now in daylight the sky is a marble-like blue-gray. The runway at Wilson is just a few linear rectangles of asphalt, dirt, and grass, swiftly growing faint below the tires of a wobbly twin-prop airplane. Ol Pejeta is north of here, in Nanyuki, up past Nairobi National Park, over the rusted roofs and mud paths of Kenya's most infamous slum, Kibera, and then onward, past where the city gives way to estates with pools and tennis courts, and then to flower farms. Straight toward Mount Kenya, buried beneath an eruption of clouds. The land below green, yellow, and red like a child's place mat.      The northern whites in Ol Pejeta are not native to Kenya. They were brought here from the Dvu˚r Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic—four of them, in 2009—in an effort to get them to reproduce in an environment that resembles the one, evolutionarily speaking, where they're from. This did not happen. One of the four rhinos, Suni, died in 2014, two years after once valiantly managing to mate (alas, to no avail) with Najin, the elder female in the group. His death left Sudan, now 43, as the last male of his kind. Nabire, a female white rhino who remained at Dvu˚r Králové, died in July 2015. A few months later, in San Diego, Nola followed Nabire into the afterlife. Earth's remaining three northern whites are all at Ol Pejeta, waiting to be saved, or to vanish, or both.      The equator bisects the town of Nanyuki. Ol Pejeta is just beyond it, down a rocky, muddy road, past bars and pubs, ice cream shops, cafés, salons, all in the same low shacks. Tim, the chill naturalist and guide who met me at the airport in a battered green jeep, and I bump along, dodging goats and cows, winding among the farms outside the town, the road lined with euphorbia trees and rangy green plants, hedges of low trees bearing orange fruit. At the entrance to Ol Pejeta is a picture of an armed ranger and a sign, now depressingly out-of-date: “Could you be a rhino bodyguard? See what it takes to protect three of the world's last remaining four northern white rhinos.…”      Ol Pejeta is a safari park—wild but also not wild, unless you count Chinese tourists unloading double-barreled Nikons at every passing elephant from the relative safety of a neon green Range Rover. It is startling, frankly, the sheer abundance of animals here: orange antelopes and buffalo gang-tackling one another in patches of water, their horns like hats pushed Leonardo DiCaprio-low on their foreheads. Skinny elephants with manta-ray ears, their hides like topographic maps. Impalas decked out in violet eye shadow. Scruffy, mangy-looking warthogs. Goth ibis. Everything is so green it vibrates. I sort of bliss out for a second, surrounded by that many different living things, then feel guilty, weak, unprofessional for doing so. I'd imagined the northern whites somewhere isolated, remote. Somewhere sacred. Not here, in this stocked pond of semi-artificial abundance, on display for tour groups trying to knock out a complete set of what people kept calling the Big Five—lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, rhinoceros—before lunch.      The rhinos lie beyond a steel fence at the east end of the park, next to quasi-military barracks where their caretakers and security live. One of their keepers, James Mwenda, is waiting for us at the gate. James is young and smiley in the green fatigues of the preserve. He used to be a porter on Mount Kenya, where he discovered that he loved animals. He wanted to help protect them. Now he's here. During the day he looks after the rhinos, and at night he goes out with a rifle on patrol. It's unclear exactly when he sleeps.      The rhinos at Ol Pejeta have armed guards that watch over them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This is a matter of real, bloody necessity. Everywhere at Wilson Airport signs are posted: no ivory on board. hands off our elephants. Poaching—elephant, rhino, anything with ivory or a keratin horn attached—is a scourge in Kenya, even as the animals are respected, revered. They have them on their currency. But they also have a massive organized-crime problem: When the poachers come now, they come armed with helicopters, night-vision goggles, and frighteningly advanced weaponry, largely funded by criminal syndicates. About 30 percent of Africa's elephants were killed between 2007 and 2014 alone.      So James and his co-workers shoot back. “If a poacher comes with an AK-47,” he says in his matter-of-fact way, “let's hope the patroller has a G3 or a machine gun.” A G3, he explains, is the next rifle up, firepower-wise, from the AK-47. Wildlife rangers are not cops; they're not looking to make arrests. Poachers get bailed out; then they jump bail. “If you look at how horrible they kill these animals to get the horn, you have no sympathy,” James says. So wildlife rangers do what they have to do to protect what they're charged with protecting. “If I was given a chance to make a verdict, I would say these people are merciless. They don't deserve any mercy.” That's at night. During the day, around the rhinos, James has a lot of time to think. He has a bond in particular with Sudan. The work is invigorating but also depressing. “I don't see Sudan enjoying life anymore,” he says. “The fact that he's the only one, it's not a lovely life. Knowing you're the last male standing—it's really sad.”      Tim and I stand there at the gate, nodding.      “Want to see him?” James asks.      VI. About the Size of a Volkswagen      The northern whites have 700 acres of their own here. They're fenced in, not just for their own protection but also because they're zoo animals—they would die in the relative wild of Ol Pejeta, with or without human assistance. Sudan, old and decrepit, is separated further: He lives by himself, on 15 acres, so he doesn't get bullied by the other two, or have to walk too far at any given time.      I'm stalling here. How to describe a ghost?      Okay, fine: I will not tell you he was beautiful. The first impression was of a shadow-colored bulldozer, a motorcycle-sized blur looming underneath a tall, long-limbed whistling-thorn acacia tree. Comically attentive Bugs Bunny ears fringed by a light halo of fur. A bump on his neck not unlike the phallic bulge on the cover of Sticky Fingers. Weirdly delicate 1940s starlet eyelashes. He lay with his chin on the ground, staring sadly forward, snot gently pooling out of his nostrils. The overall semblance was of those rocks you encounter in national parks, the ones that some ancient person has carved something into, and now that thing has faded. A message you can't read.      James was motioning Tim and me over to the animal. I was totally unprepared for this. You can actually touch him. He's old, and mostly domesticated. He's indifferent. Blind in one eye. You need to approach from the side on which he can see you, or else risk what's left of his wrath. One at a time, we lay hands on him. Tim and I took turns, and we couldn't stop. He was warm. Huffing and rasping. His skin like bark or Braille. Like mud that'd cracked in the sun. Expanding and contracting.      He struggled and then stood, as Tim and I backed away. Eyed his little corner of habitat: partial roof above, some straw in the corner, a rectangle of muddy water. Then he set out through some acacia trees, walking gingerly. You could hear his old back crack when he leaned down to pull up grass. The sky had turned off-white; we were out among the trees when it began to rain. Sudan turned back toward his home, making his way through the silvery drops. Tim and James and I sprinted back toward the jeep. A bunch of animals all running for shelter.      VII. A Rhino Addresses the Delegates      What gets saved? What deserves to get saved? Even on an ark, the room isn't infinite. “Like, who are we to decide?” Ryder asks one day, back at the Frozen Zoo. “What's the right choice?”      Technology in human hands is the story of unintended consequences. “Do you know this gene-editing technology?” he asks me. You can tweak genes, make them express what you want them to express. “I knew that the Chinese had made many pigs, because pigs are used in a lot of human medical research. If you had a small one, it would save a huge amount of money and make a lot more studies more feasible, basically. So the Chinese developed that. But they found out that there's a market for them in medical research, but there's also a market in them as pets. So they're selling these mini pigs as pets. They say in the future you'll be able to choose their appearance.” For instance: “I imagine in the future it will be possible to have one of these mini pigs that's got a coat color pattern like a cheetah.”      A mini pig dressed as a cheetah! Humans have always done this. Behaved this way. Made nature reflect our needs, our wants, our desires. “There's our dilemma,” says Ryder. “You look at Przewalski's horses, the wild horses, and they're all basically phenotypically uniformed. You look at domestic horses and you've got all these variants—that's because people selected them. People preferred them. People were interested in them. That's what our species does, is experiment.”      Now that we're on the verge of deextinction…what will we do with that power?      “It's about our values, because if we have the capability of being designers, what are the rules? My priority as a conservationist may be one direction, but human society is going to have the potential to do these kinds of things. And will people prefer having a world where they have mini pigs that look like cheetahs to all of the hassles involved in saving these animals?” Ryder genuinely wonders. And our history is not super promising on this score.      At Ol Pejeta, it costs around $10,000 a month to protect the northern whites. Not all the other animals on the preserve. Just the northern whites. Rangers like James going out in the dark every night, risking their lives to defend these animals. Poachers risking their lives, too, for the horns. And for what? A northern white is nearly identical to a southern white. “All the money we spent on protecting the northern white rhino, millions and millions of dollars, and at the end of the day, 20 years from now, you could put southern white rhinos in there and you would never notice the difference,” John Lukas, the president of the International Rhino Foundation, told author Irus Braverman in 2013. Now, standing in the shadow of their own demise, the three remaining northern whites mill about Ol Pejeta as the preserve plays host to scientists who show up and disagree about who will do what—will it be scientists from the Czech Republic or Africa or Germany or California who attempt the cloning or in vitro fertilization that might save them? Where will that attempt even take place?      The arguments go on. The rhinos go deeper into the veil. And the world they might someday re-occupy closes in on them: habitat gone, horns trafficked, fellow animals—Asian elephants and Indochinese leopards, eastern monarch butterflies and Panamanian golden frogs—following right behind them into the extinction vortex. The best-case scenario for the northern whites: survival as a living museum piece. The worst: survival as a museum piece that might someday live again. The gap between those outcomes is barely even a gap.      Most of us are ruthlessly indifferent. Some of us are ugly and blind in one eye. We live, all of us, decimated by loss. And all of us deserve to survive.      And yet they're still here, the rhinos. They're alive. I resolved not to be sentimental. The last thing the world needs is another magazine journalist parachuting in, spending two days on a game preserve, and coming back waxing emotional about what is basically three tons of mobile Silly Putty. But without getting too anthropomorphic with it: They are blameless. To be a human in front of a northern white is to be a representative of the force that is now ushering them out of existence. You just want to disembowel yourself in their presence. Sudan, Najin, Fatu: They're here and already gone. Shadows on a plain. I said I wouldn't say it, but: They were beautiful. They are beautiful.      And we can bring them back. If we want to, if it makes sense, with just another handful of scientific breakthroughs, they will live again. Resurrection! It's unreal but it's about to be real. What a degenerate, terrible species we are. But also: Look at what we're capable of! The same brutal, merciless ingenuity that we bring to ruining the world is the exact same ingenuity applied by the scientists working at the Frozen Zoo and elsewhere, poised at the horizon of existence, willfully pulling our animal brethren back from the edge. And maybe pushing us back from the brink, too. Playing with cellular matter so that it might again become life. Building an ark to save what we can't or won't. Most of us are ruthlessly indifferent. Some of us are ugly and blind in one eye. We live, all of us, decimated by loss. And all of us deserve to survive.      Well, most of us, anyway. Maybe. I get sentimental. A funny thing that happens around the folks at the Frozen Zoo—they make you feel optimistic just by the fact of their existence. So optimistic that sometimes you fail to listen. Talk to them about magic and they'll talk to you about reality. One animal rescued does not add up to a species saved. An ark is useless until it has a place to make landfall. “Saving cells isn't saving species,” Ryder tells me. “Saving DNA isn't saving species. Nobody said it was.”      The irony is not lost on them—that their great effort to conserve these animals and their DNA is insignificant next to our greater, albeit unintentional, effort to destroy them. Science is hard; people make it harder. “Unfortunately, people are always going to take precedence and people are going to protect themselves and their livelihoods,” Durrant says. Even in her own profession, “there are some people in the game who are doing this out of pure scientific curiosity and the intellectual challenge. There are some people who are doing it because they think if they can make one of these extinct animals they'll be famous and rich. Some people who, once they made one, they'd be done and move on to something else. And then what? What happens to that animal?”      The answer to that question can be found, for better or for worse, at Ol Pejeta. Twice during my visit there, James, the northern white rhino keeper, described the same scenario to me, something he's begun to imagine: What would happen if Sudan, the mournful last male of his kind, were somehow able to talk. If he were given a podium—at the U.N., say. All the delegates from all the various corrupt populations of man gathered around. “What's the best stadium?” James asked me.      Madison Square Garden.      “Okay, Madison Square Garden.” Sudan steps to the microphone. “And the audio is so good. I've always tried to write down what the speech would be. At times he would sob, cry, break down, knowing he's going to die. How would you be behaving knowing you're going die? Knowing you're the last one? Maybe you'd drown yourself in wine, in woman—Sudan can't speak, he's an animal, but it's so sad. His cousins, brothers, and sisters have been killed in this search for rhino horn.”      James said he figures if Sudan were actually given that podium, and the means to speak, it's pretty obvious what he would do: “He would curse the human generation.” ||||| Nola, a 40-year-old northern white rhino, is only one of five remaining examples of the species. She lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park near Escondido, Calif. (Lenny Ignelzi /AP)      Whenever an endangered animal dies at the San Diego Zoo, researchers race out, regardless of the hour, to remove its sperm or eggs, maybe a bit of ear or eyeball, and carefully freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen.      Today, the survival of the northern white rhinoceros and dozens of other species could hinge on the collection amassed over nearly 40 years that has become the largest gene bank of its kind: the Frozen Zoo. The icy vials may someday even be used in experiments to resurrect recently extinct animals such as the Hawaiian po’ouli bird.      The stainless-steel tanks hold the genetic material of more than 10,000 individual animals from more than 1,000 species and subspecies.      The Frozen Zoo’s work has taken on renewed urgency since the San Diego Zoo Safari Park lost 42-year-old Angalifu to cancer in December, leaving only five northern white rhinos in the world — and all unable to reproduce.      Scientists are racing to find the best way to utilize the bank’s frozen sperm to produce another one before the northern white goes extinct, which could happen within a decade.      Barbara Durant of the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research removes vials of frozen cells from a stainless-steel container cooled with liquid nitrogen. (Lenny Ignelzi /AP)      Critics question whether it’s worth spending millions of dollars on species that are down to so few.      The bank is valued as a genetic archive that has helped advance artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, cloning and stem cell technology. But debate is stirring over how far such research should go.      “The Frozen Zoo is basically rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,” said Paul Ehrlich, a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University.      He noted the world needs to address the problem’s root causes, such as population growth and climate change.      “Screwing around with science to save a white rhino might be fun and I would like to see it preserved and am all for biodiversity, but it’s so far down the list of things we should be doing first,” he said.      With species going extinct at a faster rate, zoos are taking on greater conservation roles and facing decisions about which animals are worth efforts to save. Some may be extinct by the time another one is reproduced and possibly never live in the wild.      The northern white’s natural habitat is in such war-torn countries as Sudan and Congo, which have been unable to stop poachers. The horn is coveted in Asia as an aphrodisiac, creating a market that threatens all rhino species.      There’s also the hurdle of producing enough offspring to avoid inbreeding.      “We can do all kinds of razzle-dazzle things, but it’s one thing to make another animal or two or three, but it’s quite another to make a sustainable population from a genetic standpoint,” said George Seidel, a Colorado State University professor who has written about resurrecting the woolly mammoth.      The challenges, however, are not insurmountable for critically endangered species or possibly recently extinct species, said Barbara Durrant, director of reproductive physiology at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, which houses the Frozen Zoo.      “We’re not so much interested in bringing back dinosaurs or mammoths,” she said. “There’s really no place for them now.”      The Frozen Zoo holds the cell cultures from 12 northern white rhinos — more than the living population: “There have been other species that have come back from numbers that small, so we think there is good reason we can do this with the northern white rhino,” she said.      Sperm from the Frozen Zoo has been used in artificial insemination to reproduce endangered animals from the giant panda to the Chinese monal pheasant. Its frozen cells also were used to clone two endangered types of cattle. The gaur lived only a few days, while the banteng survived for seven years before being put down after breaking a leg. Both animals, however, had genetic defects.      The northern white rhino and the drill monkey were the first endangered animals to have their cells transformed into stem cells and stored at the Frozen Zoo.      Theoretically, stem cells can produce any body tissue. That means thawed stem cells from a male rhino could produce both sperm and egg in the lab, but the method has been done only once — in a mouse.      Artificial insemination has seen success in producing other rhino species. Northern white rhino semen could be used to impregnate the closely related southern white to make a hybrid.      Scientists are also looking at in vitro fertilization, but that technique has never been done on any rhino species.      On a recent day, the only northern white left in the United States, 40-year-old Nola, munched on apples at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. When she dies, there is talk of placing her in the Smithsonian so future generations can see a northern white rhino. |||||	– Inside the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research a few miles outside the city, in an unassuming building that smells like cleaning supplies, is the Frozen Zoo. It's an ark, really—"an ark in a freezer!" as Zach Baron writes in a feature article for GQ—comprising 10,000 samples that represent roughly 1,000 species and sub-species. It's something to hold onto as our planet loses everything from "vital little soldiers like bees" to the "big charismatic mega-fauna like elephants." And what a sweet irony, if a man-made creation like a freezer of vials turns out to restore some of the man-made catastrophes of modern time, from over-hunting to pollution to climate change. Some of the animals in the Frozen Zoo still roam the Earth, while others, like the Hawaiian bird po'ouli, are already extinct, and still more are inching ever closer toward extinction. Baron reports that the "ark" is part museum, to catalog the diversity of life on our planet, and part resource for those who need samples for research. But a third reason quietly lives on, too: reanimation, or the possibility therein. The technology already exists, for example, to clone. Technological advances suggest that there is at least the possibility to someday renew lost ecosystems. Some notable scientists call it "rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic," as Paul Ehrlich told the Washington Post last year. Saving cells isn't, after all, saving species. Yet. (A quarter of all mammals are now at risk of extinction.)
summarize: Facebook has taken down 652 pages, accounts and groups it identified as part of coordinated disinformation campaigns that originated in Iran and targeted countries around the world. It also found a number of new pages connected to Russia.      The Iran-linked pages and groups spread misinformation in the United States, United Kingdom, Latin America and the Middle East. Some of them posed as a group called "Liberty Front Press."      Facebook (FB) said the coordinated campaigns originating in Iran included 254 Facebook pages and 116 Instagram accounts that amassed more than 1 million followers across the two services. Those behind the pages spent more than $12,000 on advertisements between 2012 and 2017, the company said.      Facebook, Twitter (TWTR) and other social media companies have been scrambling to protect their platforms ahead of the US midterm elections in November and prevent a repeat of the widespread disinformation seen during the 2016 presidential campaign.      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's attempts to identify fake pages, groups and accounts are making the social network safer.      "While it's still early, we're starting to see it pay off and we're identifying more of this before the election," he said on a call with reporters.      In a related development, Twitter announced on Tuesday that it has identified and removed 284 accounts, many of which it linked to Iran, for "coordinated manipulation." The company said it is working with law enforcement and other tech firms.      The announcements underscore just how aggressively foreign actors are still seeking to covertly influence political conversations in countries around the world. Facebook's revelation came after Microsoft (MSFT) took control of websites it said Russian military intelligence could have tried to use to hack American politicians.      Facebook made the announcement Tuesday evening. The company said it had taken action after discovering "coordinated inauthentic behavior" by actors seeking to "mislead others about who they were and what they were doing."      One part of the Liberty Front Press network claimed to be an independent Iranian media organization but was in fact linked to Press TV, a news network affiliated with Iranian state media, Facebook said.      Some of the pages were identified by Facebook after a tip from cybersecurity firm FireEye.      "This influence operation linked to Iran aims to promote political narratives in line with Iranian interests, including anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes," FireEye analyst Lee Foster said. "The activity we have uncovered is significant and demonstrates that actors beyond Russia continue to engage in online, social media-driven influence operations as a means of shaping political discourse."      FireEye noted that the Iran-linked activity it uncovered "does not appear to have been designed as a dedicated attempt to influence the 2018 US midterm elections."      "This does not preclude such attempts being made, however, and the recent reorientation of some social media accounts to adopting left-leaning identities may indicate an opportunistic shift toward a more elaborate effort to influence US domestic political discourse," it added.      Some of the content Facebook removed could be traced to groups previously connected to the GRU, Russia's primary military intelligence agency. Special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 members of the GRU last month, accusing them of hacking the US Democratic Party.      Facebook said that the latest Russian accounts, groups and pages it took down were not related to the ones originating in Iran, and that they did not appear to have targeted the United States. "This more recent activity focused on politics in Syria and Ukraine," it said.      Facebook is working with US law enforcement in an ongoing investigation. It said it has been following suspect pages for months.      Using clues like website registrations and IP addresses, Facebook connected Liberty Front Press pages to Iranian state media. The first Liberty Front Press accounts Facebook found were created in 2013.      Another set of suspicious accounts and pages that originated in Iran could be traced to 2011.      The announcement comes amid Facebook's attempts to prevent a repeat of 2016, when the platform was peppered with accounts connected to a Kremlin-linked troll group posing as Americans. It removed more than 30 pages last month that it said were part of a coordinated campaign to post "misleading" information. Facebook told lawmakers it suspected a Russian group was behind the accounts, which were involved in organizing political events in the United States.      Tuesday's revelations show the problem goes beyond Russia.      "I've been saying for months that there's no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt," said Senator Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. "We also learned today that the Iranians are now following the Kremlin's playbook from 2016." ||||| The new influence campaigns on Facebook follow a report from Microsoft earlier on Tuesday, in which it said it found and seized websites that were recently created by hackers linked to a Russian military intelligence unit. The fake websites were part of an effort to attack conservative think tanks in the United States.      On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been grappling with mounting evidence from social media and American intelligence that sanctions and other deterrence measures have failed to curb Russia’s activity. They signaled on Tuesday that they intended to move forward with developing punishing new sanctions in the coming weeks. It was unclear if they could enact any such legislation before November, but their deliberations in a series of hearings were meant to send a signal to Moscow to desist.      Facebook said on Tuesday that it had identified some of the new influence operations last month after a tip from FireEye about a network of Facebook pages called “Liberty Front Press.”      After Facebook investigated those pages, it said it linked them back to Iranian state media using their website registration information and internet protocol addresses. Some of the pages were created in 2013, the company said, and they posted political content focused on the Middle East, Latin America, Britain and the United States.      Other fake pages also had a far more international bent than the earlier batches uncovered by the social media company. The pages believed to have originated in Iran were written in several languages, including English, Arabic and Farsi. They carried a number of pro-Iranian themes, as well as language attacking Israel and promoting Palestinians. Some included anti-Trump language and were tied to relations between the United States and Iran, including references to the Iranian nuclear weapons deal.      Newer accounts, created in 2016 and later, had additional goals, including spreading malware and stealing passwords, Facebook said. The accounts that originated in Russia focused on activity in Ukraine and Syria. They did not appear to target the United States. In Syria, the accounts promoted a pro-Russian agenda and that of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad.      “For example, they are associated with Inside Syria Media Center, which the Atlantic Council and other organizations have identified for covertly spreading pro-Russian and pro-Assad content,” Facebook said in a blog post. ||||| Working with our industry peers today, we have suspended 284 accounts from Twitter for engaging in coordinated manipulation. Based on our existing analysis, it appears many of these accounts originated from Iran. |||||	– Social media platforms have been battening down the hatches against disinformation campaigns, and Facebook just made a new dent. The site announced Tuesday it had yanked 652 pages or groups off Facebook and Instagram showing "coordinated inauthentic behavior" by those seeking to "mislead others about who they were and what they were doing," CNN reports. Per the New York Times, Facebook said the activity (some stretching back to 2011) originated out of Iran and Russia, and that the disinformation this time went after marks in the UK, Latin America, and the Middle East, in addition to US targets. Twitter also announced Tuesday it has shut down nearly 300 of its own bad actors tied to "coordinated manipulation" that originated in Iran. One group that emerged was Liberty Front Press, which was tied to Iranian state media, per Facebook. "We … learned today that the Iranians are now following the Kremlin's playbook from 2016," Sen. Mark Warner tells CNN. YouTube says it has also taken down a Liberty Front Press channel for breaching community guidelines, though it didn't elaborate. This all went down in the same week Microsoft said it found attempts by Russian hackers to infiltrate US political groups, all bent on "disrupting democracy," per Microsoft President Brad Smith. Cybersecurity firm FireEye, which assisted Facebook in identifying the disinformation-spewing pages, says the propaganda geared toward the US wasn't meant specifically to target the midterms. "Our adversaries are sophisticated and well-funded," Mark Zuckerberg told reporters in a call Tuesday, but he insists the company's "proactive" efforts will "make Facebook safer over time," per the Washington Post.
