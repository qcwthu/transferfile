Almost 40 years ago, the 20th century's most influential sub-culture was born. Today, hip hop is a way of life that dominates fashion, music, art, dance and advertizing. It is a far cry from the humble beginnings of experimental rap, graffiti, and break-dancing in the run-down areas of 1970s New York City, which sparked a revolution. Watching from the sidelines were photographers Janette Beckman, Joe Conzo and Martha Cooper. And now, their glimpses inside the seminal years between 1977 and 1990 will be put on show at the Museum Of The City Of New York.

(CNN)For over two decades, bassist Mike Porcaro was a rock star with the band Toto, playing venues around the world. Now, the music world is mourning the death of Porcaro, who died after a battle with Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. He was 59. "Our brother Mike passed away peacefully in his sleep at 12:04 AM last night at home surrounded by his family," Porcaro's brother Steve, the band's keyboardist, posted on Facebook on Sunday. "Rest in peace, my brother," About 10 years ago, Porcaro started noticing weakness in his fingers and hands. He was diagnosed with the disease in 2006. Former members of his band -- known for hits such as "Africa" and "Rosanna" -- rallied to help. They reunited for a brief European tour in 2010 in support of Porcaro. Toto vocalist and guitarist Steve Lukather also called Porcaro a brother. "My brother Mike Porcaro is now now at peace," he tweeted. "I will miss him more than I could ever put into words. My deepest love to the family. God Bless" ALS is a fast-moving, usually fatal disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It affects more than 30,000 people at any given time.

Resigned: Afzal Amin was exposed after plotting with far-Right extremists to stir up racial hatred . The Tory Election candidate exposed for plotting with far-Right extremists to stir up racial hatred is a former member of a fanatical Islamic sect that believes the Nazis were misunderstood and that Jews control the world. Afzal Amin, who resigned after The Mail on Sunday published undercover recordings of him meeting the English Defence League, joined the Birmingham wing of the Murabitun, a fundamentalist cult which questioned the Holocaust and praised Hitler. In 1992 when Amin was 18, he left the group, founded by Scottish hippy Ian Dallas, after becoming disillusioned. Two years later, a book crediting him as author Raja Afzal Raza Amin al-Quraishy, was published in which he criticised the Murabitun and called for jihadi warriors to establish a Muslim state in Europe. Amin says his words were doctored to include the extremist views, which he yesterday described as ‘disgusting’. In the pamphlet Amin – described last week by a colleague as a ‘Walter Mitty character’ – demeans women and calls for restaurants that serve alcohol to be burned. The book, which is entitled Ian Dallas: The Shaykh Who Has No Clothes, criticised the group for not being radical enough. It states: ‘My troubles with the Birmingham community began when I realised that we were all illiterate, in Shar’iah terms, ignorant, and nobody had a plan to take the city in which we lived. ‘My pushing for study of the Shar’iah and a militant Islam resulted in my expulsion to Slough. ‘Those of us in the cities of Europe need to free ourselves economically from kafir [unbeliever] institutions, state and private, by creating our own arenas of trade, with Islamic coinage… and the building of independent villages for Muslims, from where the mujahidun [jihad warriors] can burst out and conquer lands establishing Dar ul-Islam [a Muslim region]. Scroll down for video . Extracts: Passages from the pamphlet credited to Afzal Amin . ‘May Allah bless the men currently engaged in military conflict against the kuffar [unbeliever] and may He assist us in preparing the liberation of the Muslims wherever we are.’ Recounting the tale of another Muslim, a passage in the book says that he ‘as any man would, refused to be taught the “methodology of jihad” by a female. You see nobody can be strengthened by somebody that is weaker.’ Discussing Indian restaurants which sell alcohol, he says: ‘My complaint is primarily with the hypocrisy of a group of people who claim to be the “cutting edge” of Islam, yet instead of burning the alcohol-selling restaurants are accepting…’ Last week, former student Abu Abdullah, who said he met Amin while studying at the School of African and Oriental Studies in London, claims Amin proudly gave him a copy of the pamphlet in 1998. Afzal Amin resigned after The Mail on Sunday published undercover recordings of him. Pictured: The Mail on Sunday's front page last week . He said: ‘We were shocked when we saw what he had written and asked him to move out.’ Amin said yesterday: ‘This work is not a book, it is merely stapled photocopied pages. It has been the subject of legal action and any suggestion that I share these views is defamatory. My rights were infringed by the author. ‘When I was 19 years old I was asked by a former member of the group to send him my account of the few months I spent with them. ‘He has inserted phrases throughout which are not my words and the last few paragraphs are a complete fabrication. I have been actively opposing such extreme and rejectionist views my whole life.’ Amin, 40, was exposed for hatching a plot with the EDL to announce a demonstration in his Dudley North constituency which would then be cancelled, allowing him to claim credit for brokering peace. A Muslim campaigner claims Amin asked him to publicly attack his military career to make him more appealing to working-class white voters. Asghar Bukhari, founding member of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, said: ‘He thought it would help distance him from Muslims and get white people to support him.’ Amin responded: ‘If I have met him I do not recall doing so.’ AND... He hinted at Westminster deal for lobbyist . Amin wanted cash in exchange for helping clients once elected, it is claimed. Financial services lobbyist Simon Gentry said Amin told him he would ‘take care of his clients’ and be ‘a friend in the House’. Mr Gentry added: ‘He worded it in a way that sounded financially beneficial to him.’ Amin said: ‘No such discussion took place.’ AND... He 'was always abroad' Amin preferred going abroad to canvassing, according to Anne Millward, of Dudley North Tory Association. She said: ‘He was often disappearing on trips to Dubai and Somalia.’ Amin said: ‘Performance issues should be referred to the party.’ So why DID the Tories let him stand for a seat? Serious questions were raised last night over the vetting process which put Afzal Amin on Tory Central Office’s ‘approved list’ of candidates. Calls for a review came from the leader of his local constituency association, who said Dudley North had been saddled with a ‘complete maverick’. Influence: Amin Afzal with former Tory chairman Baroness Warsi . Anne Millward said: ‘On paper, Afzal Amin was a very good candidate when he was selected in 2013, but I think the whole process needs to be thoroughly looked at after this Election. ‘If someone is on the list, you would have thought that they’d have been thoroughly vetted by Central Office and they’d be there on merit, but you then find you’ve got a complete maverick who doesn’t want to do what he’s told or toe the party line.’ Of Mr Amin’s explanation about the fake EDL march idea – comparing it to ‘negotiations with the Taliban’ – Mrs Millward added: ‘This is not Kandahar. It’s Dudley North.’ Meanwhile, Paul Goodman, editor of the Conservative Home website for grassroots members, said a long and highly critical comment about Amin’s military career – describing him as ‘a fantasist with questionable integrity’ – was posted at the end of an article Amin wrote 16 weeks ago, but was not followed up. ‘I’m sure plenty of senior people in the party would have seen it,’ said former MP Mr Goodman. ‘You might have thought it would ring alarm bells.’	Tory Election candidate was exposed for plotting with far-Right extremists .

Manu Tuilagi is a major doubt for the World Cup after it emerged the England and Leicester star is unlikely to play again this season. The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster’s team-sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘Manu is improving but it is a long process. The likelihood is, he may not play this season. He may or may not play this season.’ England coach Stuart Lancaster (left) has been hit by the news Manu Tuilagi could miss the World Cup . Tuilagi (centre) has a groin injury that could rule him out of England's tournament in September . Fears that Tuilagi's groin injury is worse than first feared were confirmed by his club Leicester . The 23-year-old, who Mailsport understands is suffering from the notoriously troublesome condition known as ‘Gilmore’s Groin’, is now likely to have just three warm-up matches this summer to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup, which kicks off on September 18. Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on. In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations. Tuilagi is considered one of the first names on the England team-sheet when he is fit to play . Tuilagi will try to be fit for the start of England's World Cup campaign, which begins on September 18 . Tuilagi (right) missed the whole of England's Six Nations campaign due to injury . As it transpired, he played no role in tournament, although he did spend time with England’s medical team and remains a valued member of the squad. But serious questions will now be asked about the management of his injury after surgery was delayed in a bid to get him fit. England had better news last night when Saracens confirmed injured duo Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt as expected to return in the next two to three weeks.

It has been a bittersweet week for Kristin Scott Thomas. On Thursday the acclaimed actress was at Buckingham Palace to receive her Damehood from the Queen, a reward for a lifetime of achievement – and almost a dress rehearsal for her new West End role playing the Monarch in The Audience. But her delight at the presentation must have involved a moment of quiet reflection, too. For last week was also the anniversary of the death of her father, taken from her in a dramatic fighter plane accident almost half a century ago on March 17, 1966. She was just five. Dame Kristin, 54 – nominated for an Oscar for her mesmerising role in The English Patient – has said little about the loss in public, but recalled that ‘Mummy was pregnant at the time and I can remember when she told us. In one breath it was, “Daddy has had an accident and won’t be coming home and I’m going to have a baby.” So it sort of took the sting out of it’. The exact details of his crash, however, have remained shrouded in secrecy – like so much else associated with the Cold War – until now, thanks to the release of a recently declassified air investigation report. Heartbreaking: Dame Kristin Scott Thomas was only five when her father was killed in a dramatic fighter plane accident . It reveals that Lieutenant Commander Simon Thomas was flying a Sea Vixen jet when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the Dorset coast. He was taking part in a training exercise for a type of mission that has since been described as ‘perhaps the most stupid, and potentially suicidal attacks ever invented’. The Sea Vixen was in the vanguard of a new generation of high-speed jets that relied on swept wings and two Rolls-Royce engines to achieve near-supersonic speed. They were designed for aircraft carriers for night-time flying and one of their tasks would be to attack Soviet ships in the event of a war. Astonishingly, of the 145 Sea Vixens built, 54 were lost in accidents and 55 crew members killed during the 13 years of frontline service with the Fleet Air Arm from 1959 to 1972. This was a worse rate of attrition than the notorious F-104 Starfighter, which became known as the ‘Widowmaker’ in Cold War West Germany because 30 per cent were lost to accidents. Lieut Cmdr Thomas, the report reveals, was the designated leader when he and three other Sea Vixen pilots lined up on the runway on the night of March 17. They were tasked with taking off from air base HMS Heron, in Yeovilton, Somerset, and attacking a target being pulled by a frigate, HMS Zulu, off Portland in Dorset. Horrific: Lieutenant Commander Simon Thomas was killed during a dangerous night-time training mission . With classic military understatement the report states that they faced ‘unpleasant conditions’, which included poor visibility, fog patches and a pitch black night. Furthermore, it was believed to have been Thomas’s first attempt at firing Glow Worm flares since he had returned to frontline duties after working as a Vixen flying instructor. The notorious flares were designed to illuminate the target prior to attack but had already been involved in a succession of accidents. As the leader, Thomas was expected to fire off the flares above the frigate so that they would illuminate the target in silhouette. The following three Sea Vixens were then tasked with attacking the dummy ship in quick succession before the leader himself would launch the final attack. All four were supposed to roll into a dive before firing off their rockets at the target at a pre-ordained angle and altitude. However, the training mission was dogged with bad luck from the outset, with one of the Sea Vixens failing to make it off the runway. The three others took off and assumed the attack formation, with Thomas in the lead, to a point 20 miles south of HMS Zulu. But then Vixen No 2 lost his radar and, after trying to maintain his position, was instructed by Thomas to return to base. This meant that No 3 assumed the No 2 position and the two remaining Vixens turned to prepare for the attack. On their first run, Thomas failed to fire the flares. Both planes turned round for a second run, but the new No 2 struggled to maintain position. By the time they were in position for a second strike, the crew of No 2 suddenly realised that HMS Zulu had changed its orientation and was now directly behind the target as they approached it. Worried their missiles could hit the frigate instead of the target it was towing, they aborted the attack for safety reasons. The report adds that the crew of No 2 heard Thomas call ‘turning in’ in preparation for his attack and ‘some five to ten seconds [later] the pilot noticed a flash’. Zulu’s crew also saw an explosion, which turned out to be Lieut Cmdr Thomas’s aircraft hitting the water and exploding. Thomas was killed instantly and his co-pilot, Lieutenant John Harvey, was listed as missing. Dame Kristin, born in Cornwall in 1960, later said that after the news of her father’s death ‘we went down to school and everybody had to be nice to us and we didn’t really understand why. Kids are so resilient. It’s only later that you realise what a terrible shock it was. I can still remember him. It’s like having a little film playing in your head. I can still remember his smell, it’s really weird. The thing that breaks my heart is the smell of engine oil’. Indeed, she has been doubly unfortunate. Kristin’s widowed mother went on to marry another Fleet Air Arm pilot, Simon Idiens, who died in another air accident in 1972. Lieutenant Commander Thomas was flying a Sea Vixen jet (pictured) when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the Dorset coast . Author Tony Buttler, in his book about the Sea Vixen, branded the Glow Worm manoeuvre, for which Lieut Cmdr Thomas was practising, ‘perhaps the most stupid, and potentially suicidal attack ever invented. Once the leader had fired the flares he had to bank left hard, climb to 4,000ft, come up behind the fourth Sea Vixen, a complex manoeuvre complicated further by the fact he had to switch on his weapons panel, which meant switching hands on the control stick, while turning his head to locate the weapons switch’. All of this was happening while the jet was maintaining a steep bank climb and the pilot was subjected to considerable G-forces. It was a recipe for disorientation and disaster. The conclusion to the MoD report offers little solace, indirectly blaming HMS Zulu and the exercise. Sir Mark Thomson, a former Sea Vixen pilot, said: ‘When you are flying at night there is no horizon. You have disorientation in relation to the ground or surface, where the ship is. You have the disorientation in relation to where the other planes are as you look in and out of the cockpit. ‘You are also looking for the weapons switch on your right side and if you are flying with your right hand you either switch hands or reach over with your left hand. ‘I can see Simon now. He was absolutely magical, the most wonderful and enchanting guy. There was no better-looking couple and while I can see Deborah in Kristin, Kristin also looks just like her father. ‘She has that classic English look with those high cheekbones. Simon and Deborah had star quality. Life can be so cruel, especially to Deborah. She even had a boyfriend between the two Simons and he was also killed in a flying accident.’	Kristin Scott Thomas's father died in a dramatic fighter plane accident .

A deaf woman claims she was ridiculed by post office staff who told her to ‘get an interpreter’ before asking her to leave the building. The 38-year-old was showing her eight-year-old son how to ship a package during a visit to the Port Orange Post Office in Volusia County, Florida. But after explaining she was deaf, she said one worker refused to communicate with her through written notes. A deaf woman claims she was told to 'get and interpreter' by staff at Port Orange Post Office (pictured) in Florida . The woman, who does not want to be named, said the female member of staff ‘started kind of making fun of me and pointing to the paper’. The situation escalated and a male supervisor was called over who initially also refused to communicate in writing, she said. Wftv quotes the Minnesota resident as saying: ‘I said to him, “You know, this is illegal. You can’t refuse to serve a deaf person at the post office. This is a federal government building.” And that’s when he wrote the note.’ She said that the man then wrote down a message on a piece of paper saying: ‘Call your congressman, who do not (sic) have to write down for you. It’s not the law. Get an interpreter.’ According to Wftv, she said: ‘At that point, he started treating us like we were dogs, literally just motioning at us like we were dogs, like we needed to get out of here.’ She woman that a supervisor then wrote down a message (pictured) on a piece of paper saying: ‘Call your congressman, who do not (sic) have to write down for you. It’s not the law. Get an interpreter.’ A United States Postal Service spokesman told the News Journal that it ‘extends its sincere apologies’ to the customer. The spokesman added: ‘Our expectation is that all customers will be treated with dignity and respect and receive courteous and helpful service from our employees. ‘Some situations present special challenges, such as language barriers, hearing and visual impairments, as well as others. ‘We always strive to meet the needs of the customers in all situations and deeply regret when we do not live up to that expectation.’ The spokesman said that it would take ‘swift remedial actions’ to address the incident.

Scotland newcomer Matt Ritchie has revealed he thought he was the victim of a prank when Gordon Strachan first rang him about a call-up. The Bournemouth winger was the surprise name in the 26-man pool announced on Monday for the forthcoming friendly against Northern Ireland and Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar. Ritchie was born in the Hampshire town of Gosport but qualifies for Scotland through his father Alex. Matt Ritchie, pictured celebrating against Derby County last month, has been named in the Scotland squad . Ritchie, who has scored 11 goals for Bournemouth this season, thought he was the victim of a prank call . The 25-year-old admits he has never actually been north of the border but – once he had recovered from his initial shock - convinced Strachan he was passionate about wearing a dark blue jersey. ‘I had a call a couple of weeks ago from the manager,’ said Ritchie. ‘That was a massive surprise and at first I thought it was a prank call. ‘I’m absolutely delighted to be involved and it’s a proud moment for me and my family. ‘To be involved with a national football team is a great achievement and a dream come true as a young footballer.’ Ritchie – who has scored 11 goals for the Championship leaders this season - also explained the background that made him eligible to be Strachan’s latest recruit. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe recently handed Ritchie (centre) a new three-year contract . Scotland manager Gordon Strachan, pictured on Monday, rates Ritchie highly . ‘My dad was born in Edinburgh and so were my grandparents,’ he said. ‘My granddad was in the Royal Navy and they moved to England after he had been posted to Portsmouth, which is where I grew up. ‘I’ve still got relatives in Scotland but my aunties and uncles always seem to come down here to see my nan and granddad so I haven’t actually been to Scotland. But I’ve got family there and I’m sure they will come to the games if I’m involved. ‘My dad is over the moon. Hopefully he’ll be able to come to the games and watch me if I’m involved.’ Ritchie revealed his dad is 'over the moon' Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe recently handed Ritchie a new three-year contract and believes his record in terms of both goals and assists make him a genuine international contender. ‘We were aware that Gordon (Strachan) rates Matt highly,’ said Howe. ‘I’m really pleased for him because he has been consistent for us for a long time now. ‘There are only a few goal scorers and goal creators around and I think he deserves his call-up. It’s a good moment for him.’ Recent Celtic recruits Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were notable omissions from Strachan’s squad, with both having impressed since their January moves from Dundee United. The Scotland boss, though, seemed to suggest the pair were simply carrying on at the same level they had been performing at while at Tannadice, asking: ‘Have they kicked on? Or are they the same players they were five or six months ago?’ But Celtic assistant manager John Collins admitted he thought they had done enough to earn a place in the squad, saying: ‘I have got to be honest, I am surprised that they were not called up. ‘They have done very well for us but the their time will come. They are young players and I have no doubt they will get themselves into Scotland squads of the future. ‘In the six or seven weeks they have been here, their performances out on the pitch and in training have been excellent. ‘They have lots of talent and are only going to get better with age. ‘Gordon has got lots of good players to pick from and it’s a tough job. But their time will come.’	Matt Ritchie was named in Scotland's 26-man squad announced on Monday . He was born in Hampshire town of Gosport but qualifies through his dad .

Chief Constable Chris Sims said officers would 'not be as visible on the streets,' in the future . Crime victims face having to report offences online then track the progress of investigations ‘like a parcel’ under plans by Britain’s second biggest police force to marginalise bobbies on the beat. Theft, assault and criminal damage victims are among those who will be expected to upload their own evidence in the ‘self-service’ reporting system, instead of liaising with an officer face-to-face or by phone. As well as supplying pictures of stolen phones or cars, victims will be asked to file crime reports to the web-based portal in plans that will also see the loss of 2,500 staff. The ‘virtual policing’ plans, unveiled in a five-year blueprint by West Midlands Police, were condemned by crime victims. Tariq Jahan, whose son Haroon, 20, was one of three men killed protecting homes in the 2011 summer riots in Birmingham, said the plans ‘didn’t inspire confidence’. Mr Jahan, from West Bromwich, said: ‘For a victim of crime, one-to-one interaction with a human is important.’ He added that many elderly people would have difficulties with the new system. Birmingham lawyer Dean Parnell, who had to track down and recover his stolen iPad in 2013 because officers were too busy to attend, said ‘a faceless online service... could lead to important evidence being missed’. The force also wants to encourage witnesses to supply images or video footage of incidents such as street thefts or assaults. Its new operating model will see neighbourhood officers deployed into specific areas, instead of across the force patch, leaving middle class areas where crime is less of an issue without a significant uniform presence. The force said the changes were needed as part of cuts aimed at saving £130million over the next four years. Chief Constable Chris Sims admitted that officers would ‘not be as visible on the streets’ in future, as the force looked to achieve ‘greater efficiency’. West Midlands Police have unveiled a five year blueprint for 'virtual policing' plans. Pictured: West Midlands Police headquarters . Beat bobbies will be cut or reassigned, with the ten neighbourhood policing units replaced by smaller teams targeting areas where a police presence is most needed. The plans will see the Birmingham-based constabulary shrink to its smallest size since it was established in 1974. The force wants to encourage online reporting of all but the most serious offences. David Jamieson, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ‘We hope that by the end of this year you will be able to log in and watch the progress of an investigation in the same way that you can track a parcel.’	West Midlands Police unveil 'virtual policing' plan for the next five years .

This is the shocking moment a waterspout swept ashore knocking adult sunbathers flat and lifting furniture - and a small child - into the air. Videos captured by several people on their mobile phones show the moment the waterspout, which is effectively a tornado over water, hits the beach in the city of Recife, in the eastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. From there it went up the beach, tearing up sun umbrellas before dying out almost as suddenly as it arrived. Videos captured by several people on their mobile phones show the moment the waterspout, which is effectively a tornado over water, hits the beach in the city of Recife, in the eastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco . Local police said that although they had several reports and an ambulance had been at the scene, nobody had been seriously injured . The waterspout went up the beach, tearing up sun umbrellas and even sucking up and spitting out a small child - who was unharmed - before dying out almost as suddenly as it arrived . Eyewitness Salviano Alaniz, 36, who was on the beach with his wife, said: 'I spotted something out to sea which seem to be a dark area and then I realised it was a waterspout moving towards the shore. 'I didn't realise how strong it was and nobody else seemed to be worried until it suddenly hit the beach - and started knocking people flat. 'Those who didn't fall over ran away as fast as they could, and I saw seven bits of furniture swept up into the air including a child that was lifted a short way before being thrown out of the waterspout and across the sand.' Local meteorologist Edvania Santos said that they were currently analysing the images posted online to try and work out how the rare natural phenomena had occurred. He said: 'There are some unusual weather patterns happening at the moment which will probably be to blame, and from the videos it looks like a classic waterspout - but we will need to study the footage more carefully before producing a report.' Local police said that although they had several reports and an ambulance had been at the scene, nobody including the child that had been sucked into the air had been seriously injured, with just a few people suffering minor cuts and bruises.

World champion Lewis Hamilton is amused by Red Bull's complaints about Mercedes ongoing dominance, accusing the sport's preceding power of double standards. Mercedes are expected to dominate this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, just as it did at the season opener in Australia with a one-two finish, and the entire 2014 season. The huge edge Mercedes enjoys prompted calls for rule changes to make F1 racing closer, and after the Melbourne procession, Red Bull even floated the idea of withdrawing from the sport if the situation does not improve. Lewis Hamilton has accused Red Bull of double standards after their threat to leave Formula 1 . The Mercedes driver romped to victory at the Australian Grand Prix with Nico Rosberg in second . Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull were hugely successful before Mercedes' improvement in the last two years . 'I genuinely find it quite funny,' Hamilton said Thursday, noting that Red Bull saw no problem with the sport when it was dominating and Sebastian Vettel won four straight championships. 'It's an interesting opinion coming from individuals who had so much success. To already have comment after one race I find quite funny,' he said. Hamilton said Mercedes had simply done a better job than its rivals, who need to work harder to catch up rather than seek to change the rules. 'Not once did this team ever complain to others to equalise things,' Hamilton said. 'Now we are the best team, we pulled together and did an amazing job.' Hamilton walks in the paddock ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grnad Prix . Red Bull's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo chats to team principal Christian Horner in Kuala Lumpur . The re-introduction of mid-season engine upgrades this year does promise closer racing late in the year, but in the meantime Mercedes is expected to remain in a class of its own at the front of the field in Malaysia and beyond. However Hamilton was wary of Ferrari's performance during race-pace long runs in Melbourne, and saw the Italian team as the main threat. 'Definitely Ferrari have made a huge step and that is good to see,' Hamilton said. 'They put in some really spectacular sectors in the last race weekend.' Mercedes had cheekily invited Vettel to its Friday engineering briefing at Sepang after the German accepted an offer from Mercedes' Nico Rosberg made during the post-race media conference in Australia. However, Mercedes had since broadened the offer to any rival team to attend, and Ferrari said neither the team nor Vettel would be taking up the offer.

New rail routes and improved lines using 140mph trains to slash key journey times by up to 40 minutes are unveiled today as part of the Chancellor’s multi-billion pound plan to ‘revolutionise travel in the North’. Journey times between Leeds and Newcastle could be cut to 50 minutes - compared to a best time now nearly an hour and half ( 87 minutes currently) for cost of between £8.5bn and £14.0bn, says a new report to be published in Liverpool by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. The 140mph trains could reduce the Liverpool to Manchester journey times to around 20 minutes – but cost as much as £13billion. The new routes, shown here, will slash journey times by up to 40 minutes- with travel time between Leeds and Newcastle cut to 50 minutes - compared to a best time now nearly an hour and half for cost of between £8.5bn and £14.0bn . Another plan to reduce journey times between Sheffield and Manchester from the current 48 minutes to 27 minutes could cost as much as £19billion. But sceptical rail unions dismissed the Government’ ideas to boost transport in the North as: ‘yet more pie-in-the-sky nonsense’. The new Government plans are part of the Chancellor’s ‘ Northern Powerhouse initiative to link ‘the great cities of the north’. It builds on the Government’s HS3 idea – high speed lines from East to West across the North to link with the controversial £50billion high speed HS2 line going from London in the South to Birmingham and then onto to Leeds and Manchester in the North. New rail routes and improved lines using 140mph trains to slash key journey times by up to 40 minutes are unveiled today . The so-called ‘TransNorth’ rail network would link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle and Hull – with sections capable of speeds up to 140mph - Journey times between Liverpool and Manchester could be as low as 20 minutes; Manchester to Sheffield and Leeds could both be 30 minutes; Leeds to Hull could be just 45, and Sheffield to Hull 50 minutes. Journey times from Manchester to Newcastle could be cut by a quarter (25%). The report by the Government and the regional quango Transport for the North includes studies by Network Rail setting out for the first time the different options for creating such a network along with indicative costings running to billions of pounds . Plans set out in the report include: slashing journey times between major northern cities with investment in high speed rail; developing new east-west road connections including a road tunnel under the peak district; and introducing Oyster-style smart travel cards and simpler fares across the North. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left) has backed the investment but Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, (right) claimed it was just more 'pie-in-the-sky nonsense' The Chancellor George Osborne (above) claimed the report had the potential to revolutionise transport in the North . A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Options range from radically upgrading existing routes to building completely new lines.’ Transport Secretary McLoughlin Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Transport Secretary McLoughlin and Northern city leaders are backing the first ‘Northern Transport Strategy’ report following work by Network Rail work on rail improvement options. The department for Transport said: ‘The report sets out a long term strategy to connect up the north, create a single economy and allow northern towns and cities to pool their strengths. ‘ The Chancellor and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin are in the North West today  to launch the report. The proposed new routes: . The proposed upgrades: . Mr McLoughlin is today at the Port of Liverpool’s container terminal L2 before joining the Chancellor on a visit to Stockport . They will also announce the go-ahead of the A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘No government has given such attention to the infrastructure of our great northern cities and how to deliver a world-class, integrated transport network for the north. The proposals announced today will reduce journey times while increasing capacity and connectivity, enabling growth.’ Chancellor Mr Osborne said: ‘This report has the potential to revolutionise transport in the North. ‘From backing high speed rail to introducing simpler fares right across the North, our ambitious plans for transport means we will deliver a truly national recovery where every part of the country will share in Britain’s prosperity.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘All of this will ensure the North can race ahead in a stronger economy and doesn't become one big bottleneck.’ But Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: "This is yet more pie-in-the-sky nonsense from the Government on the so called Northern Powerhouse when in reality transport services across the region in the real world are lumped with clapped-out, overcrowded trains with any replacement programme light years off.’	New rail routes are announced in plan to ‘revolutionise travel in the North’ Journey times between Leeds and Newcastle could be cut to 50 minutes . 140mph trains could reduce  Liverpool to Manchester times to 20 minutes . The multi-billion pound plan also includes major upgrades on current lines .
A kind-hearted 12-year-old boy turned down a £20 reward for returning a lost mobile phone and instead told the owner to do 'something nice for someone else'. Josh Brown found an iPhone4 on a train seat and answered a call from the owner's mother after getting off at Birmingham on February 21. He told Michelle Hickinbottom, 36, that he would leave her 16-year-old daughter Shaunnah's phone at the ticket office at Selly Oak train station on his way home to Alvechurch, Worcestershire. Josh Brown (left) turned down a £20 reward after he found Shaunnah Hickinbottom's iPhone4 (right) on a train . Ms Hickinbottom had offered Josh a £20 reward to express her gratitude that she would have posted to him if he left his home address. Later that day, she went to the train station and was given a handwritten note from Josh as well as the phone, which had cost £250. And she was stunned to see that instead of his address, Josh had left her a lovely message, which said: 'Don't worry about the money, just do something nice for someone else.' Ms Hickinbottom, from West Heath in Birmingham, decided to start a social media campaign to track down the youngster. And after her posts were shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, Josh's mother Angela Brown came forward on Friday. She said Josh, who attends Alvechurch CofE Middle School, is 'overwhelmed' by the response. Ms Hickinbottom said: 'I just wanted to find him as I thought it was a lovely thing to do. I said to him on the phone at the time it was really appreciated and to leave his address so I could send him £20 to thank him really. Michelle Hickinbottom had offered to post Josh £20 to thank him if he left his address, but was stunned to find a heartwarming note, which said 'just do something nice for someone else' from him instead . 'I was choked when I saw the letter. I was really overwhelmed. He will go far in life with an attitude like that. He seems a great lad.' She added: 'We are really grateful because my daughter has got a lot of photos on there she wants to keep. 'It is more sentimental and personal than anything else. 'I think he knows how appreciated he is and hopefully other people will be inspired by this.' Mrs Brown said: 'We can't believe all the lovely comments that people have taken the time to post on Facebook and Twitter, Josh is so pleased. Michelle Hickinbottom (pictured with daughter Shaunnah) said she was 'choked' when she read the letter . 'We are still overwhelmed by the lovely posts and the attention it has attracted. 'We are very proud of him. But he just did the right thing. It was the only bit of paper I had in my handbag. It was the back of an envelope. 'It was all Josh's idea. He said he wasn't going to take any money off her and he'd just ask her to do something nice for someone else in future.' Josh said: 'I was going to Birmingham to see the canals being drained when I spotted this phone on the seat. 'Not long after a lady phoned it and said it was hers. I told her I was coming back through Selly Oak and I would leave the phone there for her. 'She was very grateful and said for me to leave a note with my address on and she would send me £20 as a thank you. 'But I decided to leave the note asking for her to do something nice instead as I thought it was the right thing to do. 'My dad always says 'what goes around comes around' and if I lost my phone I would like to think someone would do the same to me. 'I didn't think it was a particularly extraordinary thing to do. But I was gobsmacked when it appeared all over Facebook and Twitter.' Josh's father Tim added: 'We knew nothing about the search for him. My wife was in town when a friend came over and asked 'did your Josh find a phone?' 'She said 'yes, but how on earth do you know' and her friend replied: 'because it's all over Facebook'. 'Every Josh Brown on the internet has been contacted about it by the looks of it, I can't believe have big it has become.'	Josh Brown found an iPhone4 on a train seat in Birmingham last month . He told the owner's mother that he would leave it at station's ticket office . Michelle Hickinbottom had offered to post him reward if he left address .

GET THE TRUTH . by Philip Houston, Michael Floyd and Susan Carnicero . (Icon Books £12.99) Ever wanted to know the best way of extracting a confession? Me neither, but here’s an unexpectedly fascinating book that shows how to do just that. Interrogation is an unfortunate name with regrettable connotations . Not only will you learn how to have the guilty singing like canaries, this book also comes up with some genuinely important insights about the interrogation process. Ah, interrogation. Such an unfortunate term, with such regrettable connotations. Torture, screaming agony, electrodes, waterboarding — those kind of connotations. Yes, but it needn’t be like that, say the authors, former CIA officers who are painfully aware of what ‘CIA interrogation’ is taken to mean — torture, screaming agony, electrodes, waterboarding — and who are appalled by that reputation. I think the authors are also against torture and pain on ethical grounds, but the nature of their disgust is partly professional. Because it turns out that interrogation-by-torment is ineffective, as the CIA’s skilled specialists have known for some time. Only rank amateurs would ever try to extract confessions and information by upping the voltage or giving the thumbscrews another turn. The only approach that has any chance of success, state the authors, is exactly the opposite. Professionals who really know what they’re doing try to take all traces of violence or confrontation out of an interrogation, turning it instead into an interview based on chummy sympathy and understanding. Good interrogators will lower their voice, talk slowly, claim empathy with their suspects and then — well, and then just keep on talking lowly and slowly seems to be the gist. Because what appears to work best is an interrogator who chats on and on, quietly, reassuringly, understandingly, often repetitively. ‘We all make mistakes, Brian. Nobody’s saying we don’t make mistakes because, you know, Brian, we all make mistakes,’ and so on and on and on. The comforting drone of the interrogator’s monologue may sound mindless, but it is carefully created and should contain five key features. These are rationalising the action (you needed the money); projecting the blame (it was their fault for not paying you enough); minimising the seriousness (we’ve all nicked Post-it notes); socialising the situation (this kind of thing happens a lot, it’s nothing we haven’t seen a million times); and emphasising the truth (if you could explain what happened when you took the money, that would be great and would help us all move on). Acts of terrible violence, gross betrayals, fraud, theft, murder — the skilled interrogator will mimic thorough understanding of the worst crimes to keep up the pretence of being on the suspect’s side. Number of tweets the CIA monitors every day . At the same time, the interrogator will be intent on keeping that suspect locked into a mode of short-term thinking — keeping the focus on particulars and specifics, trying like crazy to stop the suspect considering the long-term consequences of telling an implicating truth and being found guilty. It is a process that has had enormous success, claim the authors, though this is a success that is anecdotal. But the anecdotes are pretty convincing. Take the example of Abu Zubaydah, one of the first Al Qaeda leaders to be captured, who was being successfully won over by the pretend empathy approach until a hardliner applied torture instead — and found his victim clammed up. The book consists mainly of such case studies from the authors’ interrogating careers, supplemented weirdly with 70-odd pages of commentary by a lawyer type who adds his own legal anecdotes to make the same points. Presumably, this book is meant to show how the CIA’s interrogation techniques can be applied in the normal world. But it struck me that here was an opportunity missed, since there isn’t any effective attempt to transfer the professionals’ methods to everyday situations: how to winkle out the truth about which child broke the kitchen window, how to get your partner to fess up about what really happened at the office party. But though it misses that trick, this book does find itself making, I think to its own surprise, a genuine and important contribution to the ongoing debate, particularly in the U.S., about the use of torture such as waterboarding during interrogations of terrorists. Forget any ethical argument, say the authors — any form of physical coercion, far less torture, just doesn’t work.	Ever wanted to know the best way of extracting a confession? This unexpectedly fascinating book shows just how you can do it . However the skilled former CIA authors are  against torture and pain .
It's not known if she leaves the toilet seat up after she uses it, but Johnie the crocodile loves nothing more than a good soak in the tub. That's what was revealed in a recent video when the croc's owner Vicki Lowing from Melbourne captured bath time in her house. The video was uploaded to YouTube this week, and shows Lowing calling to 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie who is 1.5 metres long and weighes 12kg. Scroll down for video . Bath time: 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie is 1.5 metres long, weighes 12kg and loves a good soak in the tub . Johnie walks down through Vicki Lowing's house in Melbourne to get her daily bath . The 57-year-old nurse claims that the crocodiles she has had were always totally domesticated . With the sound of the bath being run in the background Johnie walks down through Lowing's house to the bathroom. 'Come on let's have a bath,' Lowing says. 'There's a girl. Get in that bath. Come on buddy. I'll help you get in.' Lowing is true to her word and once the croc gets to the bathroom she lifts it into the half full bath. 'That's better isn't it? How's that?' asks Vicki. Johnie doesn't have to answer - the image of her floating contentedly in the bath says it all. Nicknamed 'croc lady' in Melbourne, Lowing, has owned crocodiles for more than 30 years. She claims they have all been totally domesticated and that she can even communicate with them telepathically. Are we nearly there yet? Lowing's crocodiles have even ridden in her car over the years . Do you need your back washed? Lowing helps Johnie get cleaned up in the bath tub . Lowing said she first became fascinated with the animals after watching a film in the 1960s, and she has never looked back. Amazingly, despite Johnie nipping her a decade ago while ill, the 57-year-old nurse has never sustained any injuries. She admits neighbours keep their distance when she has taken her pets for walks but on the plus side she has never had problems with burglars. Over the years it would not be unusual for her son Andrew, now 20 years old, to wake up with Johnie on his bed - just like any family pet.

Kaitlin Taylor went to the Syracuse University health center in hopes of getting treated for flu symptoms but instead was sent to a psychiatric ward . A New Jersey student with a bad cold was locked in a hospital psych ward for six days after going to her university's heath center for a medication to treat flu-like symptoms, she alleges in a lawsuit. Kaitlin Taylor, of Union County, New Jersey, went to the campus health center at Syracuse  - a school she's since left - when she was a sophomore in September 2013 complaining of flu-like symptoms. But the six-day stay in the nearby St Joseph's Hospital was not what she was expecting when she told the center's staff that she was suffering from a fever, cough, phlegm and chest congestion. While waiting for care, Taylor said she told a counselor that she wanted to change her arts major and take a leave of absence from the school but missed the semester's deadline because her computer was stolen. When she was told no one could write her a prescription at the center, she was driven to St Joseph's and dropped in front the the emergency room, according to the New York Post. While waiting in the ER, Taylor said she felt as though she was getting sicker. 'I was getting stressed by the circumstances and the surroundings,' she told the Post. 'I thought I'd only be there for an hour or two.' She was then taken to a psychiatrist's office, where she spent 15 minutes explaining that she was sick, had not been sleeping well, was struggling in her classes and feared she might lose her scholarship. Taylor was then told that she would  have to stay overnight and was sent to an 'observation room' with four other patients. The psychiatrist's notes said that Taylor was in for 'involuntary treatment,' for 'insomnia, pressured speech, disorganized, declining grades'. The patients in the room were separated by low walls while staff watched over them, Taylor said. She still didn't receive medication or treatment. She wanted to call her mom, but her cellphone had died and she said the hospital wouldn't recharge it. Taylor was sent to St Joseph's Hospital (pictured) where she was put into 'involuntary treatment' and observed for six days after she had only gone to the health center for medication for her flu-like symptoms . Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her. Her hospital horror started at her university's health center (pictured), where she went to get medication . 'They hadn't done anything for me or my cold. They didn't take my blood pressure or even my temperature,' she told the Post. A nurse told her that if she cooperated and took the medication they gave her, she would be out in a shorter time period. She said she was given Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and Klonopin, used to treat panic disorder. Taylor told the post that they had to line up and take their pills, 'just like in the movie Cuckoo's Nest'. She was finally able to reach her mom, who came to the hospital to get her out of the ward. Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her, negligent and harmful use of medication and failure to get informed consent, among other reasons, the lawsuit states, according to the Daily Orange. Marc Held, Taylor's lawyer who filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, said her treatment was 'unfathomable'. The lawsuit claims that the 'unlawful, negligent and otherwise improper confinement', caused Taylor to suffer 'personal indignities'. Taylor has since left Syracuse and transferred to Rutgers University. Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz, senior vice president and dean of student affairs, said in a statement to the Daily Orange that the university 'strongly support the medical professionals and staff in the center'. In November 2014 the university announced they were in the process of searching for a new psychiatric provider and since has hired additional staff. Syracuse's attorney Matthew Larkin, however, told the Post that the university 'denies that it acted inappropriately in any way'. A St Joseph's spokesman wouldn't comment due to patient privacy and pending litigation.	Kaitlin Taylor went to the Syracuse University health center as a sophomore in September 2013 .

British people are becoming more and more sleep deprived - and it's all down to bringing laptops and tablets into the bedroom. According to a new survey, bingeing on TV box sets is now our top 'lights on' bedroom activity with 34 per cent delaying much-needed kip just to watch their favourite shows. As a nation our average bed time is 10.43pm, but we're busy for nearly an hour (52 minutes) before we actually go to sleep, according to new research. Binge-watching box sets is number one sleep-stealers with 34 per cent watching DVDs in bed . The survey of 1,000 adults, which excluded sex as an option, found that binge-watching DVDs or streamed programmes from the internet is now the number one sleep-stealer. Checking social media feeds was still a high second at 30 per cent, followed by writing emails or working (17 per cent), online shopping (11 per cent) and reading at just four per cent. Guilty pleasures such as eating biscuits, having a cuppa away from the rest of the family and playing addictive games like Candy Crush also sneaked into the top answers in a poll by The Fine Bedding Company. Although 83 per cent questioned claimed to love sleep, and that it was more important to them than food (66 per cent), we're actually getting less and less every year. According to the survey, the average amount of sleep is now six hours 28 minutes, compared to our grandparents' generation who got a good eight hours every night. Although 56 per cent of us claim to be unsatisfied with the amount of sleep we have every night, but we can't seem to tear ourselves away from our favourite shows. Some respondents admitting that it was all too easy to press play again and miss out on beauty sleep. A minority will enjoy a snack in bed and a moment alone, while one per cent of us admit Candy Crush keeps them awake in bed when they should have turned their lights out . 1. Internet TV/streaming/box sets 34% . 2. Checking Facebook/social media 31% . 3. Working/emails/accounts 17% . 4. Online shopping/browsing/magazines 11% . 5. Reading Kindle/books/mags 4% . 6. Drinking/eating/snacks/treats 1.2% . 7. Playing online games/gambling 1.2% . It seems there is also a male/female divide when it comes to going to bed times, with the majority of men questioned saying they go to bed between 11pm and midnight, but most women were already snuggled up an hour earlier between 10 and 11pm. Sara Wadsworth of The Fine Bedding Company said: 'It seems we are becoming a nation of binge-watchers, unable to wait another week for the next episode. 'Perhaps it's time to bring a bit of balance back into the bedroom and try some sleep-enhancing activities a few nights a week. Instead of switching on a screen; try some gentle yoga stretches, listening to soothing music or even meditating. 'There are lots of apps available designed to enhance sleep and can easily be listened to in bed, putting that mobile phone to good use.' What do you like to do in bed, apart from sleeping (only clean answers please)	Watching top shows  in bed costs us nearly an hour of sleep a night .

It's a common practice for people to leave honest appraisals of a hotel after their stay, and they are often scathing and highly critical. However, after one too many rude guests, a hotel group has decided to start reviewing their guests and publishing their scorecard online. Art Series Hotel Group will trial a new program, 'Reverse Review' at their six hotels in Victoria and South Australia. It gives the hotel staff the opportunity to rate guests' behaviour and post their scorecard online. Scroll down for video . The six hotels that are part of the Art Series Hotel Group will trial a 'Reverse Review' system to rate the behaviour of their guests - including cleanliness and manners . The Art Series Hotel's hotels (pictured) intend the program as a fun activity for guests with a chance to reward their best guests with free accommodation . 'Think you're the perfect hotel guest?' the ad asks. 'Stay and request to be reviewed at any of our hotels from April 17 until May 31. 'Get four or five stars and get a free night to stay again. But be warned, if you misbehave, everyone will know!' Art Series Hotel Group Marketing Director Ryan Tuckerman said the program has been inspired by online review website 'TripAdvisor' and is intended as a fun activity for guests and staff alike. 'Reverse Reviews flips the process on its head and provides a way for us to recognise and reward good behaviour in a fun and light-hearted way.' 'These days everyone's a critic. The internet has enabled people to rate every film, restaurant or latte they experience, good or bad,' the hotels' website explains. 'So what would happen if we made it a two way street? 'We have many guests who fail to meet our standards but we didn't have a forum of our own - until now.' 'We have many guests who fail to meet our standards but we didn't have a forum of our own - until now,' the company says, explaining that guests are known to steal from or trash hotel rooms . The Hotel Group are curious to see if the fear of dirty laundry being aired in public affects their guests' behaviour. It comes after a study by Galaxy Research unveiled the truth about awful behaviour in Australian hotels and the filthy acts that go on behind closed doors. The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home. One in ten people steal items like bedding, irons and light globes from hotels. 'We even have guests who pilfer the batteries from our television remotes, bless them,' added Tuckerman. The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home . 400,000 people confess that they have trashed a hotel room, with the hotel remarking: 'I'm sure not all of them are rock stars'. 20 per cent of people confessed that they'd walked in front of windows naked. Also, the study found that wealthier people are more likely to misbehave and 'the poorer you are the less likely you are to take an item without paying'. According to the study, the ideal hotel guest is a woman from regional Victoria or Tasmania aged 50-plus, married with no blue-collar jobs with an income of $40 thousand or less a year. A person fitting this description has been found to be less likely of committing an anti-social act. 'We do have special guests; one who always greet us with a smile and make us want to come to work. The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home . 'We want to bring them back for an extra night, because these are the kind of guests we want at Art Series Hotel.' The hotel divulges that 60 per cent of people staying in their penthouse have been awarded an upgrades, specifically rewarded to people who have been pleasant, clean and walked around with a smile on their face. So, what does one need to do to score a five star rating? 'There are some insider tips and tricks that are simple and really make the day of the hotel team,' Tuckerman explains. 'These include exchanging day to day pleasantries, putting the sign out on the door as soon as your room is ready to be made up, opting to have your linen changed less frequently and keeping dirty towels in a pile.' Resisting the urge to steal the amenities is also looked upon fondly. Art Series Hotel Group Marketing Director Ryan Tuckerman said the program has been inspired by online review website 'TripAdvisor'	A hotel company will start rating their guests and posting feedback online . The new initiative will award well-behaved guests with free accommodation . It will expose those that trash or plunder the hotel, or those that are rude . Art Series Hotel Group says 60 per cent of people staying in their penthouse have been upgraded due to their kind, amiable behaviour . 400,000 Australians have reportedly confessed to trashing a hotel room . Customers who opt to take part in the 'Reverse Review' trial between April 17 and May 31 will have their behaviour appraisal posted online .
There is a small corner of north Manchester which can boast two mini sporting dynasties that continue to be remarkably productive. Most famously from Bury are the Nevilles, whose notoriety takes in the worlds chiefly of football and netball, together with Phil's England age group honours at cricket. And then there are the Crosses, who can field a West Ham United footballer, a Superleague netballer and two very accomplished cricketers, the youngest of whom is becoming a fixture in England's women's cricket team. Kate Cross is part of the seam attack for England's women's cricket team and helped them win the Ashes . Kate Cross is daughter of former Upton Park striker David, but has followed more the path of her brother Bobby, who was contracted to Lancashire. The first girl to gain a place at the county's cricket academy, she has progressed to becoming part of England's seam attack, and was part of the team that won the women's Ashes last year. 'We've got quite a few connections with the Nevilles, they live not far up the road from us,' says Kate, 23. 'Phil and Gary went to the school next to our house and my sister Jenny played netball with Tracey [who is now England's interim head coach]. My mum still plays netball in the same league as Tracey's Mum.' These days David is a scout for Blackburn Rovers, and while he is best remembered for his 99 goals with the Hammers, he is a lifelong cricket nut. 'My dad was able to play cricket at the beginning of his football career and towards the end. I am too young to have seen him play, but I did manage to play a game of cricket for the thirds at Heywood with him when I was 14.' Cricketer Cross (left) is the daughter of former West Ham United striker David (right) The Neville brothers Phil (left) and Gary, pictured here playing in 2005, are also from Bury . Tracey Neville (right) is a retired netball player and is pictured here at the 1998 Commonwealth Games . These are exciting times for young women getting involved in elite sports, as evidenced by the BBC Sports Personality of the Year team award to the England rugby team, ahead of competition such as Paul McGinley's Ryder Cup victors. The paying public are yet to be convinced in many instances, but there is a big drive to promote women's sport among governing bodies, backed by many in the media. But it was not always a fashionable cause, as the younger Cross daughter recalls when she was given a place in Lancashire's boys academy at the age of 15. 'At the time there seemed to be some mixed feelings about it in a few quarters. There were quite a few people set in their ways with their cricket who were saying she has taken the position of a boy. Because I would never play in the Lancashire men's first team they didn't see it as the right investment. 'Although there was a bit of negativity it gave me the realisation that I could go further with my cricket.' Priority given to the women's game has grown to the point where the national team are now on full-time contracts that also involve them doing promotional work for the sport with the Chance To Shine charity. Cross (left) is pictured here with Sportsmail's Mike Dickson at the ECB's National Academy at Loughborough . Cross is just back from a tour of New Zealand where England edged both the one-day international and Twenty20 series, with Cross in particular shining with the ball in the ODIs. Greater financial commitment in several countries is quickening up the evolution of the women's game. While Cross bowls her late outswing at around 70mph, and the very fastest in the women's game are in the mid-seventies, power and speed are on the rise. As Serena Williams has consistently shown with her serve in tennis, it is possible that women can propel a ball with similar power to men. 'I don't see it happening in cricket in the near future but I think it could happen,' says Cross. 'It starts as a young cricketer and if girls are now able to focus on cricket at an early age you will definitely see the speeds go up. 'Women's cricket has changed in the past few years, it used to be a lot more tactical because we didn't have the strength, but in the last few years we have really worked on that and power hitting. The England women's cricket team celebrate their Ashes victory at the WACA in Perth last year . 'It's more about boundaries. A few years ago it was more about hitting the gaps but we have got a lot stronger. I really noticed at the Twenty20 World Cup in March how much other teams are improving. I'm sure Deandra Dottin (the phenomenal West Indian hitter) can strike it as far as any man in the game. She is not someone you want to bowl at.' Cross and her fellow squad members are grateful for the financial support they get from the ECB that has allowed them to train full-time. But what about the argument that you cannot really be professional in sport unless people, or television companies, are prepared to part with money to watch? 'I've heard that said, and it's true that we certainly don't get the crowds the men get. But it has to start somewhere and the ECB have invested that money in us and hopefully our game will improve, and that will bring more crowds in. 'We sold Chelmsford out last year for a Twenty20 and got 2,000 at Wormsley for the Test against India. We get a bit lost at Lord's because it's difficult to pack the ground out. But I have seen a difference in the crowds we are getting, and it's different to Australia, who commented on how many came. When we played at the MCG there were about 200 spectators, which wasn't many in there.' Cross in action with the bat for England in a Test match against India at Wormsley last August . Her career highlight was her Test debut in January, when she helped bowl England to victory in the Ashes Test at Perth with 6-70 in temperatures that got up above 100F. 'I will remember that for a long time, one of the reasons we won the game was because we were more mentally prepared for the heat. I have never felt so shattered afterwards. We had won by lunchtime and went to a waterfront pub and I had some food at 4pm, and then it just hit me. I went to bed at 6pm and slept through until 9 the next morning.' She admits to not following women's sport a great deal, but wants to make sure that there are more names to look up to for the next generation. 'I really got into the Winter Olympics this year, watching athletes like Lizzy Yarnold. When I was growing up I looked up to Andrew Flintoff, and remember the 2005 Ashes. Hopefully in the future there will be more female names and role models.'	Kate Cross is the daughter of former West Ham striker David . Kate's brother Bobby was contracted to Lancashire and her sister Jenny was a Superleague netballer . Also from Bury are the Nevilles, with Gary and Phil former footballers and Tracey a retired netball player who is now the England interim head coach .
(CNN)How can I describe life in Crimea after a year under Russia's control? You start saying things like "Let's not talk about this on the phone" and become careful about the Facebook pages you "like." Because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the Soviet Union. In just one year so much has been lost and many Crimeans seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone's life. There is a growing level of censorship, inequality and political repression of those who don't agree with the government. In everyday communication, Crimeans, including those who support Putin and Russia, have to think about what they do and say. Thanks to the activities of the FSB (Russia's secret police) denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again. In the Soviet Union, especially in the late 1930s, denunciations written by Soviet citizens about their neighbors, friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and Gulag camps. Now in Crimea, no one feels safe. Anyone who doesn't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a "joyful" conversation with the security services. Significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights, like freedom of movement. Now, there are two borders manned by armed -- and sometimes angry -- men who always have questions about where you are going and why you want to pass. For ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, things have been very difficult and thousands fled to mainland Ukraine in the first months after annexation. Their fears were confirmed when Ukrainian activists and young Tatars began to disappear. Some were later found dead, others are still missing. Ukrainian patriots also left in the first month or two after occupation -- it would have been dangerous and uncomfortable to continue living on the peninsula. The next wave of migrants were those who hoped to adjust to the new rules, but could not. They started leaving when it became clear that things would get worse economically and politically. They have been replaced by a new set of arrivals from Russia: Officials, police, FSB and other authorities. After annexation, many who had worked for the Ukrainian government in the police, army and security services swapped allegiances to the Russian side. The Kremlin was happy to have them but has put special stamps the new recruit's personal files, which say they are "inclined to betrayal." One of the main arguments of pro-Russian locals is that the average salary in Russia is much higher. Indeed, since annexation, salaries have increased, especially in the public institutions like hospitals and schools. The salary increases caused a kind of post-referendum euphoria, which quickly fizzled in late 2014 when a strong dollar meant higher prices for everything from food to gadgets. Then wages were cut again, by anywhere from 30% to 70% depending on the industry. Many doctors and teachers were greatly dissatisfied with wage cuts, but no one protested because in Russia, you must obtain permission for a public assembly. Of course, permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the Kremlin. Tourism, a formerly dependable income source for many Crimeans, has been hit very hard. More than half of all tourists who used to visit Crimea in the summer were Ukrainian and last year tourism was down by 50%. Last summer, the peninsula was empty and many hotel owners had almost no customers. Despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation, many of those who were for the annexation of Crimea continue to support Russia. As strange as it may sound, the harder life becomes here in Crimea, the more people support Putin and hate Ukraine. In a little over a year, the Russian propaganda machine has turned Ukraine from "brother state" to Russia's main enemy. For some Crimeans 2014 was a year of tragedy and farewell to their homeland. Others saw a dream realized. What things will look like in another year is unclear, but what is clear is that nothing will be the same again.	Life under total surveillance and control now the norm in Crimea, says writer . Old Soviet practice of denunciation has become commonplace, he says . He writes: The harder life gets in Crimea, the more people support Putin .
A girl who was pictured naked surrounded by a group of men during spring break has been identified as a 17-year-old. The image which surfaced online on March 11 caused concern among law enforcement who feared she could be danger. But when the girl, who has not been identified, returned home from Panama Beach and saw the snap online, she came forward to the Bay County Sheriff's Office and insisted she was safe. According to officers she told them the interaction between the crowd was consensual and and she didn't realize her picture was being taken. Scroll down for video . Police in Bay County, Florida were searching for a young woman on Spring Break earlier this month who caused concern after being pictured naked wearing only sunglasses and strings of colorful beads while surrounded by men . It has also been revealed she wasn't enrolled in a college. Sheriff Frank McKeithen releases a statement on the department's website on Friday evening saying:  'The Bay County Sheriff’s Office has identified the female in a photo the agency released on March 17, 2015. 'The photo was posted on Twitter on March 11, 2015, when it came to the attention of law enforcement who became concerned for her safety. The female was on the sand on what was believed to be Panama City Beach. 'She was surrounded by a crowd of men in bathing suits. She was wearing no clothing and appeared to be underage. The Bay County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) provided a breakdown of criminal activity between March 5 - 15 this year, with three weeks of Spring Break still to go: . 'The female in the photo became aware through the media that her identity was sought, and contacted the BCSO today and spoke with investigators. 'The BCSO requested law enforcement in the same city the girl lives in to make contact with her. 'They verified her claim to be the girl in the photo. She lives in the southern part of the United States and told investigators she visited Panama City Beach for spring break, although she does not attend college. 'She is seventeen years of age and although she stated her behavior and interaction with the crowd was consensual and she is safe, she did not realize that someone was taking her picture. Sheriff McKethithen told the Daily Mail Online earlier on Friday that the photos had been deeply concerning to law enforcement because of how young the girl looked, and their main priority was to find out if she was safe. 'She isn't in trouble,' Sheriff McKeithen said. 'We want to be proactive about her safety.' An investigation is still underway into the photographs, but the extent of that is not yet known. Bay County officials were alerted to the photos after they were posted to Twitter on March 11. In one of the pictures, the young woman was bent over and dancing naked at the water's edge on a beach in the Gulf of Mexico. In a separate shot, she appeared to be trying to cover her body while a group of men gathered around her. In another picture, the scene was more aggressive. The girl appeared to be trying to escape the frame but was surrounded by shirtless men. One of the men was grabbing the necklaces at her throat. Panama City Beach in Bay County is the country's top destination for students on Spring Break. Sheriff McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that his officers, along with the Panama City Beach Police, face an overwhelming wave of criminal activity during the five weeks of Spring Break, when their community swells from 12,000 people to an estimated 100-300,000. 'We have a mess here... this is not the traditional Spring Break of the past,' the sheriff said. 'The kids themselves are posting videos of them having sex on the beach and getting into fights.' He called Spring Break an 'emotional roller coaster' both for the students who end up victims of violence and sexual assault and for his officers, who work double shifts to cope with the influx. 'The majority of sexual assaults are not reported, because they feel shame, are embarrassed, have never likely been this intoxicated before and are far from home,' the police chief said. 'But our message is this - no matter how intoxicated you are, if you are violated, we take that very seriously.' Although the sheriff offered no exact figures on the cost of policing Spring Break, he said that the $150,000 given in assistance by the Tourist Development Council 'barely scratched the surface'. The crowd packed the beach during Spring Break festivities in Panama City Beach, Florida on March 12. Bay County authorities believe that the naked, young woman was on a beach somewhere in this area . Along with hundreds of thousands of drunk, college kids pouring into the town, there was also the dangerous elements that a group this large, with money to burn and wanting to experiment, attraced. 'Build it and they will come,' the sheriff said. Among 22 people arrested at a local bar this weekend in a narcotics sting, was a 39-year-old man from Nashville, Tennessee, who was selling the synthetic party drug, known as 'molly'. Heroin and prescription drugs have also been seized. Weapons were also a growing problem - arrests had uncovered a Glock and an AK-47 during Spring Break. McKeithen said earlier this week that the number of incidents so far this year showed the changes designed to tone down Spring Break haven't worked. These included a 2am closing time for alcohol sales. Sheriff McKeithen said: 'We can't ''police it'' away, that's not going to fix the problem. We are doing the best we can. At some point, someone has to decide whether this is what we want or don't want. 'I am trying to keep people and our officers safe.' Video courtesy WJHG .

Holland scored in stoppage time through a deflected Wesley Sneijder shot to secure a 1-1 draw with Turkey on Saturday and avoid their first ever home defeat in European Championship qualifying. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar got a slight deflection to a long-range strike from captain Sneijder in the 92nd minute to rescue a point for the Dutch, who looked to be heading to their third defeat in five matches in Group A. Burak Yilmaz scored in the 37th minute at the Amsterdam Arena, given time in the penalty area to fire off a shot that took a deflection off Bruno Martins Indi to put the Turks ahead at halftime.

Burak Yilmaz (left) fired Turkey into the lead in the 37th minute in their game against Holland . The Netherlands stayed third in the standings with seven points from five games. Turkey have five points at the halfway point of the qualifying campaign. The home team had several chances in the first half with captain Sneijder, deputising for the injured Robin van Persie, going closest but their best came after the break when substitute Luciano Narsingh missed an open goal. Sneijder shot narrowly wide with a free kick and full back Jetro Willems went close with a rasping shot 10 minutes from time. The introduction of tall forward Bas Dost forced the Dutch to throw everything forward in a final assault and the equaliser came when Sneijder's shot struck Huntelaar on the back of the head and deflected into goal. 'From the first minute we went for victory,' Sneijder told Dutch television. 'Turkey had one chance in front of goal. We dominated and made chances but we took until injury time to get the equaliser. We did not impose ourselves enough in the first half but we were more attacking in the second and something had to fall for us in the end.' Avoiding defeat will not lift the pressure on coach Guus Hiddink, who received a public vote of confidence from the Dutch football association after defeat in Iceland in October. Turkey's players celebrate taking the lead away to Holland in the first half of their Group A game . Guus Hiddink (left) is under increasing pressure as Holland manager, despite saving a point vs Turkey . Dutch fortunes have fallen dramatically since finishing third at the World Cup in Brazil last year under coach Louis van Gaal. His successor, given a two-year contract until next year's European Championship in France, has been under increasing pressure after the team lost two of their opening three qualifiers. A 6-0 home win over Latvia in November gave Hiddink breathing space but he will face more questions after narrowly avoiding defeat.	Burak Yilmaz put Turkey ahead in the 37th minute against Holland .

A woman has been found guilty of shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, faces at least seven years in prison after being convicted of firing a 9mm handgun through the restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan in the early hours of February 9, 2014. No one was hurt in the incident. In court on Wednesday, she was charged with felony use of firearm, carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm into an occupied building. Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, pictured in the courtroom as she was convicted of opening fire on a McDonald's in February 2014 after they got her order wrong . Torres's mother reacts to the guilty verdict for her daughter on all charges related to the gun-firing at the fast food chain . She looks toward the jury as she hears that she has been found guilty. Torres could face at least seven years in prison . During court, the jury heard the in-car recording taken from the police vehicle located outside of her home while she was being interrogated after the shooting. The recording captured Torres saying 'there was no reason' for why it happened, according to Mlive. She also said 'it was just dumb'. Torres explained that she was not seeking to shoot anyone while at the fast-food restaurant, and that she legally owned the gun, but did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The charge against Torres for felony use a firearm carries at least two years in prison, while shooting at an occupied building and illegally carrying a concealed weapon carries up to five years. Torres, pictured left in her mug shot, miraculously did not injure anyone. She will appear in court on April 21 for her sentencing . A news report from February 2014 shows the window Torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside. During the first day of trial, her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally . The gun used during the incident that could have  injured an employee who was tending to Torres . On the day before the incident, Torres had gone to McDonald's for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it, as she had requested, police said. After speaking to the managers, they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit, police said, and  after drinking at clubs with a friend that night, she took them up on their offer. Sitting in the passenger seat, she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number, which later helped police track her down. But when she and her friend received their order, she again had no bacon on her burger. Nydia Ray, who was driving the car during the incident, is pictured testifying in court during the first day of trial on March 24, 2015 . The server on the night of the incident, Essence Lake, testified in court on March 24, 2015. She said the bullet could have struck her if she had still been by the window . Torres pulled out a handgun and fired once, sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant, police said. Her attorney, John Beason, had previously said in court that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally. Torres' friend, Nydia Ray, who was driving the car, told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger. She said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying 'What the f*** is going on?' when it fired. The server, Essence Lake, had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass, she said, adding the bullet would have struck her if she had still been by the window. 'We went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off,' Ray said. Torres' attorney, John Beason, said that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally . She said she was not looking to shoot anyone at McDonald's and that she legally owned the gun . The women went to Ray's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number. Police tracked the women down 30 minutes later. Grand Rapids Police Officer Patrick Loeb said Ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order. She told him Torres said something along the lines of 'do you know who you're talking to?' before she fired - which Ray has since denied. Torres will appear in court on April 21 for sentencing and remains free on a $50,000 bond. Torres was found soon after speeding away from the Grand Rapids McDonald's (pictured) because she had given her number to the restaurant's manager as she flirted with him before the shooting .	Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, could face at least two years in prison after being convicted of felony use of a firearm . She also faces up to five years for carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm into an occupied building . Torres was found guilty of all charges relating to firing at McDonald's drive-thru window in Michigan in February 2014 after they failed to give her bacon . Just hours earlier, the same restaurant had made the same mistake . She will appear in court on April 21 for her sentencing .
Sophie Brannan, 11, was killed when she was hit by Christopher Hannah in November last year . A heroin addict is facing a long jail sentence after he admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit and run crash while on bail. Christopher Hannah was high on drugs when he ploughed into Sophie Brannan, her friend and her friend’s uncle as they walked home from local shops on November 14 last year. Hannah, 33, lost control of his hired Vauxhall Astra, mounted the pavement and hit the three victims so hard from behind they were thrown over the car. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury. Hannah, the son of a bankrupt businessman, fled the scene in Sandbank Street in Glasgow’s Maryhill – but later called a friend to say he had been ‘driving like a madman’ and had hit someone. At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, the father of three pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and was remanded in custody for sentence next month. The court heard Hannah’s car, which he had hired a month earlier, mounted the pavement and hit the gable end of a nearby building before careering into Sophie and her companions. Prosecutor Allan Nicol said: ‘This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground. Another motorist witnessed the carnage and immediately turned back to help poor Sophie.’ Witnesses saw Hannah speed into Maryhill Road, with his badly dented car being ‘driven erratically’ before he crashed into a taxi. The cab driver tailed Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away. Mr Nicol said: ‘At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper, then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off. ‘Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed he was under the influence of some substance.’ Paramedics took Sophie to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones. Tributes left at the scene after the crash last year. Hannah fled scene but pleaded guilty at High Court in Glasgow yesterday . She remained in intensive care overnight, but died the following day. The court heard Sophie’s friend suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy. Mr Nicol said: ‘She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts. She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.’ The girl’s uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later. However, he eventually required surgery and is likely to have ‘long-term restriction’ in movement to his right shoulder. The court heard Hannah stayed on the run for two days after Sophie’s death, despite promising his partner he would hand himself in. When police finally arrested him, they found heroin hidden inside his boxer shorts. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury . Accident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for the crash. They said he took ‘a conscious decision’ to drive while impaired and failed to stop because he knew he had taken drugs and was ‘aware of the ramifications’. Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin. He has 14 previous convictions for crimes including possessing an offensive weapon and road traffic charges and was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow’s Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash. Hannah’s advocate Thomas Ross said: ‘He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.’	Christopher Hannah, 33, was high on drugs when he hit Sophie Brannan .

Chinese officials have claimed Muslims from the country's western region are travelling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS - before returning home  to take part in plots against the communist rule. Authorities in  Xinjiang said they were planning to strengthen a crackdown on terrorism and extremism in the area, home to the minority Muslim Uighur, some of whom want their own independent state. But officials failed to provide any further details to back up their claims - although The Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in December about 300 Chinese are fighting alongside the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Recruits: Chinese officials have claimed people from Xinjiang province, home to the minority Muslim Uighur, have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside ISIS . Separatists: Some of the Uighur want their own state, like these delegates from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and the area has been beset by violence in recent years . 'There are Uighurs that have fled overseas and joined the Islamic State,' said Zhang Chunxian, Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, on Tuesday. 'The organisation has a huge international influence and Xinjiang can't keep aloof from it and we have already been affected. 'We have also found that some who fought returned to Xinjiang to participate in terrorist plots.' China has previously expressed concerns about the rise of ISIS, fearing it will fuel unrest and violence in Xinjiang, where some seek to set up an independent state called East Turkestan. Xinjiang has seen repeated violence, as members of the Muslim Uighur have bristled under what they say is repressive Chinese government rule. Beijing has previously blamed the violence on Islamic militants with foreign connections who are seeking an independent state in Xinjiang, but has offered little evidence and ignored calls for independent investigations. Uighur groups say police have used indiscriminate deadly force against people protesting the government's policies in the region. Chinese officials have started cracking down on the use of the veil in public, but tensions between the two groups have been on the increase for years. Pictured: . A Uighur man passes part of the old city of Kashgar . Attacks blamed on Uighurs have also occurred in other parts of the country, including a car which plowed into Beijing's Tiananmen Gate in 2013, killing five people. Many of the group, who have traditionally followed a moderate form of Islam, have also begun adopting practices more commonly seen in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, such as full-face veils for women in the face of the crackdown. Some Xinjiang cities have placed restrictions on Islamic dress, including the capital Urumqi, which banned the wearing of veils in public late last year. Zhang said authorities would take measures to stop people from going abroad to fight with the group, and that he expects 'fewer and fewer cases' of that happening. 'We are confident that we can fix it,' he said. Another official, Shohrat Zakir, said a yearlong crackdown on terrorist activities in the region 'has won wide support from people of all ethnic groups.'	Claims people from minority Muslim group are travelling to fight with ISIS . Some are then returning to home state of Xinjiang to plot against Chinese .

Violence has spread from Xinjiang to Beijing as they fight 'repressive rule' But Xinjiang's Community Party secretary 'confident' problem can be fixed .
The Phoenix Zoo has confessed to what it's calling an 'em-bear-assing' mistake regarding one of its animals. Park officials were planning to transfer Luka to Nashville, Tennessee, when they discovered that the two-year-old Andean bear is a female, not a male as thought. According to keepers, the species' genitalia are highly undeveloped before the age of two, making it very difficult to determine gender. The Phoenix Zoo was planning to transfer Luka to Nashville, Tennessee, when they recently discovered that the Andean bear is a female, not a male as thought (above pictured in July 2013, left, and a year later, right) Apparently the Andean bear - native to South America - is also particularly difficult to sex because there has been limited captive breeding across the U.S. Many have been incorrectly sexed as cubs at other facilities in the past, the Phonenix Zoo notes. Luka was the first Andean cub successfully born and raised at the park. She was given her first medical exam at four months old when her gender was determined. She hadn't been handled too much since the check-up, as employees felt she was doing 'very well' with her mother, Rio. The animal hadn’t been handled too much since her first check-up at four months old - when her sex was determined - as employees felt she was doing very well with her mother, Rio (pictured together, above) It wasn’t until last week, when Luka underwent a routine examination and health evaluation that it was found 'he' was actually a female bear. The zoo said Luka still might go to Nashville, but now that they know she's a 'she', it opens up other options for the bear's participation in a breeding program. Experts called the mistake 'great news for the management of this rare bear'. The concluded: 'All births are critically important for this species as they are so rare in zoos, and having another young female is beneficial to the entire breeding program and survival of the species.'	Park officials were planning to transfer the animal to Tennessee when they discovered they had got the sex wrong . Experts say it is an easy mistake to make as the Andean bear cubs' genitalia are highly undeveloped before the age of two .
Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart has praised Kevin Pietersen's 'outstanding' character, but admitted the batsman's chances of an England return are slim. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey to play in LV= County Championship Division Two in a bid to win a Test recall for the Ashes this summer. The 34-year-old was sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash, but Stewart revealed he has never had any problems with his attitude. Kevin Pietersen has been hailed for his 'outstanding character' by Surrey chief Alec Stewart . Pietersen shared a picture of himself celebrating Australia's World Cup win with James Faulkner . Surrey cricket director Stewart (right) can't see a way back for Pietersen with England . 'He's been as good as gold with us. If he was a bad character we wouldn't have had him,' he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Whenever he's been with us he has been outstanding. He's helped the youngsters, he's been in the nets, he's put on batting clinics and he's tried his heart out. So hopefully, and I have no reason to disbelieve, he will be exactly the same this time, if not even more hard working and desperate to score runs.' Stewart accepted, though, that Pietersen's hopes of playing for England again were likely to be dashed. Pietersen was axed by England following the controversial whitewash by Australia in last year's Ashes . Test captain Alastair Cook (left) admits an England recall is unlikely for the Surrey batsman . ECB managing director Paul Downton has been steadfast in his appraisal that Pietersen will not come back - as have national selector James Whitaker and coach Peter Moores, while Test captain Alastair Cook rated the prospect 'highly unlikely'. 'If England are winning, they have a good West Indies tour which we expect, then it's going to take an injury or a huge loss of form for a vacancy to become available,' Stewart added. 'But all Kevin can do and, that's what he's said to us, he's going to score runs, sit back and see what happens.'	Kevin Pietersen has joined Surrey in bid to win England recall for Ashes .

Shocking new images have emerged showing the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young  men who jump on to and off speeding trains in Mexico in a desperate attempt to reach the United States. The majority of those attempting to hitch a ride on the trains are from Central American countries like Honduras and El Salvador who are willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to work illegally in menial jobs should they ever actually reach the U.S.. Referring to America as 'the promised land' the train hoppers that manage to make it on to a speeding locomotive are seen clinging on for dear life as they tear through the countryside of northern Mexico to the border they stand little to no chance of actually making it across.

Raul had both legs amputated after he tried to jump on a moving train in Tenosique . Before the U.S.-bound trains appear on the horizon, the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern Mexico. Many of them have already travelled thousands of miles from countries deeper in South America - but their journey is far from finished. While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards. Instead they wait out in the Mexican countryside, where they are unlikely to have been spotted and make the death-defying leap on to trains speeding along the rails. While many somehow manage to make it on to the trains, others are unsurprisingly dragged beneath the 36-inch steel wheels and crushed to death. One of the biggest threats to the young men's lives is exhaustion. Having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open, when the time comes for them to make the all-important jump, their bodies fail them and they either fatally miscalculate the leap, or else suffer life-changing disabilities.

Making the leap: While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards . Dozens of desperate young men die every year jumping on to U.S.-bound trains in Mexico. The majority have come from poverty-stricken countries such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and are aged in their late teens or early 20s. Another thing unites the men too - their all or nothing desire to start new lives in the United States where, as illegal immigrants, they are unlikely to find work other than as exploited, below-minimum-wage workers in restaurants, cleaning and maintenance businesses and on building sites. 'The trains are for the poorest of the poor,' says Carlos Miranda, a migration expert in the southern state of Chiapas. 'If they thought they had any other choice, they would take it.' Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique, a modest farming town south of the Yucatan - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks. If they are lucky, they will hang on long enough to make it to Mexico City, where they switch lines in the massive train yards, and then in dwindling numbers head out again, pushing north to the U.S. border, or as close as they can get. The risks are enormous: They must navigate a spidery network of aging rails — the trains themselves sometimes jump the tracks — through jungles and deserts and mountains, searing heat and icy rain. They face attacks by the bandits and gun-toting gangs that patrol the trains, and must hop off and on at immigration checkpoints, risking limb and life each time. The trip can take weeks, or months, if you allow for all the pitfalls and stopovers to earn a few pesos for food. Death-defying: Mexico tries to catch the train hoppers before they enter the country. But the southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all' Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique and Tabasco (pictured) - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks .

Forty million people live in Central America, and nearly half are poor. In Honduras, 46 per cent live in extreme poverty. In Guatemala, 130,000 lost their homes in Hurricane Stan. El Salvador is crippled by drought, and in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, the majority of the people have little or no work. This is why they come. Mexico tries to catch the train jumpers before they enter the country. But this southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all.'

If they can, they wait for the trains to stop in the dusty yards then make a dash for it.

David Cameron's children cheered him on today as he demolished Labour's newest election attack by vowing not to increase VAT after the general election. At the final Prime Minister's Questions before Parliament is dissolved, Mr Cameron stunned Ed Miliband by immediately agreeing that the shopping levy will not rise under the Tory government. The Tory leader's wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen were in the public gallery cheering on what could be his final Commons appearance as Prime Minister. They looked delighted as Mr Cameron tore into his opponent, branding him 'Alex Salmond's poodle' and mocking him over his fraught Labour leadership battle with David Miliband. David Cameron today demolished Labour's newest election attack by vowing not to increase VAT after the general election . Delighted Tory MPs cheered Mr Cameron's final appearance at the Despatch Box before the general election on May 7 . Labour yesterday unveiled a new poster warning of Tory VAT hikes after the election.  The headline rate of VAT stands at 20 per cent after George Osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency Budget in 2010. Labour yesterday vowed not to increase the duty, but Mr Osborne refused to follow suit. Mr Miliband directly challenged the Prime Minister on the issue today, expecting the Tory to dodge the question. But Mr Cameron hit back: 'Straight answers deserve straight questions and the answer's yes.' He then challenged Labour to rule out an increase in National Insurance which Mr Miliband refused to commit to. But hours after the leader's disastrous Commons outing, Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced he would commit in the election manifesto not to hike National Insurance. Labour's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning 'the Tories will raise VAT' to help balance the books . With a major Labour attack shredded to raucous cheers from the Tory benches, Mr Miliband tried to salvage the situation by claiming: 'Nobody is going to believe him because of his extreme spending plans.' In response the Prime Minister responded by repeatedly challenging Mr Miliband to rule out a rise in national insurance under a Labour government - which he declined to do. Mr Cameron declared: 'Straight answer from me, straight question to him - I have ruled out VAT, will he rule out national insurance contributions, yes or no?' Mr Miliband sought to deflect the question, saying: 'He'll have plenty of time to ask questions after May 7.' Mr Cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the Despatch Box, with wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen looking on from the public gallery . ON SNP'S ALEX SALMOND . 'Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence.' ON BEING A LAME DUCK PM . 'I'll tell you what is a lame duck and that is trying to get into Downing Street on the back of Alex Salmond's coat-tails.' ON ED MILIBAND . 'Never mind talk of ducks, I'm looking at Alex Salmond's poodle.' ON RICHARD III AND LABOUR'S BORTHERS AT WAR . 'The last time someone did in one of their relatives to get the top job and country ended in chaos.' ...AND ONE GAFFE . To Labour MP Michael Connarty: 'First of all can I pay tribute to the honourable gentleman who is standing down at the election.' Connarty: "I'm not!" Mr Cameron went on: "Sorry, let me rephrase that. I've got to say. I want to defend the [briefing] team. This is my 146th appearance at the Despatch Box during Prime Minister's Questions and they normally get these things right.' Mr Cameron boosted Tory morale with a a series of personal attacks on the Labour leader. After being called a chicken for avoiding TV debates and a lame duck for announcing plans to quit by 2020, Mr Cameron shouted backed: 'Never mind talk of ducks I'm looking at Alex Salmond's poodle.' Delighted Tory MPs started shouting out 'woof woof' as the 30-minute session came close to descending into farce. Moments later he seized on the burial of Richard III this week to mock Mr Miliband for standing against his own brother for the Labour leadership. 'The last time someone did in one of their relatives to get the top job and country ended in chaos,' Mr Cameron said. Mr Cameron arrived in the Commons on the back foot, after his surprise announcement that he would not seek a third term as Prime Minister if he is elected again this year. Mr Miliband sought to mock the PM, saying he was pleased he had 'announced his retirement plans'. The Labour leader said: 'You said it was because you believed in giving straight answers to straight questions. After five years of Prime Minister's Questions, that was music to my ears. 'So here's a straight question: will you now rule out a rise in VAT?' Mr Cameron shot back: 'In 43 days I plan to arrange your retirement.' And  the astonishment of MPs on the Labour benches he categorically ruled out a VAT increase. He said: 'You are right, straight answers are deserved by straight questions. The answer is yes.' Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter. Shouting over the noise, Mr Miliband ploughed on: 'Nobody is going to believe it. Nobody is going to believe it because of your extreme spending plans, because your numbers don't add up and because you promised it last time and you broke your promise.' Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase . The noise eventually overwhelmed Mr Miliband and Commons Speaker John Bercow was forced to intervene and call for calm. Mr Miliband then tried to challenge Mr Cameron on the claim that spending cuts in the next three years 'will be greater even than anything seen in the last five?' But Mr Cameron insisted: 'You are wrong about that.' He then challenged Mr Miliband to answer a questions. 'Straight answer from me, straight question to you - I have ruled out VAT, will you rule out national insurance contributions? Yes or no?' Mr Miliband said: 'You will have plenty of time to ask questions after May 7 and I'm afraid to say your own Office for Budget Responsibility says a much sharper squeeze on real spending than anything seen over the past five years.'

Misfiring Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao might be struggling to win over English fans with his modest scoring return of just four goals from 19 games, but he will be pleased to know his popularity hasn't diminished too much abroad. Training with his Colombia team-mates in Barhain ahead of the South American country's mini-Asian tour, Falcao was warmly embraced by one supporter who ran on the pitch to reach him.

The hug will no doubt come as a lift for Falcao who is under huge pressure to improve his poor club form. Previously viewed as one of the game's top marksmen while at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco, the Colombian has failed to reach those same heights since agreeing to a big-money loan deal at Old Trafford.

Chef: Police think Claudia Lawrence was murdered . The detective leading the search for missing chef Claudia Lawrence revealed last night he is ‘actively pursuing new leads’ on the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 and may make more arrests in the coming weeks and months. He warned anyone who had not yet disclosed details about their relationship with the chef or the events in the days leading up to her disappearance to come forward or risk arrest. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009, and reported missing by her father on March 20 after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at York University. Police believe she was murdered. A number of new searches have been carried out since 2013, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's house in Heworth, York, and a fingertip search of the alleyway that leads to the back of her home. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said: ‘In the months since we started our review, we have made very significant progress. We have arrested and interviewed two men about Claudia's disappearance. More arrests possible: Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn (pictured), of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 . Fingertip search: Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway near Miss Lawrence's home in the Heworth area of York has ‘potential significance’ in explaining what happened to the chef and is still being investigated . 'One remains on bail while our inquiries in relation to him continue. In the coming weeks and months we may make additional arrests as we continue to develop our lines of inquiry. ‘In the light of information that has only recently come to the fore, we are actively pursuing what are rightly described as new leads.’ Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway has ‘potential significance’ in explaining what happened to Miss Lawrence and is still being investigated. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some have deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef, who was 35 at the time. Appeal: Miss Lawrence was last seen in March 2009, and was reported missing by her father Peter (above) Probe: Police believe Miss Lawrence - seen on CCTV on her way home from work in 2009 - was murdered . Map: She did not arrive for a shift at York University . He said: ‘I would make a further appeal for those to come forward now and provide these explanations. ‘If I reach the point where we believe people continue to obstruct this investigation or assist or cover up for the person or persons responsible, they will be arrested.’ Mr Malyn continued: ‘Six years have passed since Claudia disappeared. ‘For her loved ones, the pain caused by her absence and the circumstances of her disappearance has not faded. 'And nor, I assume, has the guilt and knowledge that one or more people have about what happened to this young woman.' He added: ‘Ultimately, we may not be able to prove what happened to Claudia, or be able to find her. 'But that will not be for lack of determination, tenacity and meticulous detective work, nor whilst there are still clues that need to be investigated. ‘If you know what happened to Claudia, or know that you have some relevant information but have not yet come forward, then do so, today. ‘Six years is a long time to live with that knowledge.’	Dai Malyn says North Yorkshire Police has made 'significant progress' Force began reviewing case in 2013 and may make more arrests soon . Miss Lawrence was last seen in 2009 and is thought to have been killed .
Taron Stead, 17, was cycling to work when he was hit by a car in Sheffield. The driver got out but told him she would be late so left him at side of the road . A mother who hit a teenage cyclist in her car while on the school run refused to help him because she 'didn't want her children to be late'. Taron Stead, 17, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was cycling to work in early morning rush hour traffic when he was hit by a silver car and knocked off his brand new mountain bike. The woman then got out of the car and reportedly told him her children were inside and would be upset by the blood, before driving off without exchanging details. The IT apprentice was left at the side of the road  with cuts and bruises to his hands and face and was cared for by staff from nearby Sheffield University until paramedics arrived. His furious mother, Naomi Pickard, 45, has released a photograph of his injuries in that hope that it will encourage witnesses to come forward. She told the Sheffield Star: 'Taron said the woman in the car got out looked over at him, told him she had children in the car who were upset and she didn't want them to be late for school, then the car drove off. 'I can't believe anyone would leave an injured child at the side of the road after a crash, but it was rush hour and it would have been busy so I am hoping that witnesses come forward and help the police trace the driver. 'Fortunately he was wearing a helmet, or I dread to think what might have happened.' The teenager had only bought the bike three weeks ago with money from his first apprenticeship wage. A nearby Halfords store has since offered to repair his bike free of charge after hearing about the accident. A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: 'On Friday, March 6, it is reported that a cyclist was travelling towards Brook Hill, along Crookes Valley Road, onto Winter Street . He was hit at the junction of Mushroom Lane in Sheffield and Crookes Valley Road (pictured) and left at the side of the road covered in blood. Staff from the nearby university stayed with him until paramedics arrived . 'At about 8.30am, the cyclist and a vehicle turning onto Mushroom Lane were in collision. The cyclist suffered facial injuries and bruising. 'It is reported that the vehicle left the scene. The vehicle is described as a silver Ford, either a Focus or Mondeo.' Anyone with information is asked to call South Yorkshire Police on 101.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spent 21 months since returning to Stamford Bridge trying to mould the team spirit that he craves - and now he seems to have achieved it, labelling his side as a band of 'brothers'. Chelsea ground out a hard-fought 1-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday night and their manager reserved special praise for the togetherness of his players, with John Terry and co embracing at the final whistle before applauding the travelling support. The scenes were similar to a defining game of Mourinho's first spell at Chelsea, in an away game at Blackburn in February 2005 when Arjen Robben split the sides in a gritty Ewood Park clash.

Terry, Gary Cahill (second left), Thibaut Courtois (second right) and Branislav Ivanovic (right) celebrate . Mourinho celebrates victory at full-time in what he considers one of the toughest away games of the season . And manager Mourinho believes that collective show of strength is exactly the sort of thing the league leaders will need to get them over the line in the Barclays Premier League title race. The Special One also confirmed that his players would be enjoying two days off with a week's gap until they play Paris Saint-Germain in the return of their Champions League last-16 tie. ‘My team were brothers on the pitch,' Mourinho said. 'That is important if you are to win the most difficult league in the world. I want to sleep now until midday. We could easily have lost two points. ‘The way West Ham play, nobody is better than them. They are the best at the way they play. It is not just to play football, the pressure, the tension and the emotion, my players were fantastic. ‘I told the referee is it very difficult to be a ref here, because of the style of their game. Lots of long balls. West Ham had lots of balls in the box, very difficult, very intense and really difficult for the referee. They complain for everything, the crowd is behind them and it is really, really difficult.' The Chelsea players, led by Mourinho (fourth left) leave the pitch at Ewood Park after winning in 2005 .

Eden Hazard scored the winner at Upton Park and was one of Chelsea's best players even after playing a full part in Chelsea's Capital One Cup final triumph over Tottenham on Sunday. And Mourinho led the plaudits for the playmaker who he has criticised in the past for his work ethic. 'Eden Hazard was fantastic,' he said. 'He is punished by opponents in a very hard way. Not in a violent way, just an aggressive football way because they tried to stop him but the kid is playing, scoring and defending.' But the Portuguese coach was less impressed with the rescheduling of Chelsea's game against Leicester, which could have been held this weekend with both clubs out of the FA Cup but will instead take place on April 9. ‘It is not a good thing that we play Leicester in two months now - that’s not a good thing, for someone in the title race to have played one match less,' he said.

The new Isa for first-time buyers is unlikely to solve the housing crisis – and could even worsen the property price 'bubble', economic experts warned yesterday. The Help to Buy Isa was announced by the Chancellor in Wednesday's budget, delighting thousands of young buyers struggling to save for a deposit. Under the plans, the Government will boost people's savings by £50 for every £200 they put away, with a maximum bonus of £3,000. And couples can have separate Isas, meaning they can receive a £6,000 bonus towards their first home. The Help to Buy Isa was announced by the Chancellor in Wednesday's budget, delighting thousands of young buyers struggling to save for a deposit . The policy has been welcomed by mortgage brokers, who believe it could inject some life into a slowing property market. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies and two leading free market think-tanks yesterday warned that the scheme could backfire. They said it would only fuel demand without addressing the severe lack of new homes across the UK. IFS economist Stuart Adam said those who would find it easiest to take up the offer were people already able to afford a deposit. 'This is a rather dubious policy, intended to help first-time buyers which is more than likely to have the effect of inflating housing prices,' he said. 'A lot of the benefit of the policy will go to people who would have done that saving anyway.' The policy has been welcomed by mortgage brokers, who believe it could inject some life into a slowing property market . The Institute of Economic Affairs described the new Isa as 'hopeless' and said it offered short-term help while failing to tackle the affordability crisis. It also warned it could worsen the 'housing bubble' by driving up demand. The TaxPayers' Alliance said the real problem was Britain's 'restrictive planning regulations' – an issue the Isa failed to tackle. 'This expensive policy will do nothing to address the housing shortage,' a spokesman said. Jonathan Harris, of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, added: 'Yesterday's Budget announcement about the Help to Buy Isa is a welcome boost for first-time buyers. 'However, we would like to see a greater emphasis on building more homes. There is a danger that giving first-time buyers assistance with a deposit will only push up property prices further.' But Peter Rollings, of estate agents Marsh & Parsons, said the Isas, coupled with cheap mortgage rates, would 'up the ante in the housing market in the coming months'. David Hollingworth, of brokers London & Country, added that the scheme would particularly help in areas where house prices had been 'outpacing the rate at which first-time buyers can save'. The Help to Buy Isas will be offered by banks and building societies in the autumn. They can be opened only by first-time buyers, and while money cannot be transferred straight from a relative's account, there is nothing to stop a relative transferring money into an account belonging to the buyer, who can then transfer it into their Isa. The Treasury says it will not decide exactly how and when to pay the money until it has consulted with the industry. The bonus will be available on home purchases of up to £450,000 in London and up to £250,000 outside London.	Help to Buy Isa was announced by the Chancellor in Wednesday's budget .

A schoolteacher who says she could never get a boyfriend because she looked like a MAN spent £40,000 on 22 different plastic surgery operations - and is now dating. Gina Blacks, of Tottenham, north London, travelled abroad to five different countries for operations including boob jobs, liposuction and tummy tucks and implants to her chin and hair transplants. The 39-year-old underwent the ops because she was so sick of receiving jibes about her manly appearance she was left feeling like an 'undateable monster'. Cruel men left Gina Blacks feeling like an undatable monster, but after under-going £40,000 worth of surgery and having 22 operations including boob jobs and liposuction she finally feels good about herself . Gina had hair restoration in 2009 in Bangkok, she has traveled around the world to have her different operations . But after eight years of surgery she now feels like a movie star - and is being inundated with attention from hunky blokes. Now Gina says men can't leave her alone and she is constantly being stopped in the street by bachelors begging for a date. Gina said: 'Men who were repulsed by me in the past are now stopping me in the streets and begging to take me out. 'I spent my younger years completely alone, wishing I had a boyfriend. Now they're wishing they had me.' Sick of feeling unattractive, Gina - in 2007, then aged 31 - began ploughing her savings into cosmetic surgery after a lifetime of feeling lonely. Gina was 31 when she first began ploughing into her savings to fund her plastic surgery - she said the bullying affected her confidence and she felt like she had no friends . Gina used to be a teacher but she has now left that behind to start her own online store: Gina Blacks' Online Beauty Store . Gina then left teaching in 2013 to launch Gina Blacks' Online Beauty Store and had her most recent operation in summer last year. She, who is currently looking for a new man, said: 'The worst period that I lived through was in my adolescents, during school and even at university people would call out rude comments to me. 'It affected my confidence I had no friends. People didn't want to know me or be my friend. I wasn't attractive to people for sexual relationships. 'I thought I looked ugly and manly and I had problems dating, men didn't find me attractive. I had a few flings but I just didn't find myself attractive.' Gina said she had a few flings before she embarked on her operations but she did not find herself attractive . Gina says she now feels like a model thanks to her £40,000 make-over but she wouldn't put herself at the levels of Kate Moss and co . But she believes spending eight years in an out of hospitals across England, Tunisia, Pakistan, Cyprus, Belgium, Thailand, has paid off despite having to undergo corrective surgery for botched operations. She said: 'I wouldn't put myself at the level of Kate Moss, Beyonce or Naomi Campbell but I feel like a model. 'It may have cost me my life savings but it was worth it. I only have one regret, I should have transformed myself sooner.'	Gina Blacks had surgery after being called, 'manly' by cruel men .

Tunis (CNN)Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi confirmed that a third person took part in last week's Bardo museum terror attack in an interview Sunday with French TV Station iTele. "There were for certain three terrorists," Essebsi said.  "There is one on the run. He will not get far." Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. He said Yassine was "known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored," but not known or being followed for anything special. Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack, including four directly linked to it, according to Essebsi. The development came a day after the bodies of four Italian tourists slain in the attack arrived back in Italy, an official with the Tunis Crisis Center told CNN, but 14 victims' remains still lie in the morgue. Most of the 23 victims were foreigners, making the process of identification more complicated. Nineteen of them were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. French, Spanish, Italian, British, Japanese, Russian and Colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far. The bodies of the Italians were met in Rome by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony. Eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in Tunisia on Saturday, the official at the Tunis Crisis Center said. An uncle of Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. But he said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. "It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back," he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. He had known his nephew well, he said. "After the revolution of 2011 he started to pray, before he would drink beers from time to time, like a young Tunisian. He wasn't extreme in any way." The only thing that raised questions was that Yassine had disappeared for about a month, he said. Although his nephew said he'd gone to the Tunisian city of Sfax to work, his family now suspected he had been in Libya because of the phone numbers he called from. "When he came back his behavior was the same: he was still himself, calm, serious. Nobody noticed anything, even the neighbors I spoke to," said Abeld Malik Labidi. "He said hello to everyone, he prayed, he took his coffee, even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work." Abeld Malik Labidi said Yassine's father, sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack. Officers had seized his nephew's computer and phone, as well as taking samples of his fingerprints, he said. A cousin of Yassine, who asked not to be named, told CNN that the family was shocked by what had happened. "We are all shocked, we lost someone even if what he did was wrong, may God forgive him. Those he killed were innocent, why would you go and harm Australians or Japanese ... our Islam doesn't mention about killing people, Islam has never been this," he said. He also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized, saying he was "a normal Tunisian guy ... but not an extremist." Security Minister Rafik Chelly said on Friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in Libya. The suspects were activated from sleeper cells in Tunisia, he said. He did not say which group activated them, or with whom they trained. "They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there," he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV. Like Tunisia, Libya saw its longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the Arab Spring. But unlike its neighbor to the west, Libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by Islamist militants. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which it said targeted "crusaders and apostates" with "automatic weapons and hand grenades." CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. That bloodshed is "just the start," the ISIS message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow, but nonetheless adds extra urgency for Tunisian investigators. CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from Tunis and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Radina Gigova and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

Anti-police: Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee with a woman believed to be his wife . Great orator, reads a glowing reference from one of lawyer Tasnime Akunjee’s appreciative former clients. The testimonial is included on Mr Akunjee’s CV on a professional networking site; the person who wrote it is named, so it’s not made up. But the identity of the individual in question is something we shall come back to because it tells us rather a lot about this silver-tongued solicitor. In any event, Mr Akunjee’s skills as an ‘orator’, for want of a better word, have been much in evidence on the national stage recently. You might have heard Mr Akunjee in full flow on the radio or caught a glimpse of him on the evening news earlier this month in his (very lawyerly) charcoal-grey, three-piece suit and swish purple silk tie. What he had to say was certainly splashed across the papers. Mr Akunjee, 37, was giving evidence to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee with his latest clients: the families of the three girls from Tower Hamlets, East London, who fled the UK to join Islamic State. Mr Akunjee denounced the authorities for allowing Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15‑year-olds Shamima Begum and Amira Abase to leave Britain and reach Syria after going missing in December. He castigated the police for failing to inform their parents that a school friend had vanished in similar circumstances a few weeks earlier. And he demanded — and got — a grovelling apology from the country’s top police officer for the ‘mistake’ that, in the eyes of most neutral observers, probably had little or no bearing on what happened to the youngsters. ‘Relations can be built after they have broken down only after an apology,’ Mr Akunjee insisted loftily. The audacity takes your breath away. For we now know that the father of Amira Abase, one of the missing schoolgirl ‘jihadi brides’, is himself a supporter of militant Islam. Images posted online show Abase Hussen taking part in a notorious Islamist rally back in September 2012 in London, when flags of Israel and the U.S. were burned. Also in attendance that day was hate preacher Anjem Choudary, as well as Michael Adebowale, one of the two Muslim converts who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby. Abase Hussen could not have found a more suitable lawyer to front the families’ anti-police campaign. Abase Hussen (circled right), whose daughter fled the UK last month to join ISIS, was pictured at an Islamic protest alongside Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale (circled left) Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . Tasnime Akunjee has gone on record in the past to declare that no Muslim should co-operate with the British police force because the Government’s Prevent counter-terror policy is ‘straightforward, paid-for spying on the community’. He once asked in an internet rant: ‘Does she [Home Secretary Theresa May] have Nazi blood in her veins?’ Imagine the furore if someone had insulted a Muslim leader in the same vein. The wider public might not have heard of Mr Akunjee until now but behind his self-righteous performance in the Commons, behind his fancy legal credentials, behind his respectable upbringing (his father and two younger brothers are all doctors), is an individual with links to what some might describe as the ‘who’s who’ of Islamic extremists in Britain. Consider, to begin with, a cartoon posted on his Facebook page on January 12, less than a week after the Charlie Hebdo atrocity in Paris. It depicted murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier blowing himself up by detonating a suicide vest comprising of rolled-up copies of the magazine which resembled sticks of dynamite, the clear implication being that the journalist was to blame for his own death and those of nine colleagues for frequently publishing satires about the prophet Mohammed. That message reinforced a previous Facebook entry on the day of the Paris attack itself. ‘Please don’t REPEATEDLY poke a sleeping bear,’ wrote Mr Akunjee, ‘then cry when it bites “your head off,” parce que ce est vraiment tres stupide [French for ‘because that is really very stupid].’ Could there be a more inappropriate way of behaving, given his profession? Mr Akunjee (right), 37, gave evidence to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee alongside Mr Hussen and his family . Mr Akunjee’s father arrived in this country from Bangladesh in the Seventies. He runs a GP surgery with his two other sons in Haringey, North London. Mr Akunjee’s nauseating performance before MPs closely echoed preposterous claims made by ‘human rights group’ Cage last week that MI5 was responsible for radicalising Mohammed Emwazi, the IS butcher known to the world as Jihadi John. Just a coincidence? Unlikely. In only January, Mr Akunjee — surprise, surprise — shared a platform with Cage when he argued that the UK had a ‘Jekyll and Hyde, two-tier legal system’ which was ‘a breeding ground for fascism’. Mr Akunjee said Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo was 'created' by the security services . In an article carried on the Cage website, he also claimed that the security services ‘created’ Michael Adebolajo — who with Michael Adebowale killed Woolwich Fusilier Lee Rigby — by ‘making his life so difficult’. Mr Akunjee represented a close friend of Adebolajo, who was sentenced to three years for terrorist offences in 2013. And who do you think the glowing testimonial mentioned in the opening paragraph of this article was from? It was penned by someone called Abbas Iqbal, a former member of the so-called ‘Blackburn Resistance’. He served two years back in 2010 following the discovery in his home of gruesome beheading videos and an arsenal of weapons, including knives, machetes, a sword and ammunition. ‘I recommend Mr T. Akunjee for all Muslim brothers and sisters arrested under the Terrorism Act,’ he wrote. ‘He is a true and genuine friend and brother to all who meet him.’ The reference is included on Mr Akunjee’s biography on professional networking site LinkedIn. They say you can judge a person by the company he keeps. Might the same yardstick be extended to the company a person keeps online? Among his other Facebook friends are a notorious hate preacher, a former member of banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun, a one-time Guantanamo detainee, and, almost inevitably, Asim Qureshi, the leading figure in Cage, the man who for years was in regular contact with Jihadi John, to name but a few of Mr Akunjee’s unsavoury contacts. This was the man, remember, who was given a public platform in the Commons. Mr Akunjee — as the Mail has revealed in previous articles — is part of a network of extremists spreading poisonous propaganda that is turning the heads of so many young Muslims. But Mr Akunjee, like Asim Qureshi, has much for which to thank the country he despises. The solicitor is also friends on Facebook with Asim Qureshi - the leading figure in Cage who was in regular contact with Jihadi John . We now know that the father of Amira Abase, one of the missing schoolgirl ‘jihadi brides’ (pictured), is himself a supporter of militant Islam . He studied law at two of its universities: he was an undergraduate at Sussex and a postgraduate at Westminster. He was at Westminster, a college with an appalling reputation for campus radicalism, in 2007/08. Mohammed Emwazi/Jihadi John was enrolled at Westminster at that time on a computer programming course, but there is nothing to suggest they knew each other. Mr Akunjee, also known as Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, now works for Waterfords Solicitors in Brentford, West London. Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Home is a Victorian terrace in North London, where the curtains and blinds were drawn yesterday. But he was also recently living in a flat in a block near Marble Arch, where flats typically sell for more than £1 million. Mr Akunjee is pictured in the vicinity on Facebook in the company of an attractive blonde. Asked by one friend: ‘Who is she brother?’, he replies: ‘New wife.’ When another friend commented that she was ‘without hijab’ — a veil that covers the head and chest — Mr Akunjee informs him: ‘Working on it.’ Mr Akunjee’s first marriage to a law student he met at Sussex Uni lasted less than a year. ‘In Bangladeshi culture,’ said someone who knows the family, ‘it is usually the groom’s mother who finds the wife. She [Tasnime’s mother] was not happy that he married so quickly and divorced so quickly.’ But his career has gone from strength to strength. His latest case was given star billing at his law practice. The firm’s rolling Twitter feed repeated three tweets; all refer to the missing schoolgirls from Tower Hamlets in Syria and mentioning Mr Akunjee as having ‘conduct of the case of the three girls’. How Mr Akunjee, who is based on the other side of London, came to be representing the families or why they should need a lawyer in the first place is not clear. However, the families’ decision to effectively absolve themselves of any responsibility for the disappearance of their daughters, and scapegoat the police instead, has left them facing a backlash of criticism. Senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility to help stop the spreading of militant beliefs. Not in the eyes of Tasnime Akunjee, who once claimed that even a shop assistant who ‘sold a terrorist a toothbrush in Boots’ would be guilty of aiding and abetting terrorism under terror laws. In a recent video on an extremist YouTube channel, he also denied that those who call for the death of British soldiers should be defined as extremist because ‘I think it is actually a soldier’s job to die’. Mr Akunjee’s views are shared by others in his online community. Aren’t they, and not the police, the ones who are really driving so many young British Muslims into the hands of IS?

Liz Hurley's new TV show has been drubbed by US critics. The Royals, starring Hurley as a fictional Queen, and Joan Collins as her feisty mother, was described as ‘not a royally good time’ by The Hollywood Reporter.

Video emerged today apparently showing the three runaway British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled into Syria to become brides for Islamic State militants. The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was yesterday arrested for helping the trio cross the border. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, can be heard talking to an Arabic interpreter about  fake Syrian passports while laden with bags. The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. From there, they reportedly take a taxi to an arranged meeting point where they are greeted by the spy, named by Turkish media as Muhammed Al Rashad. Scroll down for videos . On the run: New footage has emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants . Caught on camera: The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border . Runaways: Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, are understood to have since reached the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK to join a friend last month . Footage shows him instructing them to take their baggage and not leave anything behind and says they will be in Syria within the hour. Al Rashad can be heard saying 'Come on sisters ... Don't forget anything. You will be there in an hour insh'Allah,' before the girls' luggage is unloaded from the taxi and the trio are helped into a silver minivan. He speaks both English and Arabic in the four minute-long video and his face is visible at several points. Al Rashad then allegedly delivered the girls to ISIS and returns to Turkey, where he is arrested, according to Daily Sabah. Separate footage released by Daily Sabah appears to show Al Rashad being taken into custody in Sanliurfa near the Syrian border. One report said he was a Syrian who was working for the Canadian intelligence service. Another said that he was a dentist. Turkish news agency Dogan said Rashad has been held in solitary confinement in a prison in Sanliurfa province since being caught. Citing his testimony to police, it said he had identified fighters he helped enter Syria to an official at Canada's embassy in Jordan. 'I have no intention of spying. My aim is to prevent terrorist activity,' Dogan quoted him as saying. Rashad also allegedly told the agency he had accompanied at least 25 foreign fighters so far to Gaziantep. He said: 'Border commanders within Islamic State instructed me where to drop these people. I drove them to Gaziantep city centre in a cab and handed them over to others. 'I don't know how and from where they took them to Syria.' Evidence: The secret camera shows an alleged spy working for the Canadian intelligence agency helping the girls with their bags and arranging their fake Syrian passports . Suspect: Separate footage claims to show the Canadian intelligence agent being led to the courthouse by plain-clothed police officers after he was arrested on suspicion of helping the cross into Syria . The film featuring the three girls was confiscated after his arrest. Turkish foreign minister Mehmet Cavusoglu yesterday said the suspect worked for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS. But he did not identify the country, saying only that it was not the United States or a member of the European Union. Canada's Office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness said: 'We are aware of these reports. 'We do not comment on operational matters of national security.' The footage shows the girls walking with another man who is suspected of helping them cross into Syria . Mr Cavusoglu, who was interviewed on Turkish channel A Haber TV, said he had shared the information with his British counterpart - Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said he had no information. The schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK last month. It emerged earlier this week that the three girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. A man has been arrested for allegedly helping three British schoolgirls - Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 (above) - cross into Syria to become Jihadi brides for Islamic State militants . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes . Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year. The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter. One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication. Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas. On the run: (l to r) Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes. They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State's stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities. Sought advice: Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year . It is thought they were staying with a British girl – believed to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined ISIS. The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK. 'We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,' he said. Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls' families – explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend's disappearance – had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted that 'with the benefit of hindsight' officers should have communicated directly with the families. But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology. However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this week. Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation. They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. He accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. Extreme beliefs: The Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) in Raqqa has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Evidence: Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee earlier this week . The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to the fourth girl's disappearance. However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs. 'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.' At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Islamic State seized large swathes of land last June, including territory close to the Turkish border. The U.S.-led coalition is using mostly air power in an attempt to push the Sunni militant group back.	Schoolgirls are heard talking to Arabic interpreter about a Syrian passport .

Families of Iraqis shot dead on the battlefield by British soldiers could sue the Ministry of Defence for human rights violations after a High Court ruling. A judgment stated that cases in which an Iraqi was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights Act. The landmark ruling could lead to over 1,200 claims, represented by Phil Shiner’s controversial Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), being investigated in UK courts. The families of Iraqi soldiers killed by British troops could sue the Ministry of Defence for human rights violations after a High Court ruling . Last night the Ministry of Defence said they were ‘concerned’ the court had taken such ‘an expansive view of the ECHR jurisdiction’ and would take the case to the appeals court. They also said it would likely encourage ‘large numbers of opportunistic’ claims which would have to be investigated at heavy costs to the taxpayer. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said the judgment was ‘absurd’. He said: ‘The prospect that every time British troops shoot or shell an enemy in battle they can be put before a court is beyond parody and utterly preposterous. ‘How on earth are our troops expected to attack the enemy or to defend themselves knowing that every shot they fire could land them in court. ‘There are two winners in this judgment - our country’s enemies and the ambulance-chasing lawyers who will now be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of pocketing even more millions of pounds of taxpayer’s hard-earned cash.’ Colonel Tim Collins, whose eve-of-battle speech inspired the nation before the Iraq War, added: ‘I believe that these very lawyers have serious questions to answer about the abuse of the UK’s willingness to investigate such claims for personal gain and to that effect their credibility and motivation must be questioned.’ Colonel Tim Collins, former commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment, (centre) said the lawyers that have put forward the ruling have 'serious questions to answer' Under the ECHR, the state has a duty to investigate allegations of wrongdoing. To what extent the Convention applies to the activities of British armed forces in Iraq was previously not clear and has resulted in extensive legal debate. The Secretary of State accepted that anyone who was taken into the custody of British forces in Iraq had certain rights under the Convention. Colonel Richard Kemp (pictured), former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said the judgment was ‘absurd’ Claimants however argued Article 1 of the ECHR, the obligation to respect human rights, should also be applied to those shot on the battlefield. But the Ministry of Defence refused to accept that individuals who were killed during security operations carried out by British forces in Iraq were ‘within the UK’s jurisdiction’. On Monday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who is the judge designated to deal with the cases on behalf of the Iraqis, ruled Article 1 applied to ‘those test cases where the individual was shot by a British soldier’. Firstly, ‘because such shootings occurred in the course of security operations in which British forces were exercising public powers that would normally be exercised by the government of Iraq’. Secondly, ‘because shooting someone involves the exercise of physical power over that person’. He said Article 1 did not apply in cases where British military vehicles were involved in road traffic collisions. He did however state that in circumstances where a soldier killed someone during an armed conflict, the killing would be deemed legal, provided it was consistent with International Humanitarian Law. In those cases the family members would be unable to claim compensation from the UK. PIL represent the majority of the claimants and they told the courts they expected the number of claims by the end of March 2015 to reach at least 1,230. The legal aid-funded firm was criticised last year after the Al Sweady Inquiry demolished its claims that soldiers tortured Iraqi detainees in May 2004. Their claimants have been seeking orders from the court to require the Secretary of State for Defence to investigate alleged human rights violations. PIL said in a statement: ‘He (Justice Legatt) has ruled that in respect of all the 1,200 plus judicial review cases he is dealing with, all of the following stations are within the jurisdiction of the ECHR.’ A judgment stated that cases in which an Iraqi was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights Act (pictured the ECHR building in Strasbourg, France) An MoD spokesman said: ‘While the court has rejected all but one of Public Interest Lawyers’ attempts to expand our investigative obligations, we are concerned that it has taken such an expansive view of ECHR jurisdiction. ‘The judgment does not require any change to conduct of UK military operations but it is likely to encourage large numbers of opportunistic claims which must be investigated and litigated at heavy cost to taxpayers. ‘We will therefore be seeking leave to appeal the jurisdiction issues to the Court of Appeal.’ A PIL spokesman said: ‘This is a very important judgment clarifying the application of the ECHR not just to Iraq personnel in Iraq but for future international peacekeeping operations and situations of armed conflict involving the UK. ‘It is very likely that this important question of legal principle will be appealed by the UK Government and heard by the Supreme Court.’	Judgment stated that cases where Iraqi was shot or wounded are included . Ruling could lead to over 1,200 claims being investigated in UK courts . Ministry of Defence is 'concerned' and will take the case to appeals court . Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander, said judgement was 'absurd' Under the ECHR, state has a duty to investigate allegations of wrongdoing .
Mike Brown has spoken for the first time about ‘one of the worst experiences of my life’ — missing out on a precious England cap. The 29-year-old full-back returns against Scotand on Saturday, a month after being knocked unconscious 12 minutes into England’s victory over Italy. Brown missed the defeat by Ireland after experiencing headaches while attempting to complete strict return-to-play protocols. Mike Brown is ready to return to England's starting XV after missing the Ireland defeat two weeks ago . Brown was knocked unconscious just 12 minutes into the win over Italy and was ruled out for two weeks . The England full back was treated on the pitch but could not continue as Stuart Lancaster's side won 47-17 . After agonising about owning up to his symptoms, knowing it would see him miss the trip to Dublin, he reluctantly alerted team doctors about his concussion. ‘Pulling out is one of the worst things I’ve ever had to go through in my whole life,’ Brown said. ‘As a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country’s jersey and representing everyone in the country. ‘I went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning — I usually get up about 7.30 to 8 — and during that time I was sat in my room thinking should I try the next stage, should I carry on? I’ve trained through headaches before so I could definitely have trained on and seen how it went. Brown is back in training and ready to play against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . Brown is supporting the RFU's latest concussion awareness initiative after missing the Ireland game . ‘But it wouldn’t have been good preparation for the team or me having that in the back of my mind. And obviously there’s the serious implications of the dangers and the risks involved. ‘The way I am, stubborn, desperate to play for my country, I probably would have (hidden symptoms in the past). But we’re all aware of it now and the example has been set by the England medical team and the coaching staff here for everyone else to see.’ Brown, who wins his 36th cap on Saturday, watched England’s defeat at home with his fiancee Eliza. ‘I was fuming, he said. ‘I wasn’t happy at all. Unfortunately, my fiancee had to go through it with me, poor lady. It wasn’t something I want to be doing too regularly, sat in my lounge, on the edge of my sofa, screaming at the TV!’ The England star admitted it was a bitter blow to be absent for the game in Dublin, but he had to be honest .

England full back will return against Scotland after recovering .
A dentist investigating a schoolgirl with swollen gums was horrified to discover more than a dozen maggots living inside her mouth. Ana Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil after complaining of a tingling sensation in her gums and things 'moving around'. Her stunned mother Adriana, 35, said: 'She had been saying for a few days that she felt something moving around in her mouth and at first I thought she was joking. 'I couldn't see anything and she didn't seem to be in pain. Ana Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil after complaining of a tingling sensation in her gums and things 'moving around' 'But then it started getting worse and no matter how much we brushed her teeth she said she still felt something. 'I know my daughter and she is not one to make up stories or lie, so eventually I took her to see a dentist.' There, Ana, from the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, was diagnosed with a rare form of oral myiasis. This is a fly lava maggot infection that grows in humans and animals. 'I couldn't believe it when they said she had a disease and then started pulling the maggots out,' said Ms Cardoso. 'I thought I was going to be sick.' A spokesman for the dental surgery said: 'There were 15 maggots in her mouth so we videoed the removal for our records as it is a rare occurrence. 'We also wanted to show the girl's family what had happened and warn others.' The video shows Ana's reaction as a surgeon in white gloves takes out one maggot at a time with a pair of tweezers. Ms Cardoso said: 'She was actually very calm throughout the whole process but I suspect that was more out of helplessness. 'I mean, what else could she do?' Myiasis comes from the Latin word 'myia' meaning fly and 'iasis' means disease. The flies' larvae can feed on the host's living or dead tissue, liquid body substance, or ingested food. When the tissues in the oral cavity are invaded by parasites, this is known as oral myiasis. Those at risk of the rare condition include those from poorer social backgrounds and people who have suffered wounds or other injury to the face. It is also more common in regions with a warmer climate. Infestations of the nose and ears are dangerous because of the possibility of penetration into the brain, the fatality rate is 8 per cent in such cases.

Had complained of tingling sensation in gums and things 'moving around' Dentist was shocked to discover fly lava maggot infection inside her gums . Called oral myiasis, it had caused 15 maggots to form in her mouth .
A Florida man was hospitalized after he crashed his remote-controlled plane this morning. The unidentified man was flying the radio-controlled jet as part of the Florida Jets RC Air Show in Lakeland in Polk County. It crashed into Paradise Field near the runway at Linder Regional Airport. The remote-controlled jet that crashed on Friday in Lakeland, Florida, is 'similar to one of these in size' The jet crashed into Paradise Field at Linder Regional Airport during the Florida Jets RC Air Show this morning . Fog stopped the man from going to Tampa General Hospital so he was was taken to Lakeland Regional Hospital . The man suffered non-life threatening injuries, but was severely burned during the crash, according to 10 News. When the aerial enthusiast's three-foot, $20,000 plane crashed near him, some of its fuel sprayed out and caused the burns. Polk Fire Rescue originally wanted to fly the injured man to Tampa General Hospital, but there was too much fog for the medical chopper to navigate. The man was taken to Lakeland Regional Hospital instead. Although the accident was originally reported as an actual plane crash, that notion was dispelled. The Florida Jets Air Show is not a competition, but more of a 'fly-In, or Jet-Together', according to its Facebook page from last year. The page reads: 'Florida Jets is one of the most exciting R/C Aviation events on the planet. 'FJ features the ultimate technology in airframe construction and power plant, and has the highest level of pilot proficiency of any radio control model aviation discipline.' The Florida Jets Air Show is not a competition, but more of a 'fly-In, or Jet-Together', according to Facebook . There were some initial reports that a plane had crashed, but Sgt Gross quickly cleared up the confusion . Although this mishap might seem out of the ordinary, it is more common than you might think. Remote-controlled planes crash frequently enough that there is a webpage about it. The No. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes is pilot error, according to R/C Airplane World. According to the site: 'Either the pilot is flying beyond his or her abilities, or flying a plane that's too advanced or simply unsuitable for his/her level of experience. 'Or perhaps they make a genuine mistake because of, say, disorientation - even experienced rc pilots make the wrong stick movements sometimes! 'Equipment failure is another reason. In fact pilot error is commonly disguised as equipment failure! 'Flying surface or control surface failure can also be the guilty culprit in bringing down our planes, especially if the builder did a less than satisfactory job on the hinges! 'Prevention is better than cure, but sadly it takes a crash to figure out what went wrong and hopefully prevent it happening again in the future.'	Plane was part of the Florida Jets RC Air Show in Lakeland in Polk County . Crash occurred this morning at Linder Regional Airport's Paradise Field . The man crashed his yard-long plane and some of its fuel burned him . He went to Lakeland Regional Hospital with non-life threatening injuries . No. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes reported to be pilot error .
Facebook has unveiled an enormous new office in Silicon Valley, which is large enough to hold a 9-acre park on its roof, and will house 2,800 workers in a single room. The new building in Menlo Park, California, measures 430,000 square feet and apparently has the 'largest open floor plan in the world'. The social network's newest location was revealed by founder Mark Zuckerberg, who posted an aerial view on the building on his public page. Scroll down for video . Park life: Facebook's enormous new office in Menlo Park, California, was unveiled yesterday . Settling in: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is pictured above having a meeting in an office-cum-ball pit, which was seemingly crammed with plastic playthings as a first-day prank . He wrote: 'Our goal was to create the perfect engineering space for our teams to work together. 'We wanted our space to create the same sense of community and connection among our teams that we try to enable with our services across the world. To do this, we designed the largest open floor plan in the world - a single room that fits thousands of people.' Lush: The office features a 9-acre park on top of its 430,000 square feet of indoor space . California skies: The office is not far from Facebook's current Silicon Valley campus - to which it is connected by tunnel . Relaxing: The waterfront office was documented by a small army of Instagram photographers ahead of opening day . Plans: This architect's model of the office shows the single, long, open-plan room inside the office . As well as the huge open space, which has yet to be pictured, there will be smaller spaces for meetings. One Facebook employee posted an image of Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer meeting in one room, which had been filled with plastic balls - seemingly a first-day prank. According to local news outlet The Almanac, 2,800 engineers will eventually work in the main, open room. They have reportedly not all been hired yet. Artsy: The warehouse has been crammed full of art pieces by Bay Area sculptors and painters, like the above . Trendy: The building will one day play host to 2,800 Facebook employees - but it is not yet at capacity . Construction on the new building, which is not far from Facebook's existing campus, and will be connected via tunnel, was started in September 2014. And despite the simple philosophy behind it, the new Facebook building still has plenty of capacity to impress. An army of Instagram stars was unleashed on the building, and captured its quirky stairways, unusual paintjobs and sculpture pieces made by Bay Area artists.	Mark Zuckerberg posted about new premises in Menlo Park, California . 430,000sq ft office will mainly be one enormous room for employees . Said that the cavernous open room will be 'perfect engineering space'

UEFA president Michel Platini has strongly supported FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign for more home grown players in the Premier League. Dyke revealed on Monday that he wanted to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 in order to help the England team. Platini, speaking after being elected unopposed for a third term at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, is the best possible ally for Dyke, who is sure to face formidable opposition from the all-powerful Premier League. UEFA president Michel Platini agrees with Gerg Dyke's plans to increase number of homegrown players . The FA chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 . Greg Dyke wants more homegrown players in Premier League teams, raising the number per squad from eight to 12. But only three current squads fall short of that number, though many of their homegrown players have yet to play for the first team. Chelsea (11): . Cesc Fabregas, Gary Cahill, John Terry, Nathan Ake, Andreas Christensen, Jeremie Boga, Mitchell Beeney, Dominic Solanke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Isaiah Brown, Jamal Blackman. Tottenham (9): . Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason, Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Ben Davies, Harry Winks, Joshua Onomah. Manchester City (8): . Joe Hart, James Milner, Frank Lampard, Gael Clichy, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Bersant Celina, Jose Pozo. Platini said: ‘This is a position we defend. We’re not only talking about England, we’re talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke’s struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him. With the new leader of the European Commission (Jean-Claude Juncker), it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect homegrown, grassroots young players. ‘We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one. There is free flow of workers in Europe but there are some things that doesn’t apply to, like in this case.’ UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino was also enthusiastic about Dyke’s mission. He said: ‘It’s fantastic. Eight out of 25 (the number of home-grown players that currently must be included in a Champions League squad) is not as many as it should be. So whatever move in favour of increasing homegrown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.’ Dyke’s proposals have irritated the Premier League who never like being dictated to by the FA. Dyke said on Tuesday: ‘We’re open to discussions and I’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.’ Dyke's plans also include 'home-grown' players having to train in England for three years before the age of 18 . Manchester United director David Gill said the proposals needed 'to be discussed by all the stakeholders' It could make for some tension between Dyke and the Premier League at the club summit tomorrow, especially as the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board had advised Dyke (left) last week not to go public. Manchester United director David Gill sits on the UEFA ExCo and will join the FIFA ExCo in May after his election on Tuesday as the British vice-president. Gill, who is also a PL representative on the FA board, said: ‘It’s a relevant thing to look at, but it needs to be discussed by all the stakeholders.’ Michael Carrick said he would love more homegrown players to get opportunities but admitted it is difficult . Carrick said that the system doesn't always work in favour of players like it has for Harry Kane of late . United and England midfielder Michael Carrick said: ‘We’d all love more homegrown, British players to get opportunities. It’s difficult. There are two sides to the argument: you’ve got to be good enough to get the chance in the first place but someone’s got to give you that chance. ‘Someone like Harry Kane is the perfect example of how we’d all like it to be. He gets his chance and takes it and has elevated himself to another level. ‘But it doesn’t always work like that. Plenty of times you look at young lads and think, he’s got a chance but it doesn’t quite work.’ England team-mate Gary Cahill said: ‘I agree with some aspects. I think it’s important to have a mixture. I love to see young players getting opportunities. But I’m respectful of the fact that the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and it attracts some of the top players. ‘Fans want to see exciting players and top clubs want top players and sometimes they are overseas. It is a matter of getting that balance.’ Gary Cahill wants more young players to get opportunities but respected the Premier League's position . Cahill hopes a balance can be reached between the quality of the league and young players coming through . Ritchie Humphreys, the PFA chairman and an FA Commission member, said: ‘Any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome. But we also have a duty of care to our national game and to young homegrown players. ‘Everything we are working towards on the FA Commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level. The PFA supports that.’	FA chairman proposed raising the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 at Premier League clubs . Greg Dyke's plans also include 'home-grown' players having to train in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21 . UEFA president Michel Platini is in favour of the rule changes . Platini could be a powerful ally with the Premier League unlikely to be keen .
In the last decade, thousands of British teenagers have celebrated their 'graduation' from secondary school by hiring a limousine to travel to their prom in style. But it seems that they have nothing on their Mexican peers. A series of fascinating new photographs highlight a trend in the city of Monterrey for throwing extravagant parties to mark the point at which young girls turn 15 and, according to Latin American tradition, transition into womanhood. Sofia, 15, is just one of many teens who marked her coming of age - or 'quinceañera' - by riding in not one, but several, super-bling limos with gaggles of friends, wearing matching suits and party frocks, joining in the fun. Scroll down for video . It's my party! Young Sofia, 15, is pictured wearing a flamenco-style cerise dress riding in an open-top SUV-limo hybrid. The glammed-up teen celebrated her quinceañera - transition into womanhood - with a lavish party . Is it a car, is it a nightclub? Another teen, Ariadna, smiles as she takes a seat in a lavender limo, which comes with shiny ceiling and strip lighting - perfect for partying teens . Parties to mark a girl's quinceañera have become increasingly lavish with parents splashing out huge sums to ensure their youngster has a party to remember. However, it isn't just 'bank of mum and dad' that pays for the event, other relatives are called upon to 'sponsor' certain elements, for example, the cake or the DJ. Such is the pomp and ceremony of these excessive bashes, you could be forgiven for thinking that you're looking at a garish wedding party. Even the attending boys go to town, taking care to coordinate their looks with the birthday girl. Much like the American prom, the celebrating girl can expect a date, with her betrothed often appearing like a mini-groom, wearing an outfit that has been planned to match hers. The birthday cake is likely to be just as eye-catching with 'the bigger, the better' the remit. Other trends include hiring a choreographer to make sure everything from the girl's entrance into the room to her first dance has a professional touch. Open the roof and let's go! Partygoers climb inside the SUV-limo hybrid as guests make their way to a quinceañera birthday party . An early lesson in how to get in and out of a vehicle in style: One birthday girl, wearing a billowing turquoise dress, climbs aboard her limo . Mind the dress: Other female revellers offer a helping hand, their own party dresses somewhat sober in comparison . Let's hear it for the boys: Complementing this  birthday girl's colour scheme were her male friends, who looked smart in braces and bowties . The brighter, the better: Leticia, dressed in a bright pink evening gown has her own moment in the spotlight, posing in a limo that has zebra-skin seats and even a bar facility . Video courtesy of signaturefilmsphotography.com . Latin American communities in the US take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses. For example, when Disney released the hit film Frozen in 2014, it prompted a surge of Elsa-inspired dresses. At the other end of the spectrum, indigenous tribes in  jungle communities in the likes of Gueatemala would celebrate in a much simpler fashion. It's all a far cry from the more humble traditions of quinceañera. According to folklore, in the months before turning 15, a daughter would be taught skills to prepare her for ensuing marriage including cooking, weaving and even tips about how to bring up her own children. It is thought that quinceañera has its roots in  ancient Aztec culture. 15 is the number: Quinceañera is celebrated differently in different countries but is essentially a coming-of-age party . From the Latin American communities of Los Angeles to the streets of Mexico and even in Cuba, when a girl hits the age of 15, a huge party promptly follows. Essentially a coming-of-age affair, quinceañera - literally meaning '15 years old', has taken off in much the same way that the high school prom has, with celebrations and outfits becoming increasingly extravagant in recent decades. In the past, a girl celebrating her quinceañera would be preparing for marriage and offered advice from older females on how best to equip herself for womanhood. Skills considered essential for being a good wife, for example sewing, cooking, cleaning and taking care of infants would be learned. At her quinceañera, the girl is 'presented' to her community and may be expected to make a speech. After an 'acceptance' of the girl, the party-goers would then pray before a meal is served. Although most historians agree that the celebration has its roots in Aztec culture, how it is celebrated now depends very much on the country the girl grows up in. For many, religion still plays a part and parties are more conservative. Latin American communities in the US take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses. For example, when Disney released the hit film Frozen in 2014, it prompted a surge of Elsa-inspired dresses. At the other end of the spectrum, indigenous tribes in jungle communities in the likes of Guatemala or Peru would celebrate in a much simpler fashion.

The Conservatives have moved into their strongest poll position for almost five years. As David Cameron prepares to go to Buckingham Palace to mark the formal start of the general election campaign, ending the long phoney war between the political parties, an exclusive ComRes poll for the Daily Mail and ITV News shows the Tories have opened up a four-point lead over Labour. Tory jitters about the party's campaign will be eased by the survey, which suggests Labour has slipped back since last week's bruising TV encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer Jeremy Paxman. Scroll down for video . The poll puts the Conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent - the first time since February 2012 that they have recorded the same share of the vote they got at the last election - ahead of Labour on 32 per cent, down three points. It is their best vote share since George Osborne's so-called 'omnishambles' Budget, which included taxes on hot pasties and caravans, which prompted a Tory slump. The party has to reach even further back - to September 2010 - for the last time it enjoyed a four-point lead with ComRes. Ukip is on 12 per cent, well down on last year's peak of 19 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats showing signs of a modest recovery, on nine per cent. The Greens have slipped back to five per cent. The poll is the mirror image of a YouGov survey over the weekend, which put Labour on 36 per cent and the Tories on 32 per cent. An Opinium poll, meanwhile, yesterday put the Tories ahead, on 34 per cent to Labour's 33 per cent. Tbe ComRes poll finds Mr Cameron has extended his lead over Mr Miliband over which of them is best suited to lead the country . An exclusive ComRes poll for the Daily Mail and ITV news puts David Cameron and the Conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent, while Ed Miliband's Labour is on 32 per cent, down three points . The survey comes after last week's bruising TV encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer Jeremy Paxman (pictured) Following Thursday’s television grilling by Mr Paxman, half of all adults in Britain think Mr Cameron would make a better Prime Minister -- 50 per cent -- compared to three in ten -- 29 per cent -- who back Mr Miliband. This represents a fall of four points for the Labour leader on the last ComRes poll, conducted last week before the TV clash. Incredibly, 18 per cent of Labour voters think that Mr Cameron would make a better Prime Minister than Mr Miliband, suggesting even some of his party's own supporters are unconvinced. This compares to just one per cent of Conservative voters who think that Mr Miliband would be the better Prime Minister. With a seven-way television debate, featuring Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and the leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Ukip, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens looming this Thursday, voters are around twice as likely to associate Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband with being 'good on television', by 64 per cent to 31 per cent. Just 29 per cent back Mr Miliband as Prime Minister, which represents a fall of four points for the Labour leader on the last ComRes poll, which was conducted last week before the TV clash . Mr Cameron also has a big lead on which of the two is considered a strong leader, with 60 per cent of voters choosing him versus 33 per cent for Mr Miliband. However, it is not all good news for Mr Cameron: he is significantly more likely to be viewed as arrogant than Mr Miliband, by 52 per cent to 35 per cent. The Labour leader has narrower leads on which of the two is seen as more genuine and understanding of the real world. When given a straight choice between a Labour-led government and a Conservative-led government after the next election, the poll finds voters' preference is too close to call, with 41 per cent wanting the former and 42 per cent the latter. However, in the event of a hung Parliament, there is a clear preference for the current coalition to continue. Presented with a decision between a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition and a Labour–SNP arrangement, 45 per cent of voters say that they would prefer the Con-Lib option, compared to just 33 per cent who prefer Lab-SNP. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said:'It is too soon to attribute any movement in the polls to the Paxman effect. While this is bound to be a volatile election with both Labour and the Conservatives running each other close, the longer term trends points towards the Conservatives beginning to dig in and strengthen their position. 'Cameron’s ratings as a strong leader will serve him well through the coming seven-way debate as the challengers attempt to bring him down.'	Tories are up one point  with 36%, while Labour is down three points to 32% . It is their best vote share since George Osborne's 'omnishambles' Budget . Last time they had four-point lead with ComRes poll was September 2010 . Ukip is on 12%, Liberal Democrats are on 9% and the Greens are on 5% .
Female high school students from Darwin have hit out at teachers after claiming they were told not to wear clothes that were 'distracting to a lot of the boys'. Students at Casuarina Senior College say they were sent home from school for wearing tights, leggings and bike shorts in hot weather, the NT News reported. The students posted signs on Facebook and Instagram in protest of the rules, after they were taken down from a reception area in the school on Tuesday. But CSC principal Paul Mathews denied that staff had said any female student's clothing was 'distracting', and said teachers were simply enforcing the school's uniform code. Female high school students from Darwin have hit out at teachers after claiming they were told not to wear clothes that were 'distracting to a lot of the boys' The students' signs read: 'Don't stop girls from wearing tights, legging, shorts and skirts in hot weather,' the posters read. 'Instead teach male faculty and students to not over-sexualise female body parts. I don't think my thighs, legs and a** should be distracting. 'Dress code only enforces the idea that girls should cover up because 'boys will be boys'. 'What a girl wears has nothing to do with her intelligence of self respect. 'I refuse to obey rules that enforce rape culture and sl*t shaming and keep our sexist society in place.' Students at Casuarina Senior College say they were sent home from school for wearing tights, leggings and bike shorts in hot weather . Images of the signs were again shared on social media, with students saying that boys at school were allowed to wear shorts of any length while female students had to wear shorts and skirts that measured below the knee. But CSC principal Paul Mathews said tights, leggings and bike shorts were not part of the school's uniform code, and denied that staff said any female student's clothing was 'distracting'. 'Yesterday was the end of a very long communication process with students and parents reminding them about the CSC dress code,' Mr Mathews said. 'If you look at the dress code policy it doesn't at all talk about boys or girls – it says no bike pants or leggings and that shorts need to be of appropriate length . 'Can I really state that this is not an issue of gender, this is about the high standards and expectations the college has in all areas. 'My view is that a very small number of girls have chosen this method to communicate their displeasure about something they don't agree with.'

A blood test that screens couples for thousands of genetic flaws which they could pass on to a baby is to go on sale. Couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease. The compatibility test can flag up more than 600 conditions, including some that kill within the first years of life. If couples are told they are at risk of having a child whose life would be blighted by ill-health, they can decide whether to adopt, have IVF treatment or go ahead and get pregnant naturally. New test: Couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease . Spanish firm iGenomix, which developed the test, says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans. The company’s test is designed to give peace of mind, but at £1,800 per couple – £900 per person – it doesn’t come cheap. Plus, there are concerns people will become stigmatised simply because they are carrying the ‘wrong genes’. Critics also say it panders to those who believe the only acceptable child is a perfect one. The NHS does pre-pregnancy testing but focuses on people with a family history of just a few conditions. The new test, which will be available at Randox Health clinics in London and Northern Ireland from May, checks for thousands of faulty pieces of DNA. Conditions include cystic fibrosis, which is carried by one in 25 Britons, as well as rarer conditions that cause blindness, blood disorders and life-threatening hormonal problems. Conditions such as autism, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes are not included. Spanish firm iGenomix, which developed the test, says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans . The test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes, meaning they will not have symptoms themselves and may even be unaware of the problem lurking in their DNA. Most people have several disease genes and a recent study by iGenomix found that 8 per cent of couples were ‘clinically incompatible’, meaning both had the same faulty DNA. Such couples would be told there was a one in four chance of their child being ill and counselled on their options. These include an IVF technique, in which only healthy embryos are implanted in the womb, the use of donor eggs or sperm or adoption. Some women may opt to get pregnant naturally and abort later. Dr Peter FitzGerald, managing director of Randox Health, said: ‘Our wide-ranging new screen will detect potential problems before pregnancy by obtaining information from both parents. With this test, we can alert prospective parents to the risk of serious genetic conditions.’ There is another pre-pregnancy test available privately but it checks for only 100 diseases. Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said the limited and expensive options available to couples who ‘fail’ the test could push them toward getting pregnant naturally – and aborting if the baby is unhealthy. She added: ‘This test is going to create further anxiety through the over-medicalisation of pregnancy.’ Dr David King, of campaign group Human Genetics Alert, warned that if testing became popular, couples could feel pressurised to use it to avoid having children with genetic conditions. He added: ‘That will lead to a society in which parents with disabled children will be blamed and disability will become less and less acceptable. We need regulation and ethical debate before such tests are introduced.’	The test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes .

'Players with that sort of character need to be in the firing line. We can always replace a player with an experienced player but it's going to limit you. If we replace players with younger players who have incredible potential, we're going to have a period of learning, getting experience, but the benefits at the end will be untold.

As the 21st anniversary of the slaying of a 21-year-old Florida girl approaches, detectives from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office are still searching for leads in the cold case. Amy Gellert was stabbed to death on March 20, 1994, after she surprised an intruder in her parents' home in Cocoa Beach. The masked man, who had a gun as well as a dagger, also stabbed her stepfather Robert Lehton once in the head and her mother, Charlotte, 'Bunny' Lehton, seven times in the neck. Scroll down for video . Amy Gellert was killed by an intruder at her parents' house in Cocoa Beach, Florida, on March 20, 1994 . As the 21st anniversary of her killing approaches, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office is still looking for leads . Amy's stepfather Robert Lehton (left) was stabbed once in the head and her mother, Charlotte, 'Bunny' Lehton (right), was stabbed seven times in the neck by the intruder . Amy had arrived at the house after attending church services. Before she stumbled upon the masked assailant, he had forced her parents to lay on the floor and taken money and credit cards from Bunny's wallet, CBS reported. The man was behaving calmly until he saw the lights from Amy's car and began stabbing her parents. After he was stabbed, Bob ran outside and the intruder followed him. Police say Amy was the 'catalyst' for the 1994 killing . The killer arrived at Amy's car and began stabbing her. She fled the vehicle, but only made it as far as a nearby parking lot before collapsing. Amy's parents survived their wounds, but Amy did not. She had two older brothers, Mark and Ryan. Police have never arrested any suspects in connection with the murder and do not have a concrete motive for the deadly attack. Major Tod Goodyear was one of the investigators called to the crime scene in 1994. He said: 'I have a hard time thinking this is a random act. 'The consensus tends to be that Amy's the catalyst. 'There's something there with Amy that probably caused this to happen.' The unsolved cold case was featured on an episode of 48 Hours that aired on Saturday. During the episode, images of the weapons were aired and potential suspects were identified. Based on a magazine police found at the scene, they were able to determine the suspect had a prop gun. The dagger was never found. Although it seemed real during the attack, the intruder was actually armed with a prop gun (pictured) The dagger the intruder used to stab Amy, Bunny and Bob was never recovered by the police (sketch shown) Three suspects - Jeffrey Anderson, Hugh Poppell and Dominic Kanuika - were identified during the show. Anderson was involved in a police chase the day after Amy was killed and is currently in prison. However, police could never connect him to the murder. Poppell had a romantic relationship with Amy and police received a tip he may have been involved in the murder after he died in a hit-and-run accident in 2013. Kanuika became a suspect after someone reportedly overheard his high school girlfriend saying he was 'possibly involved with that homicide'. Even though he had a shaky alibi and failed a polygraph, police could never get enough evidence to suggest Kanuika was at the house. Three suspects - Jeffrey Anderson (left), Hugh Poppell (center) and Dominic Kanuika (right) - were identified . Major Tod Goodyear (left) and the rest of his cold case team are still hoping to catch Amy's killer 21 years later . Show producers and the Lehtons are hoping the episode will  turn up some new leads for police. During the broadcast, staff members from the program monitored Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets for tips, according to Florida Today. Show correspondent Erin Moriarty said: 'It's not only unsolved but it's really difficult to - even to this day after speaking with all the detectives who worked on this case  - determine the motive. 'And that really is the reason why they have not been able to completely tie up all the strings and arrest someone. 'One person's life was taken but so many other lives along the way were destroyed.' During the broadcast, 48 hours staffers monitored Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets for tips . Bob and Bunny, who still live in Cocoa Beach, hope that an arrest will help bring them 'closure'. Bunny said: 'Our sole purpose is to give people an opportunity to give us information that will lead to the capture of the person who did this. 'This is not vengeance. 'He just needs to be off the streets for doing something so terrible.' The sheriff's office worked in tandem with 48 Hours on the episode. According to the department's Facebook page: 'The CBS 48 Hours crew has followed the investigation for several months and has offered to help the investigation by seeking the help of the community.' Anyone with information regarding the investigation should call the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office Major Crimes Unit at 321-633-8413 or email at MajorCrimes@bcso.us.

Fears the notorious FLDS cult is planning to expand have been sparked after the brother of imprisoned leader Warren Jeffs applied to increase the water supply to the group's South Dakota compound. Seth Jeffs wants to double the amount of water it can draw from an aquifer in the 140-acre compound about 30 miles from Mount Rushmore. His request prompted concerns from neighbors and law enforcement about the possibility of members being displaced from their enclave on the Utah-Arizona border. He told state authorities that members of the United Order of South Dakota, a trust run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) need more water for gardens, orchards and herds of animals. Seth Jeffs (pictured left), the brother of imprisoned cult leader Warren Jeffs (right) has applied to double the water available to the group's South Dakota compound, sparking fears of an influx of members there . Women and girls from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) can be seen wearing prairie dresses in Hildale, Utah . But with few details available and considering the group's troubled history, residents are worried members are planning a mass exodus from other areas to make Black Hills their new home. Warren Jeffs and other church leaders have been convicted of sexually assaulting underage girls . And while Seth Jeffs pleaded guilty in 2006 to harboring his then-fugitive brother, he did not face any sex abuse charges. South Dakota officials said that the local members of the FLDS, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, have never been in trouble with the law there. But Linda Van Dyke Kilcoin, one of several neighbors who filed petitions to intervene in the group's water request, said: 'As locals, we know what is going on in there and we don't want to see it expand. 'We value our 12-year-old girls in South Dakota.' An aerial shot shows buildings inside Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound near Pringle, South Dakota. The sect has applied to double the amount of water it can take from an aquifer . A log-cabin-style home is among the buildings on the FLDS compound that has nearly 50,000 square feet of residential space . Seth Jeffs declined to comment to The Associated Press, but told a local newspaper in January the compound is 'not growing right now' and members 'just need more water.' The request for more will likely be acted on in May. But Ms Kilcoin doubts it's for crop production. 'They're not going to irrigate. You ever been to Pringle? It's bedrock,' she said. 'You can't grow anything down there. They're bringing in a whole pile of people.' The group has said about 75 people live at the South Dakota ranch, according to a 2014 drinking water report filed with the state. The fenced-in compound, complete with a guard tower, sits on hilly, rugged land the group bought about 10 years ago - and was valued at $5.3 million for tax purposes. Inside the complex are seven large residences totaling nearly 50,000 square feet, a chapel and school, greenhouse, and several farm buildings. A sign warning against trespassing and dump trucks can be seen in operation on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound about 30 miles from Mount Rushmore . Attorney General Marty Jackley, who said he's 'generally aware' of the activity at the compound, said the permit request and ongoing construction at the site 'are all indications that there is some level of expansion going on.' Mr Jackley said the group is on his radar because of what has gone on at FLDS sites in other states, and the additional law enforcement resources any expansion might require. Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2011 of abusing underage girls he considered his brides. Willie Jessop, who is Warren Jeffs' former bodyguard but left the cult in 2011, says he believes the group could be planning a move to South Dakota . For decades, members of his church have controlled the twin cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, but some are now being squeezed out by authorities ordering evictions because people haven't paid millions in overdue occupancy fees. Last year, the Texas government seized the group's Eldorado compound on the basis that the FLDS leaders financed a $1.1 million land purchase in 2003 through money laundering. Custer County Sheriff Rick Wheeler, whose jurisdiction includes the Black Hills compound, said when the group was evicted from its Texas property there was no indication they had moved to the compound near Pringle, citing a low level of traffic and activity. But now, he said that has changed and the group is hauling in more gravel and lumber. 'It's churning right now,' he said. Both Sam Brower, a private investigator who has spent years researching the FLDS, and Willie Jessop, Warren Jeffs' former bodyguard, agreed leaders could be preparing to move people to South Dakota from the shrinking Utah-Arizona enclave. Mr Brower said 'I think they are looking for places to move the elite,' adding that Seth Jeffs, like his brother, is considered royalty among devout members. Unlike most Mormons, members of FLDS believe polygamy will bring exaltation in heaven. Loyalists consider Jeffs a prophet who speaks for God and can do no wrong. Seth Jeffs, who originally sought to triple the amount of water the South Dakota ranch could draw, recently told the state he was scaling back his request to relieve the 'fears and concerns' of the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service. William Hansen, chief of the Water Rights Branch of the NPS, said its main concern is the effect an additional well, without stricter limitations on usage, could have on Wind Cave National Park, since the FLDS draws from the same aquifer that has been forming the cave for millennia.

A post-mortem examination found shop worker Miss Pollock, 41, died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck . A 52-year-old builder has been charged with murder following the discovery of a woman's body at a flat. Officers found the body of Sarah Pollock, 41, in her flat in the Springbourne area of Bournemouth, Dorset, at 3.26pm on March 25. Her colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to open the shop she was working for at the Dolphin Centre in Poole. A post-mortem examination found Miss Pollock died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck. Builder Colin Dymond, 52, from Bournemouth, who was known to Miss Pollock, was today charged with her murder. He will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow. Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of Dorset Police, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Sarah's family with this development and the thoughts of the investigation team are with her loved ones. 'Clearly this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. 'I would also like to thank local people who have been patient and assisted police, particularly some of the residents of Avon Close who have been temporarily relocated. 'Their understanding and co-operation has helped us conduct a thorough investigation into this tragic matter as swiftly as possible.' At 3.26pm on Wednesday, March 25, Dorset police found the body of the 41-year-old in her flat in Avon Close in the Springbourne area after concerns were raised that she had not arrived at work as expected . Miss Pollock's body was formally identified by family members, who are being supported by police family liaison officers. Mr Samuel appealed for the public's help to trace the movements of a Peugeot 308 estate hire care with the registration HN14 HWC. 'Although we have charged a man with murder we still want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Sarah's death,' he said. 'We have now recovered the Peugeot hire car from the London area and I am interested if anyone saw it being driven or parked in Dorset or Hampshire between 4pm on Tuesday 24 March and 10pm on Wednesday 25 March 2015. If so, please call Dorset Police urgently. 'We are still building a picture of exactly what happened to Sarah. If anyone saw or heard anything suspicious in the Avon Close area of Bournemouth or has any other information that could be useful, I would urge them to please get in touch.' In a statement, Miss Pollock's family said: 'We have lost an important part of our lives; a kind, caring, honest, outgoing and ultimately indescribable daughter, sister and auntie from our close-knit family. 'She was unforgettable and she will always remain in our hearts and minds, although she should not be gone. 'We respectfully ask that we are left to grieve without intrusion and want to thank Dorset Police for their hard work so far in helping our distraught family.' Anyone with information should contact Dorset Police on 101 quoting Operation Inlet. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Opening GP surgeries at weekends would mean two million fewer patients waiting in A&E every year. Research shows the number of visits to casualty has dropped by 8 per cent in areas where patients can see family doctors seven days a week. Academics say there is a huge decrease in the numbers going to emergency departments with mild or moderate ailments such as colds, sprains and back ache. They also believe the NHS should pay GPs more to open routinely at weekends – possibly by using cash saved from the reduction in visits to A&E. Research shows that if GP surgeries were open at weekends would mean two million fewer patients waiting in A&E every year. File photo shows ambulances parked outside St Thomas's Hospital in London . Over the past decade the numbers of patients arriving in casualty has soared by 50 per cent with 21.7million in 2013/14. The rise has partly been blamed on a contract introduced by Labour in 2004 which enabled GPs to opt out of working evenings and weekends. These services are now subcontracted to private firms which patients either do not trust or do not know how to get hold of, instead going to A&E. Professor Peter Dolton, an economics expert at Sussex University, looked at the A&E attendances at Central London Clinical Commissioning Group, an NHS body covering 34 GP practices. Four of the surgeries offer weekend appointments to all patients as part of a Government pilot project launched in 2013. The research found that, on average, the number of patients arriving at A&E dropped by 8 per cent – up to a 10 per cent reduction at weekends. If this were true for all surgeries across England, then an estimated 1.736million fewer patients would have gone to casualty last year. The scheme – called the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund – involves 1,147 English GP surgeries which were each given a slice of £50million to ensure several practices in the area stay open seven days a week. Draft research by NHS England last month found that, since the scheme was established in Birmingham, the number of A&E patients had dropped by as much as 25 per cent at one practice. Research shows the number of visits to casualty dropped by 8 per cent in areas where patients can see family doctors seven days a week. File photo . They fell by more than 10 per cent in Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire and by 10 per cent in North West London. Professor Dolton, speaking at the Royal Society of Economics conference in Manchester, said: ‘It’s having a significant effect on A&E and it’s very important.’ He said the Government should consider giving GPs extra funding to open their surgeries at weekends permanently. The money provided under the current scheme is only a one-off. One way of doing this, he said, would be to use money saved from the reduction in A&E visits which are very costly to the NHS. The average cost of an A&E visit is £114 compared to a GP appointment which is just £25. But Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘For the vast majority, seven-day opening remains an aspiration and telling patients that they can walk into their local surgery in the evenings or at weekends risks raising expectations that general practice cannot live up to with current resources. ‘Investing in longer opening hours may not be the best route to improving care in every area.’	Casualty visits dropped in areas where patients can see doctors every day .

David Cameron today puts the prospect of Alex Salmond ‘calling the tune’ in a deal with Labour at the centre of the Tory election campaign. As he launches a poster showing a tiny Ed Miliband in Mr Salmond’s pocket, the Prime Minister warns of the ‘chilling and real prospect’ of Labour being propped up in government by the Scottish National Party. His offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament. Scroll down for video . Pocket-size: Ed Miliband is dwarfed by Alex Salmond in the new Conservative election poster . Polls last week suggested the nationalists could win 50 out of the 59 Westminster seats in May, including those seen as the safest Labour strongholds such as Gordon Brown’s in Kirkcaldy. This would sink any prospect of Mr Miliband winning a Commons majority. Mr Cameron says today: ‘Britain needs to wake up to a chilling and real prospect – Ed Miliband as prime minister, propped up by Alex Salmond who says he’ll call the tune. ‘Again and again, Ed Miliband refuses to rule out this possibility. He is so weak, everyone knows he would be in Alex Salmond’s pocket. On every vote, every budget, every decision, the SNP would exact a high price for his support. ‘Everyone in Britain will pay with higher taxes, more spending, more debt and weaker defences in dangerous times. To keep the recovery on track and avoid this nightmare, vote Conservative.’ The Prime Minister's offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament . A Labour parliamentary candidate has rejected a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair towards her election campaign. Lesley Brennan, who is standing in Dundee East, said on Twitter her ‘instinct’ was to turn the offer down. The former Prime Minister has pledged £106,000 to help Labour campaigns in 106 marginal seats. But there has been unease about Mr Blair’s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so-called ‘blood money’. Mr Miliband is under huge pressure from his Scottish MPs to rule out a deal with the nationalists. Yesterday his deputy Harriet Harman dodged the issue eight times on the Murnaghan show on Sky. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1. She said: ‘We are focused on winning a Labour majority government. Let me say this. We do not want, we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the SNP.’ Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan dodged the question four times on Pienaar’s Politics on Radio 5 Live and shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran did so nine times on the BBC’s Sunday Politics. On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could ‘call the tune’ in the Commons. ‘It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,’ he said. ‘Neither are fit to govern. ‘It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.’ At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent. Labour MPs say the party has ‘decided internally’ not to rule out an SNP pact before the election. This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10. Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories’ latest poster. Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk. The poster’s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed ‘Big Eck and Little Ed’. The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV’s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s. Its targets included David Owen and David Steel, joint leaders of the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Mr Steel was lampooned as Mr Owen’s adoring sidekick and sometimes appeared in his pocket, left.

This is the comical letter that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking during a German lesson. Rather than being apologetic and remorseful the defiant 13-year-old brazenly tells his language master, 'I am not sorry.' In the hastily written note, scrawled on a scrunched up piece of lined paper, he says he was only speaking to a friend for a 'few seconds' was not 'constantly talking.' The teen, who has not been named, added 'I do not like German' and signed off the letter with 'I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch.' This is the defiant handwritten note that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking . The hilarious letter was uploaded to Twitter by the boy's brother, and was retweeted thousands of times in just 12 hours. The picture was uploaded with the caption 'My brother had to write an apology to Mrs *****. Look what he's put down.' The boy is a pupil at Oldmachar Academy, in Aberdeen, Scotland. The full note reads: 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second. 'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German. 'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.' The cheeky chap's father said: 'He does hate German. I had no idea that he had written this letter and this is all news to me. 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second. 'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German. 'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.' 'I don't know if he would have had the guts to hand it in.' Twitter users found the letter hilarious, and it has so far received over 2,000 'favourites'. One user wrote: 'At least Mrs ***** knows what he had for lunch. That's something anyway.' Another added: 'This is sensational.' Someone else wrote: 'That's brilliant.' Other examples of hilarious letters written by children include one from a student which read: 'Dear Mrs Storz. You are the best music teacher ever because my last music teacher choked a boy.' One letter from one pupil to another reads: 'Dear Brody. Miss P made me write you this note. All I want to say sorry for is not being sorry because . I tried to feel sorry but I don't.' There was no one available at the school for comment.

Gareth Southgate is refusing to be carried away by his England Under-21 side after seeing them take another significant step forward with a victory over fellow European Championship finalists Germany. Southgate's youngsters twice came from behind at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium before surging to a 3-2 win, to the delight of a crowd of 30,178. However, despite also beating Portugal and hosts the Czech Republic, who will also be at this summer's finals tournament, the former England defender is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England Under 21's win . Saints midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in  three minutes . Asked if he was excited by what might lie ahead, Southgate said: 'Not really. 'I love working with the group that we have, staff and players, it's a real united body of people. We have got quality and they want to be the best they can be, so they have got a chance. 'But we also know that we are very quick to put people on a pedestal, and we haven't achieved anything yet. We have had some good results, we have had some nice compliments, but we know what our goal is and we know that we are driven to achieve that. 'We are not interested in too much until we do that.' Nathan Redmond leaps for joy after bringing England level at 2-2 with a deflected shot in the second half . Jesse Lindgard brought England level for the first time with a composed finish from Carl Jenkinson's cross . Southgate's caution was perhaps a reflection of an ordinary start by his team as they struggled to get to grips with a Germany squad boasting some 600 more top-flight appearances than his. England fell behind with just 15 minutes gone when Kaiserslautern striker Philipp Hofmann, celebrating his 22nd birthday, expertly controlled and converted a left-wing cross, and after Jesse Lingard had levelled, restored Germany's lead within five minutes of the restart. The home team left it late to make the big push, but when it came, it was decisive. Germany striker Philipp Hofmann scored a brace but could not prevent the Young Lions from securing win . Liverpool and Germany midfielderEmre Can (right) slides in for a tackle on England's Jake Forster-Caskey . Nathan Redmond's strike from substitute Alex Pritchard's pass levelled it with 10 minutes remaining, and it was left to skipper James Ward-Prowse to win it two minutes later when he accepted full-back Carl Jenkinson's ball and calmly steered his shot past keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Asked how he would manage expectation ahead of the summer, Southgate said: 'We will just show people the first 25 minutes of the game - that will keep everybody's expectations in check, it's as simple as that. 'We have belief in the group of players, and they are fantastic to work with. We believe they can play at a very high level, but we believe because of the talent and the ability that they have and the attitude that they have that we can keep pushing them. 'We have to keep pushing because the standard will go up again in the summer and everybody else will be more competitive again, and we have got to be the same.' Burnley forward Danny Ings embraces Lingard as the two teams head in level at half time .	England came from behind to beat Germany at the Riverside Stadium . A crowd of 30,178 watched the victory at Middlesbrough's ground . Victory is another significant step towards European Championship . But manager Gareth Southgate is refusing to get carried away with win .
