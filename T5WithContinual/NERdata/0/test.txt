Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .	Polish ! mix ; Zywiec ! org ;
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .	Jean van Boxmeer ! person ; Reuters ! org ;
So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .	Zywiec ! org ; Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA ! org ;
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .	end
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .	Van Boxmeer ! person ; Polish ! mix ;
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .	Boxmeer ! person ; Polish ! mix ;
He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain .	Poland ! location ; Europe ! location ; Germany ! location ; Britain ! location ;
Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .	Van Boxmeer ! person ; Poland ! location ;

( EB ) .	South African Breweries Ltd ! org ; SAB ! org ; Lech ! org ; Tychy ! org ; Australia ! location ; Brewpole BV ! org ; Poland ! location ; Elbrewery Company Ltd. ! org ; EB ! org ;
Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .	Van Boxmeer ! person ; Zywiec ! org ;
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .	end
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .	Czech Republic ! location ;
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...	Polish ! mix ;
I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , " he said .	Czech ! location ;
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .	Van Boxmeer ! person ; Zywiec ! org ; Okocim ! org ; Carlsberg ! org ; Zywiec ! org ; Heineken ! org ;
He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .	Zywiec Full Light ! org ;
" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , " van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland .	Polish ! mix ; Boxmeer ! person ; Heineken ! org ; Poland ! location ;

British ! mix ; trans-Atlantic ! mix ; British Airways Plc ! org ; American Airlines ! org ; Britain ! location ; Monopolies and Mergers Commission ! org ;

Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared .	British Airways-American ! mix ;

Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday .	Santa Fe ! org ; Newmont ! org ;
Wall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .	Wall Street ! location ; Newmont ! org ; Santa Fe ! org ;
Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .	Newmont ! org ;
Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer .	Santa Fe ! org ; Newmont ! org ;
They said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term .	Santa Fe ! org ; Nevada ! location ; Newmont ! org ;
Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .	Newmont ! org ; Santa Fe ! org ;

If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire , he said .	Kinshasa ! location ; Zairean ! mix ; Zaire ! location ;
" Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said .	Rwanda ! location ; Zaire ! location ;
General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home .	Baril ! person ; Laurent Kabila ! person ; Goma ! location ; Rwandan ! mix ;
The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area .	Zairean ! mix ;

" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda , " Young told reporters .	Zaire ! location ; Rwanda ! location ; Young ! person ;
But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information .	Baril ! person ;
" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies .	end
" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary .	end
If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said .	end
Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said : " It would have to be in the last resort .	Zairean ! mix ;

Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday .	Indian ! mix ; Rubber Board of India ! org ;
K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .	K.J. Matthew ! person ; Asia Rubber Markets meeting ! mix ; Indian ! mix ;
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added .	Matthew ! person ;
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said .	end
Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .	Indian ! mix ;
Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .	Matthew ! person ;
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .	end
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .	end
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India .

Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday .	Japan ! location ;
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen .

This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen .	Eisuke Sakakibara ! person ; Finance Ministry ! org ;
But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said .	Sakakibara ! person ; U.S. ! location ;
" I think his views on ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , " said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank .	U.S. Treasury ! org ; Robert ! person ; Rubin ! person ; Hank Note ! person ; Sumitomo Bank ! org ;
Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar .	Rubin ! person ; U.S. ! location ; Sakakibara ! person ; United States ! location ;
" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger .	end
In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said .	end
" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , " said Sumitomo 's Note .	Sakakibara ! person ; Sumitomo ! org ; Note ! person ;
Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . "	Takao Sakoh ! person ; Union Bank of Switzerland ! org ; Tokyo ! location ; Sakakibara ! person ;
Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply .	Sakakibara ! person ; International Finance Bureau ! org ;
He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought .	Japan ! location ;
Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the " Sakakibara ceiling " for the dollar following the remark .	Sakakibara ! person ;
Adding to the comments by " Mr Yen " , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark .	Mr Yen ! person ; Sakakibara ! person ; BOJ ! org ; Matsushita ! person ;
" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun .	Matsushita ! person ; Nihon Keizai Shimbun ! org ;
" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co .

The Australian opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside .	Australian ! mix ; Australian ! mix ;
The court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him .	Chris Hunt ! person ;
" Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said .	Laurie Brereton ! person ;
But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry , established in May , appointing a new head to lead it .	end
Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash .	Foreign Affairs Department ! org ;
Accordingly , they demand an open investigation .	end

Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .	Singapore ! location ; World Trade Organisation ! org ; WTO ! org ;
" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , " said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A .	Singapore ! location ; WTO ! org ; Desmond Supple ! person ; I.D.E.A ! org ;
" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . "	Singapore ! location ;
The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .	U.S. ! location ;
In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered .

That would have meant Geneva .	Geneva ! location ;
But Singapore had the support of other WTO members .	Singapore ! location ; WTO ! org ;

"	Derek da Cunha ! person ; Institute of Policy Studies ! org ; ISEAS ! org ; Singapore ! location ;
There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore .

In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector .	WTO ! org ; Singapore ! location ; European Union ! org ; Singapore ! location ;
Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .	Supple ! person ; Singapore ! location ;
" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .	end
Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . "	Supple ! person ; Singapore ! location ;
From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry , Tan said .	Singapore ! location ; Tan ! person ;
A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " Tan said .	Singapore ! location ; Singaporean ! mix ; Tan ! person ;
" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . "	Singapore ! location ;
Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .	Supple ! person ; Singapore ! location ; WTO ! org ;
" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "	Singapore ! location ;
But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this .	end
I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . "	end
