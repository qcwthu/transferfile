The similarities are uncanny – from the outlandish fascinators, to the plummy voices and voluptuous curves. New drama The Royals, which launched in America last week, is about a ‘spoof’ British Royal Family – but two red-haired sisters, Penelope and Maribel, bear uncomfortable resemblances to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. The creators of the show, which stars Elizabeth Hurley as a couture-clad Queen, insist all the characters are ‘purely fictional’. Scroll down for video . 'Dim': Penelope (Lydia Rose Bewley) (left) and Maribel (Hatty Preston) (right) have certain similarities to Eugenie and Beatrice . The real deal: 'The make-up girls and wardrobe ladies had photos of Beatrice and Eugenie pinned up everywhere,' said Hatty Preston, who plays Maribel . Many of the young Royals are shown engaging in wild, drug-fuelled orgies. Hatty Preston, who plays ‘dim-witted’ Maribel, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s inevitable that people will compare the sisters to Beatrice and Eugenie. ‘I based Maribel on the Made In Chelsea stars, but the make-up girls and wardrobe ladies had photos of Beatrice and Eugenie pinned up everywhere. It’s a spoof. I hope they realise we’re laughing with them, not at them.’ The Royals has already been panned by US critics. The first episode will be screened in the UK on E! on Wednesday.

The executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumuran would not stop Prime Minister Tony Abbott from holidaying in Bali. Many Australians have called for a boycott of the island paradise in anger at the imminent killings. The island hosts more than a million Australian tourists each year, including the prime minister. But Mr Abbott told WSFM's Jonesy and Amanda on Friday that he would not boycott Bali. 'I am one of those Australians who has been several times to Bali on holidays,' Mr Abbott said. 'I've got to say I love my time there.' Scroll down for video .

Reformed ringleaders: Mercy campaigners have pointed to the success of Kerokoban Prison's rehabilitation program in changing the lives of Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right. Mr Sukumaran has become an accomplished artist and Mr Chan has been ordained as a priest . 'It's a beautiful island with friendly people. It's a magnificent place to stay. 'I hope over time that more Australians will travel to Indonesia. I hope over time more Indonesians will travel to Australia. 'The short answer is yes I would (still go to Bali). 'I would hate to think that our understandable dismay and disappointment and even anger at the prospect of these executions... would permanently blight the relationship, because it's too important to both our countries.' Mr Abbott provoked anger from Indonesian officials in February after he publicly reminded them the Federal Government had donated $1 billion of aid to the country following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The tsunami devastated the country's Aceh province and the Australian government deployed military personnel to assist in humanitarian relief operations. Mr Abbott's aid statement was dismissed by an Indonesian foreign ministry official - who told reporters 'no one responds well to threats'.

Indonesian police officers are pictured standing guard out the front of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Jakarta State Administrative Court rejected a lawsuit from Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers on February 24, 2015 . It also sparked a social media movement in Indonesia, 'Coin4Abbott', calling on the Indonesian government to return the funds to Australia. 'Take Back All Money & S**t You Gave Us!' one Twitter user said, posting a picture of a jar of coins. Mr Abbott said on Friday that he hoped to make more progress with Indonesia with private, rather than public conversations. He requested a phone conversation with Mr Widodo on Thursday but that has not gone ahead yet. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has lobbied her counterparts for an exchange of three Indonesian prisoners in Australia for Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. But the Australian Associated Press reported on Friday that Mr Widodo 'laughed' after being questioned by reporters about the issue. 'No way,' he said.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today condemned terror apologists who 'seek to excuse' ISIS extremists including Jihadi John. He used speech in London to hit out at the likes of campaign group Cage, which claimed that it was MI5's attempts to recruit Mohammed Emwazi that led to him becoming radicalised and emerge as Jihadi John. Mr Hammond condemned critics who try to 'excuse' the terrorists by pointing the finger of blame at the security services. Philip Hammond condemned critics who try to 'excuse'  terrorists including Jihadi John by pointing the finger of blame at the security services . British citizens who travel to Iraq and Syria to fight against ISIS could face prosecution if they return. Philip Hammond said that parents and schools have a responsibility to help prevent young people from travelling abroad to take part in the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Asked what the authorities' response would be to Britons who take up arms against IS, the Foreign Secretary said: 'The simple, legal answer is that anyone conducting irregular fighting activity overseas is subject to British legislative sanction. 'That is unlawful activity and can be dealt with on their return to the UK.' The parents of three London schoolgirls believed to have entered Syria with the aim of joining IS - Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - are later due to appear before the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, alongside the ambassador of Turkey. Cage sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify Emwazi's brutal killings of ISIS hostages. In an extraordinary press conference, the group's research director Asim Qureshi said Kuwait-born Briton Emwazi was a 'beautiful young man', 'extremely gentle' and 'the most humble young person that I ever knew'. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for Emwazi's radicalisation, saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an 'outsider'. Today Mr Hammond vehemently rejected the idea that the actions of Emwazi and other ISIS murderers can ever be justified. He said: 'The exposure of the alleged identity of one of the most murderous ISIL terrorists over the last few weeks has seen some seeking to excuse the terrorists and point the finger of blame at the agencies themselves. 'We are absolutely clear: the responsibility for acts of terror rests with those who commit them. But a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them.' In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, Mr Hammond will mount a strong defence of their work saying that it was only their 'brilliance' that had kept Britain safe in the face of the continuing terrorist threat. The agencies have also faced criticism over the fact that Emwazi was allowed to travel to Syria - where is believed to have carried out the brutal beheadings of a series of western hostages - even though he had be known to MI5 since 2008. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute in London, Mr Hammond - who is responsible for MI6 and GCHQ - said that agencies are currently facing an 'unprecedented' level of challenge in the face of a wide range threats from around the world. 'The sheer number and range of cases, old and new, amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe,' he said. 'Warped' Cage's research director Asim Qureshi (left) at a press conference about Jihadi John last week . Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed as 'nonsense' the suggestion that jihadis like Emwazi had been radicalised by their contact with security services. Mr Cameron told LBC radio: 'The fact is we face a terrorist threat in Britain. That is the opinion of the experts who advise me and set the threat level. 'Our police and security services have a very important role to play to find out about people that could do us harm and to step in and prevent them from doing that. 'Of course we need to work with communities to do that - and we do. 'But I totally reject the idea that police or security service tactics have somehow radicalised people. That is, I think, nonsense.' Campaign group Cage sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify Emwazi's brutal killings of ISIS hostages. In an extraordinary press conference, the group's research director Asim Qureshi said Kuwait-born Briton Emwazi was a 'beautiful young man', 'extremely gentle' and 'the most humble young person that I ever knew'. The 32-year-old blamed British security services for Emwazi's radicalisation, saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an 'outsider'. He said that while in the past they had simply had to focus on 'ideologically-driven expansionist states' they now had to deal with international terrorist groups and state-sponsored aggression as well as self-radicalised, 'lone wolf' terrorists. 'The emergence of groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and (IS) in Syria, Iraq and Libya, simply serves to underline the pace with which the threats to our safety and security from this source are evolving,' he said. 'It is only thanks to the dedication, and in many cases the brilliance, of our intelligence officers that we have succeeded to detect and contain these threats.' At the same time he pointed to the renewed threat to international order posed by Russia after years of re-engagement with the West following the end of the Cold War. 'We are now faced with a Russian leader bent not on joining the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations, but on subverting it,' he said. 'President (Vladimir) Putin's actions - illegally annexing Crimea and now using Russian troops to destabilise eastern Ukraine - fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in Eastern Europe.' He said that the 'clandestine nature' of the threats- from weapons systems developed in secret to covert plotting by terrorists - underlined the need for Britain to maintain a 'highly effective, secret capability' to identify, monitor and act against them. 'As the range of threats gets bigger, so the pace of technological change with which the agencies must keep up is getting faster, making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding,' he said. 'We must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment - and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe.'

Two ice fisherman were in for a big surprise when the reeled in a live bird from freezing waters  in northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this week. In a video titled, 'Shocking ice fishing video from Pennsylvania!', Nicholas Colangelo filmed his friend Fred Christensen pulling a live red-breasted merganser out of a hole in a large sheet of ice in  Monday. Red-breasted mergansers dive into the water while foraging for food and can usually stay under for a little under a minute - so the fisherman pulled up the line at the perfect moment. Catch of the day: Three men were ice fishing in northwest Pennsylvania when the caught a red-breasted merganser on their line as it was diving for food . Christensen, who was fishing for muskies with Colangelo and friend Luke Wholey, told Daily Mail Online that he realized immediately that he wasn't pulling up a fish, but he wasn't expecting a bird. 'I wasn't exactly certain what flashed passed the hole, there were colors that just didn't set well with me so I was hesitant of grabbing something I hadn't yet identified,' he wrote in an e-mail interview. '[It] Wasn't until I saw feathers that I realized what was going on.' 'My jaw hit the ice,' Colangelo told the Washington Post. 'I was absolutely shocked.' Colangelo said that though he and his friends go fishing regularly and have seen mergansers dive under water for long stretches of time, he wasn't expecting to catch the bird on his fishing line. 'I've never heard of anything like this happening,' he told the Washington Post. 'It was so unusual.' In the video, Christensen can be seen pulling up the fishing line out of a small hole in the water until he eventually reaches his hand in and pulls out a squirming live bird. Unexpected: Fred Christensen, pictured on Monday, said he wasn't sure what he was pulling up on the line, but he was certain it wasn't a fish . Unusual: Christensen was hesitant to reach into the water at first, but he grabbed the merganser and likely saved it from drowning on the end of the fishing line . After Christensen posed for a picture, the men untangled the bird and set it free into it's natural habitat. 'It didn't take long to realize it wasn't happy, I just grabbed the mean end as soon as I saw the chance,' Christensen wrote in an e-mail. 'I figured controlling its head and body would make unhooking and tangling much faster, I treated it the same as I would a fish. Thankfully Nick was there to help, it would have been a difficult task to accomplish alone,' he added. Colangelo told the Washington Post that the bird was only minimally tangled and easily made its way back to its flock. Christensen said that he had never heard of people catching a merganser through the ice, but said that it occasionally happens 'in open water in ares where large amounts of water birds like to congregate'. The three fishermen don't kill anything that they catch while fishing and release it all back into the wild. 'I would just sincerely like to say that the environment , the fish the birds - that's what's high priority,' Colangelo told the Washington Post. Catch-and-release: Red-breasted mergansers dive into the water looking for food. The men untangled the bird from their fishing line and set it free to return to its flock . Christensen said that there's 'no sense in killing' the fish they catch, and that you never know a fish's full potential if it's killed. 'I've seen and have caught fish I've released even years prior that have had identifying scars or characteristics that couldn't be mistaken,' he said. 'When you experience catching a fish that you've caught before it is a good feeling to see that the fish is still alive and well. It gives you that much more incentive to let them all go,' he added. The three men often fish for musky, a rare and large species that is known to be difficult to catch. The freshwater fish is often spotted around the Great Lakes region and through Canada. Colangelo and Wholey hit headlines last month after catching a 53-pound musky while ice fishing n northwest Pennsylvania, according to CBS. The men estimated that the fish was about 30 years old. They were one pound away from matching a 1949 state record for biggest musky catch. Christensen that that three days prior to catching the merganser, he had another unusual bird encounter. 'I watched a bald eagle wipe out a Canadian goose and carried it as far as it could until it realized it was extremely heavy,' he wrote. 'It just so happened it dropped less than ten yards from where I was quietly sitting waiting for a flag to pop.' 'Most would find this crazy uncommon, but for me it's just a typical day on water,' the fisherman said. Under the ice: Christensen, and his friends Nicholas Colangelo and Luke Wholey fish for muskies in northwest Pennsylvania . Reeling it in: The fish, found mostly in the Great Lakes region and in Canada, are rare, large and difficult to catch .	Fred Christensen was fishing for musky in northwestern Pennsylvania .

The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers is increasing as borrowers take advantage of the ultra-low rates on offer, according to a high street banking report. Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February with a collective value of £6.2billion, marking a 2 per cent increase on the previous month, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said. While the number of house purchase approvals is still 20 per cent lower than a year ago, early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year, the BBA said. Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February with a collective value of £6.2billion . Meanwhile, in further signs of growing consumer confidence, the annual growth in people's borrowing on personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards is continuing to increase at its fastest rate since 2008, at 4.4 per cent. The BBA also said that deposit levels with high street banks saw slow growth in February, which could be partly due to the popularity of the Government's recently-launched, market-beating 'pensioner bonds'. Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: 'The increase in mortgage approvals is welcome news and a sign that the housing market is beginning to improve. 'We're seeing stronger demand for mortgages as consumers take advantage of some of the very competitive deals currently available. 'Demand for loans and other types of personal borrowing is rising at its fastest rate since the financial crisis. Consumers are feeling increasingly confident about buying big ticket items, such as cars or home improvements, as the recovery really begins to take hold. The British Bankers' Association (BBA) have said the increase is 'welcome news' 'Personal deposits grew very slowly as alternative savings vehicles remain attractive, particularly the new pensioner bond.' Lending to non-financial companies fell by £200million, with growth in manufacturing, transport, storage and communication offset by net repayments from the construction, accommodation and food services and the wholesale and retail sectors, the BBA said. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: 'The recovery in mortgage lending reflects a very favourable economic backdrop. 'Mortgage rates are at record lows, and fewer households now expect a rise in rates within the next year. The reform to stamp duty has also increased most buyers' purchasing power. And that boost to affordability has been accompanied by further improvements in the labour market. 'Real earnings are finally rising, unemployment is falling, and the employment rate has reached record highs. That should all act to boost the mortgage market.' Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the BBA's mortgage figures reinforce his belief 'that the housing market is now gradually turning around after weakening during much of 2014'. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said low mortgage rates are likely to be around for a while yet. He said that with Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation at 0 per cent, a rise in the Bank of England base rate from its current 0.5 per cent level this year is 'highly unlikely and could even have been pushed back for 18 months to two years'. Mr Harris said: ''The good news for borrowers is that rates are likely to be very competitive over (the) coming months.'	Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February . They had a collective value of  £6.2billion, a 2 per cent increase on January . Number of house purchase approvals still 20 per cent lower than last year .

The Melbourne Islamic State jihadi who had his bloodied dead body posted on social media had reportedly committed a string of criminal offences before he fled to the Middle East. New details have emerged that Suhan Rahman, who was killed while fighting in Syria last week, was sentenced to 80 hours of community service for attempting to pervert the course of justice and witness intimidation in 2013, according to The Australian. The 23-year-old, who was previously pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar, also faced a number of charges including assault and unlicensed driving, where he was hit with a $1000 fine. Melbourne Suhan Rahman was reportedly a convicted criminal before he fled the country for the Middle East . The revelation comes just less than a week after a woman claiming to be the wife posted her deceased husband Rahman on Twitter, announcing that he had been killed fighting for the IS. His twisted wife said: ‘May Allah accept my husband, Abu Jihad al Australi.’ ‘Promised Allah and fought in the front lines until he obtained shahadah,’ she added. Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January. ‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter. His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria. The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’ A researcher at the London based terrorist research centre ICSR posted this photo of Rahman on Twitter . A woman claiming to be Suhan Rahman's wife posted a bloodied photo of her dead husband on Twitter. A rifle was placed on his body . The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.' ‘And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead,’ she added. She also posted a photo of a man that looks like Rahman praying. The 23-year-old was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar earlier this year and was also friends with playboy Melbourne jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif. Rahman and Abdullatif regularly conversed via Twitter before Abdullatif was reported dead in January. In November Rahman confessed to Abdullatif it was his ‘first time using twitter its tripping out bruv [sic]’. Abdullatif replied: ‘Lol I know I still don’t how to use it.’ The woman asked for Allah to 'accept' her husband, who she called Abu Jihad al Australi . The 23-year-old (left) was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar (right) earlier this year . ‘Ye how do I retweet to others and what duz dat mean.’ Rahman asked. ‘I’ll explain when I come home insha Allah,’ Abdullatif responded. Along with his recent postings on Twitter, Rahman also uploaded one photograph of himself wielding a high-powered silver rifle AK47. Referencing the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in January, where two Islamist gunmen killed editor Stéphane Charbonnier and 11 other people, Rahman wrote: 'May allah accept the french brothers who terrorised france. Allahu akbar. Day by day we will bring the war home to you.’ His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn. Rahman's family made a desperate plea for him to return home in January after his father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities that he was fighting with IS, The Daily Telegraph reports. A woman claiming to be Rahman's wife posted this photo of a man that looks like him praying . Abdullatif and Rahman chatted about how they didn't know how to use Twitter back in November 2014 . Mr Rahman was told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they were monitoring his son's every movement overseas. His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to go to Syria. 'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph. 'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.'

Los Angeles (CNN)Three area residents were arrested and charged Wednesday for allegedly operating four Southern California schools for Korean and Chinese students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a "pay-to-stay" scheme. The three educators collected as much as $6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from South Korea and China, said federal prosecutors. The arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud, money laundering and other immigration offenses. An allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme, authorities said. Hee Sun Shim, 51, of Beverly Hills, is the owner and manager and of the postsecondary schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud, authorities said. The two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense: They are Hyung Chan Moon, also known as Steve Moon, 39, of Los Angeles who assisted in the operation and management of the schools; and Eun Young Choi, also known as Jamie Choi, 32, of Los Angeles, a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school. Shim, who also went by Leonard Shim and Leo Shim, is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence, as well as two counts of money laundering, prosecutors said. The three defendants and their attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. "Immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules," Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Yonekura said in a statement. "In this case, officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country. This type of fraud against the United States will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system," the federal prosecutor said. Three of the schools are in Los Angeles' Koreatown neighborhood: Prodee University/Neo-America Language School; Walter Jay M.D. Institute, an Educational Center (WJMD); and the American College of Forensic Studies (ACFS), authorities said. The fourth school is currently operating in Alhambra, California: Likie Fashion and Technology College, authorities said. "What we've broken up is a pay-to-stay scheme," said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "That's a scheme where institutions purport to be schools, but are really not doing any education whatsoever," he said. "Any scheme where someone gains access to the U.S. through fraud is also a national security vulnerability," Arnold said. "Although we don't have any information that any of these people wish to do harm to the U.S., the point is anyone could take advantage of a vulnerability like this. Which is why it is so important that we identify these vulnerabilities and shut them down." Prodee University/Neo-America Language School was located on the fifth floor of a Los Angeles office tower near the Koreatown neighborhood, but Homeland Security Investigations agents said they found the school "abandoned" during their raid on Wednesday. The agents allowed CNN to attend the raid. The school featured classrooms, administrative offices and a small library, but no one occupied the spaces. In fact, the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set, filled with props and decorations, but no actors. In one small room, a CD player serenaded empty desks with classical music. The tiny library featured USC and UCLA pennants. The television wasn't even plugged in.  One federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older, in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Prodee's 2011-2012 catalog describes the facility as an English as second language school and states "It is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand English in all facets of life by providing a top quality ESL educational environment," according to a copy of the document on the website of the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. "Our enthusiastic and qualified instructors concern themselves with teaching a rigorous, but innovative curriculum of interactive and beneficial courses and materials leading to higher TOEFL scores and admission to U.S. colleges and universities," the catalog says. Another document with the state bureau indicates Prodee had a 73% graduation rate in 2011 and a 60% rate in 2010. But the indictment alleges that students actually lived Nevada, Texas, Washington state and Arizona. The schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the United States, authorities said. The document, called a Form I-20, made a student eligible for a F-1 student visa. In exchange for that form, students paid $1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months, authorities said. During their investigation, authorities interviewed 35 students, mainly from South Korea, and found none resided in Los Angeles, officials said. An unannounced federal inspection of Prodee's main site in 2011 found only one English class with three students, though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites, prosecutors said. On the same day, federal authorities also visited the American College of Forensic Studies found only one religion with one student, though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students, prosecutors said. Some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other U.S. schools also participating in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program, prosecutors said. The conspiracy count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. The immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison, and the money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years, authorities said. Wednesday's arrests follow last week's federal raids of more than three dozen "maternity hotels" in Southern California where foreign women give birth, allegedly for the sole purpose of having a U.S.-citizen baby, authorities said. The "maternity tourism" sites included apartment complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth, federal officials said. Those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from China, who paid $15,000 to $50,000 for lodging, transportation and food, according to a statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those fees don't necessarily include medical care, authorities said. Specifically, authorities in the maternity tourism raids obtained search warrants for 37 location and conducted searches at more than 50 locations, including sites that consented to a federal search, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before attempting to subvert the system . Last week it was revealed that BeautifulPeople.com had expelled over 3,000 people for not maintaining the appearance necessary to meet the high standards expected on the site. The move was welcomed by most of the member - but angered outsiders who disagreed with the site's selective policy. The 'Ugly' troll attack originated in Russia where over 2,700 applications were made to the site in a few hours. Over half of these were fake profiles and part of the ugly troll army. Similar coordinated attacks have come from the United States and the United Kingdom with 1,435 U.S. 'trolls' removed from the site and 400 from the UK in the past few days. BeautifulPeople.com is a site that is designed only with Beautifu lPeople in mind where users vote for those they think are the most attractive to stay on the site . 2,700 of the recent surge in fake profiles were from Russia, where the revenge campaign began . Greg Hodge, the managing director of BeautifulPeople.com, said: 'We had large spikes in numbers applying to join the site using profiles which immediately raised the suspicions of our administrators. 'Initially the scale of applications from specific geographical areas – Russia, the United States and the UK in particular – caused concern, when we examined the applications in more detail, we noticed a large number of what appeared to be fake profile pictures. 'We then traced this back to various social media sites calling for an attack on our site.' 'People had come together on forums such as Reddit to discuss the site and how they could hijack it by creating the fake profiles.' This is not the first time the site has been under attack. BeautifulPeople.com has been hit with 'denial of service' attacks, and had their rating system sabotaged in 2011. In response the site has introduced new measures to verify profiles and wannabe members must now take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of card with their name and date written on it . Recently 3,000 members were removed because organisers felt they had let themselves go. This chap is an example of somebody who would make the BeautifulPeople.com grade . The site introduced a system of validated membership in 2012, whereby entrants are encouraged to take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper with their name and date handwritten on it to prove that their pictures are genuine. Validated members get a 'verification stamp' on their profiles. Prior to the attack this feature was optional, but the makers have been forced to make profile verification mandatory. BeautifulPeople.com is the first dating site to force all users to prove they are genuine. Hodge said: 'Fake profiles are the number one problem in the online dating market today. 'We have always led the field in combating this. In taking this next step, we believe we will all but eliminate disingenuous profiles on our site and set the example for the online dating market as a whole. Online daters do not want their time wasted with fraudulent profiles.' The creators of BeautifulPeople.com are husband and wife duo Genevieve and Greg Hodge . He added: 'Having an exclusive dating site is not without controversy. There will always be a degree of jealousy from those who don't make the cut. 'Thankfully, through swift action by our administrators, vigilant members and the introduction of an extra level of verification has meant that we have been able to root out the attackers and ensure that our site remains beautiful and exclusive.' Entry to BeautifulPeople.com is only possible after passing a democratic rating process, where members of the opposite sex vote 'Yes definitely', 'Hmm yes, O.K', 'Hmm no, not really' and 'NO Definitely NOT' based on photographs and a brief profile submitted by new applicants. After the recent cull, over 800,000 members remain on the site, representing 190 countries and almost every ethnic and cultural background. A global average of one in ten applicants that apply to the site are accepted.	BeautifulPeople.com is an elitist internet dating site . To join you have to be deemed attractive by the other users .

Driving ban: Alison Baker, 60, was allowed by a judge to attend the classes she used to run . A motorist who ran drink-drive awareness classes has been banned from the road after being caught three times over the limit. But Alison Baker, of Pinhoe, Devon, was allowed by a judge to attend the course she used to run - which would see her ban reduced by a quarter if completed. The 60-year-old had twice driven to her local petrol station to buy bottles of wine within a couple of hours of one morning last May. But the garage cashier was concerned she was not in a fit state to drive on the second visit and told police, Exeter Magistrates’ Court heard. Officers turned up at her home, and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up. Baker had denied drink-driving but was convicted after a trial last month, before being banned from the road for two years yesterday. In an account rejected by a district judge, she blamed the high reading on post-driving consumption and said she had downed one and a half bottles of wine in about ten minutes before the police came to her home. Yesterday, Sonia Croft, prosecuting, said Baker was a trainer on drink-drive courses and should not be allowed her to attend such classes. She claimed that Baker would know all about the course and gain nothing from it. But Vanessa Francis, defending, said this claim by prosecutors was 'spiteful and unnecessarily punitive'. Sentencing: Exeter Magistrates’ Court (pictured) was told that when Baker eventually answered the door she was so drunk that she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up . She said this was Baker's first drink-driving offence and it would be unfair to refuse a first-time offender the chance to go on the course. District Judge Stephen Nicholls accepted this request. He banned her from driving for 26 months - but that could fall by 26 weeks if she passes the course by August 2016. She was also given an 18-month community order and told to pay £430 in costs. Miss Francis said Baker was involved in drink-drive courses in the local area for three years - but was made redundant three years ago because of the rise in the number of privately-run providers. During her trial Baker - who ran the classes for Devon County Council - denied using her intimate professional knowledge of alcohol units and driving to 'tailor her defence'. Vehicle: Baker claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car (file) She did not contest the high reading - 104mg of alcohol in her breath when the legal limit is 35mg - but claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car. Baker admitted decanting wine from bottles so she could hide them from her husband. She said she used alcohol for pain relief for arthritis and suffered problems with her knees, legs and wrist. The defendant said she drank herself into 'oblivion'  and would down alcohol until she passed out. Baker hid the empty bottles of wine - placing some of them in equipment she used for her drink drive awareness courses. She denied being over the limit, saying she only had two units of alcohol between trips, but admitted: ’I can't remember the police coming to the house.’	Alison Baker's ban will be reduced by a quarter if she completes course .

Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop’s advice. 'Although not as "sexy" as "anti-inflammatory diets" and "magical cures", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website’s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘magical cure’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you’re pregnant!' Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products . This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'. This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful. Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content. Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'	Mother-of-two Gwyneth Paltrow enlisted her go-to 'pain expect', Vicky Vlachonis, to write the tips on her lifestyle website, Goop . While some of the tips, like eating healthily and keeping calm, have been welcomed by experts, others have proven less popular .

A Muslim terror convert who tried to take his new-born baby to Somalia is suing the FBI and his own mother for 'conspiring to stop his on living in Jordan with his wife'. Zachary Chesser, of Virginia, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for attempting to support terrorist groups after his name appeared on the no-fly list at an airport in 2010. The 25-year-old had been on law enforcement's radar after posting threats against the creators of 'South Park' for cartoons he felt insulted the prophet Muhammad. Zachary Chesser (pictured), of Virginia, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for attempting to support terrorist groups after his name appeared on the no-fly list at an airport in 2010 . He was arrested as he attempted to leave America to join a terror group in Somalia - hoping that taking a baby with him to the airport would make him appear less suspicious. Chesser now lives in the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. His wife, a Ugandan diplomat's daughter named Proscovia Nzabanita, had to leave the United States in early 2011 after pleading guilty to lying about his plans the year before. The fate of their baby, Talhah, now five, remains at the center of a dispute being heard in federal appellate court this week. Chesser is suing the FBI and his own mother, alleging that agents interfered with his parental rights by conspiring with his mother and her partner to ensure that the boy could not travel to Jordan to live with his wife. Instead, the boy is being raised by his mother, Barbara Chesser, a senior lawyer in the Office of the Attorney General in the District of Columbia, and her partner, who is also named as a defendant. Chesser was behind bars and Nzabanita was facing deportation when his mother initiated custody proceedings, but both still enjoyed full parental rights, and they 'opposed placing the young boy with his grandparents, who did not share Chesser and his wife's conservative Islamic beliefs,' his court-appointed attorney, Wayne LaFond, says in their appeal. But Chesser is not seeking custody. Instead, he wants monetary damages. Chesser and his wife planned to travel together to Somalia where he would join al-Shabab extremists (file picture of al-Shabab fighters) Talhah was born in November 2009 to Chesser and his wife, a woman he met at a mosque in Washington, DC. They planned to travel together to Somalia where he would join al-Shabab, but Nzabanita's mother hid her passport. Then, in the summer of 2010, they tried again. This time, Nzabanita dropped off Chesser and the baby to make the trip without her. Soon, they were both arrested. Chesser was facing a lengthy prison sentence, and Nzabanita struck a plea deal requiring her to leave the country, likely for good. According to Chesser's complaint, agents monitoring his prison conversations in January 2011 tipped off Barbara Chesser that the young couple was making plans for a friend to take the boy to Jordan and join Nzabanita there. Chesser's complaint states that agents went to the airport to stop that trip. Soon thereafter, Barbara Chesser won full custody of the boy after a judge declared Chesser and Nzabanita to be unfit parents. LaFond argues that the FBI had no business disclosing the content of his conversations to intervene in a family custody dispute. 'Prisoners largely lose the right to keep secrets from the government,' he wrote, but 'they retain the right to keep those secrets from those outside the government.' Jailed: Chesser (pictured) now lives in the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado . Chesser was acting as his own lawyer when he first sued, in 2013. Judge Liam O'Grady dismissed that complaint, which remains under seal, as delusional and irrational. Chesser then amended his complaint, saying the essential facts remain accurate. 'It might not be particularly normal for the FBI to become so involved in a child custody proceeding ... but the scenarios described in the amended Complaint are far from fanciful,' he wrote. O'Grady again dismissed the lawsuit, saying Chesser had no expectation of privacy for conversations that occurred in a prison setting and therefore no reason to object when the FBI disclosed the conversation to his mother. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond appointed LaFond to handle Chesser's appeal. 'Nothing alleged by Chesser is irrational or incredible. Chesser's complaint alleges that government agents misused confidential information they had gathered about him,' LaFond wrote. Lawyers for the FBI agents want a ruling that their actions are completely legal. They wrote that no precedent exists 'remotely suggesting that the disclosure of a parent's travel plans for a child can violate the parent's constitutional right to privacy,' especially when the disclosure revolves around plans to relocate a child out of the country ahead of a custody hearing. Barbara Chesser did not return calls seeking comment. This damages dispute is just the latest  turn in the saga. Addressing Chesser at his sentencing in 2011, O'Grady said he 'took just a shocking leap from a high-school athlete to a highly energized traitor.' Chesser's lawyers described a young man casting about for an identity, throwing himself headlong into whatever hobby consumed him. He joined a Korean breakdancing team, and became so fascinated with Japanese anime that he spent four years studying Japanese and traveled to Japan on a school trip. Then, he converted to Islam after becoming infatuated during his senior year with the daughter of Somali immigrants. That ended when he demanded they marry. Chesser's divorced father said his son became so radical, he was 'even wearing some type of loin cloth in place of underwear.' Chesser's name resurfaced earlier this year when the FBI named a 'close associate' of his in northern Virginia, Liban Mohamed, to its list of most-wanted terrorists.

A 26-year-old teacher from Oregon has been jailed in Japan after receiving a bottle of prescribed Adderall pills in the mail for her attention deficit disorder. Carrie Russell has been held at a detention center near Nagoya since February 20 over the pills, the Oregonian reported. Amphetamines - which include Adderall - are illegal in Japan. Russell's mother, who is a doctor in Portland, originally sent her daughter's prescription to South Korea which the 26-year-old then forwarded on to Nagoya where she was moving for an English teaching job, according to the newspaper. Carrie Russell has been jailed in Japan after receiving a bottle of Adderall pills in the mail in order to treat her attention deficit disorder. The drug is illegal in Japan . Authorities found Russell's pills tucked inside a Tylenol bottle, the Oregonian reported. Dr Jill Russell told the newspaper she put the pills in the Tylenol bottle so as not to draw the attention of thieves wanting to sell them. She also said that she acted out of concern for her daughter's social standing if anybody saw the pills. She said in an affidavit obtained by the newspaper: 'My repackaging was not an attempt to break or circumvent the law. It was intended to preserve Carrie's privacy and dignity around a sensitive issue regarding medication to treat a disorder which falls under the area of mental health.' Miss Russell's family said that she has been in a detention facility near Nagoya, Japan since last month . The 26-year-old was arrested at a Tokyo restaurant where she was dining with friends on February 20 and jailed, the Oregonian reported. Authorities are holding Russell on suspicion of trying to sneak in amphetamine drugs, according to the newspaper. The newspaper noted that a few notices, including a document from the Consulate General of Japan in Seattle, appear online and say not to carry Adderall into the Asian nation. Amphetamines were banned by Japan in the 1950s. The Oregonian also pointed out that there is a mental health stigma in the country. Russell's family learned about what happened on February 21 - one day after her arrest - according to the newspaper. The family's attorney in Portland, Loren Podwill - who is Carrie Russell's stepfather - told the NY Daily News that her family was working with the State Department to find a 'quick and successful resolution'.

She's a great-grandmother and 102 years old but that doesn't stop Margaret Deas working out five days a week. Incredibly the Sydney woman was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis. Now Margaret enjoys the gym and exercise classes with her friends at the Thomas Holt Sans Souci Gardens aged care facility, in Sydney. Margaret Deas, 102, could very well be Australia's fittest great grandmother after she completed 102 squats on her birthday this year . She's a great-grandmother but that doesn't stop Margaret Deas working out five days a week . Incredibly Margaret was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis . And while some may like to take it easy on their birthday, Margaret decided to complete her most impressive feat yet in celebration of her special day earlier this year. ‘Last year my physio John said I'm going to get you to do 102 squats for your birthday, I said 'you have to be joking',’ Margaret told the Daily Mail Australia. ‘I've never really exercised. When I was young I did the Girl Guides and all the activities that came with that,’ she added. ‘But later it was mainly walking; my eldest girl was about 15 or 16 before we had a car so we used to walk to the train station when we wanted to go somewhere.’ Physio John Abd-Mariam has been working with Margaret, a mother of four daughters, for a number of years, and when they first met the 102-year-old was not nearly as fit as she is now. One of her four daughters Suzanne said her mother was never really into exercise when she was younger . But she did enjoy riding horses in her leisure time - pictured here on horseback with her husband Colin . Margaret initially took a bit of persuading to start exercising but once she started she didn't look back . ‘Initially we worked on basic standing balance exercises. She could manage about two minutes before fatiguing,’ John told Daily Mail Australia. A few years earlier Margaret had broken her pelvis in three places, at the age of 93, and needed to be rehabilitated after that. ‘Through her regular attendance at the classes (over 12 months), and her willingness to be encouraged to improve, she managed to increase to over 10 minutes of continuous standing exercises,’ John continued. Her daughter, Suzane, said the improvement in her mother in recent years has been phenomenal . Her transformation is incredible as Margaret had broken her pelvis in three places when she was 93 and needed rehabilitation . From there John continued to encourage Margaret to keep getting better. And in January 31 this year she completed over 102 squats – and all in the name of charity. ‘It was in late December last year that I initially suggested to Margaret that she should do one squat for every year of her life',’ John said. ‘I tried persuading Margaret over several days, initially to no avail, however as Margaret has such a lovely and selfless spirit I suggested that she could use the opportunity to raise money for a charity. ‘(This was) an idea which Margaret jumped at, and with that motivating drive we are where we are today.' ‘At first I was going to do it for the children in the third world countries,’ Margaret revealed. ‘Then I thought I've been in the Wildlife Society (of Australia) for about 15 years and I thought well… I’ll do it for them’. One of her four daughters Suzanne said although her mother was never really into exercise, the improvement she has seen in her in recent years has been phenomenal. 'One of the biggest differences we've noticed is the emotional difference,' Suzanne told Daily Mail Australia. 'Mum has a lot more of a positive outlook, she has always been positive... (but) there's definitely a difference in her contentment. The 102-year-old has always loved being outdoors - especially with horses . Margaret's fitness involves some singing, balance activities, weights, and a little bit of cardio . 'She's still very well mentally, she is very interested in politics and current affairs.' A few months on Margaret now has some tough competition as her friend Pauline Sciberras, who is nearly 92, has also joined in exercising with her, and is getting very good at her squats. ‘Pauline, Enid and I come up here straight after breakfast I do the pedals while we sing Amazing Grace, All Things Bright and Beautiful, and Onward, Christian Soldiers,’ Margaret said. ‘Pauline has just lately started doing the squats, she can do about 100 but she does them quicker than me. She does about two or three to my one, but I go all the way down.' The exercise is making a big difference for Margaret not only physically but also mentally who turned 102 on January 31 . Margaret was given a silver medal from the President of Ireland, her home country, on her birthday . The gym and exercise classes at the Thomas Holt Sans Souci Gardens aged care facility where Margaret lives have proved very popular . ‘I love it!' Pauline told the Daily Mail Australia with great enthusiasm. ‘I wouldn't stay without it.’ The women also revealed that since John has been running classes for the residents, which involve some singing, balance activities, weights, and a little bit of cardio, more and more people have been joining in. ‘Sometimes we have six, sometimes we have nine. One time we even had ten people come,’ Margaret revealed. To this day Margaret has raised over $5,000 for charity, which was donated to the Marine Sea Turtle Project in Cairns, Far North Queensland. In Margaret's honour one of the sea turtles recently rescued in the area - believed to be over 80 years old - was named after her. She also received letters from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove and a silver medal from the President of Ireland, her home country, on her birthday. As for what she might do for her 103rd birthday, Margaret isn't sure. But John hinted that he might have something up his sleeve to help her celebrate the next milestone.

CIA researchers have been involved in a 'sustained effort' for nearly a decade to crack the security protecting Apple iPhones and iPads. This is according to investigative news site, The . Intercept, who today cited documents obtained from . NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The report says top-secret documents reveal U.S. government researchers had created a version of XCode, Apple's . software application development tool, to create surveillance . backdoors. CIA researchers have been involved in a 'sustained effort' for nearly a decade to crack the security protecting Apple iPhones and tablets. This is according to, investigative news site, The Intercept, who claims to have access to top secret files detailing the spying activity . These backdoors would have allowed them access into programs distributed on Apple's App Store. The Intercept has in the past published a number of reports . from documents released by whistleblower Snowden. The site's . editors include Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for . his work in reporting on Snowden's revelations, and by . Oscar-winning documentary maker Laura Poitras. It said the latest documents, which covered a period from . 2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligence . researchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding, . which secures user data and communications. Efforts to break into Apple products by government security . researchers started as early as 2006, a year before Apple . introduced its first iPhone and continued through the launch of . the iPad in 2010 and beyond, The Intercept said. The Intercept today cited documents obtained from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured).  It said the latest documents, which covered a period from2006 to 2013, stop short of proving whether U.S. intelligenc eresearchers had succeeded in breaking Apple's encryption coding . Breaching Apple security was part of a top-secret programme . by the U.S. government, aided by British intelligence . researchers, to hack 'secure communications products, both . foreign and domestic' including Google Android phones, it added. Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months . sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that . their products have not become tools for widespread government . surveillance of citizens. Last September, Apple strengthened encryption methods for . data stored on iPhones. It claimed the changes meant the company no . longer had any way to extract customer data on the devices, even . if a government ordered it to with a search warrant. Silicon . Valley rival Google said shortly afterward that it . also planned to increase the use of stronger encryption tools. What is a 'backdoor'? A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection. Should you be worried if you use an Apple device? Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit. So far there has been no evidence that they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack . How would could the government potentially make use of these backdoors? Backdoors can provide access to unencrypted information even if users have chosen to encrypt the data they back up. Data can include the user's address book, stored photos, the voicemail database and any accounts configured on the device. What are the main concerns? Earlier this year, security expert Jonathan Zdziarski focused on three particular services known by the technical names com.apple.pcapd, com.apple.mobile.file_relay and com.apple.mobile.house_arrest that are a cause for concern. How do these hidden files work? The pcapd service starts a 'packet sniffer' on an iOS device which records all data traffic to and from your iPhone. It's installed by default on all iOS devices and gives the user no warning when it's activated. The file_relay service exists to sweep up large volumes of raw data from particular sources on an iPhone, and then release it in unencrypted form. These include the address book, accounts, GPS logs, photos, notes, calendar files, call history, voicemail and other records. The third service, house_arrest, originally allowed iTunes to copy documents to third-party apps. Now, as reported in ReadWrite, house_arrest has access to wider app-related data, including photos, databases, screenshots and temporary 'cached' information. More information about Apple's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm's support pages. Both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the . privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a . response to wide-scale U.S. government spying on internet users . revealed by Snowden in 2013. An Apple spokesman pointed to public statements by chief executive Tim Cook on privacy, but declined to comment further. 'I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked . with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor . in any of our products or services,' Cook wrote in a statement . on privacy and security published last year. 'We have also never . allowed access to our servers. And we never will.' Leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and British . Prime Minister David Cameron have expressed concern that turning . such privacy-enhancing tools into mass market features could . prevent governments from tracking militants planning attacks. The CIA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Silicon Valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens . Last year, a security expert warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. Mr Zdziarski said there is a file dubbed ‘com.apple.pcapd’ on the device that fires up without notifying the iOS device's owner. He explained this can record network traffic and HTTP request/response data from the device and could be targeted via Wi-Fi. ‘This software isn't some legacy code left on the device by Apple engineers for testing - it has been actively updated and expanded in various iOS revisions,’ The Register claimed. Backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit, and so far there has been no evidence they've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack . Apple responded by saying the services identified by Mr Zdziarski are not deliberately provided for government agencies to exploit. The company added they are for 'diagnostic' purposes, and to allow IT workers to manage their company’s devices.	This is according to Intercept which claims to have seen top secret files . It says spies had created a version of XCode - an app development tool . This would have allowed them access to programs on Apple's App Store .

England Test captain Alastair Cook could only make three runs as he opened the batting for MCC in their match against LV= County Championship winners Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi. Having top-scored in MCC's t20 defeat to Sussex on Friday, Cook could not replicate his form as he was trapped lbw by Ryan Sidebottom, with his side all out for 221 in their first innings. Yorkshire's reply started strongly and they ended day one on 82 for two, with Adam Lyth - the man who could partner Cook on England's tour of the West Indies - hitting an unbeaten half-century. Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi . Yorkshire's Ryan Sidebottom celebrates after trapping Cook lbw for just three runs . Cook will now be able to see at the closest of quarters whether or not Lyth has what it takes to occupy that spot in the wake of his first call-up earlier this week. Sidebottom removed Nick Compton - someone who has partnered Cook in Tests - with the first ball of the match as the MCC captain edged a delivery into Jonny Bairstow's gloves. Cook soon followed Compton back into the pavilion before Michael Carberry and James Hildreth steadied the ship. James Hildreth scored 89 to help MCC up to a score of 221 in their first innings in Abu Dhabi . Adam Lyth was unbeaten on 53 as Yorkshire closed day one on 82 for two in response . The duo put on 74 for the third wicket before Carberry fell for 36, but Hildreth pushed on and made 89 before Tim Bresnan got him out lbw after lunch. Daryl Mitchell (54) and Zafar Ansari (24) were the only others who could make it into double figures as the final five batsmen could only add five runs between them. Lyth then took centre-stage as he started the Yorkshire reply, although he lost fellow opener and captain Alex Lees as he was caught behind off the bowling of Matt Dunn for 11. The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi is once again playing host to the floodlight contest . A 72-ball half-century from Lyth kept the reigning champions ticking over until Jack Leaning was caught off Ansari late in the day - with Steven Patterson brought in as night-watchman to see out the closing overs. He will return to the crease with Lyth (53 not out) on Monday with Yorkshire trailing by 139 runs with eight first-innings wickets in hand.

The Premier League Golden Boot is one of the most sought-after individual prizes in the game - and this season’s competition is delicately poised for the final run-in. The three main contenders - Chelsea’s Diego Costa on 19, Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane on 19 and Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero on 17 - are all in with a chance of winning it. Will it go down to form? Will it be rocked by injury and suspension? Will it have the fairytale conclusion that so many would love to see? Sportsmail takes a look at the runners and riders in the race for the Golden Boot... The race for the Golden Boot seems to be between Harry Kane (left), Diego Costa (centre) and Sergio Aguero . Left foot: 5 . Right foot: 10 . Head: 4 . Minutes per goal: 98.26 . Harry Kane, Tottenham Hotspur . Can Harry Kane’s whirlwind season continue right until the end or will it run out of air? His hat-trick against Leicester in Tottenham’s last league match just goes to show how quickly the goalscorers chart can change as he leapt to catch Diego Costa within the space of 90 minutes. Ultimately, any Englishman and most neutrals would want to see Kane top at the end of the campaign, regardless of which team they support, given his story. Kane’s main downfall will be his lack of experience. Hopefully his youthful exuberance will not fade into nervous tension. Costa, 26, and Aguero, 26, are seasoned experts compared to the 21-year-old, more aware of what is required to find the back of the net after a long campaign when the thighs ache and the quads burn. Tottenham Hotspur's Kane was 500/1 to be the Premier League's top goalscorer at the start of the season . Burnley (A) (scored 1 goal against) Aston Villa (H) 1 . Newcastle United (A) 1 . Southampton (A) Manchester City (H) Stoke City (A) Hull City (A) 1 . Everton (A) Record against remaining teams: scored against 4/8 (four goals total) This zonal map shows where Kane scored his 19 goals this season for Tottenham in the Premier League . This pitch view map shows where Kane scored his goals from around the 18-yard box for Tottenham . Left foot: 5 . Right foot: 11 . Head: 3 . Minutes per goal: 102.42 . Diego Costa, Chelsea . The snarling, street-fighting Chelsea striker is joint-top of the goalscorers chart, but has played fewer games to reach his total goals tally and has one more to play than his two main rivals. Forget Kane and Aguero, however, Costa’s main adversary is himself. His aggressive style of play means he is the most likely of the three to pick up a suspension. He is already on eight domestic yellow cards for the season and was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on Liverpool’s Emre Can. Chelsea also have a tougher run-in than Tottenham and Manchester City. They still have to face Manchester United and Liverpool at home and Arsenal away. Having said that, Costa has already scored against Arsenal and Liverpool this season and is yet to face United who have had an unstable defence. Chelsea striker Costa is among the best signings of the season and has 19 goals in the Premier League . Stoke City (H) Queens Park Rangers (A) Manchester United (H) Arsenal (A) (scored 1 goal against) Leicester City (A) 1 . Crystal Palace (H) Liverpool (H) 1 . West Bromwich Albion (A) 1 . Sunderland (H) Record against remaining teams: scored against 4/9 (four goals total) This zonal map shows where Costa scored his 19 goals this season for Chelsea in the Premier League . This pitch view map shows where Costa scored his goals from around the 18-yard box for Chelsea . Left foot: 4 . Right foot: 13 . Head: 0 . Minutes per goal: 107.53 . Sergio Aguero, Manchester City . He is the rank-outsider, but one who you would bet against at your peril. Aguero is trailing the other two by two goals, but he has scored four in one game this season, against Tottenham who he will face again in City’s remaining eight games. Of the three strikers, Aguero is by far the best finisher who can conjure a goal, or two, from nowhere in a game. He has already scored eight times against the last eight teams City have to face - the same amount as Costa and Kane’s record put together in their last fixtures of the season. Injury will be Aguero’s main concern. The knee injury he suffered in December cost him a month out and he has failed to consistently string together games  since he moved there four years ago. Manchester City striker Aguero has 17 goals and is just two behind the leading Premier League goalscorers . Crystal Palace (A) Manchester United (A) (scored 1 goal against) West Ham (H) Aston Villa (H) 1 . Tottenham Hotspur (A) 4 . Queens Park Rangers (H) 2 . Swansea City (A) Southampton (H) Record against remaining teams: scored against 4/8 (eight goals total) This zonal map shows where Aguero scored his 19 goals this season for City in the Premier League . This pitch view map shows where Aguero scored his goals from around the 18-yard box for City . My Golden Boot Guestimate… . This is, obviously, no exact science. You can analyse all the statistics, numbers and records in the world and the enigma of chance will always rear its head. For example, Costa has scored more of his goals, eight, against teams currently sitting from sixth to 10th, but only plays one of those, Stoke. Kane has netted eight of his strikes against teams now in the bottom five, and has two of those, Aston Villa and Burnley, remaining. Conversely, Aguero has a more even spread against teams throughout the table. And Aguero has a far better early-season record against City’s last teams than the other two. But then Aguero has not scored in five games, Costa has two in last two and Kane six in his last four. My heart says Kane, but my head goes with Costa, so I choose the Chelsea man. Charlie Austin, Queens Park Rangers (15 goals) Left foot: 2 . Right foot: 10 . Head: 3 . Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin is four behind the top goalscorers on 15 for the season . Olivier Giroud, Arsenal (13 goals) Left foot: 8 . Right foot: 1 . Head: 4 . Arsenal are well represented in the top five goalscorers this season so far with Olivier Giroud on 13 . Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal (13 goals) Left foot: 0 . Right foot: 11 . Head: 2 . Alexis Sanchez is another Arsenal star among the top Premier League goalscorers with 13 to his name .

(CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. "(It) felt good at the time," a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. "I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not." The club "must have went a good 60, 70 yards," he joked. McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader JB Holmes. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. "I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range," he said. "That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. "So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up." Elsewhere on the course, Ryan Holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Holmes. Former world No 1., Adam Scott carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while Bubba Watson and Henrik Stenson are tied for fourth on four-under.

A blundering Indian groom was dumped at the altar by his bride-to-be after he failed to solve a simple maths problem. The woman walked out of the ceremony after her would-be husband revealed his appalling arithmetic skills moments before they said 'I do.' She had asked him to add up 15 + 6 and he wrongly replied that the answer was 17. An Indian groom was dumped at the altar after he failed to solve a simple maths problem (file picture) 'The groom's family kept us in the dark about his poor education,' said Mohar Singh, the bride's father. 'Even a first grader can answer this.' Most marriages in India are arranged by the families of the bride and groom. Except for brief meetings, the couple rarely gets to know each other before the nuptials. The incident took place in the village of Rasoolabad village near the industrial town of Kanpur in northern Uttar Pradesh state on Wednesday, local police officer Rakesh Kumar said. The groom's family tried persuading the woman to return, but she refused. She claimed the groom had misled them about his education. The woman's family said that a child could have solved the simple arithmetic (file picture) Local police were called in to mediate between the families and both sides returned all the gifts and jewelry that had been exchanged before the wedding, Kumar said. Last month, another bride in Uttar Pradesh married a wedding guest after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed at the wedding venue. Groom Jugal Kishore was just about to exchange vows when he collapsed with a seizure and was rushed to hospital. Angry that she had not been informed of his condition, the 23-year-old bride, Indira, asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, Harpal Singh, to marry her instead. Mr Singh, who was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, was caught off guard, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding. After the ceremony, Mr Kishore returned to the venue after being treated in hospital to find that his fiancee had married someone else, it was reported by The Times of India.

Police officers failed to spot that an elderly widow whose throat had been cut had been murdered. Una Crown, 86, was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and then set on fire in the horrific attack at the bungalow where she lived alone. But detectives, paramedics and firefighters trampled through her home, ‘severely contaminating’ the murder scene, after concluding that she had somehow set herself alight after falling on her cooker. Police had found the body of the retired postmistress, pictured with late husband Jack Roland Crown, covered in blood and with her clothing 'burnt to a crisp' in the hallway . Muddy footprints were left on the floor, a detective touched her front door key with his bare hand and her grieving family was even allowed into the property to clean it up. Concerns were only raised two days later by a mortuary technician. It was another two days before a pathologist examined the body and confirmed the fatal injuries, along with multiple defensive wounds on Mrs Crown’s hands. Detectives are still hunting the killer two years after her brutal death. Coroner William Morris yesterday attacked the services involved for allowing vital clues to be lost as he recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. ‘I have to say the handling of evidence by the police has been unfortunate,’ he said. A theory was formed relatively early on by acting detective sergeant Simon Gledhill that Una Crown had fallen on the hob or cooker and somehow set fire to herself and panicked, and had a heart attack and collapsed in the hallway. ‘In this suspicious death, foul play was too readily dismissed by police officers.’ Not treating the area as a full crime scene prevented a ‘proper forensic examination’ from being carried out. Mrs Crown’s niece, Judith Paynes, told the hearing she was lost for words. ‘I cannot understand why this evidence wasn’t picked up,’ she said. Una Crown, 86, was found dead in the hallway of her bungalow in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, after family and neighbours became concerned for her welfare . Mrs Crown, a retired postmistress, was found dead at her home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, on January 13, 2013, after family and friends became concerned about her whereabouts. She was covered in blood with her clothing ‘burnt to a crisp’ when the emergency services found her. Mr Gledhill was one of the first officers to arrive. In a statement to the inquest in Huntingdon he said there was no sign of forced entry and the death ‘looked accidental’. Emergency services collectively concluded that the fire was caused when a tea towel caught fire on the hob. Home Office pathologist Nat Carey told the hearing: ‘This was clearly a homicide from the wounds I saw – that’s not to say that’s how it was treated. ‘I concluded that she died from multiple stab wounds to her chest and neck.’ Police cordoned off the home after the original officers, paramedics and firefighters who attended the scene on January 13 2013 all decided the widow had died in an accident . Forensic teams finally investigate the crime scene outside Mrs Crown's home- four days after her body was found . Senior investigator Detective Inspector Fraser Wylie told the inquest: ‘The scene was severely contaminated by the police, firefighters and paramedics because this had not been initially picked up as a murder investigation.’ A paramedic had prodded the body and transferred Mrs Crown’s blood to a light switch before rummaging through a chest of drawers. Mr Gledhill used latex gloves during his time at the house but admitted washing a bloodstained key under a tap after he touched it. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hopkins said the family’s complaints had been upheld in a review by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire professional standards department in June 2013. Officers were provided with extra training as a result but none faced formal disciplinary procedures. ‘We recognise the failings by our officers in the initial stages of this investigation and we are deeply sorry for any hurt this has caused Mrs Crown’s family,’ he said. Several people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but all have been released without charge. Home Office pathologist Nat Cary found the death was 'clearly homicide' and 'said that the police's delay had meant that the crime scene had been 'severely contaminated'	Una Crown found burnt and stabbed but police initially ruled it an accident .

The good news for all concerned in Monaco was that it had stopped raining. Arsene Wenger had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the Arsenal manager wasn't the only one casting anxious glances skywards. This is a big day for the new AS Monaco and they do not want it washed out. Arsene Wenger had raised fears over the playing surface at Monaco's Stade Louis II on Monday night . The Stade Louis II has a  poor surface and groundstaff have worked hard to help it drain after heavy rainfall . Dimitar Berbatov celebrates during Monaco's 3-1 win against Arsenal at the Emirates last month . A recent game against Montpellier had been cancelled and because the pitch at the Stade Louis II is a notoriously poor surface, with so much going on beneath it: car parks, swimming pools, etc groundstaff worked through the night to help it drain as they prepare for what they hope will be a famous victory, one which will see them into the last eight of the Champions League for the first time since 2004, when they went on to the final and lost to Jose Mourinho's Porto. Much has happened to Monaco since then. They almost dropped into the third tier of French football and faced extinction before Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again. The first leg result against Arsenal was confirmation that the Rybolovlev project is still on track, having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao last summer.

No club in the Champions League era has surrendered a two-goal lead after playing the first leg away and Leonardo Jardim's team prides itself on tight defence. They have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and are quietly confident history will not be rewritten, with Jardim expected to enhance his reputation for caution by making a tweak or two to his team to make it even more solid.

There were fewer than 6,000 in to see them beat nine-man Bastia on Friday, a 3-0 win which kept them in touch with the Ligue 1 leaders. Despite its rich history, Monaco will never be one of the France's football hotbeds. It is a unique club set in the playground of the privileged, where most of the local residents are far wealthier than any of the players and many of them more recognisable. In Monte Carlo, the most famous of the Principality's districts, you would hardly know there was a big Champions League game on. The stadium is set in Fontvieille, a district reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s, and cut off by a tunnel from the more recognisable sights such as Casino Square, the Opera, a harbour crammed with super-yachts and the Grand Prix circuit. Abdenoour and Ricardo Carvalho congratulate goalscorer Anthony Martial during Friday's 3-0 win over Bastia . Work has started this week in preparation for the Monaco Grand Prix in May. Wenger's first return to the club he managed for seven years until 1994 fails to make the social calendar for many of those who settle here to enjoy tax-free life in the world's smallest monarchy. L'Equipe has devoted it's pages to Tuesday's clash . Prince Albert, the ruling monarch, continues to support the club he used to run and will be at the game, as the French attempt to claim another football triumph against the English after Chelsea were knocked out by Paris St Germain last week. French sports paper L'Equipe devoted its first five pages to the game with the disciplinary saga of PSG idol Zlatan Ibrahimovic relegated to Page 6. Instead, rival strikers Olivier Giroud and Dimitar Berbatov were pitched head-to-head on the front. At Stade Louis II on the eve of the game, Wenger was met by Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev and presented with a framed picture designed to commemorate his work at the club, where he won the French title in 1988. In an interview with Sportsmail, last month, ahead of the first-leg, Vasilyev hailed Wenger as 'one of the iconic coaches of modern football' but the Arsenal manager is not big on sentiment. He was wounded by the 3-1 defeat in the first leg and aware that history is against a glorious comeback, but the noises from the Arsenal camp were all about believing the impossible to be possible. With their array of attacking talent, scoring three goals seems an achievable target. Keeping Monaco at bay at the other end while doing so, may be a different proposition.

(CNN)Earlier this month, Shahindokht Molaverdi, Iran's Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, led an official delegation to the United Nations in New York to attend the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. In her March 11 speech to the commission, Molaverdi said that "the Islamic Republic of Iran has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status...on its agenda." Molaverdi described the significant progress Iranian women have made in education and science, citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women's rights. There was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including Iran's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving Iranian women of real gender equality and empowerment. Unfortunately, Molaverdi's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality. On the day she delivered her speech, Amnesty International released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before Iran's parliament that would further restrict women's rights. One would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed "traditional" families in society. The other would "further entrench gender-based discrimination, particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children," Amnesty said. A day later, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, released his fourth report to the U.N. Human Rights Council describing the dire state of human rights in the country. His report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that Human Rights Watch and others had raised during Iran's 2014 Universal Periodic Review, a review of every U.N. state's human rights record every four years by the Human Rights Council. The sobering reality, all too familiar to Molaverdi, is that Iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators. The proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women's rights in recent years. To many, the discrepancy between what Molaverdi said in her speech, and what women face in Iran, smacked of diplomatic subterfuge. Activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women's rights in Iran, and called out Molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that Iranian women face. Yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind-the-scenes struggle that Molaverdi, who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women's rights at home, and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much-needed space for Iran's beleaguered rights activists. Just two days before the U.N. session, Iran's conservative Kayhan daily, thought to be close to the Office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, published an article that showed just what Iran's women's rights activists are up against. The author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the U.N. commission, describing its notion of "gender equality" as "unacceptable to the Islamic Republic." The article accused Molaverdi of "negligence" for participating in events that could damage Iran's reputation and interests, and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of Iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by Iran's security and intelligence agencies. What's striking about Kayhan's attack is that Iran's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups, including women's rights activists. Groups like the One Million Signatures Campaign, a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women, were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious "national security" grounds. But those hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting. Anyone who fails, willingly or unknowingly, to heed their threats may face reprisals, as several activists who attempted to attend similar U.N. events in previous years found out. Yet Kayhan's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women's groups in Iran as they continue to challenge the state's monopoly on the women's rights narrative. While Iranian women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution, their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education, health care, and birth control. The image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by Iran's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many Iranian women today. So while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what Molaverdi said at the United Nations, and what Iranian women face, let us not lose sight of another reality: the paradox that exists in Iran between the state's regressive laws and policies against women, and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied. That effort, at the very least, deserves our respect.	Faraz Sanei : Women's groups in Iran have remained adaptable . Those hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting, she says .
Simon Hennessey, 50, was back behind bars tonight after 15 years on the run in Australia . A convicted killer who went on the run in Australia for 15 years evaded capture by using the identity of a brain damaged man, was tonight back behind bars in the UK. Fugitive Simon Hennessey, 50, mutilated his elderly aunt in a frenzied attack. Hennessey was just 14 when he was convicted of knifing Mary Webber, 72, to death after stabbing her more than 70 times in her Plymouth home. At the time, he became the youngest person in British legal history to be sentenced to life in a secure mental health unit. He had served 20 years of a life sentence for manslaughter, when he walked out of Leyhill Open Prison in south Gloucestershire just before Christmas in 1998. For years officers tried to trace the wanted man without success, until he was arrested in Australia as part of a probe into a credit card scam. Hennessey was detained  in Queensland in summer 2013,  but for weeks officers did not realise that he was a wanted killer in Britain. Unbeknownst to them he had stolen the identity of Robert Jeffery from New Zealand who had been left brain damaged in a car accident a decade earlier. Robert Jeffery, 44, was in a head-on collision with a vehicle in 2005 and thrown from the flat-bed truck he was driving. He has been in permanent care ever since and struggles to retain information. He has never held a passport. Hennessey was jailed for five and a half years for fraud after the scam unraveled. As soon as he was eligible for parole, the Australian authorities deported him back to the UK. He was arrested on his return and charged with evading lawful custody. Hennessey, who has changed his name from Simon to Robert, pleaded guilty to the charge and was jailed for 16 months by a judge at Bristol Crown Court. Hennessey had been using the identity of Robert Jeffrey from Hawkes Bay in New Zealand, pictured . Detective Constable Stuart Brooks, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'Robert Hennessey was arrested on suspicion of fraud offences in the Queensland area of Australia in 2013. 'Since then we've been working closely with the Australian authorities to ensure he was returned to the UK to serve the rest of his sentence and to face justice for the unlawful absconsion. 'With the assistance of Devon and Cornwall Police, the victim's family have been kept updated on Hennessey's deportation and subsequent court appearances in the UK.'

A friend of Jihadi John, unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi (pictured) has used the Human Rights Act to avoid being deported . A friend of Jihadi John accused of organising al-Qaeda terror atrocities has used the Human Rights Act to avoid being deported despite being deemed a threat to national security. The terror suspect, originally from Ethiopia, is believed to be a leading member of al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia. He was accused of playing a part in the 2005 plot to blow up the London Underground  and is  an associate of ISIS executioner Jihadi John - unmasked this week as Mohammed Emwazi. But the deportation case against the man, who can only be identified as J1, collapsed after a five-year court battle when a British diplomat admitted the system was not working. Lawyers argued the man's human rights would be breached if he was sent back to Ethiopia, where he could face detention and possible torture. The terror suspect is now living in London and has also been linked to two al-Qaeda extremists killed in US drone attacks in Somalia. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government has 'serious questions' to answer about the case and questioned why he wasn't placed under special controls. She told the Telegraph: 'This man (J1) has been linked to planned terror attacks, associated with known terrorists, and identified as a risk to the UK. So why didn't Theresa May at least put him on a TPIM in 2013 when he was released from immigration detention? 'And what is being done now? Are they reconsidering TPIMs, deportation assurances or prosecution options? Or do they no longer believe he is a significant threat?' A TPIM is a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure which allows authorities to impose a curfew and limit communications on someone they 'reasonably believe' is involved in terror activities. The terror suspect has been accused of being a leading member of an al-Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia, pictured are hundreds of al-Shabaab fighters . He was accused of playing a part in the 2005 plot to blow up the London Underground, pictured is CCTV footage of failed July 21 bomber Hussein Osman (circled in green) at Clapham Junction train station . J1 has been accused by the Government of being a senior organiser for al-Shabaab. Court papers disclose that 'on the morning of the failed London bombings of 21 July 2005, a mobile telephone which the appellant (J1) now accepts was used by him, was in contact with a telephone used by one of the bombers, Hussein Osman'. The Government argued he was a threat to national security and should be deported, court papers show. They claimed he was an associate of Londoners Mohammed Sakr and Bilal Berjawi, both of whom died in US drone strikes in Somalia. Sakr and Emwazi were friends and Sakr attended Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood along with Emwazi. It was revealed this week that Emwazi was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for  al Shabab. MI5 was also aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. It was revealed  that Jihadi John was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for al Shabab, pictured with British journalist David Haines . They had a file on Emwazi from at least 2009, when he was stopped as he arrived in Tanzania. British agents suspected that he was trying to travel to Somalia to join up with al-Shabaab, an accusation that Emwazi denied. He was never charged with a terror offence. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government has 'serious questions' to answer about the case . Michael Adebolajo, convicted of Lee Rigby's murder, is also believed to be linked to the Somali group. The case has heightened calls for the Human Rights Act to be scrapped. It collapsed when Anthony Layden, the British diplomat in charge of negotiating his deportation, admitted the system was not working. He is believed to have blamed the Home Office for the failure. This comes as the Government admitted that hundreds of ISIS extremists like Emwazi have been free to leave Britain because they were not being properly monitored by the security services. A spokesman for the Home Office said yesterday: 'Control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts. 'TPIMs have been endorsed by the courts, counter-terrorism reviewers, the police, and the Security Service. Following a review of the powers available to manage the terrorist threat, the range of measures available under the TPIM Act is being extended, including a measure to allow TPIM subjects to be relocated to different parts of the country.' Michael Adebolajo, convicted of Lee Rigby's murder, is also believed to be linked to the Somali group al Shabab .	Terror suspect accused of planning attacks has avoided deportation .

A Los Angeles-based artist claims Versace has ripped off one of her designs. Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, who has more than 80,000 Instagram followers, used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house. She uploaded a picture of one of the T-shirts she created with American Apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to Versace's offering, which she captioned: 'At least make it better than the $30 (£20) original @versace_official. This looks like a first draft.' She also uploaded a snap of Versace's £440 Medusa cotton jersey T-shirt and wrote: 'This.hurts. $650.versace rip off. sold out in 3 sizes. what is this madness? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends. what is this? 'Why can't these companies. these brands. these people create their own work? what happened? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them? (sic)'. MailOnline has contacted Kesshia Kumari for comment. In an interview with The Cut, the London-born designer said: 'I have always had a deep admiration for Versace. It’s an iconic brand that has stood the test of time. I am deeply disappointed in this. 'This is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create. It is not only artwork from a collection that I created for American Apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work. ' But this is also my face! I can’t understand how something like this could happen.' Kesshia Kumari, who is of Malaysian and Trinidadian heritage, began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on MySpace. The Versace T-shirt's description on Selfridges website reads: 'Versace’s flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t-shirt. Crafted from cotton-jersey and featuring Medusa’s head printed on the front, simply team with jeans for a luxe off-duty look.' MailOnline has contacted Versace for comment. Speaking to MailOnline, Jim Dennis, an intellectual property partner at law firm Gordon Dadds, the English member firm at Globalaw, said: 'Kesh’s design is certainly distinctive and the Versace design is strikingly similar. Provided Kesh’s design is original, then under UK law it will attract copyright as a graphic work. 'It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh’s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place. If so, Versace would infringe Kesh’s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh’s. If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t-shirts.' Carissa Kendall-Palmer, associate solicitor, EIP in London, added: 'In short, Kesh should be filing a law suit right away. The Versace T-shirt is clearly very similar to the T-shirt she developed for the American Apparel range in 2013. On the face of it, Kesh has a good case, but will need to gather evidence to support it. 'The design could be protected by both design rights and copyright, and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip-off. Many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times, it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case. She is not on her own here. Copying is very common in the industry. 'There is always the possibility that Versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining. Copyright infringement is criminal, and if Kesh registered her design, copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws. If Kesh has a registered design, she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now.'	Kesshia 'KESH' Kumari, a London-born is a Los Angeles-based artist .

The parents of a newborn baby have been left traumatised after they were handed the wrong baby due to a maternity ward mix-up and spent 45 minutes with a child who was not theirs. The parents say the trauma of the incident has affected their ability to connect with their son. Samantha and Nick Stuhlener welcomed baby Levi in January and were enjoying their precious first moments together at St Vincent's Private Hospital in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. However, the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple's baby, after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the 'settling room'. Scroll down for video . Levi was born on January 6 this year to proud parents Samantha and Nick Stuhlener at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Fitzroy . His mother, Samantha Stuhlener, has had trouble bonding with her cherished baby after a mix up at the hospital which saw her mistakenly spend 45 minutes with someone else's child . The two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at St Vincent's Private Hospital . 'I said what's happened, what's going on?' Ms Stuhlener told 7News. 'And she said, you didn't have Levi, you had somebody else's baby.' The error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought Mr and Mrs Stuhlener someone else's child. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff. 'It is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident. We unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident,' he told 7News. He emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched, fed and changed by their parents. 'While both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times, the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands,' Mr Grisold said. Both children were wearing the correct ID wrist bands in the overnight settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the Stuhleners someone else's child . 'The second baby remained in the night nursery. 'When it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room, the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents. 'At no time was either baby picked up, held or fed by anyone other than their parents.' The hospital has told the distraught parents that Levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant. However, the Stuhleners are demanding the truth. 'I don't believe that,' Ms Stuhlener told 7News, unable to hold back tears. 'I don't know, was he (Levi) with another mother?' They have become suspicious as St Vincent's Hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report, which details where their baby was throughout the incident. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff . 'That's all we've wanted, to actually see what's written in the incident report and what actually happened,' said Mr Stuhlener. To make matters worse, the hospital's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix-up. Mr and Mrs Stuhlener received a letter of apology and $500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error. However, the hospital sent them the wrong letter. They received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap – the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes. 'I acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family,' Mr Griswold confirmed. The Stuhleners say they've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'. The couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family. Ms Stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with Levi than she did with her firstborn. Their son, now almost three months old, was 'unsettled' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding. St Vincent's Private Hospital have changed their procedures to try ensure the error is not repeated. Two staff members are now required to cross check both the mother and baby's name tags when moving babies to and from the settling room. The Stuhleners claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'	The Stuhleners were handed the wrong baby in a maternity ward mix-up .

Manuel Neuer accepted responsibility as Bayern Munich suffered a surprise defeat to Borussia Monchengladbach but said the whole team were not good enough to win. Bayern were beaten 2-0 at home by Monchengladbach after Raffael scored either side of half time. He said: ‘We didn’t create any genuine chances. That wasn’t good enough,' Neuer said. ‘Gladbach were very good and defended excellently. Manuel Neuer says Bayern Munich were not good enough to beat Borussia Moenchengladbach . Neuer admitted his own mistakes during Bayern's defeat by Gladbach .

We know what we’re aiming for this season. We’ll look to the future and we’re optimistic.’ Bayern still lead the Bundesliga by 10 points from Wolfsburg, while Borussia Monchengladbach are third. And Neuer was at fault for the opening goal and the German No 1 admitted he should have done better on Raffael's strike. ‘It was the first shot on target from Gladbach.

(CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. "I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big," Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. "Thanks for all the support and prayers," a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. "I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger." CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients. "The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair," the medical center said in a statement. The chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up Friday. In late March, the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients. Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center. Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours. But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it. Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died. Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him. Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient. But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother. So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation. It's a bit of a surgical square dance, where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling. But instead of a square dance, Broussard's generous move set off a chain reaction, like dominoes falling. Her kidney, which was removed Thursday, went to a recipient, who was paired with a donor. That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on. On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain. Such long-chain transplanting is rare. It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time. That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant. He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger. Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly. "When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months. We did this in about three weeks," Jacobs said. But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all. "The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients," said Dr. Steven Katznelson. "Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients." And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page. "You are a true angel my friend."	Zully Broussard decided to give a kidney to a stranger .

A 40-year murder mystery has taken another dramatic twist with sensational new claims the victim's husband confessed to the triple killing on his deathbed. Queensland Police are investigating whether Bill McCulkin admitted shortly before he died in 2011 to killing his wife, Barbara, 34, and their two daughters, Vicki, 13, and Leanne, 11. Mrs McCulkin and her daughters disappeared from their Brisbane home in January 1974, and have not been seen since. Scroll down for video . Barbara McCulkin (right), 34, and their two daughters, Vicki, 13, and Leanne, 11, disappeared in January 1974 . The case has become one of Australia's most enduring cold-case mysteries. But a major break may have come in the case recenty, when a witness to McCulkin's alleged confession gave a statement to police. Police are trying to reconcile inconsistencies between the supposed confession and the other clues in the investigation and the conclusions detectives have reached previously. McCulkin, a petty gangster, reportedly took up with another woman just two months before his former partner and her girls disappeared. He was initially a suspect, but was later cleared of being involved in the crime. Vicki McCulkin, 13, Barbara McCulkin, 34, and her sister Barbara, 11, in 1974 .

Islamabad (CNN)Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old. Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. "We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours," said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. "We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need." Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. "He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife." "I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing." Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. "It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves," Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. "Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society." Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to "reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial." The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant "that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age."​ .

Concerns: There is growing evidence of weak benefits along with serious problems with rosuvastatin although it is the best statin for lowering cholesterol, says Dr Sidney Wolfe . A powerful statin carries a high rate of harmful side-effects including an increased risk of diabetes, a leading campaigner warns today. There is growing evidence of weak benefits along with serious problems with rosuvastatin although it is the best statin for lowering cholesterol, says Dr Sidney Wolfe. He is the founder and senior adviser to the US civil rights body Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, which attempted to get the drug banned ten years ago because of muscle and kidney problems. Since then, evidence had continued to mount about the drug’s poor benefits, he claims. British experts have said statins are safe and effective, with protection against heart attacks outweighing possible side-effects. One has reassured patients on rosuvastatin, saying they should continue taking it. Statins are the most commonly prescribed group of drugs in the NHS and given to between eight and ten million adults. They include those with cardiac disease or at risk of a heart attack or stroke. Initial approval of rosuvastatin to prevent heart attacks in a very select group of people was based on a study which was stopped early, says Dr Wolfe. This led to concern that the effects may have been over-estimated, he adds in an editorial in The BMJ medical journal. A review of trials showed that the drug, also known as Crestor, was linked to a 25 per cent extra risk of diabetes compared with a placebo, he says. Crestor was the most prescribed brand name drug in the US last year and accounts for around four per cent of NHS prescriptions for statins. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Patients taking rosuvastatin should not stop taking it. They are on it for a very good reason. Statins are the most commonly prescribed group of drugs in the NHS and given to between eight and ten million adults . ‘This opinion piece raises more questions about pharmaceutical marketing and prescribing practices in the US than the safety and use of statins in general. ‘Rosuvastatin is more expensive than other statins and is one of the least commonly prescribed in the UK. 'It is generally prescribed for a small number of people at high risk of a heart attack or stroke and who cannot tolerate the older statins or have not had the desired reduction in cholesterol levels on them.’ Dr Wolfe adds that worldwide 2013 sales of the medicine were £5.5billion, the third highest for any branded drug. He accuses advertising campaigns of exploiting its potency despite ‘long-standing, continuing evidence of rosuvastatin’s comparative lack of clinical benefits and increasing evidence of risk’. The drug’s patent expires in 2016 and he expresses hope this would lead to a sharp decline in its use. The NHS estimates statins save 7,000 lives a year. A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said: ‘They are safe and effective, and play an important role. People should continue to take their medicines as prescribed.’ A senior doctor took a statin for two years despite being at low risk and developed crippling muscle pain. But Dr Kailash Chand, a GP and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, did not make any link at first. Hospital tests, X-rays and an MRI scan all came back clear. Senior doctor: Dr Kailash Chand, a GP and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, took a statin for two years despite being at low risk and developed crippling muscle pain . He said: ‘I thought it was worth seeing what would happen if I stopped taking the drug. Within two to three weeks, my back and legs began to feel a lot better and my sleep improved. ‘Statins have an important role for patients who already have heart disease. But we must take much more care about prescribing them to low-risk patients. I was healthy and I became unhealthy.’ London cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra said the side-effects of statins have been downplayed. ‘To think that taking a drug that drastically reduces one’s cholesterol will have no other potential adverse effect is not just lazy medicine, it’s bad science,’ he added.

A transgender woman whose wife stayed with her through sex change surgery, helped her shop for a new wardrobe and join a dating site is now repaying her  by becoming her carer. Emily Dodge, 62, who was born a man revealed she needed to live as a woman to wife Jean Smith, 68, after the couple, from Cornwall, had been happily married for 20 years. Today Emily describes her relationship with Jean as like 'close sisters' and has pledged to stand by her loyal spouse now that she has   dementia. Emily Dodge (left) was born with a male body and revealed to wife of 20 years, Jean Smith (right) that she wanted to transition to a woman. Emily now cares for Jean, who suffers from early onset dementia . The Cornwall-based couple were married for 20 years before Emily (right) transitioned. Things took a turn for the worse when Jean began to suffer memory loss in 2013. She was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2014 . Emily - who has not revealed her birth name - will stand by Jean, who was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2014. The former IT worker said: 'I always promised Jean we would be best friends and that will never change. I will never leave her.' Jean, a former financial advisor, discovered her then 55-year-old husband needed to live as a woman and stayed by her side, helping Emily through gender reassignment surgery in February 2011. The couple, from Helston, in Cornwall, were so close after the operation Jean helped the woman who had been her husband with some wardrobe advice. Emily said: 'Jean was amazing. Once I was well enough after the operation, we went shopping together and she'd pick out outfits for me. 'She even helped me enrol for online dating. Our relationship is now like close sisters. She's my best friend.' Emily spoke candidly about life before the operation. 'I had felt like a woman trapped in the body of a man and the only time I felt happy was when I was wearing women's clothes and make-up' - Emily Dodge (pictured) was tired of living a double life . 'To the outside world, including Jean, I was a guy who liked DIY, football and a pint with my mates of an evening, but actually, that wasn't me at all.' - Emily shocked wife Jean with the revelation that he wanted to live life as a woman . She said: 'To the outside world, including Jean, I was a guy who liked DIY, football and a pint with my mates of an evening, but actually, that wasn't me at all. 'I had felt like a woman trapped in the body of a man and the only time I felt happy was when I was wearing women's clothes and make-up. 'I kept it all hidden in the loft and would only get it out if I was sure Jean was going to be out for a while.' But living a double life was not easy and after 20 years of marriage, Emily decided to come clean. Jean said: 'It was a huge shock when my husband told me how he wanted to live as a woman. He came into the living room wearing a skirt. I nearly had a heart attack.' Initially, she thought it was a joke. But after a lot of discussion, Mrs Smith gave her blessing, as long as her husband didn't dress in women's clothes in front of her. Before and after: Emily underwent gender reassignment surgery and wife Jean helped her shop for new clothes and enroll on online dating sites . Emily said: 'At first, that was okay. I'd lock myself in the spare room, put on one of my favourite dresses and read a book for an hour. It felt so good to finally be myself, but when I wiped off the make-up and put on a short again, it didn't feel right. 'Eventually I knew that would never be enough for me and I plucked up the courage to tell Jean I wanted to live as a woman full time. 'Jean said she didn't want to lose me and she wanted me to be happy,' she said. 'It meant the world to me.' With her approval, Ms Dodge changed her name to Emily and started taking female hormones. She had gender reassignment surgery and breast augmentation on the NHS in February 2011. 'I spent eight days in the hospital afterwards but it was worth it,' she said. 'When I looked in the mirror I was in the body I was always meant to be in. It felt right. Still best friends: Emily Dodge (left) is repaying Jean's loyalty by becoming her sole carer, and has put finding a man to share a life with, on the back burner . 'Jean fully accepted the new me too. We'd go clothes shopping together, get our hair and nails done and gossip over coffee. But soon I realised something was missing. I wanted to experience every aspect of being a woman.' She wanted male company – and Emily encouraged her to explore this. Jean said: 'I knew I'd already lost my husband, so letting Emily see other people was almost inevitable. Emily says she'll never leave me and I believe her.' She vetted Emily's potential dates and helped her choose what to wear. Emily met up with several men and also had a brief relationship with Mrs Smith's knowledge. She said: 'Jean knew all about them and spoke to the guy on the phone. It was only brief but none of it was behind her back.' Sadly, in 2013 Emily started to notice Jean was suffering some memory loss. She said: 'Jean would ask visitors if they wanted a cup of tea then go into the kitchen and come out and ask again. 'She couldn't keep up with television programmes and struggled to use the remote control.' Emily alerted the doctor and two health care workers came to the house to conduct a memory test. Emily now also runs a support group for people considering genital reconstructive surgery . After her results came back below average, Mrs Smith had a brain scan and was subsequently diagnosed with early onset vascular dementia. This means there is a reduced blood supply to the brain due to diseased blood vessels, causing brain cells to die and reduce cognitive function. Emily has since been her sole carer and consigned finding a man to share her life with, on the back burner. She said: 'I'm always worrying I'm not doing the right thing for her, so for now dating is on hold. 'Meeting someone does cross my mind from time to time. If it happened, it would be nice, but I'm not going looking for it.' Emily also runs a support group and advises other people who are planning on having genital reconstruction surgery. Now the couple, who have been together 39 years, are taking things a day at a time. Emily said: 'It's very hard as I don't know how Jean will be from one day to the next. But I do know one thing - Jean will always come first.'	Emily Dodge, 62, was born a man but had surgery to become a woman . Wife Jean Smith, 68, stood by her husband during transition .

A teenager used a fake Facebook profile to lure the love rival who fell pregnant by her boyfriend to an empty property where she attacked her so viciously that she broke her eye socket. Abigail Moody flew into a jealous rage and brutally attacked Melissa Benhamou after finding out she had slept with her partner Sam Bridge, Worcester Crown Court heard. Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year.

Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge (pictured with Moody) on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year . But when Miss Benhamou arrived, the 19-year-old grabbed her hair, and kicked and punched her to the ground. She smacked her the young woman's head against a radiator, fracturing her eye socket - before Moody chastised her victim for getting blood on her trainers. Worcester Crown Court heard she also insulted her Pakistani heritage before leaving her in a pool of blood. Abigail Moody has been given 18 months in a young offender's institute after the attack . Moody, from Bromsgrove, was yesterday sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institution after admitting racially aggravated grievous bodily harm. Sentencing, Judge Robert Juckes QC, said: 'This matter was a well planned, carefully thought out assault on a girl. 'It was a vicious attack, accompanied by racial abuse.' Prosecutor Peter Grice said the two women had been friends until April 2012, when Moody assaulted Miss Benhamou because she had slept with her boyfriend. In April last year, she slept with Moody's boyfriend once again and became pregnant before miscarrying the baby weeks later. Mr Grice told the court that Miss Benhamou was contacted on Facebook by a profile in the name of the unfaithful boyfriend - but it was Moody posing as him. She tricked her former friend into going to an address and Moody even arranged for a taxi to bring her there. On arrival, Miss Benhamou was sent a message telling her the door was open and to walk straight in. But, in the corridor outside the flat, Moody 'lay in ambush' and grabbed her by the hair before dragging her inside. She racially abused her and stamped on Miss Benhamou's phone after she knocked it to the ground. The court was told Miss Benhamou slept with Moody's boyfriend twice, falling pregnant the second time, before miscarrying the baby a few weeks later . Miss Benhamou was lured to a flat in Bromsgrove after Moody pretended to be her boyfriend on Facebook. Once there she was attacked, leaving her with injuries to her eye (right) Mr Grice said: 'The defendant repeatedly punched her victim, causing the victim to hit her head against a radiator.' Moody then accused Miss Benhamou of getting blood on her trainers and said: 'You slept with my man - you got pregnant with his kid.' Eventually the victim, who suffered a fractured eye socket, a possible blood clot in her eye, bruising and a chipped tooth, went to a nearby food outlet to get help. John Lynch, defending, said it was a 'nasty assault' and Moody had given a full and frank account of it to police. After the case, Miss Benhamou, 23, said she was left with life-changing injuries at the hands of her former best friend.

'I thought it was Sam, but when she spoke I knew immediately it was Abi. 'She was calling me a p**i and just kept hitting me and hitting me. 'You see things like this on soaps, but you never think it will happen to you. 'After the attack I went into shock. 'I had a metal plate put in my face because the bone under my eye was completely destroyed. Moody (left) wasfriends with Miss Benhamou (right) until April 2012, when the attack happened, the jury heard . 'My face is still numb to this day because she damaged the nerve. It still hurts even now. 'I can't believe my friend could do that to me. I was devastated. We used to live together and were really close. 'She was messaging me on Facebook pretending to be Sam. 'She was saying come on over I'm not with Abi anymore and I really want to see you. 'I caved too easily and went along to see him. They weren't flirty messages or anything like that but I went along in the end. I wish to this day I hadn't. 'I have nothing to do with Sam anymore. He thought he was a bit of a player. We both knew him and I regret what happened but I just want to move on with my life now. 'I'm glad she has been jailed because I have been left with life-changing injuries.

The fight to get to this point only makes the prize on offer more precious. For David Marshall, retaining his place against Gibraltar would matter every bit as much as facing Germany. The Cardiff City goalkeeper has been Gordon Strachan’s pick for each of the four Euro 2016 qualifiers to date. He has not let his manager down, yet is keenly aware that competition for the jersey continues to intensify. Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor each played 45 minutes of Wednesday night’s 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland. If one were reading the runes, it might suggest that Marshall will get the run-out when Gibraltar visit Hampden tomorrow. Scotland's David Marshall admits retaining place against Gibraltar is as important as facing Germany . The 30-year-old will assume nothing, however, until he has heard Strachan read out the 11 names in the morning. If that leads to a 17th cap, there will be no hint of complacency. Marshall went through years of travelling away with the national squad without much hope of playing. On the rare occasions he was selected, he had an unfortunate tendency to end up on the wrong end of a hefty scoreline through no error of his own. It almost seemed the fates were conspiring against him, but Marshall transformed the situation through his outstanding form for Cardiff in the Premier League last season. Having finally leap to the front of the queue, he is determined to stay there. ‘Everyone knows my history with Scotland,’ Marshall reflected. ‘I had to wait years and years to get caps, so it makes each one more valuable now as I get older. ‘I don’t want to give it up, so I’ll just continue to do what I can. It doesn’t matter to me if it is Germany or Gibraltar. There is a lot of pressure on us to win the game and it puts us in a great position if we manage to do it. Gordon Strachan has picked David Marshall for all four Euro 2016 qualifiers to date . ‘Years ago, I never thought I should be playing. Craig was brilliant. Then Allan came in at a stage when I wasn’t playing. So there was never a time when I expected to play. ‘It’s just in the last couple of years when I have got myself to a level where I can believe in myself to go and play. Injuries put Allan and Craig out and I managed to get a chance and play well, so that’s why I was probably in the team. ‘With the standard of the keepers here, it’s difficult to consider yourself the No 1. I’ve waited a long time to get a chance, but the boys are all fit. Craig has done great to get playing at Celtic and Allan is playing in the Premier League. ‘I don’t think it would be a massive decision whoever played, but the gaffer has stuck with me since the beginning of the campaign and I hope to keep playing well and stay in the side.’ Clearly, there is a professional rivalry within the goalkeeping trio, described by no less a judge than Andy Goram as Scotland’s best-ever crop. But it is distinctly cordial in nature. Marshall has not yet let his manager down, but is aware that competition is rising in the ranks . ‘We’ve been together for a long time now,’ said Marshall. ‘I’ve been here for over 10 years and Craig has been the same, obviously minus a couple of years through injury. ‘We know each other so well and we are used to the standard. When we are together, it hopefully lifts us to make each other better. ‘When I was younger, Andy Goram and Jim Leighton were great. That was a great group of goalkeepers, so to hear what Andy – a legend for Rangers and Scotland – said is a great honour. ‘But we can’t read too much into that. We just have to keep performing as that is what you are judged on. We need to concentrate and do our best for the rest for the rest of the campaign. ‘I would definitely consider the other guys friends. I shared a room with Craig for five or six years at the start with Scotland. ‘It might be a bit different at club level when there is that one place. But being here is about the country. We have not been at a championship for so long, so there is no room for sticking the knife in each other’s back. We are all together.’ Allan McGregor kept a clean sheet during 45 minutes of action in a friendly against Northern Ireland . Whoever is selected tomorrow, they will face a most curious assignment. Gibraltar have lost their four Group D fixtures by an aggregate score of 21-0. Unless something very odd happens, the Scotland penalty area should verge on a no-go zone. ‘It’s a difficult game to talk about,’ admitted Marshall. ‘Concentration levels have got to be high and football is weird. There could be a deflection, a set-piece, anything. ‘We need to start the game well as the earlier we can score the better. Craig Gordon kept a clean sheet in 45 minutes of action in a friendly against Northern Ireland . ‘This is probably the only time with Scotland that you are expected not to have too much to do. ‘But concentration is a massive thing in goalkeeping. I had it with Celtic when I was younger, when you would play a lot of games where there was not a lot to do. You just have to deal with it and train as normal. ‘Would I prefer to be busy? No, I prefer doing nothing! But you just don’t know how it is going to play out. You can’t go into a game relaxed. You treat it like any normal game and hope the boys up front can help you out.’	Gordon Strachan has picked David Marshall for all four Euro 2016 qualifiers . He has not let his manager down, but is aware that competition is rising . Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor each played 45 minutes on Wednesday . Both kept clean sheets as Scotland beat Northern Ireland 1-0 on the night .
England captain Chris Robshaw led his side on the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday as the Red Rose put the finishing touches to their preparations for the Six Nations finale against France. Stuart Lancaster's men face Les Bleus at HQ on Saturday with a chance of clinching the title for the first time since 2011. Any one of four teams can win the Six Nations this year - although with three wins each, Wales, Ireland and England are in with a better chance than outsiders France who have two. England's Jack Howell prepares with catching practice for Le Crunch against France - on the deciding day of Six Nations action . England are locked on the same points as Ireland and Wales, but have a better points advantage heading into the final round of action . England head coach Stuart Lancaster insists only the final stage of the Ryder Cup can compare with Saturday's climactic round of the RBS 6 Nations. Lancaster believes the golfing showpiece contested by Europe and the United States every two years is the only sporting occasion that can match the drama created by the Six Nations' refusal to synchronise the last instalment of games. 'I can't think of another situation in sport where you'd go into it with this points differential that can affect the psychology, so it is different from a World Cup,' Lancaster said. 'The only scenario I can think of that is similar is the final day of the Ryder Cup when you're ahead or behind when the singles are coming. 'It's that sort of feeling. It will tell us a lot about the players, but it is a pretty unique situation as well.' England enter the final day with a points advantage of plus four and it is in the context of how Wales and then Ireland, who travel to Rome and Edinburgh respectively, perform that Lancaster must prepare his team. England players huddle up together as head coach Lancaster watches on during the open training session in south west London . England coach Lancaster says England must not try and win the game too early and deal with circumstances as they arise during the match . 'I have thought long and hard about the psychology of how you deal with your own players,' Lancaster said. 'There are only so many players who need to be involved in the key decisions. The rest of the players have been given a simple message - you go all-out for the win and you don't stop until 80 minutes is up. 'The key to begin with is not to chase the game too early. We have to go out there to perform and win the game, then we'll deal with whatever circumstances come along as we go.'

Lancaster has made one change to his starting XV after promoting Geoff Parling from the bench at the expense of Dave Attwood. Parling has called for England to stand up and be counted as they seek to claim a first title since 2011. 'These sort of games are when you probably see a team's character,' Parling said. 'We know there is a lot of pressure on it and we shouldn't hide away from that. We said at the start of the tournament: we have got to win it. We've come second for three years running. 'We messed up a bit in two games again, but we've got a chance here to put things right and win it. 'These are the games you want to play in, the games you want to show your character as a player, as a pack, as a team.'

Islamic fanatics are stealing the life savings of UK pensioners to bankroll jihad in Syria. Masquerading as policemen, the extremists cold-call their targets and claim their bank details have been compromised. The frightened and unsuspecting victims are told to switch all their cash to another account to keep it safe. But the account belongs to the fraudsters and the money vanishes. It will be used to buy weapons, ammunition and combat gear for Islamic State militants. Police last night warned the public to avoid becoming a victim of the ‘cash for jihad’ telephone scam that mirrors swindles used by domestic con men. Anti-terror police are today searching seven addresses around London in relation to an alleged scam in which the elderly were targeted and thousands of pounds of their money being sent to extremists. File photo . The extremists have cheated one pensioner of £150,000. Two other victims, both aged in their 80s and from Cornwall, have lost £130,000 between them. Their only hope of getting their savings back is if the police can catch the culprits and find the cash. And yesterday Scotland Yard said that counter-terrorism officers had just arrested two men – aged 29 and 37 – in west London and a man of 23 in east London. They were being questioned last night on suspicion of fraud and money laundering. ‘Officers are investigating a large-scale fraud linked to UK extremists travelling to Syria,’ a Scotland Yard spokesman said. ‘The arrests form part of an ongoing fraud investigation, whereby unsuspecting vulnerable and elderly victims are cold-called on their home phone by a suspect impersonating a police officer, informing them their bank account has been compromised and deceiving victims into transferring money to an account under the control of the suspect. ‘Members of the public are strongly advised, if you receive a call like this to from someone claiming to be a police officer, hang up the phone, wait at least five minutes to make sure the phone line has cleared, or use another phone line, before ringing the phone number on your bank card.’ The Government is being urged to do more to stop the flow of money to Islamic State. Police suspect fraudsters linked to jihadists in Syria are targeting the elderly and vulnerable. File photo . It is considered to be the richest terror group in history and may have access to more than £1.2billion in cash. Its funds come from the revenue of captured oil fields, business extortion and hostage ransoms. There are also concerns that donations to British aid organisations are being diverted to terrorists. The Charity Commission is scrutinising 86 foundations it believes could be at risk from extremism. Thirty-seven are working to help victims of the Syria crisis. The commission has launched full-scale investigations into four charities operating in the Middle East, including the group that hostage Alan Henning was working for when he was kidnapped and later killed. Another organisation under suspicion is said to have been infiltrated by a suicide bomber. High street banks are closing or freezing accounts held by UK charities working in conflict zones, a think tank claimed yesterday. Salaries paid to the bank accounts of aid workers who live outside the UK have also been delayed or blocked, the Overseas Development Institute said. Scotland Yard announced today that it has arrested three men over an alleged cold calling scam funding terror . Tom Keatinge, a researcher for the ODI, said: ‘Tens of thousands of people in conflict areas such as Syria, Somalia and Gaza are depending on the life-saving assistance provided by UK charities, but these are precisely the locations that present the highest risks to banks under counter-terrorism legislation.’ The ODI wants the Treasury to give improved guidance on how banks, credit card firms, online donation websites and internet payment companies can comply with the law without adversely affecting legitimate aid activities. It also recommends that charities ensure their funds are adequately safeguarded from financing terrorism. One charity, which asked to remain anonymous, has been forced to give up donations worth £2million over the last 12 months as a result of funds being blocked by a bank. Fanatics have previously posed as charity collectors in town centres across the country to raise jihadi money. The arrests come after Terri Nicholson, of the Met's counter-terrorism command, warned benefit fraud, charity scams and student loan cash was being used to fund Islamic State fanatics in Syria. Speaking in November, she said: 'We are seeing diverse fraud including substantial fraud online, abuse of the benefits system, abuse of student loans, in order to fund terrorism. 'We have had a number of cases in recent times where student loans have been abused to fund both crime and terrorism. 'We have seen some cases where virtual currency is being considered and used by both criminals and terrorists. And so we are increasing our understanding of the abuse of those methods.' Speaking at the time, she urged the public to be careful when donating to charities to ensure their money is not diverted by 'undesirable individuals'. In the past two years months, police in London have seized £2.5million of donations destined for criminal and terrorist gangs. Ms Nicholson said police are adopting a 'cradle to the grave approach' to finding and stopping the financing of terrorism. She said: 'Together with the security service, we work extremely closely to understand those individuals who are at the heart of the terrorist financing effort and the enablers to that activity, because to cut off that supply route is the critical aim.'

Bafetimbi Gomis may not score often in the Premier League, but his goals tend to leave a lasting impression. They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger.

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with £28million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan. Sherwood, who saw his side lose to Stoke in injury time of his Villa debut, was in terse mood afterwards. Defeat hurts him deeply.

'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.' It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second. In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar. By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well. In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away. Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted.

Two Utah police officers have been suspended without pay over a risque video shoot featuring bikini-clad women firing high-powered weapons. The Utah Department of Public Safety imposed the discipline in December on Rob Wilkinson, a Utah Highway Patrol sergeant, and Justin Hansen, a State Bureau of Investigation agent. The department released its discipline records last week after receiving a request to obtain them by The Salt Lake Tribune. Wilkinson, who received a three-day suspension, and Hansen, who received a one-day suspension, were at the Big Shot Ranch near Grantsville in June when British bikini models posed for photos and were videotaped firing guns for a calendar called 'Hot Shots.' The two men were seen wearing camouflage uniforms identifying them as police in a promotional video filmed at Camp Williams in May and posted on YouTube in October. Scroll down for video . Risque: The models were at Camp Williams for a Hot Shots pinup calendar and behind-the-scenes video shoot. Two Utah peace officers were disciplined as a result . Exposed: Men were spotted in the promotional video wearing camouflage gear with 'police' on the back . Neither Wilkinson nor Hansen sought their superiors' permission to participate, and superiors learned of the activity only when they saw video clips played by the news media in Utah, according to the records. The men were disciplined for conduct that brings discredit to an officer or agency, and for wearing their uniform during a promotion for a product — both rules violations, the records show. Wilkinson and Hansen declined comment. An acquaintance asked the two to help supervise the firing line where the models shot at targets, according to an internal affairs report. The report also notes Hot Shots purports to donate a portion of its proceeds to charities for wounded soldiers. In November, four Utah National Guard soldiers were disciplined for their unauthorized involvement and use of military vehicles in a video featuring the bikini-clad women firing high-powered weapons and riding in tanks. A non-commissioned officer who inappropriately allowed the video to be partially shot at Camp Williams in May was relieved of his duties, and three other soldiers received lesser measures ranging from counseling to a reprimand. The men's superiors did not learn about their involvement with the video until they saw the coverage in Utah news reports, the investigation revealed .

US Paralympic hopeful Ranjit Steiner says he could have never imagined that someone would stoop so low as to steal his prosthetic leg. Steiner, from San Francisco, woke up Tuesday morning - his birthday - to discover that thieves had smashed the rear right window on his brand-new car and taken his laptop along with his $25,000 blade-style running leg. Steiner, a track-and-field champion who aspires to go to the 2016 Paralympics in Brazil, uses it for competitive running at City College of San Francisco. Heartless: Ranjit Steiner (left), a track-and-field champion and aspiring Paralympian, says someone broke into his brand-new car (right) in San Francisco and got away with his custom-fitted running blade . Survivor: Steiner had his right leg amputated four years ago after contracting bone cancer . In a message posted on his Facebook page, Steiner wrote that the break-in took place sometime between 8pm Monday and 9am Tuesday along Cesar Chavez Street between Mission and Valencia streets. As of noon Wednesday, Steiner’s artificial leg - a black model with a yellow stripe on either side - has not been found. The thieves also took the athlete’s backup running blade. Champ: Steiner won the bronze medal in the nationals last year . ‘It's just so low,’ Steiner told NBC Bay Area. ‘You never think anybody would take something like that.’ Steiner, a graduate of University of Oregon with a degree in journalism, lost his right leg above the knee to bone cancer four years ago. But the amputation did not stop him from competing or pursuing his Olympic dreams. On Tuesday Morning, Steiner got behind the wheel of his brand-new Subaru Imperza and hit the road, only to feel the breeze on his back coming from the shattered back window, according to Palo Alto Online. Steiner was hoping that the perpetrators had not found his prosthetic under the seat, but the expensive running blade was nowhere to be found. Steiner says the artificial leg will not do the thieves any good because it was custom-fitted for his height and leg length, and can only be used for running. The cancer survivor says he seldom leaves anything of value in the car, but on Monday night he went out with his family to celebrate his birthday and forgot the blade and his other possessions in the backseat. Steiner, who won the bronze medal in the national championship last year, says he cannot do any high-level training without his blade. Futile crime: Steiner says his artificial leg will not do the thieves any good because it was custom-fitted for his height and leg length . Luckily for Steiner, he works for a company that manufactures prosthetic sockets and his employer is sponsoring him, but fitting him with a replacement could take up to a month. The athlete is asking for the public's help in locating and returning the artificial leg to him so he could continue with his 100- and 200-meter sprint workouts. ‘I've got four months until National Championships and this... you know, every day counts at this point,’ Steiner told ABC 7 News. An online fundraiser has now been launched on Life Indiegogo hoping to raise $30,000 to help Steiner get a new artificial leg.

Modern British men are more hands-on than ever before when it comes to household chores, according to a new survey. Researchers found that millions of men are more than happy to tackle a range of tasks their fathers would rarely encounter, with one in ten doing the bulk of the cleaning, polishing and dusting in the home. In fact, one in five men are in charge of cooking dinner every night, while one in ten regularly do the family washing. A new survey has found that British men are more involved in household chores than ever - with 60per cent happy to prepare dinner every night and do the washing up afterwards as well . The study of 2,000 modern couples found the gender roles in the home are now being rewritten, with more than three quarters of women saying they are happy to tackle jobs that might previously have been tasked to the man of the house such emptying gutters and mowing the lawn. The research, conducted by Karcher, also found two thirds of women will actively attempt jobs around the home their mum might have avoided or just left to the man of the house. Suzi Perry, star of F1 and former presenter of The Gadget Show, commented on the findings: 'The times really are changing and so it probably wouldn't come as a surprise that more men are helping out around the home compared to several decades ago. 'Nowadays, relationships are more like teamwork and we help our partners with the upkeep of the house and garden. 'Brits are working longer hours now as well so if domestic chores were only to fall on the lap of one person, they may find family life harder and their day more stressful. 'We all know that a problem shared is a problem halved, and this should also reflect the thoughts of many towards household chores. one in five men think they do a better job at the cleaning than their wife or girlfriend, while one in three think they are far superior at the hoovering and cooking . 'So it's encouraging to see so many Brits taking on tasks they wouldn't once have been expected to do.' The study revealed more than half of men feel they do much more domestic work around the house than their fathers ever did in terms of chores. TV presenter Suzi Perry, star of F1, knows what it's like to be a woman in a man's world . Meanwhile, 41 per cent of women confessed to doing less around the house than their mum did, which is believed to be because gender roles in the home were much stricter. It was also revealed that more men are happy to do the hoovering round the house as well as the washing up and the gardening. And six in ten men said they would be willing to sort the dinner every night and the washing up afterwards as well. Other jobs that men are happy to do around the home were found to be ironing, tending to the kids and cleaning. But they'll also gladly wash the patio or use the pressure washer when it's needed - although this is a job they'll share with their wife or partner. Not only are men happy to take on the tasks their fathers once would have declined to do, they also believe they are better than their partner at completing them. In fact, one in five men think they do a better job at the cleaning than their wife or girlfriend while one in three think they are far superior at the hoovering and cooking. Furthermore, one quarter of men think they are better at doing the washing up than their partner, and one in six even think they can do the ironing more efficiently. So it may not come as a surprise that 84 per cent of UK adults in a relationship believe the modern generation of men should be happier to do any of the kind of cleaning, washing or other domestic chores around the home. Suzi Perry added: 'The modern generation of Brits are keeping up with modern views of daily living.' Phil Springall, Karcher UK Home and Garden Marketing Manager said: 'It's interesting to see just how gender roles have evolved in the home and how we're all a bit more open to sharing the load. 'The results show that both men and women alike are up for swapping jobs in a way that maybe the generations before weren't.'	New survey by Karcher found that British men do more  chores than ever . One in ten men do most of the cleaning, polishing and dusting in the home . More than half are happy to cook dinner and wash up every night .
An unarmed black teenager has been shot dead by a police officer at a Wisconsin home - just days after the release of a damning report into racial prejudice by cops in Ferguson, Missouri. Tony Robinson, 19, who was suspected of a recent battery, was reportedly gunned down by officer Matt Kenny, 45, who had followed him into an apartment in Madison at 6.30pm local time Friday. A struggle had ensued in the seconds before the shooting, it is reported. The officer then performed CPR on Tony and the teen was rushed to hospital. However, he later succumbed to his injuries. The killing, which sparked a mass protest outside the home, came only two days after a Justice Department report revealed that seven racist emails had been sent by officials in Ferguson. It also came just hours before President Barack Obama will lead this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat protesters marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: Tony Robinson (pictured with his mother, Andrea Irwin), who was a graduate of Sun Prairie High School, was shot dead by a police officer at a Madison, Wisconsin, home at around 6.30pm local time Friday . Killed: A struggle had ensued in the seconds before the shooting, it is reported. The officer then performed CPR on Tony and the teen (pictured) was rushed to hospital. However, he later succumbed to his injuries . Protest: The killing, which sparked a mass protest outside the home (pictured), comes only two days after a Justice Department report revealed that seven racist emails had been sent by officials in Ferguson, Missouri . Angry: Videos have appeared online showing around 100 protesters at the scene of the shooting, chanting slogans like, 'Who can you trust? Not the police'. Above, Tony's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, at the protests . Demonstrating: Many of the demonstrators moved the protest to inside the Madison City County building Friday night, according to footage posted on Twitter. It was not immediately clear if there were any arrests . Over the past 20 hours, videos have appeared online showing around 100 protesters at the scene of the shooting, chanting slogans like, 'Who can you trust? Not the police,' in front of a row of officers. Many of the demonstrators moved the protest to inside the Madison City County building Friday night, according to footage on Twitter. It was not immediately clear if there were any arrests. Tony, who is yet to be formally identified but has been named by family and friends, was a graduate of Sun Prairie High School. Officials have confirmed he was unarmed when he was shot dead. Late Friday, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval told broadcaster WKOW Mr Kenny had responded to a disturbance at an apartment in Williamson Street the African-American teenager had gone into. He said Tony had previously been seen dodging in and out of traffic and was suspected of a recent battery. The officer had forced his way into the home, where he was attacked by the teen, he said. '[The] subject assaulted my officer and in the context of mutual combat, the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject,' Chief Koval told the broadcaster. Friends: Tony, who is yet to be formally identified but has been named by family and friends, is pictured in a Facebook photo alongside a friend. He was described as being a 'happy person' by former classmates . Relatives: During Friday night's protests, Tony's grandmother, Sharon Irwin (right), and aunt, Lorien Carter (left), told the gathered demonstrators that relatives had not been allowed to see the teenager after his death . Criticizing the authorities: 'We were told he was evidence,' Ms Carter told the crowd shortly before midnight, according to The Daily Cardinal. She added: 'He wasn't referred to as 'his son' or 'your son,' just 'evidence' Police face protesters: Cheered on by young and old protesters, Ms Irwin said: 'He [Tony] wouldn't hurt a fly. He was unarmed.' She asked: 'Why would you shoot him five times? What happened to your taser gun?' Mr Kenny, who has more than 12 years'  experience, was reportedly knocked down by a blow to the head during the struggle. He was taken to hospital, where he was treated and released. However, speaking to 27 News, Tony's tearful mother, Andrea Irwin, claimed her teenage son has 'never been a violent person', adding: 'To die in such a violent, violent way, it baffles me.' Ms Irwin also said that although she was pleased to see protesters supporting Tony at the scene, she does not wish to see violence like that in Ferguson after Michael Brown's death. During Friday night's protests, Tony's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, and aunt, Lorien Carter,  told the gathered demonstrators that relatives had not been allowed to see the teenager after his death. 'We were told he was evidence,' Ms Carter told the crowd shortly before midnight, according to The Daily Cardinal. 'He wasn't referred to as 'his son' or 'your son,' just 'evidence.' Grieving mother: Speaking to 27 News, Tony's tearful mother, Andrea Irwin (pictured), claimed her teenage son has 'never been a violent person'. 'To die in such a violent, violent way, it baffles me,' she told the news station . Understandable context: In a press briefing, Chief Koval said: 'It's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting. And we understand that' '[But] we would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint, calm and allow the Division of Criminal Investigation(DCI) to conduct their affairs,' he added.

High turnout: Protesters on the steps of Madison City County building (Ieft) and outside Tony's home (right) Cheered on by young and old protesters, Ms Irwin added: 'He [Tony] wouldn't hurt a fly. He was unarmed. Why would you shoot him five times? What happened to your taser gun?' In a press briefing, Chief Koval said: 'In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting. And we understand that. '[But] we would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint, calm and allow the Division of Criminal Investigation(DCI) to conduct their affairs.' Mr Kenny is on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation by the state's Division of Criminal Investigation and the Dane County District Attorney's decision on whether to press charges. Chief Mike Koval said the officer was previously involved in a fatal shooting in 2007. However, he was cleared of any wrongdoing because it was a 'suicide by cop-type; situation, he said. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said an out-of-area investigation would be launched into the death of Tony, who was apparently planning on attending Madison College. Above, some demonstrators held up accusatory banners . Scene: Late Friday, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval told broadcaster WKOW an officer had responded to a disturbance at an apartment  the African-American teenager had gone into. Above, police at the scene . Emergency response: Chief Koval added that Tony had appeared to be unarmed. 'The initial finding at the scene did not reflect a gun or anything of that nature that would have been used by the subject,' he said . According to The Wisconsin State Journal, friends of Tony were left shocked by his death. 'I still can't even fully wrap my head around this,'17-year-old Jack Spaulding told the Journal. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said an out-of-area investigation would be launched into the death of Tony, who was apparently planning on attending Madison College, Badger Herald reported. The investigation is required under a newly passed state law, Mayor Soglin told the Journal, adding: 'It's a tragedy beyond description. I expect there will be a lot of anger and frustrations.' In recent days, protests have been held in Los Angeles and Washington state over police killings of unarmed men from minority groups. They followed nationwide protests over the deaths of 18-year-old Brown, from Ferguson, and 43-year-old Eric Garner, from Staten Island, at the hands of police. In the spotlight: The shooting comes at a time of increased scrutiny of police violence against minorities across the US.

The violent images broadcast on TV of the famous march helped lead to the historic passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Earlier Friday, Obama said the investigation into police in Ferguson had exposed a 'broken and racially biased system'. 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,'he said. He told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal should be to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere. Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College came the day before he led the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', on which people protested against lack of voting rights.

(CNN)I met Kelly Gissendaner in January 2010 in a nondescript classroom at Metro State Prison for Women in Atlanta. She arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four Atlanta seminaries. Since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement, Kelly was particularly eager to share community with others, if only one morning a week. And she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the Bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life. That image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who Kelly is — who she has become: someone full of contagious joy and gratitude, open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry. Kelly's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband, Doug Gissendaner. A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult, yet compassionate, conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection. This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years. Her commitment to Kelly, along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns, provided steady, ongoing love that fostered change. So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation. She was, in the words of the Apostle Paul, a "new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17). In the theology program, Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church "on the outside," as well as in prison. By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers, Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic. She asked honest questions about her relationship to God, others and the world. She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions. She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work. "From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger," she said in her 2011 graduation speech. "I became so hungry for theology, and what all the classes had to offer; you could call me a glutton." One of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically, not only as thinkers, but also as human beings wrestling with some of life's most urgent questions. My relationship with Kelly had this quality from the start. But it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison. In her graduation speech, Kelly described this moment: . "There came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- I was pulled from the courses. I was taken from my theological community. Being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down. "Since I couldn't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me. Still, this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate. It was hard ... but I pushed on. I pushed on because of that hunger. That gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me. But that gate couldn't keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for, nor friendship and community. And it sure couldn't keep out God." This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday. We continued to read theological texts together, including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories, "the ruins of the past," and building from them here and now. Restoration, Williams writes, "is going back to the memories of the painful, humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to Christ [who] comes to repair the devastation." I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories, took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done. Indeed, the power of these moments -- when Kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins, when we spoke of God's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever. Kelly embraced what Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor-theologian and Nazi resister, calls "costly grace." For Bonhoeffer, "cheap grace" is seeking God's forgiveness as a "cover-up for one's sins, for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free." In contrast, costly grace requires rigorously following Jesus in a way that leads to continuous, visible transformation, what the New Testament calls the fruits of redemption. The fruits of Kelly's redemption are now well-documented: reconciliation with her children, ministry to inmates full of despair, counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others. On the night Kelly thought would be her last, she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates, urging them not to worry about her, but to be encouraged. Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, who is widely known as the "theologian of hope" and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010. Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave. Rather, hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now --God's intended social order "on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:10). Biblical hope "revolutionizes and transforms the present."  It is the hope of the psalmist who "looks for the goodness of God in this life" (Ps. 27:13).  In the words of Kelly's favorite scripture, it is a hope that proclaims: "I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord" (Ps 118:17). In Kelly's own words: . "The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that, despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head, I still possess the ability to prove that I am human. Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things. But no matter the label attached to me, I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me, or anyone." Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly's journey of hope. While I struggle to find adequate words, what I do know is that Kelly's story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits. It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance, forgiveness, redemption and hope. Indeed, even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make. Today, Kelly's life hangs in the balance. The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution, citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her. The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete. While Gov. Nathan Deal does not have the formal power to commute Kelly's sentence to life in prison, I join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation, including more than 500 from Georgia, who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save Kelly's life and to speak out publicly against her execution. I call on all people of good will to reach out to Gov. Deal and to Georgia state legislators to demand a more just, merciful, and accountable system of justice -- for Kelly and for all. As theologian Richard Amesbury wrote, "If the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected, then none of us is without hope." We need to hear Kelly Gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of God are real.	The execution of Kelly Gissendaner was postponed due to concerns over injection drugs . McBride: In her time on death row, Gissendaner has discovered hope through theology .
Wealthy renters have paid £100 million up-front this year alone to cover their entire tenancy as competition for ideal homes intensifies, it was revealed today. With six or seven people chasing every top London property, bidders are desperate to beat their rivals to seal the deal on a home. As a result they are willing to pay a full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front - handing over £200,000 on average to the landlord. Areas in most demand: A map shows the top ten locations for up front rental payments in London . This is based on figures from Dataloft, which says the average prime London home costs £3,500 per week to rent. In total, around £100 million has been paid up front in the first ten weeks of 2015, which is twice as much as the same period last year. The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine, according to letting agents E J Harris. Stamp Duty has also turned vendors into landlords and buyers into tenants as the central London £2 million to £20 million sales market has stalled. A number of these rich people are happy to pay their entire tenancy up front despite the properties costing them around £10,000 per week. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, above, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years . The top ten locations for up front rental payments are Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. Elizabeth Harris, managing director of E J Harris, said: 'The dramatic rise in up front tenancy payments is driven by several factors. 'Stamp Duty and mansion tax concerns has turned purchasers into tenants and so competition has risen for the best homes which has led to a rise in up front bids. A photo taken on Eaton Place in Belgravia - the area in London came second in the top ten list of up front rental payments . 'The London lettings market has become increasingly international with a new wave of wealthy tenants from Russia, Ukraine, Nigeria and China who are happy to pay their rents entirely up front. Estate agent Tunstall Lettings had one case where a young woman in China paid £4million up front for five years for a property in One Hyde Park. E J Harris had another case of a wealthy Nigerian paying more than £1million up front to rent a property in Mayfair. 'Despite new lettings coming onto the market, the speed at which new lettings instructions are getting tenant offers has increased dramatically, so the number of available lettings properties is actually lower at the end of each week.' The mad market has been highlighted by a number of eye-opening deals. A one-bedroom Mayfair apartment was snapped up by a desperate tenant in a record-breaking 40 minutes. An a wealthy young man paid £400,000 up-front to rent a luxury flat only to love the place so much he bought it three days later - for more than £10 million. Mark Tunstall, managing director of Tunstall Property, added: 'They have the financial wherewithal to sidestep the referencing requirements usually imposed by landlords by offering up-front lump-sum payments. 'Whilst global interest rates remain at historical lows it is of little consequence if those with substantial liquid cash reserves have to pay their rent in advance. 'And similarly, it doesn't confer the benefits on landlords that it used to do, when they would often accept a discount on the asking rent in return for the benefit of a slug of cash which they could then invest profitably elsewhere.' Knightsbridge came third on the list of top ten areas where money is paid up front for property rental .	Some pay full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front to land properties .

Dozens of Southwest Airlines passengers were delayed by about two hours today after a pickup truck crashed into a plane at Boston’s international airport. Almost 120 travellers were waiting to board flight WN771 from Logan International Airport to Atlanta when the collision occurred at about 5:30am local time. No injuries were reported, but the aircraft has been taken out of service for repairs. Passengers were waiting to board the Southwest Airlines plane when it was struck by a pickup truck . Cara Strobel said she and fellow travellers were waiting inside the terminal when the truck crashed into one of the Boeing 737’s engines as the plane sat on the snowy apron. She told MailOnline Travel that an official at the airport said the truck was unoccupied and left in gear, allowing it roll into the jet engine near a fuel tank. The 25-year-old, who was heading to Florida for a family holiday, said: ‘All of a sudden we saw the reflections of the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles and an announcement was made that we would be delayed. As a precaution Southwest Airlines decided to ground the plane and bring in a replacement aircraft . ‘I unfortunately don't know the details of how it happened, but it looks as though the rear of the truck was what hit the engine. ‘As far as I know, no one was injured. If anything it looked like a "fender bender" and they're sending us a replacement as a precaution. ‘I'd much rather have a new plane and have them check out this one.’ The back end of the truck collided with one of the plane's engines on the airport's snowy apron . A Southwest Airlines spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that no one was on board the plane at the time of the collision. The spokesperson said the truck belonged to a different airline. Cara said Southwest Airlines staff informed passengers that they would be delayed by about two hours as a replacement plane was brought in from Washington, DC. The spokesperson for the Dallas-based airline said: ‘The 119 customers will arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport about two-and-half hours behind schedule and our employees are working to accommodate any travel needs created by the delay. ‘We thank our delayed customers for their patience as our people worked to recover from the operational curveball and deliver those customers safely to their destinations.’	Passengers were waiting inside the terminal when the collision occurred .

Accessible only by a six-day boat journey from South Africa or as part of epic month-long cruises through the South Atlantic Ocean, Tristan da Cunha is about as far from a quick holiday destination as it gets. The world's most remote inhabited archipelago stands 1,243 miles from Saint Helena, its closest neighbour with residents, 1,491 miles from South Africa and 2,088 miles from South America. It's just seven miles long and 37.8 square miles in area, and has but one settlement officially known as Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, referred to by locals - less than 300 of them - as The Settlement, located at the foot of the 6,765-foot Queen Mary's Peak. But despite its unimposing size and formidable remoteness, Tristan da Cunha has a rich history and a plethora of native wildlife that is truly unique. Scroll down for video .

A sign shows the remarkable lengths one must go to get to Tristan, including 5,337 miles to London . Oceanwide Expeditions have four cruises that take in three-day stops at Tristan da Cunha, the name given to both the main island and the surrounding archipelago, including the uninhabited Nightingale Islands, and Inaccessible Island and the Gough Islands, which are nature reserves. Cruises, such as those which leave from Ushuaia in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego, are the most convenient way to see the island. One of 12 spaces can be filled on the fishing vessel MV Edinburgh and the cargo ship MV Baltic Trader. However, non-local tourists are at the bottom of an eight-tier priority pecking order that may include those responding to medical emergencies, official visitors and locals. The other cruise sails annually to Gough Island, run since 2012 by the South African Antarctic Research and Supply Vessel Agulhas II, and carries more than 40 passengers to and from Tristan. The local rockhopper penguins are hugely popular with visitors and live on all four of Tristan's islands . Oceanwide Expeditions' Atlantic Odyssey tours, the shortest and cheapest being the 27-night tour from £3,929 (Euro 5,450), calls in on The Settlement, and aims to land on Nightingale and Inaccessible, which millions of seabirds call home. The landings aren't guaranteed though, with 30 per cent of attempts via zodiac boat since 1998 having been unsuccessful due to bad weather. Thankfully, tours often factor in a spare day. On Nightingale Island, the wandering, yellow-nosed and sooty albatrosses all breed, and the Rockhopper penguins that live on all four of the Tristan Islands are also hugely popular with those who manage to make it there. Even with such attractions, tourism is a minor industry for Tristan, with the majority of earnings coming from their commercial crawfish or Tristan rock lobster (Jasus) operations and the sale of their unique postage stamps and coins to collectors.

All residents are farmers too, and the entire area is communally owned. Historically, the island has proven an important stop for sailing ships needing a stopover in the Atlantic, and was annexed by the UK in 1816 to ensure the French couldn't use it as a base to attempt a rescue of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was imprisoned at Saint Helena. Some typical housing in Edinburgh, where all 297 locals of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago live . Hiking paths and rough roads are plentiful around the small and remote volcanic island . The Settlement was named in honour of the 1867 visit of Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, when the islands served as a Royal Navy outpost called HMS Atlantic Isle, also said to have been used to monitor shipping movements in the ocean and the radio communications of Nazi U-boats. Prince Phillip, the second Duke of Edinburgh, also visited there on board the royal yacht Britannia in 1957. Just four years later, the entire population was forced to evacuate to England via Cape Town when Queen Mary's Peak erupted. Fortunately, the damage to The Settlement was found to be minimal and most residents returned in 1963. All of the local families are farmers of some kind, with cattle among the livestock, though fishing is also a massive part of their economy . Local social haunts include the cafe and the Albatross Bar, which by virtue of being on Tristan is one of the world’s most isolated pubs .

The local penguin population was threatened in March 2011 when the MS Oliva freighter ran aground and created a potentially devastating oil slick around Nightingale Island, which has no fresh water. Rockhoppers had to be taken to Tristan to be cleaned. The islands then got even more worldwide attention later the same year when Volvo Ocean Race competitor Puma's Mar Mostro broke a mast during its journey from Alicante to Cape Town and was forced to stop there. The town turned it on for the 11 person crew, who visited the local St Mary's School, took a tour of the fish processing factory and picked up emergency supplies at the local shop.

For PBS science correspondent Miles O'Brien, seeing on film the aftermath of the freak accident that resulted in the amputation of his left arm above the elbow proved more difficult than he had anticipated. He had an early look at the documentary, Miles O'Brien: A Life Lost and Found, narrated by his friend, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. It premieres on CNN next Tuesday at 9pm. 'I was a little bit taken aback by how much it affected me emotionally,' O'Brien said. 'We all want to talk about this linear, analogue thing — here's when you grieve, here's when you do therapy, here's where you get back to work. But that's not how we all live.' Scroll down for video . Amputee: PBS science correspondent Mile O'Brien (center) lost his left arm above the elbow last February after an accident while on assignment in Asia . Alarming diagnosis: A heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm, casing acute compartment syndrome - a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm . O'Brien, 55, used to be CNN's top science correspondent until the network laid off his entire unit. He appears on the network as an occasional analyst, such as during coverage of last spring's missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but does most of his freelance work now for PBS NewsHour. He was on assignment for PBS in Japan and the Philippines in February 2014 when a heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm. It caused a nasty bruise, but not enough to stop O'Brien from working. He wanted to finish his stories and escape for a few days on a beach. The following night, his pain increased and O'Brien sought medical attention. He was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome, a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm. As he was getting ready for surgery, he searched the Internet for details on a diagnosis he had never heard before, and grew alarmed when words like 'life-threatening' and 'amputation' popped up. Fateful trip: In Febraury 2014, O'Brien (pictured) traveled to Japan and the Philippines to report on 3D printing when the accident occurred . Illusion: Waking up after the amputation, O'Brien could feel his left arm, but it was only a phantom limb . Denial: O'Brien continued working on his stories after being discharged from the hospital and didn't tell his family back home about the amputation . Waking up after surgery, O'Brien's first inclination was that he caught a break. He could feel his left arm, the fingers on his hand. But it was an illusion, a phantom limb. His arm was gone. He checked out of the hospital two days later and spent more than a week in a Philippines hotel, finishing his PBS stories. In an extreme form of denial, the divorced father of two told no one what had happened, even his children. They were dark days, and he told Gupta he even considered suicide. 'I had never lost an arm before,' he said, drily. 'I wasn't sure how that would go.' Two weeks after the amputation, he wrote in a blog post- typed with one hand with the help of a voice recognition software: 'Life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you. Actually, I would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now — in more ways than one.' During an interview on the Today Show in March 2014, about a month after his accident, O'Brien described what happened to him as 'mind-boggling.' Unstoppable: The 55-year-old reporter has learned how to ride a bicycle one-handed with the help of a special contraption (pictured) O'Brien had never been the sort of person who reached out for help. And he wanted to prove to himself he could move forward and still do his job. When he found out about the amputation through the February blog post O'Brien had written, Gupta was worried. 'I wasn't surprised by Miles' reaction,' he said. 'My concern was, was this his form of therapy or was he delaying the inevitable psychological crash by not dealing with it emotionally?' O'Brien has tried to prove he can maintain his active life beyond work, with some missteps. He started running, but losing an arm affected his balance and he took some nasty spills. He broke his nose one time when he reached to break his fall with an arm that was no longer there. A woman who came upon him was horrified — look what happened to his arm! — and O'Brien had to explain he didn't lose it in the fall. With the help of a prosthetic arm, he completed a 300-mile bike ride to honor his late sister, Gupta pedaling by his side. The licensed pilot has also been testing out how to fly again with his new disability. Growing pains: The divorced father of two has been learning how to perform simple everyday tasks like cutting a bagel and getting dressed on his own . He's learning about the oddities of pain in a phantom limb, how to work with new prosthetics and how to negotiate simple tasks — getting dressed, cutting a bagel — that he never had to think twice about before. When filming the CNN special, O'Brien knew what Gupta was up to when his friend asked him to read on camera some of the emails that Gupta had sent to him a year ago. He was trying to make him cry. It worked. The emotional journey, still not completed, has been one of self-discovery. He's learned that there's no weakness in asking for help. He realizes what loved ones and even strangers think of him, and it has been overwhelming. 'If I had to trade it — that arm for the knowledge and the love that I feel?' he said. 'I'll go with the love. It's a hell of a way to learn a lesson.'	O'Brien, 55, had his left arm amputated above the elbow in February 2014 after a heavy bag fell onto his forearm . He was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome, a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm . O'Brien woke up after amputation thinking his arm has been spared because he could feel it, but it was a phantom limb . He didn't tell his family back home what's happened to him and kept working . O'Brien says he had to learn how to perform simple everyday tasks like cutting a bagel or riding a bicycle with just one hand . He broke his nose while jogging when he reached to break his fall with an arm that was no longer there . O'Brien is the subject of a new documentary, Miles O'Brien: A Life Lost and Found, that premieres on CNN March 10 .
A labourer has been banned from keeping or handling fish after being filmed swallowing a goldfish and washing it down with a can of Strongbow. Luke Berry posted a video of himself on social media attempting to down the creature three times after a day of heavy drinking. The 26-year-old from Farringdon, Oxon, was reported to police after RSPCA investigators found the clip online. He was branded 'uncivilised and disgusting' in front of magistrates in Oxford and banned from keeping or handling fish in future. Scroll down for video . Luke Berry was banned from keeping or handling fish after a video of him downing a goldfish with a can of Strongbow was reported to police . In the video titled 'Here fishy fishy', the 26-year-old coughs the creature up three times before swallowing it whole . During the video, Berry coughs up the squirming fish three times before swallowing it whole. Dressed in an Arsenal football shirt and clutching a can of Strongbow cider, he is seen downing the fish before showing his empty mouth to the camera. The clip, titled Here Fishy Fishy, was reported to police following an RSPCA investigation. Prosecutor Paddy Roche said: 'This case arises as a consequence of the RSPCA getting wind of a video that had been posted on Facebook. The labourer's lawyer said he was 'ashamed' of his behaviour and had been encouraged by friends. 'He was extremely intoxicated at the time. He was egged on. He fully accepts what has happened,' said Alice Dodds. She added the 26-year-old, who receives £70 a week in benefits, had overcome a background of 'heavy drinking' before filming the video. Berry was ordered to pay a £500 fine after being described by magistrates as 'disgusting'. Presiding magistrate Iain McCoubrey said Berry could be punished with a 12 month community order with 120 hours of unpaid work. The labourer looked jubilant after being let off with a fine and banning order preventing him from owning fish for five years . 'We are sentencing you for an act of animal cruelty. 'It was a particularly disgusting thing to do, in particular filming it and posting it on Facebook was uncivilised. It was unacceptable. 'This offence of animal cruelty is serious enough for us to make a community order. You will have to comply with an order to carry out unpaid work.' He was banned for keeping or handling fish for five years. Speaking after the sentencing, the RSPCA's Inspector Andy Eddy said: 'We are very satisfied with the sentence. 'It demonstrates that it is unacceptable to behave in this way, to cruelly treat an animal in this fashion, and then post it online for entertainment.'

Bigger is better when it comes to selling bras because according to new market research, women are more likely to buy lingerie if it's modeled by a plus-size woman over a thin blonde. Adore Me, a rapidly growing lingerie start-up based in New York, has revealed that its television ad featuring a plus size model quadrupled online sales when compared to the brand's commercial starring a group of blondes. 'There's an overall mentality that you have to be super skinny,' the company's founder Morgan Hermand-Waiche told CNN. 'We are showing that we offer lingerie for everyone.' Scroll down for video . Betty versus Veronica: Online retailer Adore Me has revealed that new research shows that its television ad starring a plus size brunette sold more lingerie that its commercial featuring a group of blondes . The three-year-old start-up, which sells its lingerie and swimwear through monthly subscriptions, as well as one-off purchases, used a marketing strategy called A/B testing, in which consumers are shown different ads in order to measure what models, poses and settings increase the retailer's sales. When Adore Me debuted its first national television campaign last January, the company used the  testing method for its three different commercials, which aired on channels such as Bravo, Lifetime and MTV. One television ad featured a cast of all blonde models, another showcased all brunette models and the third starred one plus-size brunette. After the company monitored online traffic and sales throughout the month, they came to the -perhaps surprising conclusion - that the 30-second commercial featuring the dark-haired plus-size model generated four times as many sales than the one featuring the blondes. Making sales: A curvy brunette can be seen modeling a pink lingerie set for one of the brand's commercials . Foolproof method: The company's founder Morgan Hermand-Waiche told CNN's Rachel Crane that he relies on customer research to build his company's website . Even better news for the thriving company is that the plus size clip only cost one-tenth of the other commercials' production expenses to make. The online retailer also learned that its female consumers preferred the commercial that left its models unretouched. Adore Me didn't do any digital retouching to the ad featuring multiple brunette models - and that commercial was the one that was favorited by consumers. A/B testing is an important strategy for the company, which unveils a new collection every month. Blondes don't sell: Last year's research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a flaxen haired beauty . Coveted curves: This year's data revealed that women prefer model to remain digitally untouched . Last year's marketing research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a blonde. Keeping that information in mind, the company wasn't surprised when its commercials featuring brunette models fared better than the ones that starred blondes during this year's round of testing. 'At the end of the day... it's [our] customers who choose the model they like [and] the pose they like instead of us imposing on them,' Mr Hermand-Waiche told CNN's Rachel Crane. 'Its really the customer who builds the [Adore Me] website based on what they prefer,' he noted.

Jeremy Clarkson could return to Top Gear if he faces up to ‘his own shortcomings’, a senior BBC source hinted last night. The insider said the 54-year-old presenter, who is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer Oisin Tymon, might be allowed to come back if he ‘sorted himself out’. The source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings. Scroll down for video . Suspended: A BBC insider has suggested Jeremy Clarkson (pictured at the Roundhouse theatre this week) might be allowed to come back if he 'sorted himself out' ‘He has a great deal of public support and of course that shouldn’t be ignored. But he does needs to rest and sort himself out.’ The remarks come after The Mail on Sunday provoked an outcry last week when we revealed that a BBC executive had likened Clarkson’s support from politicians to that given to paedophile Jimmy Savile. The Corporation is due to decide Mr Clarkson’s fate this week, after he was suspended pending an independent review into allegations surrounding the alleged assault. To the disappointment of millions of fans, Top Gear has also been taken off the air. The BBC and Clarkson have been locked into a bitter war of words since it emerged he had been involved in an altercation with Tymon reportedly sparked by a row over the lack of hot food at a hotel. The 54-year-old presenter (right) is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer Oisin Tymon (left) During a briefing to this newspaper last week, a BBC executive also claimed the host was ‘self-destructing’ and should go into rehab. Since then, the Corporation and the presenter have refused to comment publicly about the affair. Clarkson does not deny ranting at the producer but other claims that he punched his colleague remain unsubstantiated. Ken MacQuarrie, head of BBC Scotland, who has been investigating the claims, is due to report to BBC director-general Lord Hall, who will then decide on the star’s fate. But a senior BBC source has now told the MoS there is a growing realisation within the Corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear off the air while an investigation was under way. He said: ‘The programme could have and should have carried on during Clarkson’s suspension.’ He declined to comment on suggestions that the star needed to spend time in rehab: ‘I think he kind of knows he has to sort himself out. I don’t know if he should go into rehab or not. It’s not for me to say.’ Last week, the MoS’s story showed the extent of BBC briefing against the highly-paid presenter, with an executive likening Tymon’s position to that of Savile’s victims who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. The executive said: ‘The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way. ‘If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile’s a real talent, Maria Miller is saying Savile will be Savile.’ The comments were strongly condemned by both Savile’s victims and a furious Clarkson, who has since called in lawyers in a bid to identify the source of the comparison. A BBC spokesman last night declined to comment on the idea that Clarkson could return to the Corporation. He said that it would not be offering ‘further commentary’ on the matter until Lord Hall had made his decision.	Presenter was suspended after allegedly assaulting producer Oisin Tymon .

An 'outstanding' hospital doctor has been jailed for six months after he supplied meow meow and date-rape drugs to a university polo club president who  choked to death on a sock after a night out. Dr James Morgan, 29, gave the cocktail of drugs to trained huntsman James Steen, after inviting him and two other friends back to his home in Rugby, Warwickshire, at the end of the night. The doctor, who had only met Mr Steen that night, gave the 23-year-old media student class B drug Mephedrone and class C drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), one of the most common date-rape drugs. Jailed: Dr James Morgan, 29 (left), from Rugby, Warwickshire, has been jailed for six months for supplying date-rape drugs and meow meow to 23-year-old James Steen (right), who died after choking on a sock . 'Talented': The trained huntsman (pictured), who was President of the Polo Society at Newcastle University, had gone back to Morgan's house following a night out with him and two other friends . But the court heard how the student, from Poyntzpass, near Newry, Northern Ireland, had a fetish for sniffing socks and later suffocated to death after partially swallowing one. Jailing him at Warkwick Crown Court, a judge told Morgan that his career had been left in tatters for committing the 'terrible dereliction of duty'. Judge Sylvia de Bertodano added that, as a doctor, Morgan should have lived up to his 'position of authority'  - and known more than anyone that drugs 'ruin lives'. She said: 'It's tragic cases like this which reinforce the message courts send out when they sentence for the supply of drugs, that drugs of whatever class ruin lives. 'You, better than anyone, should know that. You are not only a doctor, you are an outstanding one. So as well as taking James's life, you have ruined your own life. Your career, which you worked so hard to build, is in jeopardy.' She added: 'As a doctor, even in a social context, you were in a position of authority. He had taken a great deal more of the class C drug than any of the other three of you. 'Allowing that to happen was a terrible dereliction of your duty. 'The message has to go out that if someone, in particular a doctor, supplies a non-drug-user with illegal drugs and they die as a result, they must go to prison.' Tragic: Judge Sylvia de Bertodano said Mr Steen's 'tragic' death sent out the message that 'drugs or whatever class ruin lives'. She also offered her sympathies to Mr Steen's family, saying: 'You are going to have to work very hard to rebuild your life - but that is something James Steen will never be able to do. 'James Steen was a young man on the very threshold of life. He had everything to live for. Nothing you can do, and I can do today can reconcile his family to their loss.' Morgan, who worked as registrar at Coventry's University Hospital, met Mr Steen through his partner Simon Chapman and his friend John Deptford. Mr Deptford, who played for Northampton Outlaws Rugby Club, had befriended Mr Steen online and stayed with him when he visited Newcastle. 'Threshold of life': She added that Morgan had committed a 'terrible dereliction of duty' by allowing Mr Steen (pictured) to take drugs, despite him being a doctor 'in a position of authority' Promising: The student (left and right), from Poyntzpass, near Newry, Northern Ireland, was a keen skier and was studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University . The student, who was a keen skier, lived in Newcastle while studying media, communications and cultural studies at the university. The court heard Mr Steen had travelled to Rugby for a meal with Mr Deptford, Mr Chapman and Morgan. The four men went to the Steam Turbine pub in the town and had a meal before moving on to another pub. Prosecutor Lal Amarasinghe told the court they all went back to Morgan's Victorian terraced home, where he got a bottle of 'poppers' which was passed round to sniff. He said: 'Mr Deptford, who had been quite drunk, could not recall anything else until waking up and realising he and the other three were all naked and Mr Steen was lying on the floor. 'Everything to live for': The night before his death he travelled down to Rugby for a meal with Mr Deptford - who had befriended Steen online - Mr Chapman and Morgan. The four men later went back to Morgan's home . 'Realising something was wrong, he pinched him to try to get a reaction, but without any response, and immediately called to Morgan who examined the student. 'An ambulance was called, and as they waited they tried to resuscitate Mr Steen but realised his airway was blocked. 'Mr Deptford, who knew Mr Steen had a fetish for sniffing socks and putting them in his mouth, found he had a sock blocking his throat, and pulled it out. Paramedics then arrived, but Mr Steen was already beyond help.' Morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder. That was later reduced to supplying drugs. The court heard how police found traces of Mephedrone, a synthetic stimulant, on a chopping board and a bottle which had contained GBL, which can be an anaesthetic and hypnotic agent, in the property. In large amounts it can cause respiratory failure. Spirit: After his death, Mr Steen's parents said their son had been a 'kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a generous spirit' The court heard Mr Steen died of respiratory failure as a result of a blockage of his airway, although the drugs were said to be a ‘direct contributor’ to that. Christopher Millington QC, defending, said: 'This was a talented student, and the consequence of his death has caused terrible grief to his family. 'This case is tragic in many ways. At the heart of it is the death of a talented student, and in the dock to face the consequences is a gifted doctor. 'The case is complicated by this fact: as we understand it, the cause of death was asphyxiation. 'What the deceased had done was put a sock in his mouth which, according to Mr Deptford, he had partially swallowed. Nobody knew it was there until after his death. Probe: After an ambulance was called to his home, Morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder. Pictured: Police guarding the property in Rugby following Mr Steen's death . Forensics: Police found traces of Mephedrone on a chopping board and a bottle which had contained GBL. Pictured: Forensic teams gathering evidence in the wake of Mr Steen's death . 'The role the drug played is that it increased the risk of asphyxiation. It was not the direct cause of death.' He added that the consequences of jailing Morgan would be to deprive the public 'of the services of a gifted doctor.' He said there was a 'stand-out reference' from Dr Belinda Stanley, a member of the GMC's disciplinary tribunal, who described Morgan as 'among the best she has ever worked with.' Mr Millington added: 'The sad fact is that having devoted so many years of his life to becoming a doctor, he has put his career in jeopardy because of the irresponsibility he displayed during that social gathering. 'That is something he will have to live with, together with the guilt and feeling of responsibility over the death of the deceased.' After Mr Steen's death, his family described the young man as 'kind, caring and very talented'. In a statement released through police, they said: 'James enriched our lives, and the lives of others, in so many ways. 'He was a kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a generous spirit. He touched everyone he met with his positivity and his sense of humour. 'We are devastated by James' untimely death, but we are comforted by knowing how much he was loved and admired by his family, friends and university colleagues. 'We are immensely proud of our son, and all he achieved and the significant mark he made during his brief time on this earth.'	Dr James Morgan gave cocktail of drugs to trained huntsman James Steen . He had invited him back to his home in Rugby, Warks at end of the night . Mr Steen took class B Mephedrone and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) 23-year-old student then suffocated to death after partially swallowing sock . Judge said Morgan committed 'dereliction of duty' by allowing tragic death . 'Drugs of whatever class ruin lives. You, better than anyone, should know that,' she told him .
Minnie Minoso, who hit a two-run home run in his first at-bat when he became major league baseball's first black player in Chicago in 1951, has died, the Cook County medical examiner said Sunday. The medical examiner's office did not immediately offer further details. There is some question about Minoso's age but the White Sox say he was 90. Minoso played 12 of his 17 seasons in Chicago, hitting .304 with 135 homers and 808 RBIs for the White Sox. The White Sox retired his No. 9 in 1983 and there is a statue of Minoso at U.S. Cellular Field. Remembered: Minnie Minoso (seen here in August 2013), who became major league baseball's first black player in Chicago in 1951, has died . History: In a March 9, 1957 file photo, Chicago White Sox outfielder Orestes 'Minnie' Minoso poses in batting position at Al Lopez Field in Tampa, Florida . Starting out: Minoso made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949 and was dealt to Chicago in a three-team trade two years later. Minoso is seen with Lou Boudreau, right, and Larry Doby (on the left) in May 1949 . 'We have lost our dear friend and a great man,' White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf said in a release. 'Many tears are falling.' Minoso made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949 and was dealt to Chicago in a three-team trade two years later. He made his White Sox debut on May 1, 1951, and homered in his first plate appearance against Yankees right-hander Vic Raschi. It was the start of a beautiful relationship between the Cuban slugger and the White Sox. Minoso, regarded as baseball's first black Latino star, was a Havana native who spent most of his career in left field. He is one of only two players to appear in a major league game in five different decades. He got his final hit in 1976 at age 53 and went 0 for 2 in two games in 1980 for the White Sox, who tried unsuccessfully over the years to get the 'Cuban Comet' into baseball's Hall of Fame. 'When I watched Minnie Minoso play, I always thought I was looking at a Hall of Fame player,' Reinsdorf said in an informational package produced by the team for a 2011 Cooperstown push. 'I never understood why Minnie wasn't elected. 'He did everything. He could run, he could field, he could hit with power, he could bunt and steal bases. He was one of the most exciting players I have ever seen.' Saturnino Orestes Armas Minoso Arrieta was selected for nine All-Star games and won three Gold Gloves in left. He was hit by a pitch 192 times, ninth on baseball's career list, and finished in the top four in AL MVP voting four times. Despite the push by the White Sox and other prominent Latin players, Minoso has never made it to Cooperstown. His highest percentage during his 15 years on the writers' ballot was 21.1 in 1988. He was considered by the Veterans Committee in 2014 and fell short of the required percentage for induction. 'My last dream is to be in Cooperstown, to be with those guys,' Minoso said in that 2011 package distributed by the White Sox. 'I want to be there. This is my life's dream.' Minoso, who made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949, hit .298 for his career with 186 homers and 1,023 RBIs. The speedy Minoso also led the AL in triples and steals three times in each category. Playing in an era dominated by the Yankees, Minoso never played in the postseason. 'Every young player in Cuba wanted to be like Minnie Minoso, and I was one of them,' Hall of Fame slugger Tony Perez said. 'The way he played the game, hard all the time, hard. He was very consistent playing the game. He tried to win every game. And if you want to be like somebody, and I picked Minnie, you have to be consistent.' Minoso appeared in just nine games in his first stint with the Indians, but he took off when he was dealt to Chicago as part of a three-team trade in 1951 that also involved the Philadelphia Athletics. He went deep in his first plate appearance against Yankees right-hander Raschi, and hit .375 in his first 45 games with the White Sox. Tribute: The White Sox shared an image of Minoso on Twitter Sunday (left). Flowers have also been left at his statue at U.S. Cellular Field (right) Minoso finished that first season in Chicago with a .326 batting average, 10 homers and 76 RBIs in 146 games for the Indians and White Sox. He also had a major league-best 14 triples and an AL-best 31 steals. It was Minoso's first of eight seasons with at least a .300 batting average. He also had four seasons with at least 100 RBIs. 'I have baseball in my blood,' Minoso said. 'Baseball is all I've ever wanted to do.' The White Sox uploaded a photograph of Minoso smiling and holding his jersey to the team'sTwitter on Sunday. 'Minnie Minoso — Mr. #WhiteSox — has died. Tears of sadness are falling for a great man,' the caption said. In a separate tweet, the White Sox also posted a statement from the Minoso family, which requested privacy.

Doctors do not get the praise they deserve.’ Reddit user Facetus, a medic, wrote: ‘I know exactly how the doc in the picture feels. Despite the picture showing such a dark moment it actually makes me feel happier about my career choice. I think it is the sense of connection with the unknown doc in the pic and the comments and reaction of Reddit community that makes me feel: what we do matters.’ Another user, livinbandit, said: ‘My dad is an ER doctor. I remember the times he would come home and cry in my mother’s arms because there was someone that he couldn't save no matter how hard he tried.’ Reddit users touched by the picture of the doctor left comments praising the work that the emergency services do .
