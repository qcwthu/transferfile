(CNN)Buddy Elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin Anne Frank. His death Monday brought back memories for me. We met three years ago in an Atlanta hotel conference room. He and his wife, Gerti, were touring the United States to promote a new book. I could tell instantly that he was related to Anne. His face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though I was meeting her in person. "Anne Frank's Family" had just been published, based on 14 boxes of letters, postcards, photos and documents that Gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in Basel. Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did. The 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-Semitism. That day in Atlanta, I listened to Elias tell me about loved ones he lost. He told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral Switzerland when World War II broke out. I thought back to our conversation Thursday when I learned the news of Elias' death. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed. Like millions of people who read "The Diary of Anne Frank," I was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family's courage. Anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the Nazis in the secret annex of an Amsterdam apartment. I was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975. After the family was discovered, they were sent to Auschwitz. Later, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they both died in March 1945. Her father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor of the family, one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from Auschwitz. In the course of my two hours with Elias, I learned new things about the young, Jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world. She called him Bernd, short for Bernhard, Elias' formal name. In his youth, Elias was an actor and a skater with Holiday on Ice. He was her first cousin and 4 years older. They adored one another. "Bernd, maybe we can skate as a pair together someday," Anne wrote in January 1941 from Amsterdam. "But I know I'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are." In another letter, Anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue, fur-trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with Elias. "She never did get to do that," Elias said. On his 17th birthday in 1942, she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met. It was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other. But it turned out to be her last to him, and he preserved it like a relic, as proof of his cousin's affection, as something to treasure. "That was the last sign of life I had with Anne," Elias told me. After the war, Otto Frank searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate. He published Anne's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film. He created the foundation in her name in 1963. The first edition of the diary was in Dutch. Elias told me he had to wait several years for a German language edition before he could read it. That was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate. By the time he read her words, he had not seen Anne in many years. In his mind, he treasured the image of a spunky girl who loved the Jack-in-the-Box puppet shows Elias staged and played hide-and-seek. "Anne," he said, "was always good at hiding." I wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words. Otto Frank kept alive his daughter's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to Elias.  He was devoted to the task until the day he died. In 2012, he helped create the Frank Family Centre in Frankfurt, where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public, according to the Anne Frank foundation. Elias was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world. Anne Frank never gave up on humanity, despite everything she endured. It was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary. In Elias, I saw that same goodness.	Anne Frank was extremely close to her first cousin Buddy Elias .

First-time buyers are being pushed out of the housing market by the rise of ‘granlords’, say experts. A recent buy-to-let boom has been partly driven by retired Britons looking to invest in property. And estate agents say the interest from older investors in property is putting an even greater strain on Britain’s limited housing stock. Retirees have increasingly turned to buy-to-let to get a better return on their savings at a time when banks are offering the worst interest rates on record. First-time buyers are being pushed out of the housing market by the rise of so-called 'granlords' who are looking to invest their pensions in property, experts have warned (file picture) The industry is now predicting that even more ‘granlords’ will buy homes to rent out from April, when reforms make it easier for the over-55s to cash in their pensions. This is likely to drive up prices even further at the lower end of the market, making modest, first-time properties even more unaffordable for young buyers who are trying to take their first step on the property ladder. Miles Shipside, of property website Rightmove, said: ‘While many pension pots may not fund a sufficiently large tax-free lump sum to facilitate a property purchase, for some it will provide enough for a deposit. ‘Agents report a high level of interest from “granlords” – new landlords who are typically first-time, retirement-age, buy-to-let investors.’ David Blythman, of Scottfraser estate agent, Oxfordshire, said: ‘Since the beginning of the year there has been no let-up in demand for properties across Oxfordshire and our investment search division are now receiving a significant uplift in enquiries including many from ‘granlords’ - first time, retirement age, buy-to-let investors diversifying their pension investments. ‘We foresee these buyers having a positive impact on the quality of the private rental sector as they have no intention of squandering their hard earned funds on anything other than the best properties.’ Estate agents say the interest from older investors  is putting an even greater strain on Britain’s limited housing stock (file picture) Britain is in the middle of a buy-to-let boom as middle-income ‘amateur’ landlords invest in property. Thousands of middle-class families fed up with rock-bottom interest rates are making their first foray into the renting market. The value of buy-to-let mortgages on new purchases rose by 34 per cent to £11.6billion between January and November last year. The number of landlords taking out mortgages on new purchases in the UK also grew by 21 per cent to 93,970 between January and November 2014 - with 8,500 handed out every month. Ken Hume, of James Alexander estate agents in Norbury, South West London, said: ‘We’ve had enquiries from a number of older people considering buy-to-let, with interest expressed particularly in smaller flats where yields are higher.’	Recent boom partly driven by retirees wanting better return on savings .

For most people who turn 80, it is the time to kick back, relax and enjoy a well-earned retirement. But for one karate-kicking great-grandmother in Kansas, there is no letting up. Helen Dugan, a third-degree black belt, continues to lead karate classes at the school she set up, Champs Achievers, despite passing the milestone. Battling on: Despite turning 80, Helen Dugan, owner of karate school Champs Achievers, is not letting up . Aiming high: After earning her black belt at 61, Dugan was inspired to teach others the sport in Kansas . Iron fist: Dugan set up the class for disabled children and said it was important to 'build on their strengths' The great-grandmother of 17 only took up the sport when she took two of her children to a class at the age of 47, the Kansas City Star reports. She said: 'We never had karate when I was a child, so I took my sons to a class and I realised that my two skinny sons didn't need the exercise and so I got into the back row of the class.' Her children lasted four years before as she puts it, 'they discovered girls and got married', but she 'was hooked'. Dugan, who has been married to husband Barney for 57 years, took karate classes for 14 years, earning her black belt at the age of 61. At the time she was also working as a nurse in the Center School District in Kansas City, in Missouri. Leading the way: Dugan takes a hit from seven-year-old Brayden Bond during a class in Lenexa, Kansas . Listen in: The great-grandmother quiets the class as three-year-old Aiden Degnan tries to get her attention . Friendly face: Dugan has seen her class grow in the last 20 years and it now caters for more than 50 children . Jousting: Dugan takes on five-year-old Micah Jenkins using pugil sticks during one of her sessions . Inspired to pass on her expertise to others, the mother-of-five set up a non-profit karate class called Champs aimed at helping those with a disability. Karate and other martial arts taught at the group -  including judo, jujitsu, tai chi and a defensive street-fighting discipline called Guided Chaos - can improve concentration, stamina, balance, motor skills, independence and self-esteem. She said: 'I started the group because the class I was learning in had children who couldn't keep up, so I took them aside. Sometimes it was because of learning disabilities, or it was children with ADHD. 'I then started teaching them separately.' Now almost 20 years later, the group is going from strength to strength and caters for more than 50 children in the area.	Helen Dugan continues to lead karate classes despite passing age of 80 .

Things usually end badly for England in Turin. Italia 90 culminated in a tear-jerker in this city, as did the Euros in 1980, and David Beckham’s first game as captain was another defeat at the turn of the century. It was 1948 when England last won here and even Michael Caine’s cliff-hanger in The Italian Job, a heist film based around an England game in Turin, did not go to plan — and that was not even real. Roy Hodgson, too, admits his personal record playing Juventus when he was coaching in Italy was not up to much either, so there was no surprise when he and his captain Wayne Rooney insisted they were much keener to talk about the future than the past. England manager Roy Hodgson looks on during a press conference  ahead of the match against Italy . Harry Kane poses just days after grabbing his first international goal on his England debut . Here is the first real test for Hodgson’s new wave, playing away against one of the major European nations, even if both teams have something of an experimental feel to them. Hodgson chose to take a young squad to the World Cup in the hope that experience would pay off in the long run and he can go some way to claiming that it already has with seven wins out of seven, while others including Germany, Holland and Italy have stuttered amid the complacent environment that is the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Hodgson speaks to his players on the pitch in Turin ahead of Tuesday's friendly match against Italy . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle could be in line to start for Italy against England on Tuesday .

The manager remains rightly cautious about getting carried away on the basis of handsome victories against Slovenia and Lithuania. ‘I’m always frightened to say those things,’ said Hodgson, but he is quietly satisfied with almost everything that has happened since his team returned from Brazil. ‘You never know,’ he added. ‘Certainly, there seems to be a group and a talent pool that is growing all the time. Some of the talent that’s already been with us for a couple of years, I see signs of them becoming more comfortable, assured in their play not only with their clubs but with England. The teams we select have a lot of energy and pace around them. These are good qualities a team badly needs. Pace and energy mean you cause teams problems when you attack and when you defend it helps prevent any damage. ‘If we can keep this group of 20-odd players together, they’ll get more international experience and hopefully in a year’s time we might be stronger than we are today. ‘But I don’t feel we’re lagging any more. Or that other teams are moving forward faster than us. We’re keeping pace. By the finals in France, hopefully we’ll be closer to that.’ Perhaps they will if Harry Kane tackles the challenge of his first start as he did his first appearance. Or if another player emerges to demand a place in the team. Even then, the usual fear that England have qualified stylishly in the past only to malfunction during the tournaments, will remain. One of the reasons they have struggled when stepping up a level in recent tournaments has been because they lack the depth of players in defensive areas, including defensive midfield, to give the team a healthy balance. So it will be interesting to see how Phil Jones performs if he is deployed in midfield as expected. Wayne Rooney answers the questions from the press as England continue preparations for Italy .

Ignazio Abate (right) controls the ball under pressure from Ciro Immobile during training in Turin . Hodgson urged supporters to wait and judge his team in a series of friendlies being planned against what he called ‘top-class opponents, teams on a par with Italy’ next season. England will play France and Spain in November, assuming they all avoid the need to play off. They are away in Germany in March next year and are in talks for a friendly against Holland. ‘It will be much more relevant when we qualify,’ said Hodgson, who always seems to come over all misty-eyed when he returns to Italy and spoke with touching fondness of the moment he was invited by Massimo Moratti to coach Inter Milan. Antonio Conte was also emotional as he discussed his first return to the Juventus Stadium, although the Italy boss has more immediate problems amid suggestions that he regrets his decision to swap club football for the chance to lead the Azzurri to Euro 2016.

Already it has damaged his relationship with Juventus, the club he loves, where he played more than 400 games, many as captain and won three titles as coach. Conte, new to international management, has been swamped by controversies around an injury to Claudio Marchisio, which prompted a death-threat, but turned out not to be as bad as first feared and his decision to call-up Brazilian-born Eder, who will start tonight, and Argentina-born Franco Vazquez. ‘What am I missing, what am I lacking?’ said Conte. ‘I don’t know if I’m missing anything. Regardless of what’s going on I will keep working and moving forward. Sometimes I ask myself questions and don’t know the answers.’ Kane looks around at the huge Juventus Arena as he prepares to make his full debut against Italy . Gianluigi Buffon missed Italy's Bulgaria match with illness but was back in training on Monday . The return of Buffon (right) provided a major boost to Italy ahead of their encounter against England . Gianluigi Buffon is fit to start after a fever but this Italian generation is near to the end and braced for a transitional phase. ‘There’s been a big turnover in terms of players and experience at every level and whenever that happens you need a minimum level of patience,’ said Conte. ‘You need to allow the players to grow without being critical at every opportunity. I don’t think this is helpful. ‘When I say we have to be left to work it’s because we have to work. We don’t have a lot of time because the European Championship is next year. All I can promise is that we can work very hard.’ The two teams are in different places. You would rather be Hodgson than Conte and yet we have heard this before. There were similar noises from both camps before they met in Manaus, nine months ago. Even if England prefer to look forward, history is against them in more ways than one.

Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Suspected Boko Haram gunmen shot dead and slit the throats of 68 people -- including children -- in an attack on a village in Nigeria's Borno state, according to survivors and vigilante sources. The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. "They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old," Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. "They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people," Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. "I only got information of the attack on my village last night," said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba "lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri."	Young victims in the village of Njaba, ages 13 to 19 were singled out for killing, witness says . "They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee," witness says .
Manu Tuilagi's recovery from a persistent groin injury remains a distant prospect and the wrecking-ball centre is racing to be fit to play any further rugby this season. The 23-year-old has not played since being forced off during Leicester’s Champions Cup tie against Ulster last October. The initial prognosis was that he would be sidelined for six to eight weeks, but that was soon exposed as wishful thinking. A series of target dates for his comeback have come and gone, and now it appears Tuilagi won’t resurface until the last month of the season — if at all. Manu Tuilagi has not featured since injuring his groin playing for Leicester back in October . The England centre is in a race against time to be fit for the World Cup, starting in September . Sportsmail understands he is setting his sights on playing four or five games for the Tigers in late April and May, but only time will tell if that ambition can be realised. England were already resigned to being without their midfield colossus for the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign, but having had Tuilagi in camp to oversee his rehabilitation, the management are aware that he is not close to being match-ready. The latest bulletin represented another setback in an alarmingly drawn-out recovery. ‘He is making good progress and is doing straight line running, but he still has some way to go,’ said head coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of another Calcutta Cup encounter which will not feature Tuilagi. ‘I think he’ll come good at the end of the season. Certainly Phil Pask (physio) has done a good job with him, but it’s not in the near future. By the end of the season he’ll be back playing. ‘It is about making sure his groin and the healing around it is strong enough to cope with the forces he puts through it. He is a powerful man and he needs to make sure the groin has healed sufficiently. It is a step-by-step process to make sure he does not re-injure it, so that is why people are very cautious.’ Leicester and England are keen to build their attacking game around Tuilagi’s forceful ball-carrying but the pattern in the last two years has been for longer spells injured than fit. He has made only four appearances for the Tigers this season, following a modest tally of 10 last season in a campaign disrupted by a prolonged recovery from a pectoral injury. Tuilagi is a destructive figure but when he breaks down it takes a long time for his powerful body to heal. In early December, his club’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, predicted an imminent return and outlined just what Leicester and England were missing. ‘Manu should be back by the end of December,’ he said at the time. ‘In the modern game you’ve got to be able to dent the line of the opposition — you need physicality and Manu gives you that. He has been huge for England. The midfield is the biggest problem England have and Manu gives you that one position solved.’ Tuilagi could make a return in the final month of the season but his World Cup place is in jeopardy . Tuilagi has struggled with injury over the past two seasons and has only played nine Tests since 2012 . Worryingly for Lancaster and his assistants, uncertainty over Tuilagi’s ability to withstand the rigours of his profession remains part of the problem. In 2012, he played 10 times for his country, culminating in a devastating contribution to the record win over the All Blacks at Twickenham. Since then he has made only nine Test appearances, four of them as a replacement and one of those for the Lions on a tour where his impact was undermined by yet another injury. Despite attempts to alleviate his condition using prolotherapy — involving injections of a sugar solution into the bone — it is thought that a recent improvement has been brought about by intensive physiotherapy. Leicester will hope his best-case scenario of a return for the business end of the season ignites their Aviva Premiership title challenge, while England will want Tuilagi to join their initial World Cup training squad in June, ready to play a full, active part. England head coach Stuart Lancaster confirmed Tuilagi is no closer to making a return . Lancaster oversees training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England will line up against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . He remains the most potent weapon in the team’s back-line, when available. He can splinter the best defences and has even spooked the All Blacks with his explosive exploits in midfield. That continues to be the primary area of concern for Lancaster despite the advances made by Jonathan Joseph during this championship, to the extent that Henry Slade and Sam Burgess have been under close scrutiny in camp this week. That pair are seen as World Cup contenders. Billy Twelvetrees appears to be running out of chances to prove his Test credentials at 12, Luther Burrell is striving to claim that position and Kyle Eastmond appears to have been tried and discarded. Lancaster has said Tuilagi will be considered at inside centre, if that is the position to fill, while he was even shunted out to the wing in New Zealand last June. Whatever the number on his back, England will surely pick him, but by now they would ideally have spent ample time fine-tuning their centre combination. Instead, if Tuilagi is eventually cleared for a comeback, there will be a maximum of three pre- tournament friendlies to reintegrate him before the main event comes around.

A domestic treble is a marathon rather than a sprint. Yet Celtic are closer to their promised land after routing the Arabs in Scottish football’s answer to the six-day war. By 5pm on Saturday, Dundee United were worn out. As punch drunk as a flabby heavyweight leaning against the ropes in the 14th round. Exhausted — mentally and physically — by three losses in a week to a side with more depth, energy and firepower. The Tayside team fancied their chances after holding on for a 1-1 Scottish Cup draw with nine men a fortnight ago. Then Celtic won the League Cup Final. And followed it with a thumping 4-0 victory in last Wednesday’s Scottish Cup replay. Jason Denayer celebrates with his team-mates after giving Celtic a three-goal lead before half-time . Denayer taps home from close range as Celtic record comfortable victory against Dundee United . Battered and bruised, United were gone then. Long before they found themselves three goals down in the first half of this league match. The heat, light and fury which bred six red cards, three penalties and running feuds in the previous meetings had gone. All told, Celtic and Dundee United met four times in two weeks. By the end, Jackie McNamara’s team were pleased the ordeal was over. The same might be said of the title race. In Saturday’s early game, Aberdeen shipped two points in Dundee. The Dens equaliser came from the grandson of former Parkhead chairman Jack McGinn. Proof, if it were needed, that this was Celtic’s week. ‘It’s been a great week,’ said defender Efe Ambrose. ‘We know that, but we don’ t want to look at what we’ve done. We want to look forwards and that means the next game. That’s more important than what we’ve already done. ‘Every game counts in the league and we want to keep going. From now until the end of the season, we want to keep doing our best, so we can defend our title and get to the Scottish Cup Final. Then we can see if the Treble is still possible.’ John Guidetti struck to make it 2-0 to Ronny Deila's side after 33 minutes at Celtic Park on Saturday . The Scottish Cup looks the last substantial hurdle. Inverness, an awkward opponent, await in the semi-final on April 19. Thereafter it is Hibs or Falkirk in the Final. ‘It’s an enjoyable place to be at the moment because everything is working well for us,’ said Ambrose. ‘I think, right now, it would take a lot of effort from another team to stop us. ‘Celtic are playing at a top level. It’s difficult for others to withstand what we have right now. Guidetti is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling the home side's lead . ‘We have a huge squad and everyone is in their best form. It’s difficult for the manager to pick his starting line-up. There’s a lot of competition in the squad and that makes us better.’ There was nothing boastful in the way the Nigerian said this. He was merely stating a bald truth. For the fourth meeting with United in a fortnight, Ronny Deila replaced his entire front four. Leigh Griffiths, Kris Commons, James Forrest and Anthony Stokes made way for John Guidetti, Stefan Johansen, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. Mackay-Steven and Armstrong were United’s star players until they were sold to Celtic for £2million in January. Gary Mackay-Steven opened the scoring against his former club to set up victory for Celtic . Once again, Tannadice chairman Stephen Thompson had cause to ponder if it was worth it when Mackay-Steven smashed a superb opening goal in 16 minutes, accepting a simple Ambrose pass and winding up for a swerving left-foot shot from fully 25 yards. As a former United player, his reluctance to celebrate was understandable. Why Guidetti did likewise after doubling the lead in 33 minutes with a looping, deflected shot into the top corner was harder to work out. By then, Celtic were playing a training game. A flat affair, given the ill feeling of the previous encounters, the home support could barely even bring themselves to boo Ryan McGowan. There was a brief flash of the old enmity when Paul Paton was lucky to escape a red card for a wild, scything tackle on Mackay-Steven on the stroke of half-time. If a yellow was a lenient punishment, Celtic added to the penalty by scoring a third when Virgil van Dijk thumped Johansen’s low free-kick towards goal before Jason Denayer intercepted and cheekily back heeled into the net for 3-0. Mackay-Steven (left) celebrates his goal with Stefan Johansen during the Scottish Premiership match . The Belgian has found a rich vein of form and, as with van Dijk, the Celtic support should enjoy him while they can. Dundee United came close just once, when substitute Ryan Dow had a dipping, long-range effort tipped over the bar by Craig Gordon. In truth, the visitors looked utterly demoralised by then. ‘I thought we were soft in the first half and we accepted things,’ said McNamara. ‘So I told them I was disappointed in that. I was a bit angry at half-time about belief and not just pride, but in terms of doing things and not feeling sorry for themselves. ‘In the second half, we did that. We rolled up our sleeves, though it could be argued that Celtic took their feet off the gas.’ They could afford to conserve their energies. Only three times in Celtic’s 127-year history have the club won a Treble and they are now tantalisingly close to a fourth. ‘I never allow myself to think about the Treble,’ parried Ambrose. ‘None of us do. ‘The most important thing for the team is to go game by game and that’s what the manager wants. We take it as it comes. ‘We don’t put anything in our heads. The important thing is to play hard and prepare. Everyone wants to beat Celtic. ‘It’s important that we’re calm and work to the tactics the manager wants us to play. ‘We need to have one spirit, one heart. We have good momentum right now and I think we have delivered what the manager expected. We’re almost there. ‘But we’re not there yet, so we have to keep pushing in training. Every time we play a game, he wants us to improve, so that’s a challenge he has given to us.’ A popular whipping Bhoy when things go wrong, it’s worth recording that Ambrose himself has improved of late. The Green Brigade sang his name on Saturday, prompting a wry chuckle from a player who seems a little safer at right-back than centre-half. ‘The Celtic supporters are the best in the world,’ said the defender, ‘I will give them credit for that. ‘Sometimes it’s unfair if I get criticism but that’s football. We’re a team, not individuals. ‘If a mistake happens, you just have to get on with it, work harder and make sure you correct the mistake.’ Of late, Deila’s Celtic have managed not only to correct their early season mistakes, but eradicate them. As the final mile of the marathon approaches, they are pacing themselves nicely.	Gary Mackay-Steven opened the scoring for Celtic after 16 minutes . John Guidetti doubled the hosts lead 12 minutes before half-time . Jason Denayer made it three for Ronny Deila's side on stroke of half-time .
The world's oldest person is set to celebrate her 117th birthday, but says that despite her age, her life has seemed rather short. Misao Okawa was born in Osaka, Japan, on March 5, 1898, was recognized as the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records in 2013. Mrs Okawa said she still does not know how she has lived for so long, but has previously credited her longevity to eight hours sleep, eating sushi, and doing squats until the age of 102. Scroll down for video . Long life: The world's oldest person, Japanese Misao Okawa, born on March 5, 1898, says she does not know how she has lived for so long . 'It seemed rather short,' she said after an Osaka government official asked how she felt about living for 117 years, adding that she is 'very happy' to be that age. Asked for the secret of her longevity, the great-grandmother responded nonchalantly, 'I wonder about that too.' During the celebrations of her 116th birthday last year, Mrs Okawa said: 'Eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax.' The head of Mrs Okawa's retirement home added that she 'eats three large meals a day, sleeps eight hours a night, and insists that her favourite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice.' The great-grandmother has slowed in recent months and has trouble hearing but she eats well and is in good health, the  Osaka care home said today. Japan's Misao Okawa, poses with her  son, grand children and great-grandchildren and Ward Mayor Takehiro Ogura, right,  at her nursing home in Osaka, western Japan . Despite saying today that she does now know why she has lived for 117 years, Mrs Okawa has previously credited her longevity to eight hours sleep, eating sushi, and doing squats until the age of 102 . She is also known to have made every attempt to stay active for as long as possible, and revealed in an interview 15 years ago, aged 102, that she does leg squats 'to keep her body in shape'. Mrs Okawa married her husband, Yukio, in 1919, and they had three children — two daughters and a son. The following things took place in 1898: . January 1: The City of Greater New York is created through the annexation of land. April 25: The starts of the Spanish-American War (ended August 12 after 3,5 months of fighting) July 7: The United States annexes the Hawaiian Islands. August 23: The Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica set sail from London. August 28: An American man named Caleb Bradham registers a soft drink - Pepsi-Cola. December 26: Marie Curie and her husband Pierre discovers radium. Mrs Okawa says that the happiest moments of her life were her wedding and the birth of her children – she still has a surviving son and daughter who are now 94 and 92. She now has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1931. Mrs Okawa, the daughter of a kimono maker, was recognized as the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records in 2013. Experts say it is no surprise that Mrs Okawa is Japanese. The nation has the most centenarians in the world, with more than 58,000, according to the government. About 87 percent of them are women. They say it is down to an excellent healthcare system, encouragement to stay active in old age and a healthy diet made up of fish, rice and fruit. The life expectancy for a Japanese woman is almost 86 years while the average for a Japanese man is 79.6 years.	Misao Okawa was born in Osaka, western Japan on March 5, 1898 . The 117-year-old claims not to know why she has lived so long . She has previously cited sleep, sushi and squats as key to long life .
Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was left smiling at the end of a difficult weekend by watching the club's new Major League Soccer franchise make a sparkling start to life at Yankee Stadium. The sight of Manuel Pellegrini's men crashing at Burnley on Saturday wouldn't have been easy for Al Mubarak to stomach as hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League title receded. But he was sporting the broadest of smiles after David Villa inspired NYCFC to see off the New England Revolution and ensure a perfect beginning to their temporary stint in the Bronx.

This terrifying clip shows the moment blood-red fluid began leaking along the walls of a bus - in a scene straight out of horror movie The Shining. As the oozing liquid drips down into a huge puddle on the bus floor, panicked passengers are heard repeatedly urging the driver to stop the vehicle and open the doors. The incident occurred on March 19 on a 99 B-line bus bound for the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Passengers on a Vancouver bus became panicked as a blood-red fluid began dripping down the walls of the vehicle in a scene reminiscent of cult horror movie The Shining . Luka Jason, who posted the video, joked the 'bus might need an exorcism'.  In two days, the 90-second clip has amassed almost 50,000 views. The caption adds: 'A little bit of panic ensued in this packed bus behind me as you can hear from all the voices.' One person is heard speculating the fluid may be hazardous, adding: 'What is that? It stinks.' Commenter EloynAmmillio believes the fluid is 'similar to anti-freeze that is part of the air conditioning system' that sits on top of the rear cab of the bus. 'Apparently a hose burst somewhere and let it all out of the radiator. It is toxic to get into the eyes and mouth and can be irritating to skin if allowed long exposure.' But according to bus company TransLink, it was a non-toxic and non-flammable leak of hydraulic fluid - although some types can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, and be toxic if swallowed. An iconic scene in The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick, shows a river of blood gushing out of an elevator . Bus company TransLink confirmed the leak was of non-toxic and non-flammable leak of hydraulic fluid . Chris Bryan, a spokesperson for the company, told Vancity Buzz: 'TransLink take all leaks very seriously. All incidents are promptly and thoroughly investigated. 'Once repairs are made, our vehicles are road tested prior being returned to service. At no time were passengers in any danger.' The cause of the leak is not known, but the vehicle resumed operation after a two-hour repair. Mr Bryan added the safe steering of the bus was not affected. 'We apologize to any of our passengers who may have been distressed by the incident,' he added. In 1980's The Shining, an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, a family heads to the isolated Overbrook Hotel, but an evil spirit sends the father - played by Jack Nicholson - on a violent rampage. The trailer for the movie consisted solely of the iconic shot of a rive of blood pouring out of an elevator.

A cancer nurse at a hospice drowned herself in a hot tub four days before she was due to face disciplinary proceedings, an inquest has heard. Jane Revell, 53, who worked part-time at Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, was found dead in a the jacuzzi in her back garden on December 18 last year. An inquest into her death  heard prior to her death she had been 'upset and worried' about appearing at a hearing to answer questions about the referral of a patient. Cancer nurse Jane Revell, 53, (pictured) drowned herself in a hot tub four days before she was due to face disciplinary proceedings, the inquest into her death heard . Mrs Revell worked part-time at Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, and had been due to  answer questions about the referral of a patient . The allegation was said to be 'of a minor nature' and not one which could lead to her dismissal, the hearing at Cannock Coroner's Court was told. The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's £270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub. She was fully clothed except for her shoes. Earlier in the day, the mother-of-two and school governor had written a suicide note which she had put in a Christmas card and left in the kitchen. She had also sent a text message to her daughter Hannah, telling her to go to a neighbour's house after school. The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's £270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub in the back garden . Before her death, Mrs Revell had sent a text to her daughter Hannah telling her to go to a neighbour's house, instead of the family home (pictured) 'When Hannah and the neighbour arrived at the house at around 5pm they found the front door unlocked and Mrs Revell's car in the drive,' Detective Constable Mark Bailey told the hearing. 'Mr Revell arrived home from work soon after and searched the garden before finding his wife's body in the hot tub. 'A farewell message was later found inside a Christmas card in the kitchen.' A post mortem examination revealed that she had drowned, and there was no trace of alcohol or drugs in her body. The inquest heard she was in good health and had no history of mental health problems. South Staffordshire Coroner Andy Haigh concluded Mrs Revell had committed suicide 'while stressed.' He said: 'She was a lady who was committed to her family, her community and her career. 'She did have some recent problems at work. 'These appear to have been of a minor nature, but with the benefit of hindsight they were not minor matters for Jane and are a major reason for her death. 'I fully accept that no-one in the family expected Jane to have done this, and I am very sorry that she should have done.' Speaking after the inquest, Dr Richard Soulsby, chief executive of Katharine House Hospice, paid tribute to Mrs Revell. 'Jane's contribution to the hospice over the last 12 years has been immeasurable and her death has been a huge shock to her friends, colleagues, and patients,' he said. 'She was a vibrant and greatly valued member of our team.'	Jane Revell, 53, found in the back garden of her home in Stafford . She was 'upset and worried' about a forthcoming disciplinary hearing .

Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown has picked his #one2eleven of stars he  played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports. It is little surprise the former Arsenal defender has chosen 11 players that once donned the red of the Gunners, but who makes his best line-up? Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown (centre) has chosen his best XI he ever played with in his career . GOALKEEPER: DAVID SEAMAN . David Seaman has to be my No 1 goalkeeper. I'd come from Everton with Neville Southall. You couldn't look at Neville because if you looked at him he'd blame you if the ball was in the back of the net. But David was the complete opposite. David had really sort of soft hands. He was able to take the sting out of a shot. We had a decent defence but it was nothing without David in goal. RIGHT BACK: LEE DIXON . If I'm having to pick one, it has to be Lee Dixon. He was sort of my eyes and ears. He was almost part of my own body. I never had to look to my right because Lee was telling me everything that was going on. Arsenal's Lee Dixon (left) and Tony Adams (centre) shout at Barcelona's Phillip Cocu after a penalty incident . DEFENDER: TONY ADAMS . First bumped into him at the age of 13. Cockney lad, swaggering into the room. I was a little bit of a country bumpkin. We kind of set up a partnership in the youth team. I knew him inside out. I knew his strengths, I knew his weaknesses. He has to get into that team. There's no doubt about it. DEFENDER: SOL CAMPBELL . He turned up at Arsenal around all that publicity and expectation. It was on a train that didn't get out of the station to start with. Wenger stuck with him. Eventually once that train got going, it was unstoppable. It was a real force. He's quick, strong, could see danger. Once he was focussed, he was as good as anyone. LEFT BACK: ASHLEY COLE . Straight away I could see that this kid was going to be a bit special. Ashley would park himself around the senior players. He would listen in, he was a very, very quick learner. A real winner. Just disappointed he had to leave Arsenal early. Gunners captain Patrick Vieira lifts the FA Cup after Arsenal beat Manchester United in the final in 2005 . RIGHT WING: ROBERT PIRES . Just on another planet. The goal that stands out was at Villa Park when he knocks it over Peter Schmeichel. He'd just embarrassed a top keeper. He was just capable of that. You've got to look at what you see in training behind the scenes, and Robert Pires had people applauding the stuff he was capable of. MIDFIELDER: PATRICK VIEIRA . He was the catalyst for all the success that was to come. Without Patrick there wouldn't have been any of these trophies. I can tell you that. He pretended he couldn't speak English at the start, then everyone was talking about him, and I think he grabbed someone by the throat in the dressing room. It showed he had some fight about him. As it unfolded I became his minder. I think people could see he could react a bit and we needed him on the pitch. Absolute top talent. Still to this day he's the same person that walked through the door that very first day at Arsenal. MIDFIELDER: EMMANUEL PETIT . It was a competition between him and Patrick Vieira who was going to be man of the match. Game after game. He was a warrior that could play with that finesse and gave us that buffer whenever we had to defend. Those two in front made our lives very easy. Vieira and Emmanuel Petit celebrate during their Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1999 . LEFT WING: MARC OVERMARS . You've got to ask Gary Neville how pleased was he to see him leave. He was so quick that it was almost as if someone had picked him up and put him there. You didn't see him travel. He put fear into teams. You could just see people backing off giving him space to play in. STRIKER: DENNIS BERGKAMP . His ability. The way he could bend balls around players. Pace as well. Once he got away from you in training - I was no slouch - and you wouldn't catch him. Slow start when he came. I think he was a little bit unsure of the situation he found himself in. Again we weren't really ready. To play with Dennis was a joy. I remember Ian Wright skipping down the marble halls at Highbury when he heard Dennis was coming, because he knew that meant goals. STRIKER: THIERRY HENRY . He had that sort of textbook finish. He was more basic in his finishing. His pace. His power. You've never seen anything like it. This was a top athlete without spikes, he had football boots instead. Unbelievable. I gave him a hard time when he came, as I did with all the strikers. He had that swagger as he does now even in front of the camera. He was turning to the rest of the team: 'You better be able to stick with me.' Whereas at the start we were demanding he came with us. Those two together was an absolute nightmare and I used to giggle when I'd see them in action because I had to train against them.

Bird said she had tried to discuss the situation with Clark County School District police. 'The school police told me because it was not on school campus and after hours, I needed to call the regular police. The regular police told me, 'You need to call the school police,'' she said. Eventually it got to the stage where Carla couldn't handle it anymore and she hung herself. Parents in similar situations need to contact every school administrator available advised Bird. 'You go as hard as you can, and at the same time let your kid know that this is not their fault,' she said. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with funeral expenses.

Brazilian zoo keepers were required to adopt a rare white lion cub after it was rejected by its mother from birth. The two-month-old female named Clara is the first white lion to be born in captivity in Brazil. After its mother left it to fend for itself, zoo keepers at Beto Carrero World were required to take over the reins. The two-month-old female named Clara is the first white lion to be born in captivity in Brazil . As shown in the video, Clara is fed a bottle containing goat’s milk and vitamins every few hours. And she has her own private section in which to relax in the country’s sunshine, away from the other animals. Zoo keepers plan to reintroduce Clara to the rest of her pack when she is six-months-old. Zoo keepers at Beto Carrero World have taken over the reins from the mother and are caring for the lion cub . Clara the two-month-old white lion is fed a bottle containing goat’s milk and vitamins every few hours . But for now, they are enjoying interacting with the animal with a series of toys including ropes and dog bones. Contrary to popular belief, white lions are not actually albino. Their colour is a result of a recessive trait derived from a less-severe mutation in the same gene that causes albinism. Zoo keepers are enjoying interacting with the animal with a series of toys including ropes and dog bones . Clara has her own private section in which to relax in the Brazilian sunshine away from the other animals . Unfortunately however, their lack of camouflage makes them easy prey for hunters in the wild and many white lions are held in captive in zoos and circuses. Clara’s parents themselves were brought to the Brazilian zoo from Pretoria, South Africa in 2011. Beto Carrero World is located in Penha, Santa Catarina, Brazil and is twinned with the biggest theme park in Latin America, which was opened in 1991.

A teenager who suffered amnesia and forgot her entire life regained her memory - after a hug from her little brother. Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago after suffering a rare but serious side effect from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine. Doctors had tried everything, but the devastated teenager was still not able to recognise her family, friends or understand who she was. Then one day at home, her brother Caleb, then six, walked into her room and gave her a cuddle. She claims at this point, her memories came flooding back. Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago and was unable to recognise her family, friends or understand who she was. Then one day, after a cuddle from her brother Caleb, now 7, her memories came flooding back . Miss Inman said: 'I had forgotten my entire life, which was absolutely devastating. I literally lost everything. 'Mum and dad would get very upset as I didn't recognise them and it was hard for them to deal with it. 'We had tried everything. I would look at family photographs and I knew it was me in them but I just couldn't remember anything about why I was there. 'It totally ruined me. I could not go back to school and I lost my family and friends and did not know who I was. It was dreadful. 'My brother and sister, who were six and eight at the time, didn't really understand. 'It sounds weird and is hard to explain but the first thing I remember was my little brother Caleb. 'Our bond is a really powerful thing and he just came in to my room and gave me a big hug. 'We have always had a close bond and a special relationship and somehow that moment just triggered everything coming back to me. 'After that hug all my family memories came back - every last one of them.' Miss Inman claims she developed severe amnesia nearly two years ago after suffering serious side effects from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine - after suffering severe headaches . Miss Inman had always suffered bad headaches but it was not until just before her 15th birthday that medical staff diagnosed her with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This meant she had abnormally high pressure inside her skull, which was causing excruciatingly painful headaches. She suffered the severe memory loss after doctors performed a lumbar puncture and found she had twice as much fluid in her spine than usual. Miss Inman, who lives in Plymouth, Devon with her parents Julie, 41, Daryl, 42, sister Ellie, nine and Caleb, now seven, said she was awake throughout the procedure. She said: 'It was like a switch was flicked and all my memories just disappeared. 'I didn't recognise my mum or my family. It was a weird feeling in my stomach as I felt like I knew them from somewhere but I couldn't think where. 'I immediately thought my mum must have been important as she did not leave my side through the whole ordeal. 'I thought she must be my mum but I didn't remember anything about her or anything that we had done together. 'It is a known side effect to the treatment. I have since heard that some people forget how to do their jobs and forget their families.' Chloe was sent home from hospital to try to re-jog her memories. But it was only the hug from her brother brought all her family memories back. She said: 'I was off school for two months. I didn't really understand what was going on - I just kept thinking "I don't remember you". 'But with my best friend it clicked immediately just by the way we started talking to each other. Miss Inman now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her 'entire school life . 'I had to fight the memory loss and now I remember nearly everything that I couldn't remember before and my life is slowly getting back together.' Despite this, her school work has suffered badly from the ordeal. 'I really struggled with school as I had to take so much time off and had to be taken out of all my lessons.' She now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her 'entire school life.' Miss Inman now studies performing arts at City College in Plymouth, Devon, and also volunteers at St John Ambulance. Her dream is to work as an Army medic. She said: 'It's quite scary looking back on it now. It did ruin my year and really my whole entire secondary school life. 'My pain was ignored for so many years. My consultant tested me for quite a lot of things and ran out of what to give me to help.' Chloe is now on a drug called acetazolamide to help reduce the fluid in her back -  and has fortunately not suffered from any headaches now for a year. She explained: 'My condition hasn't been properly diagnosed or treated yet because they don't really know what causes it. 'But they know that if it comes back to perform a lumbar puncture as a quick solution - but I'm terrified I could lose all my memory again.' She added: 'My condition is so powerful that it can kill people, either by it not being treated and too much pressure on the brain or people get fed up of being told it's just a headache that they lose faith and end up committing suicide. 'No-one really understands how painful it is.'	Chloe Inman, 16, suffered total memory loss nearly two years ago . Claims it occurred after a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine .

Southampton have jetted off to Switzerland for a break ahead of what James Ward-Prowse believes are the 10 biggest matches in the club's history. Saints' late, and somewhat fortuitous, victory against Crystal Palace on Tuesday evening got them back to winning way after their remarkable season started to go off kilter. The latest in a line of disjointed displays looked set to cost Ronald Koeman's men, only for Sadio Mane to strike late on to secure a 1-0 win which moved them back to within a point of the top-four. James Ward-Prowse (front) uploaded an image to Instagram of the Southampton team on the plane . Sadio Mane (centre) scores the decisive goal as Southampton beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Tuesday . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has taken the squad to Switzerland fora team break . It means Champions League qualification remains a realistic - and scarcely-believable - prospect for Saints, whose players flew to Switzerland on Wednesday for a break ahead of what Ward-Prowse knows is a crunch period. 'I think it will be great to just have a good time, the pressure of the Premier League is massive, especially where we are in the table,' the midfielder said. 'It's good to get away, put our feet up and have a bit of a laugh with the group. It should be a good bit of fun and then we'll move on from there . 'These next 10 games are probably the biggest in the club's history and we're determined as a group of players to make history for the club. 'We want to get us to the biggest stage in the world where we feel we belong with the best teams and best players in the world.' Next up for Southampton is the unenviable task of a trip to Chelsea on March 15 - a match Ward-Prowse will hope to be starting after his telling impact against Palace. The England Under 21 midfielder was brought on in a bid to inject some fresh impetus into Saints' toiling attack and had the desired impact, producing the shot which led to Mane clipping home. 'We reflected on the win in the changing room and we believe it's going to be a pivotal three points come the end of the season,' Ward-Prowse told Southampton's official YouTube channel . 'We haven't been on the best of runs lately and it's great to obviously get the three points and move forward. You could feel the whole stadium was pleased. 'It wasn't a pretty performance, not a vintage Southampton display, but we dug deep, the fans got behind us and I think we showed great character.' Southampton's displays have been inconsistent lately but Mane's goal keeps  their Champions League hopes . Ward-Prowse believes the final 10 league games of the season are the biggest in Southampton's history . While Ward-Prowse deserved credit for the run and shot that led to Mane's goal, it would not have got that far had Julian Speroni dealt with the initial attempt. The long-serving Palace goalkeeper could only parry Ward-Prowse's shot into the Senegal winger's path, but defender Scott Dann stood up for his team-mate after the costly mistake. 'You can't just point the finger at Jules,' he said. 'He has kept us in games at times this season and he will carry on making important saves for us. Scott Dann refused to criticise goalkeeper Julian Speroni for spilling the ball into the path of Mane for the goal . 'Jules said he should have done better but these things happen and we should have reacted better. 'He is a great goalkeeper and has done really well for us. He made a couple of good saves last night and made some good decisions coming out when they played balls through. 'These things happen but we'll stick together as a team.'	Southampton have 10 days off before their next game against Chelsea . They beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Tuesday to move a point off the top four . The squad are heading to Switzerland for a team break before the run-in .
Shocking new images have emerged showing the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young  men who jump on to and off speeding trains in Mexico in a desperate attempt to reach the United States. The majority of those attempting to hitch a ride on the trains are from Central American countries like Honduras and El Salvador who are willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to work illegally in menial jobs should they ever actually reach the U.S.. Referring to America as 'the promised land' the train hoppers that manage to make it on to a speeding locomotive are seen clinging on for dear life as they tear through the countryside of northern Mexico to the border they stand little to no chance of actually making it across. Shocking: The images show the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young men who jump on to and off speeding trains in Mexico in a desperate attempt to reach the United States . Making a jump: A man is seen either jumping or falling off of a speeding train as it passes through the Mexican countryside near Tabasc . Treatment: A seriously injured young man is taken to hospital by medical workers after a failed train jump near the city of Tabasco . Recovery: Raul Ordonez Martinez, 42, is seen recovering after having both legs amputated at the Municipal Hospital Emiliano Zapata. Raul had both legs amputated after he tried to jump on a moving train in Tenosique . Before the U.S.-bound trains appear on the horizon, the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern Mexico. Many of them have already travelled thousands of miles from countries deeper in South America - but their journey is far from finished. While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards. Instead they wait out in the Mexican countryside, where they are unlikely to have been spotted and make the death-defying leap on to trains speeding along the rails. While many somehow manage to make it on to the trains, others are unsurprisingly dragged beneath the 36-inch steel wheels and crushed to death. One of the biggest threats to the young men's lives is exhaustion. Having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open, when the time comes for them to make the all-important jump, their bodies fail them and they either fatally miscalculate the leap, or else suffer life-changing disabilities. Lucky: One of the biggest threats to the men's lives is exhaustion. Having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open, when the time comes for them to make the all-important jump they often miscalculate the distance . Rest: Before the U.S.-bound trains appear on the horizon, the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern Mexico. Many of them have already travelled thousands of miles from countries deeper in South America - but their journey is far from finished . Young Central American men are seen sitting on top of one of the trains as it speeds through the Mexican countryside near Tabasco . Risk: Referring to America as 'the promised land' the train hoppers that manage to make it on to a speeding locomotive are seen clinging on for dear life as they tear through the countryside of northern Mexico to the border they stand little to no chance of actually making it across . Wedged between cargo cars, perched on tanker tops, stuck in stuffy boxcars, with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems, they hop on, often in daylight, high noon even, because arresting impoverished migrants has not, historically, been a top priority in Mexico . Making the leap: While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards . Dozens of desperate young men die every year jumping on to U.S.-bound trains in Mexico. The majority have come from poverty-stricken countries such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and are aged in their late teens or early 20s. Another thing unites the men too - their all or nothing desire to start new lives in the United States where, as illegal immigrants, they are unlikely to find work other than as exploited, below-minimum-wage workers in restaurants, cleaning and maintenance businesses and on building sites. 'The trains are for the poorest of the poor,' says Carlos Miranda, a migration expert in the southern state of Chiapas. 'If they thought they had any other choice, they would take it.' Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique, a modest farming town south of the Yucatan - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks. If they are lucky, they will hang on long enough to make it to Mexico City, where they switch lines in the massive train yards, and then in dwindling numbers head out again, pushing north to the U.S. border, or as close as they can get. The risks are enormous: They must navigate a spidery network of aging rails — the trains themselves sometimes jump the tracks — through jungles and deserts and mountains, searing heat and icy rain. They face attacks by the bandits and gun-toting gangs that patrol the trains, and must hop off and on at immigration checkpoints, risking limb and life each time. The trip can take weeks, or months, if you allow for all the pitfalls and stopovers to earn a few pesos for food. Death-defying: Mexico tries to catch the train hoppers before they enter the country. But the southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all' Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique and Tabasco (pictured) - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks .

Forty million people live in Central America, and nearly half are poor. In Honduras, 46 per cent live in extreme poverty. In Guatemala, 130,000 lost their homes in Hurricane Stan. El Salvador is crippled by drought, and in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, the majority of the people have little or no work. This is why they come. Mexico tries to catch the train jumpers before they enter the country. But this southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all.' How many lose arms or legs along the way? Impossible to know - not everyone is counted. Wedged between cargo cars, perched on tanker tops, stuck in stuffy boxcars, with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems, they hop on, often in daylight, high noon even, because arresting impoverished migrants has not, historically, been a top priority in Mexico. Women and children are most vulnerable, to both the elements and to the men, and are usually the most difficult to spot. If they can, they wait for the trains to stop in the dusty yards then make a dash for it. You can find them hiding in the dark hollows of the hopper cars, the children wide-eyed, their mothers fingering the family Bible.

The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen’s resistance. Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously – and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling – Deila’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus. The Norwegian’s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon. Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead . But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star. Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players’ performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions. Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers. Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics . ‘I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,’ said Deila. ‘There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That’s really good. You don’t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way. ‘The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday . ‘We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.’ Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin. ‘I know everything about the players,’ he laughed. ‘When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us, sprinting. That is an incredible number. But at the weekend Gary Mackay-Steven ran 1300m! ‘You have to know the references of what it means to be fit. It’s easy to say that to the other players, if I tell them how far Gary Mackay-Steven ran in a game and compare it to them. Deila highlighted how impressive Palacio's running was against his side in the Europa League clash . ‘If a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing, I can show him the numbers. If he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m, what does he think of that? ‘Why can’t Gary run as far every game? Stuart Armstrong ran 900m on Sunday and he didn’t play the whole game.’ It was pointed out that Armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing Kris Commons against Aberdeen, before being hurt and making way for Anthony Stokes. Was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked? The winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the Bhoys six points clear . ‘It was cramp, he’ll be okay for (tonight’s game) against St Johnstone,’ said the Celtic manager. ‘It was a sign that he is not strong enough yet. You have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player. ‘Just coming to Celtic - dealing with the contract, the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in Gary and Stuart. ‘Then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before. The total loading gets too much. That’s why Stuart started on the bench. ‘But then Scott Brown is doing it every day. He is so strong, unbelievably strong. Why? Because he has done this for many years, he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself. Stefan Johansen is also starting to get that into his body.’ So is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams? Scott Brown has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic . ‘No, that’s not true,’ countered Deila. ‘But that’s the easiest thing to do something with. I don’t think the best teams are the fittest – they could be – but there are so many parameters, so many boxes you have to fill in football. ‘We don’t train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour-and-a-half every day. ‘As for the stats, we use them in different situations. It is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively. Instead of saying something subjectively, you can see it as a fact. Stuart Armstrong is also a willing runner for Celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club . ‘But everything has to be related to football. We are not marathon runners. It is about what we do on the pitch.’ What Celtic have done on Scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches. Making it 11 against St Johnstone at Parkhead will push them nine points clear of Aberdeen. Complacency might be the creeping danger, but Deila doesn’t detect any traces of that corrosive commodity. ‘There is still so much to fight for,’ he insisted. ‘We are working here on the culture, every day, to be 100 per cent every day. ‘I have no reason to be worried because I haven’t once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration. I am really looking forward to the game and I expect a good performance and hopefully a good result.’	Ronny Delia's side are formidable in the Scottish Premier League .

Julie Andrews has revealed how the spectacular hilltop opening scene of the Sound of Music took a week to shoot because it was filmed with a helicopter before filmmakers had drones at their disposal. The famous scene sees the actress throw herself into a full-bodied twirl with her arms outstretched and sing the film’s opening words: ‘The hills are alive...’ And as part of a 50th anniversary special, Diane Sawyer and her film crew recreated the famous scene, but with a drone - it took them about four takes in just half an hour. Julie Andrew revealed that it took a week to shoot the famous scene where she throws herself into a full-bodied twirl with her arms outstretched and singing the film’s opening words: ‘The hills are alive...’ Diane Sawyer and her film crew recreated the scene with a drone in Germany (pictured) The drone flew over the top of the trees and captured Sawyer as she span around. It took her film crew about four takes in just half an hour . The 79-year-old told Diane Sawyer in the upcoming '20/20' special that although the shot looked perfect it required a great deal of effort . Although the film was set in Austria, the filming of the movie’s title song was carried out in Mehlweg in southern Bavaria. The 79-year-old actress told ABC's Diane Sawyer in the upcoming  '20/20' special that although the shot looked perfect it required a great deal of effort. 'This giant helicopter came at me sideways with a very brave cameraman hanging out the side of … where the door would be normally … the helicopter would shoot me, and I'd come from one end of the field and he'd come from the other,' Andrews recalled. 'I'd make the big turn, and then he'd go around me to go back and start again, and I'd run to the other end.

'This giant helicopter came at me sideways with a very brave cameraman hanging out the side of … where the door would be normally … the helicopter would shoot me, and I'd come from one end of the field and he'd come from the other,' Andrews recalled .

Julie Andrews filming as Maria in The Sound Of Music which opened 50 years ago and quickly became the most popular film on the planet . 'But every time he went around me, the downdraft from the jets would fling me down into the grass.' Andrews, who was signed to play Maria for a fee of $225,000 (£150,000), without any share of the profits, had to have her hair and clothes  refreshed after each of the nine takes it took to get the scene completed. In his book ‘The Sound of Music Story’ Tom Santopietro details how having been knocked down on half of the ten takes, even the placid actress ‘finally got so angry I yelled, “That’s enough!”’ But she couldn’t be heard over the sound of the helicopter, and the pilot interpreted his star’s hand signals as a thumbs-up gesture of, ‘You’re doing great – let’s go for one more.’ Andrews, who was 28 during the filming, told Sawyer said that the brook, which was actually plastic filled with water, was also brought in by the movie studio and the birch trees were also brought in. In his book Santopietro writes how helicopter rentals were very expensive, and the budget was so slim on the film that With only the first half of the number requiring the use of the helicopter, as soon as the shot was captured, the pilot would instantly fly to Obersalzberg for the filming of the movie’s finale: the von Trapp family’s escape over the Alps into Switzerland. There was no money for even one more day’s helicopter rental. The story – based on fact – of Maria von Trapp, an Austrian nun turned governess who married into a musical family and defied the Nazis, inspired devotion and ardent fervour. On every continent where it played it set one box office record after another. It ranks as the fifth highest-grossing film of all time (when gross is adjusted for inflation) and is, arguably, the most beloved film ever.

Following this week's results in the Premier League it is looking increasingly likely that all three teams promoted last summer will be heading straight back down to the Championship. Leicester, Burnley and QPR find occupy the bottom three places in the top flight with just 10 games to play and although there are other teams in sight, form is a big concern for all three. If the trio are all relegated it will be the first time that no promoted team has survived in 17 years, and only the second season none have stayed up in since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Burnley's Danny Ings reacts as his side slip to a 2-0 defeat at Anfield on Wednesday night . Leicester goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer can't prevent James Milner scoring Manchester City's second goal . Olivier Giroud celebrates Arsenal's opener as the inquest begins in the QPR backline . Barnsley went straight back down in 1998 but they did famously beat Liverpool at Anfield (above) In 1997-98 it was Barnsley, Bolton and Crystal Palace who could not cope with the step up but - despite the adage that the gulf between the top flight and the Football League is huge - promoted sides have fared well in recent seasons. Twice - in 2011-12 and 2001-02 - all three promoted teams have avoided the drop, while only five of the last 18 promoted sides have been relegated. In fact, promoted teams have a 58.2 per cent instant survival rate, with only 27 of the 68 teams to have been promoted to the top flight being sent straight back down. That recent record will significantly worsen though come May unless Leicester, Burnley and QPR can all find form fast. *four teams relegated . **two teams promoted .

Unhappy: School headteacher Dan Philpotts has criticised the sweet shop for opening at 7.30am . A headmaster today criticised a sweet shop which opens at 7.30am on weekdays - because it is leaving his pupils ‘hyperactive’ in class. Parents have been asked to stop their children visiting the shop in Radcliffe-on-Trent on the way to school after it emerged some students were spending their dinner money on sweets. South Nottinghamshire Academy principal Dan Philpotts, 40, hit out after the Sweet Cottage opened 1,300ft (400m) from the school gates less than two weeks ago on February 28. The married father-of-two said the shop - which opens from 7.30am to 4.30pm on Monday to Friday - is causing some pupils to become ‘disruptive’ because they are high on sugar. Mr Philpotts added: ‘This has escalated out of control. It’s crazy. I am just looking out for what is best for our pupils. There hasn’t been one specific incident that sparked this. ‘But students have been coming in late, and just generally becoming hyperactive and causing disruption. The shop is not prepared to acknowledge the effect it is having.’ The headmaster, a former Wolverhampton Wanderers youth footballer, insisted that he wanted to continue working with the shop, but it would carry on opening at 7.30am each day. He continued: ‘We are asking parents to speak with their children about being sensible with their sugar intake and how they spend their dinner money. Opening hours: The shop is said to be causing pupils to become ‘disruptive’ because they are high on sugar . Letter: Mr Philpotts wrote to parents of South Nottinghamshire Academy pupils to warn them about the shop . ‘We will continue to inform and work with parents to avoid any unnecessary disruption during school hours which impacts on pupils’ behaviours and learning.’ Since the shop opened, teachers have reported pupils coming in with stained mouths and hands from the sweets they were buying and then eating. But the owner of the Sweet Cottage hit back, saying children have always taken sweets to school. He said: ‘When I was a kid I always took a bag of sweets to school. The headteacher was not invited to come to the shop, he came of his own accord and he upset customers. Local shop: The Sweet Cottage (in red) opened just 1,300ft from the school (in blue) less than two weeks ago . 'Working with parents': The school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and has been rated 'good' by Ofsted . ‘It is just a coincidence that we open at 7.30am. We are not trying to entice schoolchildren in - and we will be opening at the same time during school holidays.’ In his letter to parents, which was sent out last Friday, Mr Philpotts urged parents to back the school’s unofficial boycott. It stated: ‘It is important to note that, as an academy, and in our role in loco parentis to your children, we do not object to sweets per se. ‘But we do object to students filling up on sweets before the school day has even started.’ The school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was rated ‘good’ by watchdog Ofsted in its last inspection two years ago.

(CNN)There were screams. Then the sounds of a commercial jetliner slamming into the mountainside. And finally silence. Deathly silence. That much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on Germanwings Flight 9525. Beyond that, it's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the Alps. None of them can speak for themselves, nor can any of the flight's six crew members. But authorities have given some clues, based on what investigators know about the aircraft's trajectory and what they've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site. It all began on what seemed like most any other Tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the Germanwings plane in Barcelona, Spain. The passengers came from all walks of life, using Lufthansa's low-cost carrier to get to Dusseldorf, Germany. They were high school students, heading home after a week in Spain. They were parents and children enjoying their vacation. There were businessmen, scouting out store locations. There was a 26-minute delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers didn't give the OK to start the plane's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation, according to Lufthansa. For any frequent flier, that kind of delay is nothing abnormal. Nor, it seems, was takeoff. The Airbus A320 left and headed northeast at 10:01 a.m. (5:01 a.m. ET) on what should have been a 726-mile journey. The plane leveled off at 38,000 feet, its cruising altitude. By this point, passengers would be OK to unbuckle, head to the restroom or get their bags out of the overhead bin. A seemingly innocuous act changed everything: The aircraft's pilot had to use the restroom, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr, telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out. It's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin, going to or from the restroom. They also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half-hour into a nearly two-hour flight, with the Alps ahead of them. The passengers couldn't have known it, but the co-pilot -- identified as 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz --"manipulated the buttons of the flight monitoring system to activate the descent of the aircraft" while the pilot was out, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Thursday. This was around 10:45 a.m. It wasn't like the plane suddenly jerked down, plunging straight into the ground. Authorities described a steady descent at a rate of about 3,000 to 3,500 feet (or roughly 1,000 meters) per minute. Still, it is the kind of descent you'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the Alps. If passengers didn't notice that fall, they might have caught wind of what was happening at the front of the plane. Students, singers among the victims . Inside the cockpit, the only sound was that of Lubitz breathing steadily. But outside the cockpit, the noises apparently grew louder and more frantic. The pilot tried to open the door but couldn't get in. He likely knocked on the door. He used a video conference system to talk to the co-pilot, Robin said. None of it worked. Nor did his last-ditch attempt, as recounted by a senior French military official involved in the crash investigation to The New York Times. "You can hear he is trying to smash the door down," the official said. Did the passengers hear this commotion upfront? It's hard to imagine they didn't. And if that wasn't reason enough to cause worry, they just had to look outside -- at the mountain chain that should have been far below them instead of getting closer and closer and closer. The voice recorder didn't indicate any abnormal noise in the cabin until the final few moments. Still, even if the passengers didn't know it at the time, all it took was eight minutes for a seemingly normal flight to become a nightmare. The nightmare ended in a violent crash into rugged, remote terrain. So did the screams and the lives of all 150 people on Flight 9525 -- a death that Robin described as "instantaneous." Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz?	Germanwings Flight 9525 had a slight delay before taking off from Barcelona, Spain . After leveling off at 38,000 feet, the plane descended steadily before hitting the Alps . Screams were heard in plane's cabin in minutes before crash, according to audio recording .
Her turn as a cold character in Four Weddings And A Funeral and a villain in Only God Forgives made her a household name - and one of the world's most in-demand actresses. But, at 54, Kristin Scott Thomas says she's fed up of playing these 'cold' characters and is now swapping the cinema for the stage. Speaking to the Radio Times, the acclaimed actress said: 'I got fed up with being asked to do the same thing, playing cold, wicked bitches'. Kristin Scott Thomas, who has made the move from the silver screen to the stage, says she got fed up with being asked to play cold, wicked women . The mother-of-three added: 'I felt like the camera was stealing bits of me and the end product was a mosaic, just snippets. If I cried on film, they weren't my tears.' The British-French actress is now vowing to make theatre her priority and she's kicking things off in May by portraying the Queen in The Audience. She takes over the reins from Dame Helen Mirren in Peter Morgan's show, which tells the tale of the royal's weekly meetings with various prime ministers. Indeed, Kristin and Helen now have more in common than just a shared role; Kristin was  named a Dame in the New Year's Honours List, alongside Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith. Speaking to the Radio Times, the acclaimed actress said: 'I got fed up with being asked to do the same thing, playing cold, wicked bitches' One of her most celebrated roles was in Four Weddings and a Funeral alongside Simon Callow, Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah and Hugh Grant . In the past, the star has said that she considers herself to be more French than English after moving to Paris to become an actress at the age of 19 and bringing up her three children there. The actress is nonetheless diverting her attention back to her British roots for the foreseeable future after announcing that she had quit films in 2014 and taking on a string of West End roles. Speaking to The Guardian about her latest career move last year, she said: 'I just suddenly thought, I cannot cope with another film. 'I realised I've done the things I know how to do so many times in different languages, and I just suddenly thought, I can't do it any more. I'm bored by it. So I'm stopping.' At 54, the brunette discussed her place in the industry and the brick wall she's facing as a 'woman in her fifties.' 'I'm sort of, as the French would say, "stuck between two chairs",' she continued. 'Because I'm no longer 40 and sort of a seductress, and I'm not yet a granny.'

England’s fledgling wine industry is threatened by a group of devastating plant diseases discovered in the country for the first time. Experts at the Royal Horticultural Society in recent months have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops. The diseases, spotted on vines at RHS gardens in Wisley, Surrey, and the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale. Kent, have damaged vineyards in wine-growing countries around the world. Outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields, delayed fruit ripening and overly-acidic grapes. The only way to properly deal with the problem is to pull up the plants, experts say. Experts at the Royal Horticultural Society  have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops (file picture) The warning comes after wine producers announced this week that they are to apply for the name ‘Sussex wine’ to be given protected ‘designation of origin’ status, putting it in the same league as Champagne and Bordeaux. The reputation of English wine has grown immeasurably in recent years, particularly in warm and sunny Sussex, which has similar soil and climate to the Champagne region of France. Sales of sparking English wine are expected to hit £100million in 2015, following a boom in the number of vineyards in recent years. In 2014 alone 46 wine producers opened in southern England, a 50 per cent year-on-year increase in new firms. Vines are also becoming a popular plant in back gardens, with many homeowners trailing one over a trellis or up the inside of a conservatory. Dr Gerard Clover, head of plant health at the RHS, said there is no sign the viruses have yet made it into commercial vineyards, but warned producers to be wary of the disease. Writing in the trade journal the Grape Press, due to be published next month, he said: ‘The discovery of four grapevine viruses not previously reported in the UK during an in initial survey suggests there is no room for complacency. ‘These viruses have the potential to spread and cause damage to the UK’s developing grapevine industry.’ The four viruses cause different problems to plants, including leafroll disease, stem pitting, and fleck disease. Outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields, delayed fruit ripening and overly-acidic grapes (file picture) They are thought to have come to our shores on imports of infected plants, but can also be spread by mealybugs and scale insects. Dr Clover urged commercial vineyards to be aware of the risk and to only use plants that are certified as being virus-free. Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, he said: ‘We found four of these viruses in Wisley and one at Brogdale. But we found them because we knew what we were looking for. ‘The symptoms could easily be mistaken for something else - nutrient deficiencies for example, or other problems. ‘We visited two commercial sites in Suffolk and Surrey and found no signs of the viruses at either.’ But he said that until now there has been limited monitoring for viruses in British vineyards, so the diseases are likely to be i8n other sites as well. He added: ‘It is reasonable to suggest that they could have spread further, but it is impossible to say how far. ‘Luckily we have caught this early so we have opportunity to do something about it.’	RHS identify four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops .

A female sports reporter has hit back at two radio show hosts over a sexist Twitter exchange in which they referred to her  'giant boobs'. Comcast Sports Network's Aiyana Cristal said she had been cyberbullied by  WSCR-AM 670 hosts Dan Bernstein and  Matt Spiegel adding: 'sexual harassment is never acceptable'. Writing on her own Twitter page she described the comments as 'ignorant' and said the incident served as a 'gross reminder that women fight every day to be treated equally'. Reporter Aiyana Cristal, who covers the Chicago Bulls for Comcast Sports Network, has hit back at two radio hosts over a sexist twitter exchange in which they referred to her 'giant boobs' Criticism: Matt Spiegel and Dan Bernstein were involved in the exchange which referenced Cristal's breasts . She said: 'Progress has been made for women in sports but we still have a long way to go'.

(CNN)German investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz this week, according to published reports. Die Welt, a German newspaper, cited an unidentified senior investigator who said Lubitz suffered from a severe "psychosomatic illness" and German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a "severe subjective burnout syndrome" and from severe depression, the source told Die Welt. The New York Times also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. CNN has not been able to confirm the reports. Investigators continued to work Saturday to piece together the secret life of Lubitz, who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers. He had been declared "unfit to work" by a doctor. They were expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on Tuesday. As their efforts continued, dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains. There were 150 people on board Germanwings Flight 9525, including Lubitz. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been "slashed." Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent New York Times report on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. According to those unnamed officials, Lubitz also was being treated for psychological issues. Other media reports indicate he was treated for depression. Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health, and that if Lubitz had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests. "We can't believe it. If anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known," the official says. The Lufthansa official also said the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own  he would have been required to self-report if he had been deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, "concerning a diagnosis." But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents' home in the town of Montabaur. But the fact that investigators found "ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment," prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. Dusseldorf police said Saturday that a small team of French investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, told French TV from Dusseldorf that the French team would work in "full transparency" with their German counterparts. "We will interview people related to the investigation in the coming days. The hearings will be conducted in the coming days and weeks," he said, according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness, he replied: "The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today." No scenario can yet be ruled out, including mechanical failure, "as we do not have the necessary evidence," he said. The German tabloid newspaper Bild said Saturday it had interviewed an ex-girlfriend of Lubitz. The woman is not named in the story and CNN has not been able to verify the report independently. According to Bild, the ex-girlfriend said Lubitz was a very nice and sensitive man who needed a lot of care and attention, and he was very troubled. She said he would get into fights with her. The newspaper also cited the ex-girlfriend as saying that Lubitz had bad dreams that his plane was going down. Patrick Sondenheimer was the pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, according to Reiner Sondenheimer of Dusseldorf, Germany, who says he is a relative of Patrick's. Patrick Sondenheimer is the pilot believed to have been locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot, Lubitz. CNN spoke to Reiner Sondenheimer at his Dusseldorf apartment. Also at the apartment was a woman who did not provide her name but said she was Patrick Sodenheimer's relative. That woman also said that Patrick Sondenheimer was on the doomed flight. Reiner Sondenheimer declined to say anything else, other than the family wanted time to grieve. The pilot has not been named by German authorities. Another Germanwings pilot who once flew with Lubitz, Frank Woiton, told WDR, a local broadcaster belonging to CNN's German affiliate ARD, that his impression of Lubitz was that he was "friendly" and that there was "nothing suspicious." Woiton also said Lubitz "was a good pilot and had a good command of the plane." Woiton's first job after he found out about the crash was the route Dusseldorf-Barcelona-Dusseldorf -- the same route as had been taken by Germanwings Flight 9525 a day earlier. He was praised in German media for the emotional announcement he made to passengers before takeoff, in which he said the crew, like everyone else on the plane, wanted to get home safely to their families. At the scene of the crash, two helicopters were being deployed above the mountainside by recovery crews Saturday. The weather has improved after high winds Friday made their complex task even more treacherous. Lt. Col. Xavier Vialenc, a spokesman for the Gendarmerie, told CNN there were about 40 officers at the crash site Saturday. Once at the crash site, recovery workers spend all day working there, he said. Back in Seyne-les-Alpes at the end of the day, they can see a psychologist if they choose and have a debriefing session with all the workers. Vialenc said the operations were going well so far and that the progress made was meeting their expectations. Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN on Friday that rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remains the focus of investigators in Germany. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Spohr also told reporters that Lubitz had "interrupted" his pilot training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr didn't give a reason for the break. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Lubitz was the co-pilot on Tuesday's flight between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Most were from Germany and Spain. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims . CNN's Pam Brown, Frederik Pleitgen, Mary Kay Mallonee, Michael Pearson, Nic Robertson, Margot Haddad, Stephanie Halasz, Sandrine Amiel, David Fitzpatrick, Felix Gussone, Karl Penhaul and Anna Maja Rappard contributed to this report.

South Korea's president visited injured U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert on Monday amid an outpouring of public sympathy and support for the envoy who is recovering from an attack by a knife-wielding man. Lippert has been hospitalized since Thursday at Seoul's Severance Hospital, where President Park Geun-hye also received treatment in 2006 when she was knifed by a man with a box cutter during an election rally. Park was then an opposition party leader. Scroll down for video . South Korea's president President Park Geun-hye visited injured U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert on Monday amid an outpouring of public sympathy and support for the envoy who is recovering from an attack by a knife-wielding man . Hospital officials said they expect to release Lippert on Tuesday as he recovers from his injuries . Lippert has been hospitalized since Thursday at Seoul's Severance Hospital, where President Park Geun-hye also received treatment in 2006 when she was knifed by a man with a box cutter during an election rally . Park's office said the president went to the hospital shortly after she returned to South Korea on Monday from a Middle East tour. Park was quoted as saying 'my heart is aching more' because Lippert is hospitalized at the same hospital due to a similar attack. Lippert told Park that he and his wife have been moved by the support the South Korea government and people have showed to him, according to a statement from the presidential Blue House. Conservative activists and Christians have wished Lippert a quick recovery, held pro-U.S. rallies and conducted dance performances near the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. High-level government officials and politicians have visited him, and one well-wishing man even tried to offer dog meat to him. Hospital officials said they expect to release Lippert on Tuesday. 'He has strongly expressed his desire to go back to work,' said Yoon Do-heum, general director of Severance Hospital said. The alleged attacker, known as an anti-U.S. activist who was previously convicted of hurling a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador in Seoul in 2010, was arrested Friday.

High-level government officials and politicians have visited him, and one well-wishing man even tried to offer dog meat to him . Kim Ki-jong could face charges including attempted murder. Police said the exact motive for Kim's action was not known but he shouted after the attack that he opposes the ongoing U.S.-South Korea military drills that Pyongyang condemns as a preparation for a northward invasion. Police said Monday that some of the books, computer disks and other materials found at his home support rival North Korea, which could result in charges of violating an anti-Pyongyang security law. Critics want the law abolished, saying past authoritarian rulers have used it to suppress their political opponents. The two Koreas have shared the world's most heavily fortified border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. The U.S., which fought alongside South Korea during the war, stations about 28,500 troops in the South as a deterrent against the North.

West Ham are ready to rise to the challenge of facing a Sunderland side managed for the first time by Dick Advocaat, according to defender Aaron Cresswell. The Black Cats travel to Upton Park on Saturday evening just one point and one place outside of the Premier League relegation zone, having sacked Gus Poyet after last weekend's 4-0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Advocaat has been appointed until the end of the season with the aim of keeping the club in the top flight, and Cresswell - a Premier League ever-present for West Ham so far this campaign - knows the game takes on extra significance following the Dutchman's appointment. Aaron Cresswell (right) says West Ham are ready to face Sunderland on Saturday evening . Cresswell admits it will be tough facing a team who have just appointed a new manager . 'What was already set to be a tough but exciting game has that bit more to it now Sunderland have brought a new manager in,' he told West Ham's official website. 'I don't know too much about Dick Advocaat but he's certainly got a lot of experience and we're expecting a difficult match. Every game in the Premier League is a challenge and we will have to rise to it. 'When a new manager comes in it gives everyone at the club a lift and the players will want to impress the new manager. 'The first game under a new manager seems to favour the team with the new manager and I certainly think that was the case when we played West Bromwich Albion on New Year's Day just after Tony Pulis had taken over.' Dick Advocaat has taken over at Sunderland until the end of the season . Advocaat takes charge of the Black Cats for the first time away at West Ham on Saturday evening . Although Advocaat will want a positive result in his first game in charge, the fixture is also crucial to West Ham and their manager Sam Allardyce. Following an impressive start, Allardyce has seen his side fall away from the pack chasing European qualification with the Hammers having won just one of their last 12 league games. In that spell they have come up against Liverpool, Manchester United, Southampton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea but, of their final nine league outings, only two come against sides in the top half. 'We've had a tough run of fixtures recently and while no game is easy in the Premier League, some are harder than others,' Cresswell added. 'Having played all the top clubs in the last two months, we know that we have a fair few winnable games in our last nine games so I firmly believe we can finish strongly. 'We haven't had the results that we feel our performances deserve so we need to work that bit harder to make sure we get what our performances merit. No one at the club wants the season to fade away and we want to finish as high as we can.'	West Ham host Sunderland at Upton Park on Saturday evening .

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reacted angrily to a UN report that stated the government's asylum-seeker policy breaches the UN torture convention by saying that 'Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations'. Mr Abbott was furious that the UN did not acknowledge his government for stopping the boats, and questioned the international organisation's credibility. The report by UN special rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez focused on the offshore detention on Manus Island of asylum-seekers by Australian authorities. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a combative mood in Perth on Monday. He was annoyed by a UN report that stated the government's asylum-seeker policy breaches the UN torture convention . It found that the conditions breached Australia's obligations under the Convention against Torture. However, Mr Abbott said that the report failed to congratulate the government for avoiding asylum-seeker deaths at sea, and that the report missed the point. 'I really think Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations,' he told reporters in Perth. Mr Abbott (centre) was on a visit to Houghton Wines' Swan Valley vineyard in Perth on Monday when he responded to the comments made in the UN report criticising his government's policy . On Sunday Mr Abbott visited Davidson Rural Fire Brigade in Sydney where he received his ten year RFS service medal. But he was in a much less jovial mood after the UN report was revealed . 'Particularly given that we have stopped the boats and by stopping the boats we have ended the deaths at sea.' He felt that the UN would be 'much better served' by recognising the government's successes. 'UN representatives would have a lot more credibility if they were to give some credit to the Australian government for what we have been able to achieve in this area,' he said. The Australian Prime Minister (centre) felt that the UN would be 'much better served' by focusing on his government's successes . Stopping the boats was the most humanitarian, decent and compassionate way to deal with the issue, he emphasised. Mr Abbott said conditions on Manus Island were reasonable with basic needs like food, clothing, shelter and safety being met. Mr Abbott said he was also 'sick of being lectured to by the United Nations'	Damning UN report criticises the government's asylum-seeker policy .

A woman who appeared on NBC's weight-loss competition 'The Biggest Loser' has reportedly penned an expose on the hit reality show program. Kai Hibbard worked on her book 'Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win' with Deborah Baer, according to the New York Daily News. Hibbard's book will reportedly detail what happens behind the scenes of 'The Biggest Loser,' which has aired for 16 seasons. Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season. Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right) has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.' Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season . A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it. Her proposal was so juicy. It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.' According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off. The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct. I hope more than a "tell all" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.' Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, "You’re going die before your children grow up." "You’re going to die, just like your mother." "We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised. The consistent "Biggest Loser" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.'

Marca also claim that Barcelona right back Dani Alves will sign a contract with PSG as he prepares to leave on a free transfer this summer and has started looking for a property in the French capital. Italian papers Corriere dello Sport and La Gazzetta dello Sport lead with the injury farce surrounding Claudio Marchisio and the insuing row between Antonio Conte and former club Juventus . News of a row erupting between national head coach Antonio Conte and his former club Juventus over the injury to Claudio Marchisio dominates the front pages in Italy on Saturday. Italy medics revealed the midfielder damaged his cruciate knee ligament while on international duty and was facing up to six-eight months out. But after returning to Juve for further tests it emerged the injury was not as serious as first feared leading to questions over how Italy got it so wrong. Juventus power-broker John Elkann was furious with former manager Conte asking: 'Why do they work so hard in the Nazionale?' Conte responded by insisting Elkann never complained when he was in charge at the Turin-based club.	Luis Enrique wants to sign Koke from Atletico Madrid in the summer .

When applying for a job as a litter picker, a 'head for heights' is not usually required. But for these abseiling cleaners collecting rubbish thrown down the cliff of a Chinese mountain, it's a necessity. The 'spider men' abseil from the side of the 4,500ft cliff edge of Tianmen Mountain, risking their lives to pick up litter thrown away by visitors, according to The People's Daily Online . A cleaner abseils down the side of Tianmen Mountain to collect rubbish thrown over the cliff edge by tourists . Easy does it: The painstaking process is necessary because tourists chuck food packets, empty bottles and cans down the cliffside, defacing its natural beauty . A worker throws a sack tied on a long rope onto the cliff before abseiling to clean the side of the mountain, located in the central Chinese province of Hunan . After finishing cleaning a section, a litter picker pulls himself back over the boundary fence onto the path. The beauty spot is popular with tourists looking to ride the cable cars and visit the temple at the summit . Despite repeated calls by the Chinese Tourism Administration urging tourists not to throw their rubbish over the cliff edge, they continue to chuck empty food packets, bottles and cans into the mountain, as well as spitting and defacing the mountain. The beauty spot, located in Zhangjiajie in central China's Hunan province, is popular with tourists looking to ride the cable car route, reportedly the longest in the world. There is also a large temple on the summit, dating back to the Tang Dynasty which ruled the region for two periods between 610-690 and 705-907. A similar cleaning operation is in place takes place on Mount Emei in Sichuan province, China, where cleaner Peng Wencai has spent 14 years descending down the mountain to collect trash thrown away by tourists.

Rings of gas and dust are known to encircle Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Scientists recently discovered a fifth member of this haloed group known as Chariklo, which is one of a class of minor 'centaur' planets. Now astronomers have detected a possible ring system around a second centaur, Chiron, suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought. Scientists have detected a possible Saturn-like ring system (pictured) around a minor, Chiron, suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought . Like their mythological counterparts, centaurs are hybrids, embodying traits of both asteroids and comets. Today, scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system, concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of Jupiter and Pluto. Chiron, discovered in 1977, was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur, after the mythological Greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast. To discover the rings, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology observed the dimming of a star as Chiron passed in front of it, briefly blocking the light. By looking at how much and when the light was blocked, scientists say the centaur may possess a circulating disk of debris. 'It's interesting, because Chiron is a centaur - part of that middle section of the solar system, between Jupiter and Pluto, where we originally weren't thinking things would be active, but it's turning out things are quite active,' says Amanda Bosh, a lecturer in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. It follows the discovery of rings around a giant asteroid called Chariklo last year. 'I try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object, small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space, and stare up at a 20 kilometer wide ring system 1,000 times closer than the moon,' said Uffe Gråe Jørgensen of the University of Copenhagen of the Chariklo study. Chiron, discovered in 1977, was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur, after the mythological Greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast. Like their mythological counterparts, centaurs are hybrids, embodying traits of both asteroids and comets. Today, scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system, concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of Jupiter and Pluto. While most centaurs are thought to be dormant, scientists have seen glimmers of activity from Chiron. Chiron was discovered in 1977 by Charles Kowal recovery images have been found as far back as 1895, it was the first-known member of a class of objects now known as centaurs, with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus . Starting in the late 1980s, astronomers observed patterns of brightening from the centaur, as well as activity similar to that of a streaking comet. In 2010, MIT started to chart the orbits of Chiron and nearby stars in order to pinpoint exactly when the centaur might pass across a star bright enough to detect. 'There's an aspect of serendipity to these observations,' Professor Bosh says. 'We need a certain amount of luck, waiting for Chiron to pass in front of a star that is bright enough. Chiron itself is small enough that the event is very short; if you blink, you might miss it.' In light of these new observations, the researchers say that Chiron may still possess symmetrical jets of gas and dust. But other interpretations may be equally valid, including the 'intriguing possibility,' Professor Bosh says, of a shell or ring of gas and dust. Pictured are the positions of known outer solar system objects. The centaurs are those objects (in green) that lie generally inwards of the Kuiper belt (in blue) Ruprecht, who is a researcher at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, says it is possible to imagine a scenario in which centaurs may form rings. For example, when a body breaks up, the resulting debris can be captured gravitationally around another body, such as Chiron. Rings can also be leftover material from the formation of Chiron itself. Nevertheless, Bosh says the possibility of a second ringed centaur in the solar system is an enticing one. 'Until Chariklo's rings were found, it was commonly believed that these smaller bodies don't have ring systems,' Bosh says. 'If Chiron has a ring system, it will show it's more common than previously thought.'	Minor planet is known as Chiron and located between Saturn and Uranus . Discovery was made by studying dimming of star as it passed behind Chiron . Astronomers say ringed bodies may be more common than first thought . Researchers are still unsure how rings stay place on such a small 'planet'
Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files . A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for £50,000, a court heard today. Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer’s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard. They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer’s door to complain about noise - but he became ‘infatuated’ with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as ‘spy games’, ‘spies’ and ‘secret documents’ - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took ‘sensitive or secret material’ and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent. Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive. The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines. Base: Mr Spencer is an engineer on submarines in the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth . Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told. Mr Spencer’s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was ‘infatuated with Shane’. Mr Chalk said: ‘He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.’ That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen. Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa’s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying ‘you reject me, you reject me’. The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour’s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had ‘lost’ Mr Spencer. Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told the Polish man took 'sensitive or secret material' and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police . Miss Berriman also found that she had lost her key to her boyfriend’s flat and Kostrzewa let her into the shared entrance - and then allegedly said he had found her key on the floor of a Co-op store. She was surprised that the key had fallen off the tight-fitting keyring. In the covert recording with the agent Alex, the defendant allegedly said he had ‘acquired keys to Shane Spencer’s flat’. Mr Chalk said on various dates in March 2014, Kostrzewa used search engines on his computer, entering words including ‘spy games, secret documents, spies, consulate Republic of Poland’. Mr Spencer went to Gibraltar to work from March 19 to 25. The prosecutor said: ‘He then offered to sell off the documents relating to UK submarines to the Polish government.’ In April agent Alex rang the Pole and they met on April 10 in Plymouth, going to a hotel room which was rigged up with hidden recording gear. He allegedly said he found a key to access the flat and stole the relevant papers and planned to copy Mr Spencer’s hard drive - and wanted £50,000 for the information. Alex said he 'needed time to consider the documents'. In the recorded conversation, the defendant said ‘this is only the beginning’. Aerial view: The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer at Devonport (above) and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines . He told Alex his neighbour Mr Spencer ‘designs nuclear submarines’ - and said Mr Spencer did not know he had stolen the material from him, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly said he pulled out the sheets of paper and replaced them empty sheets of paper to make the file look as thick in the folder. He said he and Mr Spencer ‘booze it up on the vodka’ but his pharmacist girlfriend is intelligent and stops Mr Spencer talking about his work as a mathematician and physicist. Alex asked him how much he wanted for ‘all of it’ with the hard disk - and Kostrzewa requested£50,000 for the material as ‘there are over 20 boats’ and ‘they are boats that are already sailing’. Kostrzewa left the room and Met Police officers turned up at the hotel and studied the documents. Alex allegedly then offered the Pole £4,000 but he said that ‘was not enough’. However, he said he would think about it - but would want the cash in £20 notes, the court was told. As he left the room he was arrested by police. Kostrzewa denies burglary between January and April 2014. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Prosecutors want panels of the boat in which Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding to be brought to court to show jurors what they say is his written confession. His lawyers want them to see the entire bullet-ridden boat. Prosecutors have said Tsarnaev scrawled the motive for the attack inside the boat. They say he referred to U.S. wars in Muslim countries and wrote, among other things, 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.' Scroll down for video . Prosecutors say alleged Boston Bomber Dzokhar Tsarnaev (right) confessed to the attack in a scrawled message inside the boat where he was taken into custody. A view of the bloodied and bullet-ridden message seen on the left in an image obtained by ABC . Above, another view of the boat message which reads in part: 'We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us you hurt us all.' Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, had been killed hours earlier during a shootout with police, but Tsarnaev escaped and was captured — bloodied and wounded — inside a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown. During a final pretrial hearing Monday, Tsarnaev attorney William Fick objected to the plan to bring pieces of the boat to court and suggested instead that the boat be brought to the courthouse so the jury can see the entire boat. He argued that the jury would be seeing the writing out of context if the panels were brought into the courtroom. To see the whole boat would allow the jury to imagine Tsarnaev lying inside 'much like someone lying in a crypt making those writings,' Fick said. Attorneys for Tsarnaev want the entire boat where their client was arrested brought to court to the jury can see how torn up it was in the firefight with police . Above, a picture of the moment Tsarnaev was taken into custody outside of the boat in Watertown . Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb argued that it would be impractical to bring the entire boat to the courthouse and that there are photographs of it that can be shown to the jury. He suggested that the defense wants the jury to see the boat —which contains bullet holes, blood stains and broken glass — to gain sympathy for Tsarnaev. Tsarnaev's lawyers also asked Judge George O'Toole Jr. to exclude autopsy photos of the three people killed in the bombings. More than 260 people were hurt. 'These are highly sensitive, highly disturbing images,' said attorney Miriam Conrad. She said the defense will not dispute how the victims died. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said prosecutors have to prove that the victims died from the use of a weapon of mass destruction, which is among the charges against Tsarnaev.  She said the full-body autopsy photos are necessary because they show all the wounds. The judge did not immediately rule on the motions. Tsarnaev's lawyers made it clear during the hearing that they will portray Tsarnaev as an adoring younger brother who was coerced by his older brother into participating in the deadly 2013 attack. Although his lawyers had indicated they planned to argue that Dzhokhar, then 19, was influenced by Tamerlan, then 26, they used their strongest language to date to describe how they will depict the brothers' relationship and each of their roles in the attack. Tsarnaev's trial is set to start Wednesday and is expected to last about three to four months. Tsarnaev pictured above in court on January 15, 2015 . Tsarnaev attorney David Bruck said prosecutors are trying to show a 'completely distorted' picture of his client by asking the judge to limit the kind of evidence they can present during the initial phase of the trial, when the jury will be asked to decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of 30 charges. Bruck, arguing that the defense should be entitled to present evidence of Tamerlan's role in the attack, called him the 'lead conspirator ... but for whom the Boston Marathon bombing would never have occurred.' Bruck said the defense should be allowed to present evidence that the motive 'may well have been the defendant's domination by, love for, adoration of, submissiveness to ... his older brother.' 'That is fair game,' Bruck said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty argued that the defense plans to try to include mitigating evidence during the guilt phase of the trial, when that should be reserved for the second phase of the trial — known as the penalty phase — when the jury will be asked to decide Tsarnaev's punishment: life in prison or the death penalty. Opening statements in Tsarnaev's trial are scheduled for Wednesday. The trial is expected to last three to four months.	Defense attorneys for Tsarnaev petitioned to bring the entire boat where he was captured to court so jury could see damage from firefight . Prosecutors said it wasn't realistic to bring the entire vessel to court, and that pictures of the boat would suffice . However, they do want panels from inside the boat brought to court which they say contain's Tsarnaev's confession note . It reads: 'We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us, you hurt us all' The judge did not rule on either motions on Monday - two days before the start of the trial . The trial is expected to last three to four months .
World Cup winners Germany will be at their best when they take on Euro 2016 qualifying rivals Poland, Scotland and Ireland  after their current period of experimentation, insists Joachim Low. The Germans drew 2-2 in a friendly against Asian champions Australia on Wednesday before a 2-0 victory at Georgia in a Euro qualifier on Sunday. While easing past the Georgians to stay on track for qualification, Germany missed a string of chances again as they struggled with their finishing. Joachim Low's side have failed to replicate the form previously shown at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Germany playmaker Mario Gotze (right) wastes a golden chance against Georgia by shooting wide . Low, who has extended his contract recently to 2018, has said he wants to tinker with his team that won the World Cup last year to make it more flexible and adaptable to different opponents. A three-man defence and more attacking full backs have been two of his experiments, with the coach also trying to find a good mix of youth and experience after the departure of three key players following the World Cup and the return of several long-term absentees, including Marco Reus, Ilkay Guendogan and Holger Badstuber. He has also announced more young players will be in his squad from September onwards. 'We now have a test in the summer against the United States and there I can still try some things out,' Low said of their June 10 friendly before they face Gibraltar in a qualifier three days later. 'After that our forces will then be very focused for our games in September, October and November.' Marco Reus (right) fires home to give Germany the lead in their Euro 2016 qualifying match with Georgia . Germany, who have 10 points along with Scotland while Poland  top Group D with 11, host the Poles and travel to Scotland on September 4 and 7 respectively, . They take on Ireland, who are on eight points, on October 8. 'Experience shows that at that time we are always in much better form because we have the chance to be longer together as a group, to play matches and train,' Low said. 'In the second half of the year we are always better.' While Germany are expected to qualify for the tournament in France, Low is delighted to have Reus back and in goalscoring form following a string of injuries last year, with the speedy winger on target in both games. 'He had a lot of bad luck in the past months and used a lot of strength and energy to come back. Our game is more versatile when he is playing and also much more dangerous.'	2014 World Cup winners Germany recently drew 2-2 with Australia .

England's campaign at the European Under 21 Championship looks set to be dominated over whether Harry Kane is included - but Gareth Southgate may not need him. In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer. Southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe. Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough. James Ward-Prowse . The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic. The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces. Germany's Julian Korb reaches out in vain as James Ward-Prowse fires home England's winning goal . The Under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game. Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on. Carl Jenkinson . Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home. But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side. Carl Jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for England as Germany substitute Nico Schulz looks on . Jenkinson put in a Man of the Match display having assisted two of England's three goals . It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal. With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team. Nathan Redmond . Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing. Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions. Nathan Redmond rifles home England's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . Redmond celebrates after drawing England level late in the game following an impressive display on the right . It was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor Norwich side in the Premier League last season, but having struck the equaliser against a talented Germany team he looks to be improving. Now a veteran of the Under 21 set-up, it will be difficult for Southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for Kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the Young Lions.	England recorded impressive 3-2 win over Germany in Under 21 friendly . Young Lions twice came from behind to seal late win at Riverside Stadium . James Ward-Prowse, Carl Jenkinson and Nathan Redmond among stars . Gareth Southgate's side look in strong shape heading to the European Under 21 Championship in Czech Republic this summer .
My mum Lesley, 69 — who is retired and a fine example of someone who likes to splurge her pensioner pounds — last week flounced out of Argos, where she’d intended to spend upwards of £200 on her grandchildren. She was just too daunted by their new space-age shops to buy anything. Gone are the catalogues, little jotter pads and blue pens that used to fill the stores. Instead, the desks, revamped in clinical white and looking more like a scientist’s lab than a shop, are fitted with white touch-screen iPads. Claudia Connell says her mother, Lesley, 63, was so daunted by the space-age technology in Argos last week that she went to an independent toy seller in another town . Customers search on the iPad for their items, place an order and pay at a self-service kiosk. Then their goods are placed on a counter for them to collect. The transaction can be carried out without so much as a please or thank you to a member of staff. My mum told me afterwards: ‘I’ve never used a tablet. I should learn but I don’t want my first lesson to be in Argos with other shoppers breathing down my neck and making me anxious. ‘I couldn’t find a sales assistant, so I just walked out and bought the grandchildren’s toys from an independent toy seller in another town. They cost more and I had a 12-mile round trip, but it was worth it not to feel like a silly old fool holding everyone up.’ We know the baby boomer generation have the most leisure, money and time to spend on the High Street, so why are retailers doing all they can to make them feel like outcasts? Our High Street stores have changed beyond recognition in recent years — and for many older customers it’s certainly not for the better. The convenience of online shopping is the only way to go for some, but for those who still prefer to shop in person, the experience is becoming an increasingly stressful and confusing one. Given that retail sales have been declining steadily for the past two years, businesses are doing all they can to get customers through their doors. Argos stores used to be known for their weighty catalogues (pictured), little jotter pads and blue pens but instead they now have iPads, self-service counters and barely any customer-employee contact . The trouble is, they all seem to be looking for trendy high-tech solutions — gizmos and gimmicks designed to lure in the under-30s, intimidating the rest of us in the process. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle says: ‘It’s all about retailers panicking over what their competitors are doing and not wanting to be left behind. ‘A lot of them were stung by coming too late to the online market and they don’t want the same to happen again by being too late to take on board in- store technology. ‘But they are getting carried away and aren’t stopping to see the long-term damage they could be doing to customer relations. Older people generally have more money to spend but also want some human interaction while shopping (picture posed by model) ‘Older people have money to spend, but what our research tells us is that, more than anything, they want human interaction. They want a trained, friendly person in the shop who acknowledges them and knows their stock. ‘They don’t want to wander into a shop and feel as if they’re on the set of Tomorrow’s World. ‘When I give advice to clients I always tell them to get staff out on the floor, get them to make eye contact when they talk and to be friendly. ‘For some older women a trip to the shops can be the only human contact they have that day. They don’t want to be directed to some touch screen computer on a wall when they ask a question.’ Kate also believes that some of our best known High Street brands are getting it horribly wrong. ‘Even Marks & Spencer, which relies heavily on the pensioner pound, is focusing too heavily on in-store technology in the form of touch- screen ordering stations and self-service checkouts.’ Also, the rise of super malls, such as Westfield in London and the Trafford Centre in Manchester, have only served to isolate older people even more. Speaking as a 48-year-old shopper, I find London’s two Westfield centres to be stressful. ‘Who wants to spend their day wandering around a maze of shops, getting lost, walking miles and not being able to find your car at the end?’ says Kate. ‘Shopping malls are geared towards young people. They’re exhausting for older people and are another clear example of how the retail world is putting up keep out barriers for senior shoppers. ‘It’s why we’re seeing a rise in the independent, with shops offering old-fashioned customer service.’ It isn’t just department stores that have become a mind-boggling minefield as anyone who has ever attempted to go into a High Street coffee chain and order a plain, white coffee or tea will know. First, you have to select the type of bean, then the type of milk, then how you want that milk to be heated, what topping or flavours you want and finally — after lengthy negotiation — you might get your drink. Oh, but not before having your name (spelt incorrectly) scribbled on your cup. The new CEO of the supermarket chain Morrisons has decided to stop relying on technology and instead will get more staff manning tills and assisting in the shops (stock image) Now Greggs, once a go-to place for no-nonsense, simple food, is undergoing an image makeover, with Cajun soups and Mediterranean flatbread wraps alongside the sausage rolls and iced buns. A hankering for some fries recently led me into my local McDonald’s — and then immediately back out again — when I realised they have introduced a complicated touch-screen ordering system and that the tables have imbedded tablets preloaded with games. I only wanted a carton of chips, not an ‘interactive experience’. Self-service tills in supermarkets are fine — unless you are buying alcohol, single items of fruit or veg, want to use your own bags, require cash back or intend to pay with anything other than the world’s smoothest, crispest banknotes — in which case you’ll need to call on the hovering assistant, who is busy helping half a dozen other confused people. There is some good news, though. Earlier this month, David Potts, the new CEO of supermarket Morrisons, took the decision to stop relying on technology and, instead, get more staff manning tills and assisting in the shop. The reason for this decision was that customer feedback revealed that — surprise! surprise! — shoppers like to interact with humans and not machines when we visit stores. So, forget ‘unexpected item in bagging area,’ isn’t it time that other retailers followed the example set by Morrisons and gave us a few more ‘unexpected humans on the shop floor’?

Face-to-face contact has been replaced with self-service checkouts . The older generation are the ones who have the most money to spend .

This is the moment a tearful Chinese mother and her two daughters knelt down to beg forgiveness from the parents of a student who died while saving the two girls' lives. The youngsters, aged seven and nine, had gone with their mother Li Xiaoli at the end of last month to visit a man-made lake near the village of Xizhaolou in Qingfeng county, in central China's Henan province. But as they were playing on the side of the lake, the younger of the girls - named Chao - slipped and started to fall towards the water, and when her sister Liao went to grab her, she fell in as well. Li Xiaoli and her two daughters beg the parents of the man who died saving them for forgiveness . Meng Ruipeng drowned after rescuing the two girls pictured, but their mother failed to report it for fear of a compensation claim . Both girls were wearing winter coats and it was clear they would not survive long as they struggled to get back to the shore. The girl's mother, who was unable to swim herself, started screaming, alerting a nearby university student named Meng Ruipeng who ran over to help. Without thinking of his own safety, Meng jumped into the water to rescue the girls, The People's Daily reported. He managed to throw the youngest girl from the steep-sided quarry lake back onto the bank, plucking her from below the surface where she had started to sink, and then pushed the older girl towards the bank where she was grabbed by her mother and pulled to safety. Meng Ruipeng (pictured), 24, died dragging two young girls to safety from a man-made lake . But the intense cold and exertion had left the 24-year-old student so weakened that he sank below the surface seconds later and vanished from sight. Yet incredibly, instead of raising the alarm, the girls' mother had been terrified that she would end up in trouble and possibly a compensation claim from the boy's family, and had told the girls to say nothing. Instead, she had taken them home, dried them and changed their clothes, and acted as if nothing had happened. However, she did not realise that the drama had been watched by fishermen on the other side, who had raised the alarm with police. After divers investigated, they recovered the young man's body, and then started trying to work out if other people were involved in his death. That eventually led them to the girls and their mother Li Xiaoli, who had initially denied knowing anything about the tragedy but later admitted what she had done. So as the young man was being prepared for the funeral, she and her daughters turned up dressed in black together with all their savings, a total of 10,000RMB (£1,000), and offered it to the parents of the dead student to make amends. She said: 'I forced my girls to say nothing, it was my decision, and all the shame is mine. 'I offer you my apology and my tribute to your son who saved the lives of my two daughters.' After seeing the two children in tears alongside the mother, the parents of the dead boy accepted the apology. They also told them to keep the money, saying it would not bring back their son but their admission of what he had done at least restored honour to his death.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 30th league goal of the season but couldn’t prevent Real Madrid dropping two points in a 1-1 draw with Villarreal. He is now only one goal from his tally for last season with 12 games left and has become the first striker to score 30 goals a season for the fifth consecutive campaign in one of Europe’s top leagues but he left the pitch annoyed at Real’s failure to pull away from Barcelona at the top of La Liga. They are now just two points clear of their rivals with a trip to the Camp Nou later this month still to come. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates with Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema after putting Real Madrid 1-0 up from the penalty spot . Ronaldo, who won the penalty himself, looked to have put the hosts in control when he sent Sergio Asenjo the wrong way from the spot . Gerard Moreno celebrates after scoring the equaliser that Villarreal's quality and endeavour deserved, and his side held on for a point . Dani Carvajal makes a stunning goal-line block with his head, diving behind Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas to keep the score at 0-0 . Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo, Bale, Kroos, Silva (Jese 72 mins), Isco (Illarramendi 78), Benzema *(Hernandez 81), Ronaldo . Subs not used: Navas, Coentrao, Nacho, Arbeloa. Booked: Carvajal, Pepe . Goal: Ronaldo (pen) Villarreal: Asenjo, Mario, Bailly, Dorado, Costa, Pina (Trigueros 61), Sergio Marcos, Moi Gomez, Campbell, Gerard, Giovani (Vietto 62). Subs not used: Juan Carlos, Musacchio, Víctor Ruíz, dos Santos,  Uche . Booked: Bailly, Moi Gomez, Asenjo, Trigueros, Costa . Goal: Gerard . Joel Campbell was in the starting line-up for Villarreal after coach Marcelino made wholesale changes just three days ahead of his team’s second leg cup semi-final against Barcelona. The Arsenal loanee was bundled over by Pepe in one of Villarreal’s first attacks and from the free-kick the visitors won a corner which led to their first clear cut chance. It fell to Gerard Moreno but with only Iker Casillas to beat he shot straight at Spain keeper. When the rebound ran to Moi Gomez his effort was dived-headed to safety by Dani Carvajal. The keeper congratulated the full-back – both had saved certain goals. Bale was seeing plenty of the ball down the Madrid right although he was at times handicapped by his preference for crossing with his left. He should have been awarded a penalty when Jaume Costa grabbed his arm at a corner and stopped him taking off to connect with Kroos’ kick. It was a spot-kick but the referee waved away the Welshman’s appeal. From another Kroos corner on the half hour Bale this time jumped unimpeded and headed just wide. Varane came even closer shaving the post from another corner kick as Real pushed for the opening goal. As the half went on Real took more and more risks with Marcelo flying forward and throwing himself at an Isco pass but failing to connect effectively. Bale then hit the top of Sergio Asenjo’s bar with a cross-shot from the right and Ronaldo blasted a free-kick over from 35-yards.

Benzema gets up above Villarreal defensive pair Chechu Dorado and Ericn Bailly but he couldn't direct his header past Asenjo . Ronaldo apologies to Marcelo after failing to play the Brazilian in when well-placed during a frustrating night for the European champions . Villarreal had defended well and for the first time in the league since August Real Madrid went down the tunnel at half-time with the score at 0-0. The Bernabeu crowd had not helped with the usual nervous whistles for Bale when one of his passes went astray. He had shown more than most for the home side and in the second half his pass to Ronaldo brought about the opening goal. As the ball was played in Eric Bailey tried to take the Portuguese for a dance grabbing him around the waist and and spinning him around. The referee pointed to the spot and Ronaldo stepped up to score goal number 30 in the league this season. He could have got his second moments later from another Bale assist but this time Asenjo blocked the effort and took an accidental Ronaldo knee to his face in the process. Ronaldo then returned the favour to Bale but the he pulled his shot high and wide. Real Madrid now looked in complete control having broken Villarreal’s dogged resistance but they were in for a shock. With a sweeping eight-pass move from one end of the pitch to the other Villarreal went from keeper Asenjo to striker Moreno who leveled the scores. He played a one-two on the edge of the Real Madrid area with substitute Luciano Vietto and shot past Iker Casillas to silence the Bernabeu.

Real Madrid were almost back in front from their next attack but when Ronaldo ran on to Isco’s pass and shot goalwards Asenjo blocked the effort. Bale then crossed from the right and Ronaldo rose highest in the area but against Asenjo made the save brilliantly tipping the ball over his bar. Carlo Ancelotti risked the wrath of the Bernabeu by taking off fans favourite Isco to put on Asier Illaramendi and he even threw on Javier Hernandez for Karim Benzema but Chicharito failed to make a difference going down dramatically in the area but not convincing the referee to point to the spot. Vietto fell over when clean through with only Casillas to beat and he then saw the Spain keeper brilliantly turn away his diving header.

The flamboyant floral designer whose sudden departure from the White House is blooming into a political intrigue is pictured for the first time - as supporters blamed 'jealous' rivals for her abrupt exit. Laura Dowling spent six years as the Obama administration's chief florist before quitting last month amid rumors of a rift with the First Lady. Her departure only became public six weeks later after a Washington Post gossip column claimed that the 55-year-old was 'escorted from the building' after her employment ended without notice. Mrs Obama's office released a belated statement praising the designer's 'lively and colorful' arrangements - while high-powered lawyers hired by Ms Dowling insisted she had resigned to take on 'exciting new opportunities'. The French-trained artisan, pictured outside her Alexandria, Virginia home in a patterned peach raincoat, matching tote, floppy hat and pink trousers, has refused to comment further. Scroll down for video . Out: Laura Dowling, seen for the first time since she was marched out of the White House by security. She had been chief florist to the Obamas for six years . Upset: Friends said that 'jealousy' was at the bottom of her sudden enforced departure from the East Wing . Inner circle: As florist, Laura Dowling (right) was close to Michelle Obama, who is in charge of the East Wing . However sources close to Ms Dowling suggested she was upset at having to leave and blamed her demise on the intense rivalry that exists within the small coterie of decorators and designers that serve the White House. 'She is very sad about leaving the White House,' the source told Daily Mail Online, on condition of anonymity. 'She was very proud to work there and this has come as a shock. It's all about jealousy - Laura has not put a foot wrong. 'She was very hardworking and she has always been professional and passionate about her work. She and her husband have said they can't talk about it now. 'But they've said that when the time comes they will reveal what really happened.' Ms Dowling's muted departure was in stark contrast to tributes afforded to other departing White House fixtures such as the Obamas' personal chef, Sam Kass, who was praised for his 'extraordinary legacy' when he left last December. Her celebrated predecessor, Nancy Clarke, lasted more than 30 years as chief florist, serving six presidential administrations. Ms Dowling took over the top job in 2009 after competing against several leading designers to create a lavish arrangement for a mock state dinner. She described her style as 'new floral aesthetic' with a 'chic look of elegance' inspired by woods, meadows, forests and gardens. Her website promises arrangements that transcend 'fads and trends', however rival florists who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told The Washington Post her 'fussy style' fell out of favor with Mrs Obama. Francophile: When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look'. Her arrangements were found in the formal parts of the White House . Modern and clean aesthetic: Just days before Dowling's departure, the Old Family Dining Room at the White House had been re-opened after being refurbished by the first lady to showcase modern art and design . They pointed to the recent refurbishment of the White House Family Dining room, which includes abstract paintings and a 1950s-inspired carpet, as an illustration of how the First Lady's tastes have moved on. Ms Dowling is said to have resigned on February 13 - just days after the 'thoroughly modernized' room was unveiled. She was escorted from the White House by security, sources said. It wasn't until six weeks later that Mrs Obama's office issued an official statement to say: 'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements. 'Ms Dowling's creations were always lively and colorful, reflecting not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced. 'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. 'We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.' The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before . Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, is now spending time at home in Alexandria, Virginia (right) and has retained lawyers. Within an hour of the First Lady's official confirmation, Ms Dowling release a statement about her sudden departure through heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin, immediately igniting rumors of an impeding legal action. 'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' she said. 'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' Ms Dowling and her husband Robert Weinhagen, 70, live just outside Washington D.C. in Alexandria's wealthy Old Town neighborhood. Asked if he could elaborate on his wife's sudden departure from the White House, Mr Weinhagen said on the steps of their smart $900,000 townhouse: 'No, not really'. A neighbor told Daily Mail Online: 'I certainly had not heard that she was sacked or escorted from the premises until it came out in the newspaper. 'They are quite private but they are really nice people. They have a very nice garden, obviously.'	Laura Dowling was head florist for the Obamas until last month when she was taken out of the East Wing by security . The distinguished florist's friends say she was the victim of 'jealousy' in the White House . Dowling, 55, has not been seen until today and has retained high-powered lawyers in Washington - leading to speculation she will sue . Supporters tell Daily Mail Online she and her husband have promised to 'reveal what really happened'

Wales star George North wants to reward Warren Gatland's 'trust' in him after a challenging few months on the international circuit. Juggernaut wing North will win his 48th cap in Saturday's RBS 6 Nations showdown against unbeaten title favourites Ireland at the Millennium Stadium. And the 22-year-old's impressive display when Wales beat France in Paris 11 days ago suggests he is on the way back to recapturing top Test match form. Earlier this term, Wales head coach Gatland called for North to increase his involvement in games, and it did not go unnoticed.

Scrum-half Rhys Webb catches the ball in training ahead of Saturday's Six Nations showdown with Ireland . 'For me, it's never a good point if the head coach is not happy with you,' North said. 'That is when you start getting dropped and stuff. 'I felt that Paris was a step forward for me to where I want to be in a Welsh jersey, and hopefully on Saturday I can push forward again and reward his trust.' North has only scored one try in his last seven Tests - against Fiji last November - but at the Millennium Stadium it is a strike-rate of seven touchdowns from 10 starts during the past 16 months. Victory for Wales this weekend would keep them in the Six Nations title mix heading for an appointment with Italy in Rome next week, but recent history suggests that Ireland occupy the box-seat. They have beaten Wales in each of the last two Six Nations campaigns, scoring an aggregate 56 points, while Joe Schmidt's men are currently on an Irish record-equalling run that has realised 10 successive Test wins. North is tackled by England's Jonathan Joseph (left) and Anthony Watson (right) during the Six Nations match . 'If you look at Ireland over the last couple of years in this fixture, they have just been clinical,' North added. 'Over the past two years they have been very good at finishing games off. They take their chances when they can, and we have lacked that composure when it has come to the crunch. 'They are 10 (wins) from 10, which is unbelievable. 'They have got a lot of confidence now, they execute their game-plan very well and they are a side that knows what they want to do and where they want to go, and everyone has bought into that ethos. 'We don't need to big the game up more than it is. It's a massive game for Ireland, going for the Grand Slam, and for us it will be a great Test match here in Cardiff.' North (pictured here in 2014) will win his 48th cap for Wales if he plays against Ireland at the weekend . Wales, meanwhile, will be captained by flanker Sam Warburton for the 34th time as he overtakes Ryan Jones' Welsh record, and North said: 'It's exceptional for Sam. 'He is a quality player and leads from the front, and as a captain you cannot ask for any more. 'With someone like Sam it's not necessarily what he says, it's the actions he does. He is the kind of man who will never ask you to do something he wouldn't do himself. 'In training, he is not someone who stands up and gives a 20-minute speech and everyone gets up and starts screaming. 'It's more of a kind of chat that is to the point and is no more or no less than what it needs to be.'

A Chinese man who has been left with a memory that lasts just five minutes has found the only way he can cope is to continually write down every detail of his life in a precious notebook. Chen Hongzhi, 25, from Hsinchu county, Beipu, suffered a serious head injury in a car accident when he was a teenager which has left him with virtually no memory, The People's Daily reports. He writes down everything - from the people he meets in the street to the weather - as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. Memory book: Chen Hongzhi uses the notebook to write down people he meets and what he does each day after being left with a five-minute memory following a car crash . Chen suffered the severe brain injury in a car accident when he was 17 and spent months in intensive care in hospital. While his body recovered, his memory loss is still so severe that he often forgets things that happened between five and 10 minutes ago. The debilitating condition also means that Chen cannot remember how to write properly, so he makes notes in a phonetic 'scrawl' that mostly only he understands. 'This is my record, I write in it everyday, even if it is pouring down with rain or if I don't go out to do the weeding I still l must write, "Heavy rain",' he said. 'Whenever I get home from any time away  I quickly grab my notebook and write down important things from the day - who I've met, what I've done, how much money I got from recycling bottles, all that sort of stuff.' Life record: Chen writes down everything from the people he meets in the street to the weather as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. He has even developed his own language . Dependants: Chen Hongzhi with his mother Wang Miao-chiong, who starts the day by handing Chen his notebook and reminding him he is no-longer 17. They are reliant on each other following the recent death of his father . Every day when Chen wakes up, his mother, Wang Miao-chiong, must remind him that he is no longer 17 and eight years have passed. She hands him the notebook so he can read what has happened in his life since the accident and check important details like who his friends are and what needs to be done that day. Chen's story has spread online in China after it was compared to that of the fictional character played by Nicole Kidman in the film Before I Go to Sleep. His condition means Chen is unable to hold down a job so he raises a small amount of money by walking several kilometres collecting plastic bottles. Chen also collects wood that he and his mother use to make a fire to cook their food. His mother, 60, said the practical system has kept Chen going for years, but she worries about what will happen to him after she has gone, particularly given the recent death of his father. Guide to life: Chen Hongzhi, 25, has had to write everything down after he suffered brain injuries that left him with a five-minute memory, when he was 17 . They get by on donations from neighbours and friends in the tiny village in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County, who have given Chen the nickname 'short memory man' because he forgets having met them within 24 hours. She said the family had initially hoped he would go back to school but soon realised there would be little point. 'It had been planned that would go back to school but there was no point as he could never remember the lessons, and has been living at home with me ever since.' Before the accident: Chen poses with a pony before a car accident left him with very little memory . Hard worker: Despite having very little memory, Chen collects firewood for his family to use in the stove . The pair are totally dependent on each other, with Chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he, in turn, provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores. A severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss. Memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it. Damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss. Head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident. A person can appear to be relatively well, but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted. They can also forget the time from before the brain injury – called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia – and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months. But the most common – and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss. This can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Examples of this are forgetting what has just been said, having difficulty in learning a new skill, repeating the same question over and over, forgetting people's names, getting details mixed up, forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed. There is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem, and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies. However, memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it. Source: Headway: The Brain Injury Association . After the death of his father, he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities, where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story, and posted on social media where it quickly spread. Beipu village chief, Liu Chin-ting, said the family receives monthly support from Hsinchu County's social welfare department, which is helping the family to get by. Welfare workers also make it a point to visit Chen and his mother during festive holidays, he said. But Liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training. He said: 'He needs to get some preparation because his mother won't be there forever, and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job'. The family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but Chief Liu, who is helping to negotiate, said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper, rice, salt and soy sauce. He said: 'Once the basics are sorted out, perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term, but at the moment they just need to survive.' Chen meanwhile is clearly happy, as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he's very happy that people want to help. He knows he is destined to forget everything, but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour. He said: 'I am reading here about all the people that want to give me money, but I would say don't give me too much, because it looks as if I'll probably forget where I put it all.' In the film Before I Go to Sleep, 40-year-old Christine Lucas, played by Nicole Kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before. In a remarkable similarity, she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident. Alike: Chen's story has led to comparisons between himself and Holywood blockbuster Before I Go to Sleep (2014), starring Nicole Kidman as Christine Lucas and Colin Firth as Ben Lucas .

Mayor Bill de Blasio attended a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-friendly St. Patrick's Day parade on Sunday, and told participants that a society for all is one that embraces and respects everyone. The St. Pat's for All parade stepped off in Queens under a heavy snowfall. It was held as an alternative to the city's centuries-old St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan, which for years has excluded gay groups and this year is scheduled for March 17. De Blasio, a Democrat, refused to march in last year's Manhattan parade because it wasn't fully inclusive, and Guinness beer dropped its sponsorship. Organizers said last year, though, that they would welcome one gay contingent under its own banner this year. On Sunday, de Blasio said he is 'not ready to commit to marching' in this year's Manhattan event. Parade: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, center, waves the flag of Ireland as he marches beside Kerry Kennedy, third from left, during the all-inclusive St. Pat's For All parade in Sunnyside, Queens on Sunday . Celebration: Marchers carry a banner reading 'St. Pat's for All' on Sunday in the snowy weather . Capital New York reported that NBC Universal employees are planning to march with a banner for Out@NBCUniversal. The group's Twitter page describes itself as 'the employee resource group of LGBT & Straight Ally employees at NBCUniversal.' De Blasio arrived about 15 minutes late to the St. Pats for All parade, sporting a lavender shirt and green tie. Despite the snow and cold he said, 'It's a sunny day in my world.' 'You are a hardy troupe,' he told people gathered for the parade. 'You are here to celebrate no matter what. That is what pride is all about - pride in the fact that in New York City you can be whoever you are.' The mayor said on Sunday: 'A society for everyone is a society where everyone is respected, where everyone is embraced, where everyone has a say at the table.' In the past, gays were free to march in the world's biggest and oldest St. Patrick's Day Parade but not with banners saying they're LGBT. Most marching units in the parade carry identifying banners. There are about 320 units in this year's parade, the parade committee said. The New York Daily News quoted the mayor as saying of the March 17 event 'I'm not ready to commit to marching, because all we've heard is that one delegation related to NBC will be allowed to have members of the LGBT community in it.' Gathering: de Blasio looks on during the snowstorm at the St. Pat's For All parade. The parade, which embraces diversity, is considered an alternative to New York City's official St. Patrick's Day parade . Per Capital New York, de Blasio said 'Having only one delegation associated with one company that allows members of the LGBT community is obviously a pretty narrow concession, and I think we'd like to see something that's more inclusive. 'Here is an example of a parade that's inclusive of all - it celebrates Irish heritage in a way that everyone can be a part of. I hope for some more progress with the parade in Manhattan, but there is still time, and we look forward to some additional discussion and I certainly welcome any discussions with anybody who wants to make it more inclusive.' 'Even though it is a statement of some progress that this NBC delegation has been included, and I certainly commend that, we need something more for it to really feel like we've turned a corner here,' de Blasio reportedly said, per Capital. LGBT activists say the main parade organizer, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, has been under increasing pressure to allow diversity, especially after New York state passed its Marriage Equality Act in 2011, allowing marriages for same-sex couples. The two grand marshals at the 15th annual St. Pat's for All parade were longtime human rights activist Kerry Kennedy and Tony Award-winning actor Brian O'Byrne. Patti Lowenhaupt, a retired art teacher and Queens resident who showed up for the parade, said people 'are all human beings underneath it all.' 'We here in Queens have the ability to accept all kinds of people,' Lowenhaupt said. Several protesters, however, stood on the side holding signs that read 'Sodom & Gomorrah.' Other elected officials participating in the St. Pat's for All parade included City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and city Comptroller Scott Stringer.

(CNN)A severe solar storm created a stunning display of light in the night sky over parts of the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand early Wednesday morning, spotted by those lucky enough to be awake in the wee hours. Called aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere, the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived Tuesday about 10 a.m. ET (1 a.m. Wednesday in Sydney). Both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the Earth, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. "When these particles bombard the Earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, the collision often creates brilliant colors," Borek said. "Most of the time, auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint, which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on Earth." Share your photos of the aurora with iReport . The stronger the storm, the farther south it can be seen, said Borek. And this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful, reaching as a high as a G4 on a scale from 1 to 5 Tuesday night, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours, and NOAA's latest reports say it's down to a G1. Though the storm could affect GPS technology and power grids, NOAA said Tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions. The most visible impact as been this stunning light display. If the auroras are seen again tonight, Borek said, they won't be as pronounced and most likely won't reach as far south as Tuesday night. People in northern Michigan, northern Minnesota and Maine may be able to spot them, although he warned that clouds from Minnesota to Montana may impede visibility Wednesday night.

No-one will linger long over this. At some point on Thursday morning it will be gone, expunged from the memory, all thoughts turning to a significant European Championship qualifier with Gibraltar on Sunday. For both nations this was what it was. An improving Northern Ireland have their own qualifier against Finland and, like the Scots, had an eye on the bigger prize. The 85th-minute corner from debutant Matt Ritchie which placed the ball onto the head of goalscoring substitute Christophe Berra salvaged the night from irrelevance. Christophe Berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for Scotland . Berra celebrates his late goal, which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity or quality .

Steven Fletcher gets a shot away, one of few clear cut chances created by either team, but was unable to put his team ahead . The Sunderland striker is denied again by Michael McGovern as he goes through one on one to try and break the deadlock . Scotland: Gordon (McGregor 45 mins), Whittaker (Russell 78), Greer, Martin (Berra 45), Forsyth, McArthur (Morrison 63), Darren Fletcher, Ritchie, Maloney (Naismith 45), Steven Fletcher (Rhodes 63), Anya. Subs not used: Brown, May, Robertson, Hutton, Bannan, Reynolds, , Forrest, Marshall. Goal: Berra 85 . Northern Ireland: McGovern, Danny Lafferty, Jonny Evans (McCullough 81), Baird 9Hodson58), Dallas, Reeves (Ryan McLaughlin 70), McNair, Hughes, Norwood (Davis 69), Magennis (McKay 75), Grigg (McCourt 58). Subs: Mannus, Conor McLaughlin, Kyle Lafferty, Brunt, Ward, Cathcart. Referee: Martin Atkinson (England) A captain’s performance from Darren Fletcher was also worthy of note. Throw in some decent runs and crosses from Derby left back Craig Forsyth in his first start and Gordon Strachan will take value from this. With Ikechi Anya, the enigmatic Watford winger who tried his utmost to enliven a comatose friendly, there was evidence of a promising new line of attack. Yet the truth is this. It was no night for snap judgments. Strachan fiddled with his resources, never really fielding anything resembling his strongest first 11. At times this was a stark reminder of why the Home International Championships are now a distant, mothballed relic. ‘I thought it was important to win this game,’ said the Scotland boss. ‘Just to make us feel good about ourselves. The performance was good at times. We got used to the pitch as well - which is a bit slick. Northern Ireland have improved immensely over the last year, beating Hungary and Greece.’ They never threatened a repeat. Their boss Michael O’Neill, an old face on the Scottish scene, said: ‘For us I thought there were more positive than negatives. But we didn’t get enough good balls in the box. We left a lot of our first-choice players out, seven or eight of our players that will probably start on Sunday [against Finland].’ Berra’s breakthrough came in his first appearance for his country since November 2013. It came late, as people crept towards the exits, resigning themselves to a mediocre scoreless draw. The Ipswich defender’s header from the penalty spot crept through a ruck of bodies and into the net via the inside of the post.

Scotland captain Darren Fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four . Ikechi Anya (right), who was one of Scotland's livelier players, takes on Manchester United defender Patrick McNair on the wing . It was a reward Scotland just about deserved. They had given it a go in the opening half, but looked to have run out of ideas after a raft of substitutions. Thank goodness for Anya, a cult figure amongst the Tartan Army, who brings an energy and industry to his work. Even on nights like this. Nights when, bluntly, others can’t quite find their game. Reared a mile or so from Hampden his endeavour and tempo kept things interesting when an unspecified crowd estimated at less than 30,000 allowed their minds to drift towards the latest plot on Coronation Street. Anya was at the heart of the first major chance in just four minutes, scurrying down the left flank and playing a one-two with Forsyth. A sharp cut-back was turned towards goal at the second attempt, Northern Ireland keeper Michael McGovern – also Hamilton’s keeper – producing a terrific save to push the ball over the bar. The early touch gave the keeper confidence. He would need it as Anya embarked on a one-man war of attrition. The little winger, whose goal in Germany last September has already become an iconic moment, was hellbent on adding to his tally. He smashed a low right-foot shot from 20 yards in nine minutes. Scuttled forward and hit one wide with his right in 20. Then wasted a great chance after James McArthur nicked the ball off the toe of Chris Baird and teed him up two minutes later, thumping past the post again. Dallas goes up for a header against Steven Whittaker as the two sides attempted to stamp their authority on the friendly fixture . Bournemouth star Matt Ritchie, who made his debut in Wednesday night's game, controls the ball in midfield . It took half an hour for another Scotland player to have a crack on goal, Steven Fletcher’s low shot from 18 yards taken comfortably by McGovern. Five years have passed since Fletcher, Sunderland’s £14million man, last scored for his country. The only strike in 19 appearances for a player people screamed for during the infamous Craig Levein spat. No-one remembers the goal – in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying win over Iceland in April 2009. Instead they remember Barry Ferguson’s V-sign to photographers or goalkeeper Allan McGregor’s smirk in the aftermath of the infamous Boozegate episode. A Steven Fletcher goal celebration in a Scotland shirt is now a solitary event. He had another chance to change that before half-time, making the run to take a Maloney pass and trying to dink a shot over McGovern. To his credit the Irish keeper – an old hand around these parts – would not be beaten. Fletcher lasted an hour before accepting that this, once more, would not be his night for a goal. Manchester United's Jonny Evans (left), the Northern Ireland captain, holds off Steven Whittaker as the ball goes past . McGovern gets up well to punch away, under pressure from Scotland striker Steven Fletcher, as McNair watches on . The substitutions are a necessary nuisance in these games. Keen to try as many players out as possible before Sunday, Strachan made plenty. Steven Naismith and, critically, Berra joined McGregor as half-time replacements, the Hull City No1 replacing Celtic’s Craig Gordon. On the hour mark, James Morrison and Jordan Rhodes – Fletcher’s replacement - were also handed a half hour to turn things around. For Northern Ireland, the arrival of the mercurial Paddy McCourt - scorer of extraordinary goals for Celtic - and former Rangers skipper Steven Davis also raised interest levels. For Matt Ritchie, it was a tentative, but promising debut. He ran around a lot and showed sharpness, and almost made the decisive impact in 69 minutes – taking a neat lay off from Naismith and thrashing a long-range shot a couple of yards wide. With the best assist record in English football, he also takes a decent corner. A swirling inswinging ball picked out Naismith for a firm header which hit the target, but failed to seriously trouble the confident figure of McGovern. Ritchie had better luck with his delivery from a corner five minutes from time when Berra claimed his third goal for Scotland. And just when Northern Ireland boss O’Neill thought his young, inexperienced side had come through the game unscathed. Against a Gibraltar team who have shipped 21 goals in four qualifiers, O’Neill expects Scotland to do likewise. ‘There is a lot more depth in the Scotland squad at this moment in time,’ he said. ‘They moved the ball well and looked strong and powerful. Anya, in the first 15 or 20 minutes, caused us problems. I don’t anticipate Gibraltar will give you too many problems. I certainly hope not.’ In that regard he probably spoke for a nation.

(CNN)The sack and pillage of the Mosul museum by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyian. The bulldozing of the archaeological site of Nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in Iraq. These acts are a deliberate attack against civilians, minorities, heritage sites and traditions. In the minds of terrorists, murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked. It is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization, whose temples, palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of Iraq and Mesopotamia for the last 3,000 years. It is important we understand the true nature of this conflict. This war against culture is a war against people. It is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression. This is why extremists attack schools, media, or other places of culture. Through modern methods of communication and information, they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds. They forbid girls to go to school, kill journalists and vandalize museums: all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity. There can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity, and I wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion. When culture is under attack, we must respond with more knowledge, and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity's shared heritage. This is why we appeal to all cultural institutions, museums, journalists, professors, and scientists to share knowledge widely about the Mesopotamian civilization. We need to remind ‎all of the history of this land which led the Islamic golden age. And we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth, in Iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own. Pre-Islamic heritage in Iraq belongs to all Iraqis, just as the Pyramids are written into the identity of all Egyptians. What is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the "irreparable loss of treasures of humanity." What is happening is a security issue. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime. We see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations, spread terror, and encourage violence. We see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted‎ sites, and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism. With this in mind, we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes. The acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action. Faced with such crimes, we hope we can better understand the values we all share, and stand united in respect of humanity.	ISIS bulldozed site of ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq .

(CNN)Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will announce Monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president. Cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012. His announcement takes place at a bastion of  conservatism, Liberty University, the institution founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. Cruz is going to run from the right. He has spent much of his short career in Washington blasting the "mushy middle" of his party (which might be news to most Democrats), which he dismisses as a "failed electoral strategy." During a recent visit to New Hampshire, where he vowed to eliminate the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue Service, Cruz said that "I'm pretty sure, here in New Hampshire, y'all define gun control like we do in Texas: Gun control is when you hit at what you aim at." Fifty years ago, another Republican senator ran this kind of campaign, Arizona's Barry Goldwater, who took on President Lyndon Johnson. Cruz will test the conventional wisdom that Goldwater's strategy was and remains a failure. When Republicans voted to nominate him in 1964, Goldwater told the delegates that "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue." When the icon of moderate Republicans, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, spoke to the convention, the delegates hissed and booed. The outcome was far from great for the GOP. Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal Democratic majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred. Although Goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964, Cruz thinks that the times have changed. Is he right? Right now, the chances are not great. If Cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism, he faces very long odds of making it to the White House. The strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against Jeb Bush in red states, but it is not an approach with a great track record. Even as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades, Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination, and those who have also won the presidency, always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes. Ronald Reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent, and George H.W. Bush had a thousand points of light. His son George W. Bush emphasized policies tied to "compassionate conservatism" to prove that he was not an extreme zealot. Even Republicans who didn't win in the general elections, like John McCain and Mitt Romney, did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base. Notwithstanding the conventional wisdom, even in primaries it seems that Republican voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in November. This coming election will be tough for Republicans. As all the experts have shown, the electoral college math does not favor the GOP. Some experts have predicted that Democrats have over an 80% chance of winning the Electoral College. According to the Washington Post, if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election, five currently favor Democrats (Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania) while in others, like Colorado, Democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends, namely growing minority populations that favor their party's nominee. Barring any dramatic changes in the coming months, Democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in Hillary Clinton. Cruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate. The Republican Party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in Washington. In 2014, congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14%. As the new year began, the approval ratings were only slightly better: just 16%. This is the congressional Republicanism where Cruz comes from. Many voters who like conservatism and the GOP don't love what their representatives are doing on Capitol Hill. The kind of scorched earth, always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings. There have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as Cruz. During his campaign for the presidency, he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in Congress. When Goldwater squared off against Johnson in 1964, the President predicted that there would be a "frontlash" of Republican and independent voters who would move way from the GOP just because Goldwater was at the top of the ticket. This was Johnson's response to predictions of a backlash in the South from Democrats who were angry about civil rights. The frontlash, Johnson explained to Bill Moyers is "liberals, independents, moderate Republicans." The electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in Midwestern states in 1964, where solidly Republican areas went Democratic because they were scared off by Goldwater, but a Cruz campaign could be exactly what Democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain. Monday, Cruz will bask in the spotlight of his announcement. But Republicans are going to have to really think hard about whether they want to put all of their electoral eggs in this volatile basket which, at least based on the history, has a very slim chance of winning.	Julian Zelizer: If Ted Cruz follows Barry Goldwater's path, he and his party could lose big . Contrary to conventional wisdom, GOP primary voters are more interested in victory than ideology, he says .
Cristiano Ronaldo headed Real Madrid into the quarter-finals of the Champions League with two first half goals against Schalke but an awful performance from the holders suggested their crown is very much up for grabs this season. Carlo Ancelotti’s team were booed off after losing 4-3 on the night. They stumbled into the last eight 5-4 on aggregate but Ronaldo’s goals and the return of Luka Modric apart, there was little to cheer. Ancelotti was even asked if he would be surprised if he was sacked after the performance. He said he was just concentrating on doing his job and apologised for the display: ‘It was bad for the image of the club,’ he said.

Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia) ‘The reaction of the crowd was totally justifiable but it will serve to wake us up. I still believe in the team because I know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it. We are playing very badly. We need to train more, work more, we need more of everything.’ Ronaldo headed in a Toni Kroos corner on 25 minutes to cancel out Christian Fuchs’ shock opener and when Schalke took the lead again on 40 minutes through Klass-Jan Huntelaar, Ronaldo headed in a Fabio Coentrao cross to equalise. It was his rage at the lacklustre performance from some of his team-mates more than his finishing that was most striking. Karim Benzema scored eight minutes into the second half but Real still allowed Schalke to level on the night with substitute Leroy Sane beating Casillas with a long range shot and when Huntelaar got his second five minutes from time it left Roberto Di Matteo’s team needing just one more goal for one of the all-time Champions League shocks. The fifth goal never came and Madrid stumbled over the line but this was hardly a performance to put fear into the rest of Europe. The mood was set before kick-off when supporters jeered Ancelotti’s name as it was announced. The credit he earned for winning this competition last season seems to have long since disappeared. He needed a positive Champions League display from his players – he never got one. Real looked flat going forward and were slow to cover space at the back and when Tranquillo Barnetta crossed from the right on 25 minutes, he found Fuchs with time and space to shoot past Iker Casillas. Sami Khedira, who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season had failed to follow Fuchs’ run and Casillas was beaten too easily. Ronaldo turned to shout at his sleepy team-mates after he rose to head in Kroos’ corner five minutes later but Madrid did not wake up. Karim Benzema was also on the scoresheet for Real Madrid as he re-found his goalscoring touch against Schalke .

Huntelaar's goal at the Bernabeu put Schalke back in front with the score at 2-1 in the Champions League clash . Schalke are starting to gain a reputation for spectacular exits from the Champions League. The German club have been on the losing end of the highest-scoring tie of the round each time they've been dumped out in the knockout phase. They might not have made progress, but Schalke get full marks for entertainment, as these aggregate scores show... 2014, last 16 . Real Madrid 9-2 Schalke . 2013, last 16 . Galatasaray 4-3 Schalke . 2011, semi-final . Manchester United 6-1 Schalke . James Restall . A Raphael Varane back pass almost let in Huntelaar who then rattled the bar. And with his third chance inside five minutes he found the back of the net. Casillas spilled Meyer’s shot straight to the Dutchman and, against his old club, he made it 2-1. Ronaldo stepped forward to level once again but a crescendo of whistles still greeted the half-time whistle. Benzema put them 3-2 up on the night on 53 minutes but Leroy Sane beat Casillas from distance to cause further embarrassment. This was the first time since 2009 Madrid had conceded three at home in Europe. Ancelotti immediately brought on Modric and Marcelo for Khedira and Coentrao. The Croatian looked to restore some control to midfield but when Huntelaar got his second of the game off the underside of Casillas’ bar the miracle looked back on for Schalke’s 4,000 following. Gareth Bale was jeered when he shot well wide from a good position. He is a victim rather than the cause of Madrid’s malaise but is starting to struggle in front of the club’s unforgiving supporters. He will be glad that former Tottenham team-mate Luka Modric is now back in the side alongside him. His return and Ronaldo’s reliability were the plus points for Madrid on a night when they answered more questions than provided answers. Around 1,000 Real Madrid supporters had voted for Ronaldo to be dropped earlier this week in a poll organized by Spanish newspaper Diario AS. Whether they were at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night or at home clicking other online surveys it is impossible to know. Once again Real Madrid’s Ballon d’Or had been head and shoulders above the rest and had he not been, next Friday’s quarter-final draw might even have been missing the name of the ten-times winners.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry  delivered a highly cautious assessment on Saturday ahead of the next round of nuclear talks with Iran, citing 'important gaps' in the way of a deal before an end of March deadline. At a news conference in Egypt, where he attended an economic discussion, Kerry also said a U.S. decision would come shortly on unblocking hundreds of millions in suspended military assistance for the Egyptian government. Three days before Israel's election, America's top diplomat expressed hope that any government voted into power 'meets the hopes for peace' in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaks at a news conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Saturday. He said he's returning to nuclear negotiations with Iran with 'important gaps' standing in the way of a deal . But on the Obama administration's most important foreign policy priority - talks with Iran to curb its nuclear program - Kerry was circumspect. He said only a negotiated agreement could provide long-term assurance that Tehran would not develop nuclear weapons. But with a deadline just two weeks away, he could not say whether the United States and other world powers would be able to reach a framework accord with the Iranians or even were close. 'We have made some progress but there are still gaps, important gaps, and important choices that need to be made by Iran in order to move forward,' Kerry told reporters in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. 'The purpose of these negotiations is not just to get any deal,' he said. 'It is to get the right deal.' Speaking after a week of U.S. political fighting over the diplomatic outreach to Iran, Kerry lambasted Senate Republicans who signed an open letter to Iran's leaders suggesting any deal they reach with the administration could expire the day President Barack Obama leaves office. Such tactics, which Kerry called unprecedented, will inevitably raise questions among Iran and America's allies in the talks, he said. He said that in order to provide long-term assurance that Tehran would not develop nuclear weapons, more negotiations need to occur . The conflict between the administration and mainly Republicans in Congress has emerged as among the tensest subplots to the diplomatic effort. Because U.S. lawmakers can block the lifting of some penalties against Iran and potentially pass additional trade or financial restrictions, they hold the power to undermine an accord. They are pressing for at least a say in whether any deal the U.S. and its partners reach is acceptable. Negotiators are talking about freezing Iran's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the Iranians. Many in Congress say the U.S. should hold out for greater dismantlement of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. But opponents of a deal have been vague about what types of continued nuclear activity - if any - they would deem acceptable. 'What's the alternative?' Kerry asked. 'In previous years when U.S. policy was not to talk to Iran and insist at the same time that they can have no nuclear program, whatsoever, the number of centrifuges skyrocketed. Every time negotiations have broken down in the past, Iran's nuclear program has advanced.' Negotiators are talking about freezing Iran's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the Iranians . Kerry, who was schedule to travel Sunday to Lausanne, Switzerland, for several days of discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, noted the Islamic Republic's longstanding claims that it has no interest in assembling a nuclear arsenal. Its leaders have issued a fatwa, or formal religious ruling, against such weapons. The United States, he said, has 'great respect for the religious importance of a fatwa'. But negotiators need an agreement that translates that commitment into an agreement that can 'guarantee that Iran's program will be peaceful now and peaceful forever'. 'We still don't know whether or not we will get there,' Kerry said. 'It may be that Iran simply can't say yes to the type of deal that the international community is looking for, but owe it to the future of everybody in the world to try to find out.' On Egypt, Kerry said a decision would come 'very soon' on F-16 fighter jets, tanks and other materiel the Egyptians say the need to combat an extremist threat operating in the Sinai Peninsula and spilling over from lawless Libya. Kerry said at the conference that negotiations with Iran can not stop, because 'every time negotiations have broken down in the past, Iran's nuclear program has advanced' The aid was suspended after the military's 2013 takeover of the government. The U.S. administration considers its resumption critical for Mideast stability, but must first certify Egyptian progress on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, or issue a declaration that such aid is in the interests of U.S. national security. Ahead of Israel's national election Tuesday, Kerry emphasized how Democrats and Republicans alike have sought peace between Israelis and Palestinians for decades. The United States is hopeful that 'whatever the choice the people of Israel make,' peace efforts can resume. Kerry said he did not want anyone to misconstrue his comments as interference with the vote. Obama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached a new low earlier this month when the Israeli leader sharply criticized American policy on Iran in an address before the U.S. Congress. Kerry said he could only repeat U.S. 'hopes that the choice that the people of Israel make will not only meet their needs domestically and their hopes in their country, but obviously meet the hopes for peace which I think everybody shares.'	U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said only a negotiated agreement could provide long-term assurance that Tehran wouldn't develop nuclear weapons . He said he couldn't say if U.S. or other nations could reach a framework with Iran before the end of the month . But he said a decision will come shortly on unblocking hundreds of millions in suspended military assistance for the Egyptian government .
To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee rarely talks directly to journalists, so when a US reporter received a note from her telling him to 'go away', it was considered a major coup. Connor Sheets had been chasing an interview with her for weeks, in part to try and establish that she is lucid. Since publisher HarperCollins stunned the literary world with news that Lee is publishing a second novel, controversy has raged about whether the reclusive, 88-year-old novelist is of sound mind. To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee rarely talks directly to journalists, so when a US reporter received a note from her telling him to 'go away', it was considered a major coup . The blunt reply she gave to Sheets has seemingly put these worries to bed. The writer concluded that this reply could only have come from someone who's of sound mind. Sheets wrote: 'It appears that Nelle, as her friends call her, is very much with it, that she is still lucid and that her acerbic, press-averse side is fully intact.' Lee had mesmerizing success with her book To Kill A Mockingbird, released over half a century ago, and fans and writers were both delighted and taken aback to hear that Lee was releasing another novel. They were even more surprised to learn that it was a manuscript written 60 years ago and hidden away after an editor told the young novelist to recast the book into what would become Mockingbird. Go Set a Watchman, finished in the mid-1950s, features many of the same characters as Mockingbird and was discovered last year among her papers by lawyer Tonja Carter. But she was quoted by gossip blog Gawker as saying last July that her client sometimes signed things 'she did not understand'. Since publisher HarperCollins stunned the literary world with news that Lee (pictured in 2007) is publishing a second novel, controversy has raged about whether the reclusive, 88-year-old novelist is of sound mind . Go Set A Watchman is already number one in the best-seller list at online bookstore Amazon, where the 304-page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its July release. Pictured right is US investigative journalist Connor Sheets who was lucky enough to receive a hand-written note from Lee . Could Lee, who had a stroke in 2007 and so often said she would never publish again, really be happy that a manuscript, long since discarded, was going to see the light of day? Mr Sheets hasn't been able to answer that question, but has confirmed that she seems to be mentally focussed and harboring a familiar contempt for journalists. It is well known that Lee has poor eye sight and is deaf. She has lived since 2007 in a nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, where all requests for visits reportedly go through her lawyer. Mr Sheets described how he made repeated attempts to talk to her, eventually writing a two-page letter to her on February 5. This week that letter arrived on his doormat, with four words scribbled at the bottom in black pen - 'Go away! Harper Lee'. Sheets said: 'She may have softened her language as she has advanced well into her golden years, but the thrust is the same: leave her alone.' Carter took on the role of Lee's gatekeeper after the author's fiercely protective sister Alice died last summer. Tongues started wagging and Carter has been on the defensive, telling The New York Times that Lee is 'extremely hurt and humiliated' by allegations that she has been manipulated. 'She is a very strong, independent and wise woman who should be enjoying the discovery of her long lost novel,' Carter told the newspaper through emails and text messages. 'Instead, she is having to defend her own credibility and decision-making.' In February Carter released an earlier statement telling fans that Lee is 'happy as hell' about the new book. US media has fallen on the story, quoting alleged friends and associates of Lee as attesting to her excitement and lucidity, or raising doubts and speculation. Lee, who rarely speaks to the media, said via HarperCollins that she was 'humbled and amazed' the manuscript was to be published after so many years. Go Set A Watchman is already number one in the best-seller list at online bookstore Amazon, where the 304-page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its July release. NPR reported that Lee's friend, Wayne Flynt, visited her the day before news of the book came out and said she was of sound mind. 'Does she understand what's going on? If you make her hear, she can understand what's going on,' he said on NPR. 'Can she give informed consent? Absolutely, she can give informed consent.' To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Price for its tale of racial injustice in the Great Depression-era South. Published in 1960, is has become standard reading in American classrooms and has been translated into more than 40 languages, as well as adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Gregory Peck. Roberts said that regardless of its merits, Go Set A Watchman will be of important literary and scholarly value. 'What's in a writer's mind is always interesting,' she told AFP. 'Anything that makes people read is good and anything that makes people talk about race in this country is good.'	Reporter had written Harper Lee interview request posted back to him . In the bottom right-hand corner of the letter were the words 'go away' There have been worries that the author is not of sound mind . The US reporter who received this reply says it confirms she is lucid . Lee is publishing a second novel called Go Set A Watchman .
