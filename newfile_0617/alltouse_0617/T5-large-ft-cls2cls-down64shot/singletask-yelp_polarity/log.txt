It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.  We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.  We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.  What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again.

06/02/2022 06:01:48 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 06:01:48 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] BEWARE this Rosati's has changed ownership and you should avoid it.  We placed a phone order for delivery at 6:50 and were told it would be 45 minutes. One hour and 15 minutes later we called back and they had lost the address. It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.  We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.  We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.  What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again.

06/02/2022 06:01:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:01:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 06:04:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 06:04:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] BEWARE this Rosati's has changed ownership and you should avoid it.  We placed a phone order for delivery at 6:50 and were told it would be 45 minutes. One hour and 15 minutes later we called back and they had lost the address. It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.  We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.  We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.  What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again.

We placed a phone order for delivery at 6:50 and were told it would be 45 minutes. One hour and 15 minutes later we called back and they had lost the address. It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.  We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.  We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.  What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again.

06/02/2022 06:16:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:16:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 06:32:19 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] BEWARE this Rosati's has changed ownership and you should avoid it.  We placed a phone order for delivery at 6:50 and were told it would be 45 minutes. One hour and 15 minutes later we called back and they had lost the address. It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.  We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.  We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.  What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again.

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:32:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 06:35:29 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] BEWARE this Rosati's has changed ownership and you should avoid it.  We placed a phone order for delivery at 6:50 and were told it would be 45 minutes. One hour and 15 minutes later we called back and they had lost the address. It wasn't clear if they had made the pizzas and they were sitting around or if they just lost the whole order. In any case, they said they'd send them right out.  We live 7 minutes away. 35 minutes later we called again and got more confusing answers about who was the manager and where our order was. We asked for a refund and told them we still wanted our pizza. Their response was that we would have to pay if we wanted the pizza, so we told them to just issue a refund and keep the pizzas. They said OK.  We then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place. During the call, the doorbell rang with Rosati's delivery person. Based on what we were told on the phone, we turned him away. He explained that they were under new management and had been messing things up all over the place. He left with the pizzas.  What a fiasco. Maybe if they stay in business long enough to figure out how to handle a simple pizza order it will be good again. We'll never know, as we're never going to be their customers again.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

This place was BOGUS with a capital B. I felt like I needed a shower after visiting Last Chance and I was only in the store for about 120 seconds. Yes, seconds.   First off hordes of people gather to wait for the store to open everyday. Then you have to hear this obnoxious speech about their deals of the day and if you let your kids run free you will be asked to leave. Shoes are a whooping 35% off, which is a deal if the shoes are not already run into the ground! During the speech they go over the return policy which is very strict, they do NOT accept returns. So it sucks for you if you get home and notice the pants you just bought have stains all over the inner seams, or if the shoes you just purchased have no insoles. WTF.   I just don't understand why if you are looking for a deal you would visit this \""flee market\"" and not just the Marshalls which is upstairs. Why anyone would want flee infested, ripped, destroyed or dirty clothes is upon me.   What I do suggest if you don't believe me is to have purell ready to go when you exit \""Last Chance.\""

06/02/2022 06:49:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:49:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Shoes are a whooping 35% off, which is a deal if the shoes are not already run into the ground! During the speech they go over the return policy which is very strict, they do NOT accept returns. So it sucks for you if you get home and notice the pants you just bought have stains all over the inner seams, or if the shoes you just purchased have no insoles. WTF.   I just don't understand why if you are looking for a deal you would visit this \""flee market\"" and not just the Marshalls which is upstairs.

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:04:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

06/02/2022 07:20:11 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I honestly thought clothes from Last Chance were clothes that came from Nordstroms not clothes that couldn't be sold at your local Salvation Army. This place was BOGUS with a capital B. I felt like I needed a shower after visiting Last Chance and I was only in the store for about 120 seconds. Yes, seconds.   First off hordes of people gather to wait for the store to open everyday. Then you have to hear this obnoxious speech about their deals of the day and if you let your kids run free you will be asked to leave. Shoes are a whooping 35% off, which is a deal if the shoes are not already run into the ground! During the speech they go over the return policy which is very strict, they do NOT accept returns. So it sucks for you if you get home and notice the pants you just bought have stains all over the inner seams, or if the shoes you just purchased have no insoles. WTF.   I just don't understand why if you are looking for a deal you would visit this \""flee market\"" and not just the Marshalls which is upstairs. Why anyone would want flee infested, ripped, destroyed or dirty clothes is upon me.   What I do suggest if you don't believe me is to have purell ready to go when you exit \""Last Chance.\""

06/02/2022 07:20:20 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:20:20 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

This place was BOGUS with a capital B. I felt like I needed a shower after visiting Last Chance and I was only in the store for about 120 seconds. Yes, seconds.   First off hordes of people gather to wait for the store to open everyday. Then you have to hear this obnoxious speech about their deals of the day and if you let your kids run free you will be asked to leave. Shoes are a whooping 35% off, which is a deal if the shoes are not already run into the ground! During the speech they go over the return policy which is very strict, they do NOT accept returns. So it sucks for you if you get home and notice the pants you just bought have stains all over the inner seams, or if the shoes you just purchased have no insoles. WTF.   I just don't understand why if you are looking for a deal you would visit this \""flee market\"" and not just the Marshalls which is upstairs. Why anyone would want flee infested, ripped, destroyed or dirty clothes is upon me.   What I do suggest if you don't believe me is to have purell ready to go when you exit \""Last Chance.\""

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:36:14 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

06/02/2022 07:52:54 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 07:52:54 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18.

06/02/2022 07:53:03 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:53:03 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 07:55:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Stopped into eat while attending the 2011 ironman.  There was also a Badger football game going one so the place was packed.  Even though we had over 10 people in our group they seated us as soon as they could.  Staff was very friendly, service was prompt and food really good.  Would go back and recommend!

06/02/2022 07:55:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We were provided samples of several flavors of the house made gelato by the owner's husband.  Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

06/02/2022 07:55:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 07:55:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Went to the new place on Saturday.  Kind of swanky looking on the inside and warm.  Beer was great, I LOVE Hopalicious!  Our group of 8 ended up getting a nice spot upstairs around the couches.  Staff was great, everything was great.  Highly recommend

06/02/2022 07:55:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18.

We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes.

06/02/2022 08:07:21 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18.

06/02/2022 08:07:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 08:07:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 08:21:51 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 08:21:51 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18.

06/02/2022 08:22:00 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 08:22:00 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 08:25:01 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Went to the new place on Saturday.  Kind of swanky looking on the inside and warm.  Beer was great, I LOVE Hopalicious!  Our group of 8 ended up getting a nice spot upstairs around the couches.  Staff was great, everything was great.  Highly recommend

06/02/2022 08:25:01 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18.

06/02/2022 08:37:08 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18.

06/02/2022 08:37:17 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 08:37:17 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 08:53:29 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 08:53:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

06/02/2022 08:53:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Holy shit, I had the most amazing time EVER at XS. My friend knows a promoter there who got four us (all girls) in for free around 1 am on a Saturday night when Calvin Harris was DJing. First of all, let me just say that EDM is not my thing at all, but Calvin Harris was AH-MAZ-ING. The theatrics and sound were soooooo good -- it was like being at a full-fledged rave. I had a blast dancing, and there wasn't a single creep to be found on the packed floor. My girlfriends and I met so many attractive guys and had a blast. We didn't leave until around 5 am, and even then the place was still packed.  Only negative experience was going to the bar and asking for water, only to be charged $16 for two bottles of Fiji. When I explained to the bartender that my friend and I just wanted tap water, she snootily told us to go to the water fountain. Uh... what? Luckily the guy standing next to me at the bar stepped in and bought the water for us :)  BY FAR the best clubbing experience I've ever had. I'm totally making a beeline for XS next time I come to Vegas.

06/02/2022 08:53:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas.   We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.  We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs.   The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.  I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious.   I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.

06/02/2022 08:53:39 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 08:53:39 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

06/02/2022 08:56:38 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Holy shit, I had the most amazing time EVER at XS. My friend knows a promoter there who got four us (all girls) in for free around 1 am on a Saturday night when Calvin Harris was DJing. First of all, let me just say that EDM is not my thing at all, but Calvin Harris was AH-MAZ-ING. The theatrics and sound were soooooo good -- it was like being at a full-fledged rave. I had a blast dancing, and there wasn't a single creep to be found on the packed floor. My girlfriends and I met so many attractive guys and had a blast. We didn't leave until around 5 am, and even then the place was still packed.  Only negative experience was going to the bar and asking for water, only to be charged $16 for two bottles of Fiji. When I explained to the bartender that my friend and I just wanted tap water, she snootily told us to go to the water fountain. Uh... what? Luckily the guy standing next to me at the bar stepped in and bought the water for us :)  BY FAR the best clubbing experience I've ever had. I'm totally making a beeline for XS next time I come to Vegas.

06/02/2022 08:56:38 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas.   We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.  We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs.   The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.  I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious.   I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.

06/02/2022 09:08:24 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 09:08:24 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 09:08:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

06/02/2022 09:08:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Holy shit, I had the most amazing time EVER at XS. My friend knows a promoter there who got four us (all girls) in for free around 1 am on a Saturday night when Calvin Harris was DJing. First of all, let me just say that EDM is not my thing at all, but Calvin Harris was AH-MAZ-ING. The theatrics and sound were soooooo good -- it was like being at a full-fledged rave. I had a blast dancing, and there wasn't a single creep to be found on the packed floor. My girlfriends and I met so many attractive guys and had a blast. We didn't leave until around 5 am, and even then the place was still packed.  Only negative experience was going to the bar and asking for water, only to be charged $16 for two bottles of Fiji. When I explained to the bartender that my friend and I just wanted tap water, she snootily told us to go to the water fountain. Uh... what? Luckily the guy standing next to me at the bar stepped in and bought the water for us :)  BY FAR the best clubbing experience I've ever had. I'm totally making a beeline for XS next time I come to Vegas.

06/02/2022 09:08:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas.   We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.  We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs.   The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.  I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious.   I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.

06/02/2022 09:08:34 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 09:08:34 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 09:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 09:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 09:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

06/02/2022 09:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Holy shit, I had the most amazing time EVER at XS. My friend knows a promoter there who got four us (all girls) in for free around 1 am on a Saturday night when Calvin Harris was DJing. First of all, let me just say that EDM is not my thing at all, but Calvin Harris was AH-MAZ-ING. The theatrics and sound were soooooo good -- it was like being at a full-fledged rave. I had a blast dancing, and there wasn't a single creep to be found on the packed floor. My girlfriends and I met so many attractive guys and had a blast. We didn't leave until around 5 am, and even then the place was still packed.  Only negative experience was going to the bar and asking for water, only to be charged $16 for two bottles of Fiji. When I explained to the bartender that my friend and I just wanted tap water, she snootily told us to go to the water fountain. Uh... what? Luckily the guy standing next to me at the bar stepped in and bought the water for us :)  BY FAR the best clubbing experience I've ever had. I'm totally making a beeline for XS next time I come to Vegas.

06/02/2022 09:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas.   We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.  We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs.   The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.  I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious.   I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.

06/02/2022 09:23:01 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 09:23:01 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 09:26:02 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 09:26:02 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 09:26:03 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

06/02/2022 09:26:03 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Holy shit, I had the most amazing time EVER at XS. My friend knows a promoter there who got four us (all girls) in for free around 1 am on a Saturday night when Calvin Harris was DJing. First of all, let me just say that EDM is not my thing at all, but Calvin Harris was AH-MAZ-ING. The theatrics and sound were soooooo good -- it was like being at a full-fledged rave. I had a blast dancing, and there wasn't a single creep to be found on the packed floor. My girlfriends and I met so many attractive guys and had a blast. We didn't leave until around 5 am, and even then the place was still packed.  Only negative experience was going to the bar and asking for water, only to be charged $16 for two bottles of Fiji. When I explained to the bartender that my friend and I just wanted tap water, she snootily told us to go to the water fountain. Uh... what? Luckily the guy standing next to me at the bar stepped in and bought the water for us :)  BY FAR the best clubbing experience I've ever had. I'm totally making a beeline for XS next time I come to Vegas.

06/02/2022 09:26:03 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas.   We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.  We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs.   The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.  I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious.   I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 09:38:17 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 09:38:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

06/02/2022 09:38:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Holy shit, I had the most amazing time EVER at XS. My friend knows a promoter there who got four us (all girls) in for free around 1 am on a Saturday night when Calvin Harris was DJing. First of all, let me just say that EDM is not my thing at all, but Calvin Harris was AH-MAZ-ING. The theatrics and sound were soooooo good -- it was like being at a full-fledged rave. I had a blast dancing, and there wasn't a single creep to be found on the packed floor. My girlfriends and I met so many attractive guys and had a blast. We didn't leave until around 5 am, and even then the place was still packed.  Only negative experience was going to the bar and asking for water, only to be charged $16 for two bottles of Fiji. When I explained to the bartender that my friend and I just wanted tap water, she snootily told us to go to the water fountain. Uh... what? Luckily the guy standing next to me at the bar stepped in and bought the water for us :)  BY FAR the best clubbing experience I've ever had. I'm totally making a beeline for XS next time I come to Vegas.

06/02/2022 09:38:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My boyfriend and I came here for one of his many birthday dinners in Vegas.   We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.  We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs.   The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.  I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.  My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious.   I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced. There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I suppose on my next Vegas trip I'll be stopping in again.

06/02/2022 09:38:26 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 09:38:26 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 09:55:02 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 09:55:02 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

Chicken & dumplings dish was good almost great, a tad salty.  But we sweat a lot in PHX and need to replace the salt!  The shrimp...fantastic.

Maverick helicopters by far the best attraction in town for visitors and locals to enjoy.  If you don't take a helicopter ride with Maverick and see the city you're missing all the sights!  Maverick helicopters by far, the city's  best value and lot a fun, overall fantastic experience!

06/02/2022 09:55:11 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 09:55:11 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 09:58:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 09:58:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

06/02/2022 10:09:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

06/02/2022 10:09:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 10:09:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 10:24:08 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 10:24:08 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

06/02/2022 10:24:17 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 10:24:17 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 10:27:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 10:27:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I recently used Vicky and Pierre to complete a new home purchase.  The process was seamless!  Vicky is SUPER responsive and we were able to close in less than 30 days.  These guys will do whatever it takes to get the job done.  I would definitely recommend the Cornerstone team, they are great!!

06/02/2022 10:27:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

Chicken & dumplings dish was good almost great, a tad salty.  But we sweat a lot in PHX and need to replace the salt!  The shrimp...fantastic.  Nice bottled beer selection  And finally!!!!!!.....for the first time in my life a server noticed when i was in the middle of a story/joke and was coming by the table & didn't interrupt!

Maverick helicopters by far the best attraction in town for visitors and locals to enjoy.  If you don't take a helicopter ride with Maverick and see the city you're missing all the sights!  Maverick helicopters by far, the city's  best value and lot a fun, overall fantastic experience!

That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

06/02/2022 10:40:20 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 10:40:20 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 10:57:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 10:57:18 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again
