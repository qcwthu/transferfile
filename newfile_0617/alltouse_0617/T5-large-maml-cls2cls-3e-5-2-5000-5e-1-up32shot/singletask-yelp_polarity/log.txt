The night of my pick-up we went to the designated pick up area at 11:20 PM.  At 11:26 PM I called just to check if the shuttle would be on time.  The dispatcher informed me that they are running about 5 to 10 minutes late.  At 11:40 PM I called back and asked for an update.  The dispatcher informed me that the shuttle driver came by at 11:35 PM and no one was there.  I informed the dispatcher that we have been out front from 11:20 PM and the door man of the hotel was out front since 11:00 PM and no airport shuttle came by. We had to catch a cab to the airport.  If they can lie about this,  I hate to think what else they would do.  I will attempt to get reimbursement for my cab fare which I think they will not do.

I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 00:08:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My wife and I brought round trip tickets from  and to McCarran.  The person at the desk informed me that I do not have to call for pick-up service because it is noted on the ticket and to be sure to be at the designated location by 11:30 PM. The night of my pick-up we went to the designated pick up area at 11:20 PM.  At 11:26 PM I called just to check if the shuttle would be on time.  The dispatcher informed me that they are running about 5 to 10 minutes late.  At 11:40 PM I called back and asked for an update.  The dispatcher informed me that the shuttle driver came by at 11:35 PM and no one was there.  I informed the dispatcher that we have been out front from 11:20 PM and the door man of the hotel was out front since 11:00 PM and no airport shuttle came by. We had to catch a cab to the airport.  If they can lie about this,  I hate to think what else they would do.  I will attempt to get reimbursement for my cab fare which I think they will not do.  A follow up review to follow after I talk to them.   Paul Y.

06/02/2022 00:24:33 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My wife and I brought round trip tickets from  and to McCarran.  The person at the desk informed me that I do not have to call for pick-up service because it is noted on the ticket and to be sure to be at the designated location by 11:30 PM. The night of my pick-up we went to the designated pick up area at 11:20 PM.  At 11:26 PM I called just to check if the shuttle would be on time.  The dispatcher informed me that they are running about 5 to 10 minutes late.  At 11:40 PM I called back and asked for an update.  The dispatcher informed me that the shuttle driver came by at 11:35 PM and no one was there.  I informed the dispatcher that we have been out front from 11:20 PM and the door man of the hotel was out front since 11:00 PM and no airport shuttle came by. We had to catch a cab to the airport.  If they can lie about this,  I hate to think what else they would do.  I will attempt to get reimbursement for my cab fare which I think they will not do.  A follow up review to follow after I talk to them.   Paul Y.

06/02/2022 00:24:34 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 00:24:34 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 00:55:19 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 00:55:19 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 01:16:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 01:16:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My wife and I brought round trip tickets from  and to McCarran.  The person at the desk informed me that I do not have to call for pick-up service because it is noted on the ticket and to be sure to be at the designated location by 11:30 PM. The night of my pick-up we went to the designated pick up area at 11:20 PM.  At 11:26 PM I called just to check if the shuttle would be on time.  The dispatcher informed me that they are running about 5 to 10 minutes late.  At 11:40 PM I called back and asked for an update.  The dispatcher informed me that the shuttle driver came by at 11:35 PM and no one was there.  I informed the dispatcher that we have been out front from 11:20 PM and the door man of the hotel was out front since 11:00 PM and no airport shuttle came by. We had to catch a cab to the airport.  If they can lie about this,  I hate to think what else they would do.  I will attempt to get reimbursement for my cab fare which I think they will not do.  A follow up review to follow after I talk to them.   Paul Y.

06/02/2022 01:16:56 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 01:16:56 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 01:32:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

06/02/2022 01:32:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] My wife and I brought round trip tickets from  and to McCarran.  The person at the desk informed me that I do not have to call for pick-up service because it is noted on the ticket and to be sure to be at the designated location by 11:30 PM. The night of my pick-up we went to the designated pick up area at 11:20 PM.  At 11:26 PM I called just to check if the shuttle would be on time.  The dispatcher informed me that they are running about 5 to 10 minutes late.  At 11:40 PM I called back and asked for an update.  The dispatcher informed me that the shuttle driver came by at 11:35 PM and no one was there.  I informed the dispatcher that we have been out front from 11:20 PM and the door man of the hotel was out front since 11:00 PM and no airport shuttle came by. We had to catch a cab to the airport.  If they can lie about this,  I hate to think what else they would do.  I will attempt to get reimbursement for my cab fare which I think they will not do.  A follow up review to follow after I talk to them.   Paul Y.

06/02/2022 01:48:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 01:48:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 02:12:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 02:36:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 02:36:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

06/02/2022 02:45:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

06/02/2022 02:45:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] High ticket prices, seats don't recline, tiny theater and dirty bathrooms.   That sums this place up. If it hadn't been for a time crunch and a convenient show time i doubt I would have come here and after this won't be coming back. Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.

06/02/2022 02:45:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

06/02/2022 02:45:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] now i've discovered why i've never given this place a bother.  as previous reviews have attested-- service is non-existent; instead, its the peripheral glance of the same servers rushing past your table as if they were real fucking busy. really? we've been waiting for half an hour or so already. deciding that my ass had become numb from waiting, we managed to flag down a hastily walking server and finally gave our order.   so, pomegranate margarita is OK. seafood kibis is frozen product, thawed, fried, not very seafood. lamb kibis is the less appetizing $12.95 unfolded version of much tastier gyro that can be found elsewhere for half the price. i suppose its good we were saved the task of having to answer to \""how's everything tasting?\""...because, quite precisely, everything is not tasting [good] at all.   fez is one of those places that you go to, wait a long time (in hopes that the food redeems itself), and receive a server who places more importance on their strut and getting your friends number. ultimately you are left with underwhelming food, money and time, wasted.

06/02/2022 03:00:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 03:00:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

06/02/2022 03:20:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 03:20:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 03:42:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This was my home for 4 days and 3 nights, I shared it with a friend and there was plenty of room for drunken stumbling, recovery and attempting to remember what we did, who we talked to and why'd we drink like that again...   The room was a good size, with a kitchenette, microwave, sink and all the normal pots, pans, plates and flatware you'd expect in a kitchen. There was even a blender, fridge and a toaster for use. I guess these are actually high rise condos and some people live in these places. Sickness.   The shower was big, the spa tub was nice, sinks nice and the toilet was as expected. My only problem with the bathroom was that there is NO fan in the toilet area...the guy I was sharing the room with is a health nut and was taking protein powder...lemme just say....BLEH!   We stayed on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the strip during the day and night. The windows are tinted so if you're too drunk to close em the night before you aren't getting beamed in the eyes by the dreaded Vegas sun. There's complimentary Internet access so I was able to post my shenanigans on FB and let others know what type of drunken debauchery was going down.   The problem I had with the hotel was that it was a bit of a journey to get to the main hotel as well as the food areas. But other than that, the staff was helpful, the maids were nice and they don't bother you if you and a friend walk in stumbling and your friend barfs in the empty vase on display in the Lobby.   Fun times! I'll be back, dunno if I'll get accepted back but I'll try! : )

06/02/2022 03:42:38 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 03:42:38 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 03:53:46 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This was my home for 4 days and 3 nights, I shared it with a friend and there was plenty of room for drunken stumbling, recovery and attempting to remember what we did, who we talked to and why'd we drink like that again...   The room was a good size, with a kitchenette, microwave, sink and all the normal pots, pans, plates and flatware you'd expect in a kitchen. There was even a blender, fridge and a toaster for use. I guess these are actually high rise condos and some people live in these places. Sickness.   The shower was big, the spa tub was nice, sinks nice and the toilet was as expected. My only problem with the bathroom was that there is NO fan in the toilet area...the guy I was sharing the room with is a health nut and was taking protein powder...lemme just say....BLEH!   We stayed on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the strip during the day and night. The windows are tinted so if you're too drunk to close em the night before you aren't getting beamed in the eyes by the dreaded Vegas sun. There's complimentary Internet access so I was able to post my shenanigans on FB and let others know what type of drunken debauchery was going down.   The problem I had with the hotel was that it was a bit of a journey to get to the main hotel as well as the food areas. But other than that, the staff was helpful, the maids were nice and they don't bother you if you and a friend walk in stumbling and your friend barfs in the empty vase on display in the Lobby.   Fun times! I'll be back, dunno if I'll get accepted back but I'll try! : )

06/02/2022 04:11:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 04:11:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

06/02/2022 04:11:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 04:11:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic service!!! Steak was great. However, I ordered my ribeye cap rare-plus and it came out almost medium. Might have been the sizzling plate. Nevertheless it was tender and flavorful. Great atmosphere! Very unsuspecting place in a surprisingly upscale center.   Dress code: none. We came in jeans and tee and even a baseball cap. No dirty looks. No questions/comments/etc. Granted a good portion of diners were in more dapper attire. Oh wells!

06/02/2022 04:11:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This was my home for 4 days and 3 nights, I shared it with a friend and there was plenty of room for drunken stumbling, recovery and attempting to remember what we did, who we talked to and why'd we drink like that again...   The room was a good size, with a kitchenette, microwave, sink and all the normal pots, pans, plates and flatware you'd expect in a kitchen. There was even a blender, fridge and a toaster for use. I guess these are actually high rise condos and some people live in these places. Sickness.   The shower was big, the spa tub was nice, sinks nice and the toilet was as expected. My only problem with the bathroom was that there is NO fan in the toilet area...the guy I was sharing the room with is a health nut and was taking protein powder...lemme just say....BLEH!   We stayed on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the strip during the day and night. The windows are tinted so if you're too drunk to close em the night before you aren't getting beamed in the eyes by the dreaded Vegas sun. There's complimentary Internet access so I was able to post my shenanigans on FB and let others know what type of drunken debauchery was going down.   The problem I had with the hotel was that it was a bit of a journey to get to the main hotel as well as the food areas. But other than that, the staff was helpful, the maids were nice and they don't bother you if you and a friend walk in stumbling and your friend barfs in the empty vase on display in the Lobby.   Fun times! I'll be back, dunno if I'll get accepted back but I'll try! : )

Even though we had over 10 people in our group they seated us as soon as they could.  Staff was very friendly, service was prompt and food really good.  Would go back and recommend!

06/02/2022 04:15:48 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We were provided samples of several flavors of the house made gelato by the owner's husband.  Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

06/02/2022 04:15:48 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

06/02/2022 04:32:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 04:32:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

The room was a good size, with a kitchenette, microwave, sink and all the normal pots, pans, plates and flatware you'd expect in a kitchen. There was even a blender, fridge and a toaster for use. I guess these are actually high rise condos and some people live in these places. Sickness.   The shower was big, the spa tub was nice, sinks nice and the toilet was as expected. My only problem with the bathroom was that there is NO fan in the toilet area...the guy I was sharing the room with is a health nut and was taking protein powder...lemme just say....BLEH!   We stayed on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the strip during the day and night. The windows are tinted so if you're too drunk to close em the night before you aren't getting beamed in the eyes by the dreaded Vegas sun. There's complimentary Internet access so I was able to post my shenanigans on FB and let others know what type of drunken debauchery was going down.   The problem I had with the hotel was that it was a bit of a journey to get to the main hotel as well as the food areas. But other than that, the staff was helpful, the maids were nice and they don't bother you if you and a friend walk in stumbling and your friend barfs in the empty vase on display in the Lobby.   Fun times! I'll be back, dunno if I'll get accepted back but I'll try! : )

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 04:56:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 04:56:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 04:56:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 05:30:08 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 05:30:08 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 05:30:08 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!

Try to not seat in the first 3 rows, you'll get wet. You can get drinks and popcorn, but they are pretty expensive.

06/02/2022 05:34:29 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Dr. Amy is the BEST! She made me feel like family and took care of me and my dental situation. I did not go out of there in tears like my last dentist. Her front office staff Karla was understanding and very helpful. Thank you Dr. Amy and your staff for making me feel so comfortable and welcome.

06/02/2022 05:34:29 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I've been here a few times and let me tell you it's been a great experience in every visit, one of my two favorite appetizers is the nachos with carne Asada and the chorizo with queso, I could just keep coming back for these two,along with a beer at their newly added bar which by the way the variety it's pretty awesome, they have all kinds of tequilas you just wanna try them all haha! I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!

06/02/2022 05:50:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 05:50:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 05:50:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

Try to not seat in the first 3 rows, you'll get wet. You can get drinks and popcorn, but they are pretty expensive.

06/02/2022 05:50:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Dr. Amy is the BEST! She made me feel like family and took care of me and my dental situation. I did not go out of there in tears like my last dentist. Her front office staff Karla was understanding and very helpful. Thank you Dr. Amy and your staff for making me feel so comfortable and welcome.

I'm sure they won't have a problem with that!,they also have a patio with a mister system which I haven't personally been into just yet because I've been there during the winter but that's the one feature I'm looking forward to go to during the summer; over all I thing it's a great place  to go and enjoy a nice meal with familly or friends, I will definitely come back!!

06/02/2022 05:54:51 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 05:54:51 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 06:10:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:10:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 06:10:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

06/02/2022 06:10:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

06/02/2022 06:31:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:31:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 06:31:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 06:31:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.

06/02/2022 06:31:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] So I've been off work randomly on the same day SOHO has been closed for the past month and finally this afternoon I got to enjoy the place.   Every single thing I've read and head is true. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!

06/02/2022 06:51:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 06:51:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 06:51:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 06:51:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.

06/02/2022 06:51:53 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] So I've been off work randomly on the same day SOHO has been closed for the past month and finally this afternoon I got to enjoy the place.   Every single thing I've read and head is true. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!

06/02/2022 06:56:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 06:56:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I recently used Vicky and Pierre to complete a new home purchase.  The process was seamless!  Vicky is SUPER responsive and we were able to close in less than 30 days.  These guys will do whatever it takes to get the job done.  I would definitely recommend the Cornerstone team, they are great!!

06/02/2022 06:56:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

06/02/2022 06:56:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Finally a big Chinese buffet that's good!!  A buddy and myself checked this place out last week and I couldn't be more happier.  Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.  Very good food and service!

06/02/2022 06:56:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Not too shabby.  A nice getaway from the flashy lights of the Vegas Strip.  They had an ok selection of drafts (I drank Bass) and it was a place I could actually hold a conversation with my friends without talking loudly like most bars we had been to all week.  Thank goodness there are low key places to hang out at in Vegas! haha

06/02/2022 06:56:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] So I've been off work randomly on the same day SOHO has been closed for the past month and finally this afternoon I got to enjoy the place.   Every single thing I've read and head is true. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Review of Buffet:  UGH!  It was very very underwhelming.   Maybe regular menu is great, but do not get the buffet IMHO.  About half the restaurant was eating the buffet... unfortunately I was in the idiot half of the crowd.

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I recently used Vicky and Pierre to complete a new home purchase.  The process was seamless!  Vicky is SUPER responsive and we were able to close in less than 30 days.  These guys will do whatever it takes to get the job done.  I would definitely recommend the Cornerstone team, they are great!!

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Finally a big Chinese buffet that's good!!  A buddy and myself checked this place out last week and I couldn't be more happier.  Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.  Very good food and service!

They had an ok selection of drafts (I drank Bass) and it was a place I could actually hold a conversation with my friends without talking loudly like most bars we had been to all week.  Thank goodness there are low key places to hang out at in Vegas! haha

06/02/2022 07:12:10 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] So I've been off work randomly on the same day SOHO has been closed for the past month and finally this afternoon I got to enjoy the place.   Every single thing I've read and head is true. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!

That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.  Very good food and service!

06/02/2022 07:33:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] So I've been off work randomly on the same day SOHO has been closed for the past month and finally this afternoon I got to enjoy the place.   Every single thing I've read and head is true. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!

06/02/2022 07:33:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:33:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.   Best sushi I've very had and best deal. I grew up in hawaii and have had the best of the best from my Japanese heritage, yet this place gave me 5 diamond service with super good attitudes and great service for an amazing deal. Love it!

06/02/2022 07:58:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

06/02/2022 07:58:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again
