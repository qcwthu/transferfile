I didn't mean to do that, but it was my alarm clock that didn't wake me up. W: That is not a proper excuse. You could set it ahead of the exact time so that you could have got up earlier and not have been late.

[SEP] W: Dr. Steven, I am thinking about changing my major before the end of the freshman year. M: What are you studying now? W: I am taking three genera] requirements and American history and American literature this. semester. Last semester I took four requirements and freshman French. M: I believe it's not too late to change your major because you've mainly taken general requirements which all freshmen have to take. Also we have twelve electives so the mo lit courses will be included in them, so you can change your major without losing any credit hours. W: I am very happy to know I am still able to change my major. I am interested in writing newspaper articles, and after finishing my degree I would like to work for some newspaper firm. M: Oh, I think you will be a good writer. W: Dr. Steven, when do students start practical training? M: They don't begin practical training in reporting until the sophomore year. Journalism 121 normally is taken in the freshman year as a general background course. W: I see. I will take the course next semester. Thank you very much for your help. M: You're welcome. I look forward to seeing you in my department. [SEP]  (A) English sociology. (B) Journalism 121. (C) Freshman French.

This is the third time you have been late for class within this week. And every time you went in, you disturbed the teacher's class. M: Sorry, Miss. I didn't mean to do that, but it was my alarm clock that didn't wake me up. W: That is not a proper excuse. You could set it ahead of the exact time so that you could have got up earlier and not have been late. M: I did that, but it seemed useless when I found the batteries had run out after I woke up this morning. I rushed to school and luckily, my neighbour Mr. Green gave me a hand and took me to school with his car. W: So you could have made it. But you were still late for class. M: The thing is, when I got off, I found I had left my bag in his car. And it was too late to get it back when I realized that. I went straight to the nearest shop and gave him a call. I waited for five minutes before Mr. Green drove back. W: Finally, he gave you your bag and you came to the classroom and you were already 15 minutes late for class at that time. Is that all? M: Miss, you seem to know the entire story. May I go back to class now? Otherwise I will be late for the following class. [SEP]  (A) The batteries ran out. (B) The alarm clock was broken.

W: I am taking three genera] requirements and American history and American literature this. semester. Last semester I took four requirements and freshman French. M: I believe it's not too late to change your major because you've mainly taken general requirements which all freshmen have to take. Also we have twelve electives so the mo lit courses will be included in them, so you can change your major without losing any credit hours. W: I am very happy to know I am still able to change my major. I am interested in writing newspaper articles, and after finishing my degree I would like to work for some newspaper firm. M: Oh, I think you will be a good writer. W: Dr. Steven, when do students start practical training? M: They don't begin practical training in reporting until the sophomore year. Journalism 121 normally is taken in the freshman year as a general background course. W: I see. I will take the course next semester. Thank you very much for your help. M: You're welcome. I look forward to seeing you in my department. [SEP]  (A) English sociology. (B) Journalism 121. (C) Freshman French.

She hasn't been very well in the last couple of weeks. M: Has she seen a doctor since she's been ill? W: Yes, she has. The doctor told her to take it easy for a while, but she hasn't been taking his advice. She's as busy as usual. M: Do you think it useful for me to ask her to have a rest when I go to see her? Or shall we go together? W: I think you can go yourself and show your concern to her since she sometimes would take your advice. So it's unnecessary for me to go with you. What's more, I've got some other things to do at the moment. [SEP]  (A) Two days ago. (B) Two weeks ago. (C) A week ago.

I think there'll be huge changes in the ways people use cars. New laws will be made about what kind of car you can own and when you can drive. W: Maybe there'll just be too many of them on the roads. The air will be so seriously polluted that nobody will be able to breathe. M: Exactly. People will have to rely on trains. W: Why do you say that? M: Well, we won't be able to use cars, and airports take up too much space. That leaves trains. W: Huh. So do you think there'll be more efficient train systems between cities? M: Sure. They'll enable people to travel between cities in a matter of hours. There may even be trains going under the oceans to connect the main continents. W: Under the oceans? Oh, no!

M: How about the course? W: The course was very good. The teachers were nice. They taught us to listen, speak, read and write in English, but it was mostly speaking. One interesting thing I found was that the American classes are different from our classes here because the students have a lot more freedom. You can sit anywhere you like in the classroom. You can ask the teachers questions at any time during the class, and you are welcome to share your ideas with the class. I really like this kind of class. M: How interesting!

I think there'll be huge changes in the ways people use cars. New laws will be made about what kind of car you can own and when you can drive. W: Maybe there'll just be too many of them on the roads. The air will be so seriously polluted that nobody will be able to breathe. M: Exactly. People will have to rely on trains. W: Why do you say that? M: Well, we won't be able to use cars, and airports take up too much space. That leaves trains. W: Huh. So do you think there'll be more efficient train systems between cities? M: Sure. They'll enable people to travel between cities in a matter of hours. There may even be trains going under the oceans to connect the main continents. W: Under the oceans? Oh, no! I get nervous enough flying on a plane. [SEP]  (A) Air pollution. (B) Traffic jam. (C) Oil shortage.

I went to New York to attend a summer course in English. M: Wow. You were lucky. How long did you stay there? W: About 50 days. I went there on July 5th and came back on August 25th. M: How about the course? W: The course was very good. The teachers were nice. They taught us to listen, speak, read and write in English, but it was mostly speaking. One interesting thing I found was that the American classes are different from our classes here because the students have a lot more freedom. You can sit anywhere you like in the classroom. You can ask the teachers questions at any time during the class, and you are welcome to share your ideas with the class. I really like this kind of class. M: How interesting!

I think there'll be huge changes in the ways people use cars. New laws will be made about what kind of car you can own and when you can drive. W: Maybe there'll just be too many of them on the roads. The air will be so seriously polluted that nobody will be able to breathe. M: Exactly. People will have to rely on trains. W: Why do you say that?

Josh: Actually, I want to work for a Web hosting company. Kelly: What would you do there? Josh: Well, in a nut shell, Web hosting companies provide space for people to store and run their Websites. Does it sound like I know what I'm talking about? Kelly: Oh, yeah, sort of. Josh: Well, And then, sort of? Well, they allow people to run their Web sites without having to buy and maintain their own servers, and I'd like to work in technical support, you know, helping customers resolve computer-related problems with their sites. And you know I'm a good communicator. Kelly: So, how's the pay for that kind of job? Josh: Well, most people I know start out with a very reasonable salary; you can earn pay increases depending on your performance. Kelly: So, what about benefits? Josh: Oh, the benefits are pretty good. They provide health insurance, two weeks (of) paid vacation a year, and opportunities for advancement. And in the end, I'd like to work in a management position. You know, sitting back, enjoying the view out of the twentieth-story window of the office building. Something like that. Kelly: Well, is there any long-term job security in a job like that? Josh: Uhh. That's hard to tell. I mean, the Internet is booming, and these kinds of companies are sprouting up everywhere, which is a good thing, but just like the dot-com era, you never know how long things will last.

Yeah, but, you know, I don't have the resources to go back to school at the moment; however, the job I am looking at will pay for some classes after I have been with the company for six months.

I got into that wedding dress with great difficulty. It was too small. M: Why didn't you get one your size? W: Oh, it was my grandmother's - my mother wore it on her wedding day, and I really wanted to wear it on mine. I suffered for six months so I could wear it. M: How did you do it? W: Do you know this diet that many actors are doing? I don't think it's very healthy if you do it for a long time, but it really works. M: I think meat is not allowed in your diet. W: No, actually, you can eat things like, um, roast chicken, steak, and bacon, but you can't eat any bread and butter. M: Is it the diet that you love but have to avoid? W: That's right.

M: It is. I can't believe it's so thin! What kind of computer is it? W: It's an Apple MacBook Air. It's very lightweight and has a bunch of built-in apps. I couldn't be happier with it.

M: Does the computer have a disk drive? W: No, it doesn't, but I don't need one. All of my documents are online. M: Well, you're very lucky. It will be great to have this when you start looking for jobs. W: I already have. Today, I spent the day at the café working on my résumé. This computer has great battery life. M: Well, that's good.

It's interesting to see what people used to enjoy reading. Did you see this old book of children's stories? M: Some of these books aren't so old, though... See? This mystery was published only six years ago. It cost seventy-five cents. You can't beat that. W: Hey! Look at this! M: What? Are you getting interested in nineteenth century poetry all of a sudden? W: No. Look at the inscription! Someone gave this book as a present, and wrote a note on the inside of the front cover. It's dated 1893. Maybe it's worth something. M: Everything on that shelf is worth fifty cents. W: But if this is a signature of someone who is well known, it might bring a lot more. I hear William Shakespeare's signature is worth about a million dollars. [SEP]  (A) He gave gifts to millions of people. (B) He was a very wealthy man in his times.

Frank: It must be an exciting trip. Terry: Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. Frank: That's really beautiful. Terry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. Frank: I can't believe it. Terry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. Frank: Did you stay in a hotel? Terry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Frank: What's your general impression of New York? Terry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.

W: I hope not. Anyway, I am going to apply. And I'd like to ask you to write a recommendation for me, if it is not too much trouble. M: No trouble at all. I'd be glad to do it.

I'm a machine operator working in the assembly workshop. M: Oh, are you? Then you have a six-day week, don't you? W: Yes. And we work eight hours a day, but this includes a one -hour break. M: What about the huge machines used in your factory? I know you make heavy machines yourselves. But I wonder if you also use machines imported from abroad. W: Most of them are made in China, some even by our factory. Only a few were bought from other countries. M: But I see the machines turned out here are quite modem and efficient. W: Following the national policy of self - reliance and hard - working struggle, we've tried our best in the past few years to improve our equipment. However, there is still a lot more to do. M: Now the question about yourself. I hope you don't mind it. How much do you earn each month? W: My monthly wage is 3,500 RMB, not including the extra pay of about 500 for extra work I put in. M: That sounds reasonable indeed. I'm very interested in worker's welfare here. What other benefits do you workers get, I wonder? W: Like other factories in China, our factory offers free medical service for workers. [SEP]  (A) $3,500. (B) $500. (C) 3,500RMB.

W: Well, you know Sarah and I moved into an off-campus apartment in the fall,on the west side of town. Any way, we've been happy with it until the past couple of months. M: Yeah. What happened? W: Well,the dishwasher broken down,so we reported it to Ms. Corners,the owner. She said she'd take care of it, but a month went by and nothing happened. M: Did you get back in touch with her? W: I got a repairperson to give me an estimate,and then I sent it to her. When I didn't hear from her,I had the repair done. And I deducted the cost from the rent check. M: So what's the problem? W: She called here madly. She said she could have gotten the repair done for less money. Now, she's threatening to expel us for not paying the full rent. M: Hold on, Paula. It does sound pretty serious. But I'm sure you can all sit down and work this out. W: Well,you're over at the law school. So, I wondered if you would mind coming with Sarah and me when we go to talk to Ms. Corners. We're supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight. M: Sure. I haven't studied a lot about contracts yet,but I'll be glad to help you straighten things out. Why don't I stop by about 7:30? W: Thanks Sam. You are our lifesaver.

Frank: It must be an exciting trip. Terry: Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. Frank: That's really beautiful. Terry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. Frank: I can't believe it. Terry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. Frank: Did you stay in a hotel? Terry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Frank: What's your general impression of New York? Terry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.

Frank: It must be an exciting trip. Terry: Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. Frank: That's really beautiful. Terry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. Frank: I can't believe it. Terry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. Frank: Did you stay in a hotel? Terry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Frank: What's your general impression of New York? Terry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.

Frank: It must be an exciting trip. Terry: Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. Frank: That's really beautiful. Terry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. Frank: I can't believe it. Terry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. Frank: Did you stay in a hotel? Terry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Frank: What's your general impression of New York? Terry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.

W: I got a repairperson to give me an estimate,and then I sent it to her. When I didn't hear from her,I had the repair done. And I deducted the cost from the rent check. M: So what's the problem? W: She called here madly. She said she could have gotten the repair done for less money. Now, she's threatening to expel us for not paying the full rent. M: Hold on, Paula. It does sound pretty serious. But I'm sure you can all sit down and work this out. W: Well,you're over at the law school.

Frank: It must be an exciting trip. Terry: Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. Frank: That's really beautiful. Terry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. Frank: I can't believe it. Terry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. Frank: Did you stay in a hotel? Terry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Frank: What's your general impression of New York? Terry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.

M: Yes, let me see now. You are studying mathematics, aren't you?. W: Yes, I am. But I'd like to apply for admission to the engineering college next year. M: I see. Have you asked your parents for their advice about this? W: Yes, I have. They think it is a good idea. M: Well, your record here has been very good. I don't think you will have much trouble. W: I hope not. Anyway, I am going to apply. And I'd like to ask you to write a recommendation for me, if it is not too much trouble. M: No trouble at all. I'd be glad to do it.

I'm a machine operator working in the assembly workshop. M: Oh, are you? Then you have a six-day week, don't you? W: Yes. And we work eight hours a day, but this includes a one -hour break. M: What about the huge machines used in your factory? I know you make heavy machines yourselves. But I wonder if you also use machines imported from abroad. W: Most of them are made in China, some even by our factory. Only a few were bought from other countries. M: But I see the machines turned out here are quite modem and efficient. W: Following the national policy of self - reliance and hard - working struggle, we've tried our best in the past few years to improve our equipment. However, there is still a lot more to do. M: Now the question about yourself. I hope you don't mind it. How much do you earn each month? W: My monthly wage is 3,500 RMB, not including the extra pay of about 500 for extra work I put in. M: That sounds reasonable indeed. I'm very interested in worker's welfare here. What other benefits do you workers get, I wonder?

W: Well,the dishwasher broken down,so we reported it to Ms. Corners,the owner. She said she'd take care of it, but a month went by and nothing happened. M: Did you get back in touch with her? W: I got a repairperson to give me an estimate,and then I sent it to her. When I didn't hear from her,I had the repair done. And I deducted the cost from the rent check. M: So what's the problem? W: She called here madly. She said she could have gotten the repair done for less money. Now, she's threatening to expel us for not paying the full rent. M: Hold on, Paula. It does sound pretty serious. But I'm sure you can all sit down and work this out. W: Well,you're over at the law school.

Frank: It must be an exciting trip. Terry: Well, I've really seen lots of things. I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan. Frank: That's really beautiful. Terry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters. Frank: I can't believe it. Terry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though. Frank: Did you stay in a hotel? Terry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Frank: What's your general impression of New York? Terry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.

W: She called here madly. She said she could have gotten the repair done for less money. Now, she's threatening to expel us for not paying the full rent. M: Hold on, Paula. It does sound pretty serious. But I'm sure you can all sit down and work this out. W: Well,you're over at the law school.

And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. "Another fattening cookie recipe." But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then. [SEP]  (A) at 305 degrees (B) at 315 degrees (C) at 350 degrees

W: No, you don't. You just have to present the language simply and give the students a chance to practice speaking. M: Come to think of it, that's the way I was taught to speak Chinese. But speaking didn't help me learn to read and write Chinese. W: My students won't want to read and write English, at lease not now. They are more interested in speaking. M: You sound very knowledgeable about all this. How do you know so much? W: I took a Teaching English as a Second Language course last year when you were in China. I've also talked with the experienced teachers quite a lot. I think I would like to be an ESL teacher when I graduate. [SEP]  (A) A student. (B) A teacher. (C) A tourist.

W: Don't feel discouraged. Be patient. As you are so distinguished, you will definitely find the person who is right for you. M: To tell you the truth, I am tired of being alone. I hope to find my Mrs. Right. What should I do? W: Do you believe in Internet matchmaking service? M: That's really a new walk of life. What is it exactly? W: It helps match up singles the world over, and helps find the man and woman of their dreams. M: Oh, it must be to the taste of a certain group of people. W: The advertisement said Dream Dates has matched up thousands of singles the world over! M: Unbelievable! They must be exaggerating the figure! W: Look at the way they manage their business: they collect applicants' photos, and give the applicants questionnaires to fill out as to what type of character they are. M: I don't believe several questions can decide the type of person you're. People's characters are complicated and keep changing all the time. W: Anyway, it seems that things work well this way. The information and specifications will be entered in a large computer database. M: A computer to decide your best date? That's really ridiculous! W: Look, it promises: Dream Dates provides expert dating service and a place for singles to meet. We'll introduce you to the person uniquely qualified to be your partner. M: Sheer slogans! Not reliable! W: It says you can enroll in a free trial membership! M: I won't do it even they pay me for that! W: Well, we don't have to believe this. Maybe I can tell John, and see whether he'd like to try it. [SEP]  (A) Entering a large company without application. (B) Programming human feelings into machines.

04/25/2022 07:54:32 - INFO - __main__ -  [dream] At what temperature should you bake the cookies? [SEP] Chef Randall: Well, hello everyone, and welcome to today's show. And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. "Another fattening cookie recipe." But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then. [SEP]  (A) at 305 degrees (B) at 315 degrees (C) at 350 degrees

I'll just move my things. Hold on a minute. M: Thanks. Phwoo...I've been waiting in departure for ages. W: Mmm...The flight was delayed leaving Beijing. Security checks, you know. M: Yeah. Same here. W: Are you going to London, then? M: Yes. I'm going to the LSE to do a master's degree in International Relations. W: Really? That sounds interesting. You must be really clever. M: So are you going to London too? W: Well actually, I'm going to the University of Middlesex to do Business Studies. M: That sounds interesting. W: Well actually, it's my parents who want me to do Business Studies. I'd rather study Philosophy, but my dad wants me to take over the family business. He thinks Business Studies will make me rich.

W: I'm going to teach English to some immigrants in the university's community service program. M: That sounds interesting. Don't you need to speak a foreign language for a job like that?

And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. "Another fattening cookie recipe." But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then. [SEP]  (A) at 305 degrees (B) at 315 degrees (C) at 350 degrees

And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. "Another fattening cookie recipe." But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then. [SEP]  (A) at 305 degrees (B) at 315 degrees (C) at 350 degrees

04/25/2022 08:29:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [dream] At what temperature should you bake the cookies? [SEP] Chef Randall: Well, hello everyone, and welcome to today's show. And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. "Another fattening cookie recipe." But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then. [SEP]  (A) at 305 degrees (B) at 315 degrees (C) at 350 degrees

M: So are you going to London too? W: Well actually, I'm going to the University of Middlesex to do Business Studies. M: That sounds interesting. W: Well actually, it's my parents who want me to do Business Studies. I'd rather study Philosophy, but my dad wants me to take over the family business. He thinks Business Studies will make me rich.

W: I'm going to teach English to some immigrants in the university's community service program. M: That sounds interesting. Don't you need to speak a foreign language for a job like that? W: No, you don't. You just have to present the language simply and give the students a chance to practice speaking. M: Come to think of it, that's the way I was taught to speak Chinese. But speaking didn't help me learn to read and write Chinese. W: My students won't want to read and write English, at lease not now. They are more interested in speaking. M: You sound very knowledgeable about all this. How do you know so much? W: I took a Teaching English as a Second Language course last year when you were in China. I've also talked with the experienced teachers quite a lot. I think I would like to be an ESL teacher when I graduate. [SEP]  (A) A student. (B) A teacher. (C) A tourist.

W: The advertisement said Dream Dates has matched up thousands of singles the world over! M: Unbelievable! They must be exaggerating the figure! W: Look at the way they manage their business: they collect applicants' photos, and give the applicants questionnaires to fill out as to what type of character they are. M: I don't believe several questions can decide the type of person you're. People's characters are complicated and keep changing all the time. W: Anyway, it seems that things work well this way.

And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. "Another fattening cookie recipe." But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then. [SEP]  (A) at 305 degrees (B) at 315 degrees (C) at 350 degrees

W: Look at the way they manage their business: they collect applicants' photos, and give the applicants questionnaires to fill out as to what type of character they are.
