We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)

05/31/2022 13:23:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

This was my first visit here and a family friend told us that we should try this.  Totally dissatisfied with the food except for the Jelly Fish and Chicken Salad with Sesame dressing, one star for that.  The rest were below par especially their sweet and sour pork.   The other star came from the service of the owner/waiter/bus person in one. When we came here for Saturday lunch, we were the only customer in the restaurant. It initially looked creepy too since there was just one individual inside which was the owner.   They also do not offer lunch specials (which 90% of all Chinese restaurants do nowadays).   Will definitely NOT be back here.

05/31/2022 13:23:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 13:23:39 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 13:26:40 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

This was my first visit here and a family friend told us that we should try this.  Totally dissatisfied with the food except for the Jelly Fish and Chicken Salad with Sesame dressing, one star for that.  The rest were below par especially their sweet and sour pork.   The other star came from the service of the owner/waiter/bus person in one. When we came here for Saturday lunch, we were the only customer in the restaurant. It initially looked creepy too since there was just one individual inside which was the owner.   They also do not offer lunch specials (which 90% of all Chinese restaurants do nowadays).   Will definitely NOT be back here.

Was told that I could order something else, but had to pay for the meal I did not eat. Then the owner came out and told me that she didn't want to make me something else because I might \""not like that either\"". She said I must just not know what pad Thai is supposed to taste like because she makes it right and will not make me anything else. Very very rude!

05/31/2022 13:26:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)

In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

This was my first visit here and a family friend told us that we should try this.  Totally dissatisfied with the food except for the Jelly Fish and Chicken Salad with Sesame dressing, one star for that.  The rest were below par especially their sweet and sour pork.   The other star came from the service of the owner/waiter/bus person in one. When we came here for Saturday lunch, we were the only customer in the restaurant. It initially looked creepy too since there was just one individual inside which was the owner.   They also do not offer lunch specials (which 90% of all Chinese restaurants do nowadays).   Will definitely NOT be back here.

05/31/2022 13:37:54 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 13:38:02 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 13:52:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

05/31/2022 13:52:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you are looking for a hole in the wall type of restaurant, this is it! Dirty looking and the location is not so good. This was my first visit here and a family friend told us that we should try this.  Totally dissatisfied with the food except for the Jelly Fish and Chicken Salad with Sesame dressing, one star for that.  The rest were below par especially their sweet and sour pork.   The other star came from the service of the owner/waiter/bus person in one. When we came here for Saturday lunch, we were the only customer in the restaurant. It initially looked creepy too since there was just one individual inside which was the owner.   They also do not offer lunch specials (which 90% of all Chinese restaurants do nowadays).   Will definitely NOT be back here.

05/31/2022 13:52:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street!

05/31/2022 13:52:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 13:52:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 13:55:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, \""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,\"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a \""why are you wasting my time\"" demeanor.  I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.  Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience.

This was my first visit here and a family friend told us that we should try this.  Totally dissatisfied with the food except for the Jelly Fish and Chicken Salad with Sesame dressing, one star for that.  The rest were below par especially their sweet and sour pork.   The other star came from the service of the owner/waiter/bus person in one. When we came here for Saturday lunch, we were the only customer in the restaurant. It initially looked creepy too since there was just one individual inside which was the owner.   They also do not offer lunch specials (which 90% of all Chinese restaurants do nowadays).   Will definitely NOT be back here.

She said I must just not know what pad Thai is supposed to taste like because she makes it right and will not make me anything else. Very very rude!

05/31/2022 13:55:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 14:08:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 14:22:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.

05/31/2022 14:22:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

05/31/2022 14:22:44 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] In my search for a primary care doctor I was told about this place.  I called to make an appointment and was treated poorly because the receptionist had never heard of my insurance (even though it is one they accept).  She said new patient visits were only done at 11 and 3 and that I could not be seen for anything but giving my information.  I took 3.  Upon arriving I was not greeted and waited only 2 minutes until a lady realized I was standing there waiting for my paperwork (yes, I did mark on the sign-in paper that I was a new patient). I received my paperwork and sat to fill it out.  Then I Realized, as I was being coughed on by another patient, that there is no separation of sick and well patients.  Eww!!  I was taken into a room five minutes later (yay for me!). My blood pressure was taken and the nurse asked why I was there.  I told here I was a new patient looking for a doctor (hopefully Paige Walend) and she was weirded out by the fact that nothing was wrong with me.  She left and I sat in that room for 40 minutes without anyone coming in to check on me.  I walked out of the room and asked for the copies of my papers and that I would take my business elsewhere.  This girl was helpful! She promptly got my papers and I left.   No one ever tried to talk me out of leaving or explain why the long wait.  I will not be recommending this company to anyone I know.

05/31/2022 14:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 14:22:52 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 14:25:54 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

If it hadn't been for a time crunch and a convenient show time i doubt I would have come here and after this won't be coming back. Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.

05/31/2022 14:25:54 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

05/31/2022 14:25:54 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] In my search for a primary care doctor I was told about this place.  I called to make an appointment and was treated poorly because the receptionist had never heard of my insurance (even though it is one they accept).  She said new patient visits were only done at 11 and 3 and that I could not be seen for anything but giving my information.  I took 3.  Upon arriving I was not greeted and waited only 2 minutes until a lady realized I was standing there waiting for my paperwork (yes, I did mark on the sign-in paper that I was a new patient). I received my paperwork and sat to fill it out.  Then I Realized, as I was being coughed on by another patient, that there is no separation of sick and well patients.  Eww!!  I was taken into a room five minutes later (yay for me!). My blood pressure was taken and the nurse asked why I was there.  I told here I was a new patient looking for a doctor (hopefully Paige Walend) and she was weirded out by the fact that nothing was wrong with me.  She left and I sat in that room for 40 minutes without anyone coming in to check on me.  I walked out of the room and asked for the copies of my papers and that I would take my business elsewhere.  This girl was helpful! She promptly got my papers and I left.   No one ever tried to talk me out of leaving or explain why the long wait.  I will not be recommending this company to anyone I know.

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 14:37:26 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

05/31/2022 14:52:16 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] In my search for a primary care doctor I was told about this place.  I called to make an appointment and was treated poorly because the receptionist had never heard of my insurance (even though it is one they accept).  She said new patient visits were only done at 11 and 3 and that I could not be seen for anything but giving my information.  I took 3.  Upon arriving I was not greeted and waited only 2 minutes until a lady realized I was standing there waiting for my paperwork (yes, I did mark on the sign-in paper that I was a new patient). I received my paperwork and sat to fill it out.  Then I Realized, as I was being coughed on by another patient, that there is no separation of sick and well patients.  Eww!!  I was taken into a room five minutes later (yay for me!). My blood pressure was taken and the nurse asked why I was there.  I told here I was a new patient looking for a doctor (hopefully Paige Walend) and she was weirded out by the fact that nothing was wrong with me.  She left and I sat in that room for 40 minutes without anyone coming in to check on me.  I walked out of the room and asked for the copies of my papers and that I would take my business elsewhere.  This girl was helpful! She promptly got my papers and I left.   No one ever tried to talk me out of leaving or explain why the long wait.  I will not be recommending this company to anyone I know.

05/31/2022 14:52:24 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 14:52:24 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 14:55:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.

Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.

05/31/2022 14:55:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.

05/31/2022 14:55:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] In my search for a primary care doctor I was told about this place.  I called to make an appointment and was treated poorly because the receptionist had never heard of my insurance (even though it is one they accept).  She said new patient visits were only done at 11 and 3 and that I could not be seen for anything but giving my information.  I took 3.  Upon arriving I was not greeted and waited only 2 minutes until a lady realized I was standing there waiting for my paperwork (yes, I did mark on the sign-in paper that I was a new patient). I received my paperwork and sat to fill it out.  Then I Realized, as I was being coughed on by another patient, that there is no separation of sick and well patients.  Eww!!  I was taken into a room five minutes later (yay for me!). My blood pressure was taken and the nurse asked why I was there.  I told here I was a new patient looking for a doctor (hopefully Paige Walend) and she was weirded out by the fact that nothing was wrong with me.  She left and I sat in that room for 40 minutes without anyone coming in to check on me.  I walked out of the room and asked for the copies of my papers and that I would take my business elsewhere.  This girl was helpful! She promptly got my papers and I left.   No one ever tried to talk me out of leaving or explain why the long wait.  I will not be recommending this company to anyone I know.

Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

Private Event menu...  Angel Park House Salad - Radicchio, Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Croutons, Feta / Vinaigrette. (***) There have only been a few occasions where I have lauded a House Salad. I've gone back and recollected why a basic House Salad is better than some others... it's the addition of slivers of Raw Onions, Garbanzo Beans and / or Kidney Beans, and most importantly a profundity of Dressing!   Entree - Duo of Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion and Classic Chicken Breast - Merlot Butter, Cherry Balsamic Reduction, Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus. (**** 1/2) Everyone was raving about the Tenderloin Medallion... \""how tender\"", \""moist\"", \""you can cut it with a butter knife\""... on, and on, and on. But there was also \""two bites...\"", \""three bites\"", \""so small\"", \""more Medium than Medium Rare\"". Luckily, for me, the person seated next to me thought that her Beef was too rare... Hey, I'll take a donation of Beef anytime! The Beef I had was cooked towards Medium, the donated Beef was Medium Rare... Again, it's pretty hard to control the Entree for 300 people. The Chicken fillet was also very, very tender.  Warm Rolls & Butter (** 1/2) Cold... but serving close to 300 people, that was expected.  Dessert - Red Velvet, Amaretto Mousse Cake (*** 1/2) Dry. Again, the result of having it served last and probably sitting for hours. The moistness was totally gone by the time the Cake was served. Nice color contrast, though, of the Dark Red Cake versus the Cream colored frosting...  Positives -  Architecturally oriented so that the Cocktail / Patio area is facing the Sunset from the West... very romantic.  On a Golf Course - A Golf Course is one of the few Green areas in this city.   Pass-through Bar Window to the Patio / Cocktail area.  Looked like there could be three or four simultaneous Events going on at the same time with Wall partitions that could be moved or arranged.  Small Portable 20' x 20' Parquet Wood Dance Floor. Large enough for  a couple, three dozen couples. And small enough to get \""lost\"" in on the floor...  Window Walls where it matters most... facing the West and North... nice views of the very Green Golf Course and the Setting Sun.  Well-stocked Bar. You know Golfers... After the Practice Putting Green, the Practice Driving Range, Ninth Hole, after a Round... you've gotta have a round of Drinks!  Proficiency with Events - talked with some of the Event Staff... starting with the Spring, there are Special Events held weekly through the Summer. Quite busy.  Negatives, not many  -  Maximum number of Diners - around 300.  Lack of synchronization between TVs - The organizers of the Event wanted a Slide Show that could be controlled via a computer or DVD player to all the Flat Screen TVs around the Club House. - Not Possible. I was very surprised that this was not possible with the technology available nowadays. Probably too much trouble for this one event...  You're not going to get too many views of the night-time lights of Las Vegas. The Club House is oriented more towards the Golf Course / Mountains than the City.  Weather of Las Vegas - The Wind from the West coming down from the mountains in this area can reach 40-50mph... not kidding! Luckily for this event, the wind did not pick up till well after Sunset. You have to take your chances with an event here...

We didn't get any sake on this visit, but it says $5 sake bombs during happy hour. Therefore, I would definitely come back during happy hour because the rolls can get pretty expensive here. I got the Spicy Scallop & Salmon Roll ($11.95). The salmon was fresh and the roll was good, it was just so darn expensive! I wanted to try the seaweed salad as well, but as I was ordering I realized it was $8 so hastily changed to edamame for $3. All in all, a good place to come to happy hour with friends. Lots of tables (with cushions) and seats at the sushi bar.

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 15:08:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Even though we had over 10 people in our group they seated us as soon as they could.  Staff was very friendly, service was prompt and food really good.  Would go back and recommend!

05/31/2022 15:22:33 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] We were provided samples of several flavors of the house made gelato by the owner's husband.  Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

Private Event menu...  Angel Park House Salad - Radicchio, Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Croutons, Feta / Vinaigrette. (***) There have only been a few occasions where I have lauded a House Salad. I've gone back and recollected why a basic House Salad is better than some others... it's the addition of slivers of Raw Onions, Garbanzo Beans and / or Kidney Beans, and most importantly a profundity of Dressing!   Entree - Duo of Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion and Classic Chicken Breast - Merlot Butter, Cherry Balsamic Reduction, Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus. (**** 1/2) Everyone was raving about the Tenderloin Medallion... \""how tender\"", \""moist\"", \""you can cut it with a butter knife\""... on, and on, and on. But there was also \""two bites...\"", \""three bites\"", \""so small\"", \""more Medium than Medium Rare\"". Luckily, for me, the person seated next to me thought that her Beef was too rare... Hey, I'll take a donation of Beef anytime! The Beef I had was cooked towards Medium, the donated Beef was Medium Rare... Again, it's pretty hard to control the Entree for 300 people. The Chicken fillet was also very, very tender.  Warm Rolls & Butter (** 1/2) Cold... but serving close to 300 people, that was expected.  Dessert - Red Velvet, Amaretto Mousse Cake (*** 1/2) Dry. Again, the result of having it served last and probably sitting for hours. The moistness was totally gone by the time the Cake was served. Nice color contrast, though, of the Dark Red Cake versus the Cream colored frosting...  Positives -  Architecturally oriented so that the Cocktail / Patio area is facing the Sunset from the West... very romantic.  On a Golf Course - A Golf Course is one of the few Green areas in this city.   Pass-through Bar Window to the Patio / Cocktail area.  Looked like there could be three or four simultaneous Events going on at the same time with Wall partitions that could be moved or arranged.  Small Portable 20' x 20' Parquet Wood Dance Floor. Large enough for  a couple, three dozen couples. And small enough to get \""lost\"" in on the floor...  Window Walls where it matters most... facing the West and North... nice views of the very Green Golf Course and the Setting Sun.  Well-stocked Bar. You know Golfers... After the Practice Putting Green, the Practice Driving Range, Ninth Hole, after a Round... you've gotta have a round of Drinks!  Proficiency with Events - talked with some of the Event Staff... starting with the Spring, there are Special Events held weekly through the Summer. Quite busy.  Negatives, not many  -  Maximum number of Diners - around 300.  Lack of synchronization between TVs - The organizers of the Event wanted a Slide Show that could be controlled via a computer or DVD player to all the Flat Screen TVs around the Club House. - Not Possible. I was very surprised that this was not possible with the technology available nowadays. Probably too much trouble for this one event...  You're not going to get too many views of the night-time lights of Las Vegas. The Club House is oriented more towards the Golf Course / Mountains than the City.  Weather of Las Vegas - The Wind from the West coming down from the mountains in this area can reach 40-50mph... not kidding! Luckily for this event, the wind did not pick up till well after Sunset. You have to take your chances with an event here...

05/31/2022 15:22:33 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is kind of dark, but I think that's what makes it a good place to get sake (convenient if you get asian glow). We didn't get any sake on this visit, but it says $5 sake bombs during happy hour. Therefore, I would definitely come back during happy hour because the rolls can get pretty expensive here. I got the Spicy Scallop & Salmon Roll ($11.95). The salmon was fresh and the roll was good, it was just so darn expensive! I wanted to try the seaweed salad as well, but as I was ordering I realized it was $8 so hastily changed to edamame for $3. All in all, a good place to come to happy hour with friends. Lots of tables (with cushions) and seats at the sushi bar.

(Sorry, in advance to the AZ natives who get offended.) Soups, Sandwiches, Salads, Tacos and Entrees are available at lunch.  The ambiance is modern and chic with indoor or outdoor dining options. We had excellent service and the restaurant was really dead at Noon.   Best thing was free valet parking! This differentiates Province from anyplace in  CA!

05/31/2022 15:22:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 15:22:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors.

05/31/2022 15:25:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

05/31/2022 15:25:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Attended a Private Event at the Angel Park Golf Club, which the Club House serves a dual purpose as both a Restaurant and an Special Event Center.  Private Event menu...  Angel Park House Salad - Radicchio, Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Croutons, Feta / Vinaigrette. (***) There have only been a few occasions where I have lauded a House Salad. I've gone back and recollected why a basic House Salad is better than some others... it's the addition of slivers of Raw Onions, Garbanzo Beans and / or Kidney Beans, and most importantly a profundity of Dressing!   Entree - Duo of Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion and Classic Chicken Breast - Merlot Butter, Cherry Balsamic Reduction, Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus. (**** 1/2) Everyone was raving about the Tenderloin Medallion... \""how tender\"", \""moist\"", \""you can cut it with a butter knife\""... on, and on, and on. But there was also \""two bites...\"", \""three bites\"", \""so small\"", \""more Medium than Medium Rare\"". Luckily, for me, the person seated next to me thought that her Beef was too rare... Hey, I'll take a donation of Beef anytime! The Beef I had was cooked towards Medium, the donated Beef was Medium Rare... Again, it's pretty hard to control the Entree for 300 people. The Chicken fillet was also very, very tender.  Warm Rolls & Butter (** 1/2) Cold... but serving close to 300 people, that was expected.  Dessert - Red Velvet, Amaretto Mousse Cake (*** 1/2) Dry. Again, the result of having it served last and probably sitting for hours. The moistness was totally gone by the time the Cake was served. Nice color contrast, though, of the Dark Red Cake versus the Cream colored frosting...

Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

05/31/2022 15:36:48 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Attended a Private Event at the Angel Park Golf Club, which the Club House serves a dual purpose as both a Restaurant and an Special Event Center.  Private Event menu...  Angel Park House Salad - Radicchio, Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Croutons, Feta / Vinaigrette. (***) There have only been a few occasions where I have lauded a House Salad. I've gone back and recollected why a basic House Salad is better than some others... it's the addition of slivers of Raw Onions, Garbanzo Beans and / or Kidney Beans, and most importantly a profundity of Dressing!   Entree - Duo of Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion and Classic Chicken Breast - Merlot Butter, Cherry Balsamic Reduction, Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus. (**** 1/2) Everyone was raving about the Tenderloin Medallion... \""how tender\"", \""moist\"", \""you can cut it with a butter knife\""... on, and on, and on. But there was also \""two bites...\"", \""three bites\"", \""so small\"", \""more Medium than Medium Rare\"". Luckily, for me, the person seated next to me thought that her Beef was too rare... Hey, I'll take a donation of Beef anytime! The Beef I had was cooked towards Medium, the donated Beef was Medium Rare... Again, it's pretty hard to control the Entree for 300 people. The Chicken fillet was also very, very tender.  Warm Rolls & Butter (** 1/2) Cold... but serving close to 300 people, that was expected.  Dessert - Red Velvet, Amaretto Mousse Cake (*** 1/2) Dry. Again, the result of having it served last and probably sitting for hours. The moistness was totally gone by the time the Cake was served. Nice color contrast, though, of the Dark Red Cake versus the Cream colored frosting...  Positives -  Architecturally oriented so that the Cocktail / Patio area is facing the Sunset from the West... very romantic.  On a Golf Course - A Golf Course is one of the few Green areas in this city.   Pass-through Bar Window to the Patio / Cocktail area.  Looked like there could be three or four simultaneous Events going on at the same time with Wall partitions that could be moved or arranged.  Small Portable 20' x 20' Parquet Wood Dance Floor. Large enough for  a couple, three dozen couples. And small enough to get \""lost\"" in on the floor...  Window Walls where it matters most... facing the West and North... nice views of the very Green Golf Course and the Setting Sun.  Well-stocked Bar. You know Golfers... After the Practice Putting Green, the Practice Driving Range, Ninth Hole, after a Round... you've gotta have a round of Drinks!  Proficiency with Events - talked with some of the Event Staff... starting with the Spring, there are Special Events held weekly through the Summer. Quite busy.  Negatives, not many  -  Maximum number of Diners - around 300.  Lack of synchronization between TVs - The organizers of the Event wanted a Slide Show that could be controlled via a computer or DVD player to all the Flat Screen TVs around the Club House. - Not Possible. I was very surprised that this was not possible with the technology available nowadays. Probably too much trouble for this one event...  You're not going to get too many views of the night-time lights of Las Vegas. The Club House is oriented more towards the Golf Course / Mountains than the City.  Weather of Las Vegas - The Wind from the West coming down from the mountains in this area can reach 40-50mph... not kidding! Luckily for this event, the wind did not pick up till well after Sunset. You have to take your chances with an event here...

05/31/2022 15:36:48 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is kind of dark, but I think that's what makes it a good place to get sake (convenient if you get asian glow). We didn't get any sake on this visit, but it says $5 sake bombs during happy hour. Therefore, I would definitely come back during happy hour because the rolls can get pretty expensive here. I got the Spicy Scallop & Salmon Roll ($11.95). The salmon was fresh and the roll was good, it was just so darn expensive! I wanted to try the seaweed salad as well, but as I was ordering I realized it was $8 so hastily changed to edamame for $3. All in all, a good place to come to happy hour with friends. Lots of tables (with cushions) and seats at the sushi bar.

(Sorry, in advance to the AZ natives who get offended.) Soups, Sandwiches, Salads, Tacos and Entrees are available at lunch.  The ambiance is modern and chic with indoor or outdoor dining options. We had excellent service and the restaurant was really dead at Noon.   Best thing was free valet parking! This differentiates Province from anyplace in  CA!

05/31/2022 15:36:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 15:36:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 15:39:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Attended a Private Event at the Angel Park Golf Club, which the Club House serves a dual purpose as both a Restaurant and an Special Event Center.  Private Event menu...  Angel Park House Salad - Radicchio, Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Croutons, Feta / Vinaigrette. (***) There have only been a few occasions where I have lauded a House Salad. I've gone back and recollected why a basic House Salad is better than some others... it's the addition of slivers of Raw Onions, Garbanzo Beans and / or Kidney Beans, and most importantly a profundity of Dressing!   Entree - Duo of Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion and Classic Chicken Breast - Merlot Butter, Cherry Balsamic Reduction, Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus. (**** 1/2) Everyone was raving about the Tenderloin Medallion... \""how tender\"", \""moist\"", \""you can cut it with a butter knife\""... on, and on, and on. But there was also \""two bites...\"", \""three bites\"", \""so small\"", \""more Medium than Medium Rare\"". Luckily, for me, the person seated next to me thought that her Beef was too rare... Hey, I'll take a donation of Beef anytime! The Beef I had was cooked towards Medium, the donated Beef was Medium Rare... Again, it's pretty hard to control the Entree for 300 people. The Chicken fillet was also very, very tender.  Warm Rolls & Butter (** 1/2) Cold... but serving close to 300 people, that was expected.  Dessert - Red Velvet, Amaretto Mousse Cake (*** 1/2) Dry. Again, the result of having it served last and probably sitting for hours. The moistness was totally gone by the time the Cake was served. Nice color contrast, though, of the Dark Red Cake versus the Cream colored frosting...  Positives -  Architecturally oriented so that the Cocktail / Patio area is facing the Sunset from the West... very romantic.  On a Golf Course - A Golf Course is one of the few Green areas in this city.   Pass-through Bar Window to the Patio / Cocktail area.  Looked like there could be three or four simultaneous Events going on at the same time with Wall partitions that could be moved or arranged.  Small Portable 20' x 20' Parquet Wood Dance Floor. Large enough for  a couple, three dozen couples. And small enough to get \""lost\"" in on the floor...  Window Walls where it matters most... facing the West and North... nice views of the very Green Golf Course and the Setting Sun.  Well-stocked Bar. You know Golfers... After the Practice Putting Green, the Practice Driving Range, Ninth Hole, after a Round... you've gotta have a round of Drinks!  Proficiency with Events - talked with some of the Event Staff... starting with the Spring, there are Special Events held weekly through the Summer. Quite busy.  Negatives, not many  -  Maximum number of Diners - around 300.  Lack of synchronization between TVs - The organizers of the Event wanted a Slide Show that could be controlled via a computer or DVD player to all the Flat Screen TVs around the Club House. - Not Possible. I was very surprised that this was not possible with the technology available nowadays. Probably too much trouble for this one event...  You're not going to get too many views of the night-time lights of Las Vegas. The Club House is oriented more towards the Golf Course / Mountains than the City.  Weather of Las Vegas - The Wind from the West coming down from the mountains in this area can reach 40-50mph... not kidding! Luckily for this event, the wind did not pick up till well after Sunset. You have to take your chances with an event here...

05/31/2022 15:39:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is kind of dark, but I think that's what makes it a good place to get sake (convenient if you get asian glow). We didn't get any sake on this visit, but it says $5 sake bombs during happy hour. Therefore, I would definitely come back during happy hour because the rolls can get pretty expensive here. I got the Spicy Scallop & Salmon Roll ($11.95). The salmon was fresh and the roll was good, it was just so darn expensive! I wanted to try the seaweed salad as well, but as I was ordering I realized it was $8 so hastily changed to edamame for $3. All in all, a good place to come to happy hour with friends. Lots of tables (with cushions) and seats at the sushi bar.

05/31/2022 15:39:58 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Five of us came to Province for lunch. The lunch menu is what I consider California cuisine. (Sorry, in advance to the AZ natives who get offended.) Soups, Sandwiches, Salads, Tacos and Entrees are available at lunch.  The ambiance is modern and chic with indoor or outdoor dining options. We had excellent service and the restaurant was really dead at Noon.   Best thing was free valet parking! This differentiates Province from anyplace in  CA!

05/31/2022 15:51:27 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Best. Sangria. PERIOD.  Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.  Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.

05/31/2022 15:51:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Attended a Private Event at the Angel Park Golf Club, which the Club House serves a dual purpose as both a Restaurant and an Special Event Center.  Private Event menu...  Angel Park House Salad - Radicchio, Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Croutons, Feta / Vinaigrette. (***) There have only been a few occasions where I have lauded a House Salad. I've gone back and recollected why a basic House Salad is better than some others... it's the addition of slivers of Raw Onions, Garbanzo Beans and / or Kidney Beans, and most importantly a profundity of Dressing!   Entree - Duo of Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion and Classic Chicken Breast - Merlot Butter, Cherry Balsamic Reduction, Creamy Lemon Herb Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus. (**** 1/2) Everyone was raving about the Tenderloin Medallion... \""how tender\"", \""moist\"", \""you can cut it with a butter knife\""... on, and on, and on. But there was also \""two bites...\"", \""three bites\"", \""so small\"", \""more Medium than Medium Rare\"". Luckily, for me, the person seated next to me thought that her Beef was too rare... Hey, I'll take a donation of Beef anytime! The Beef I had was cooked towards Medium, the donated Beef was Medium Rare... Again, it's pretty hard to control the Entree for 300 people. The Chicken fillet was also very, very tender.  Warm Rolls & Butter (** 1/2) Cold... but serving close to 300 people, that was expected.  Dessert - Red Velvet, Amaretto Mousse Cake (*** 1/2) Dry. Again, the result of having it served last and probably sitting for hours. The moistness was totally gone by the time the Cake was served. Nice color contrast, though, of the Dark Red Cake versus the Cream colored frosting...  Positives -  Architecturally oriented so that the Cocktail / Patio area is facing the Sunset from the West... very romantic.  On a Golf Course - A Golf Course is one of the few Green areas in this city.   Pass-through Bar Window to the Patio / Cocktail area.  Looked like there could be three or four simultaneous Events going on at the same time with Wall partitions that could be moved or arranged.  Small Portable 20' x 20' Parquet Wood Dance Floor. Large enough for  a couple, three dozen couples. And small enough to get \""lost\"" in on the floor...  Window Walls where it matters most... facing the West and North... nice views of the very Green Golf Course and the Setting Sun.  Well-stocked Bar. You know Golfers... After the Practice Putting Green, the Practice Driving Range, Ninth Hole, after a Round... you've gotta have a round of Drinks!  Proficiency with Events - talked with some of the Event Staff... starting with the Spring, there are Special Events held weekly through the Summer. Quite busy.  Negatives, not many  -  Maximum number of Diners - around 300.  Lack of synchronization between TVs - The organizers of the Event wanted a Slide Show that could be controlled via a computer or DVD player to all the Flat Screen TVs around the Club House. - Not Possible. I was very surprised that this was not possible with the technology available nowadays. Probably too much trouble for this one event...  You're not going to get too many views of the night-time lights of Las Vegas. The Club House is oriented more towards the Golf Course / Mountains than the City.  Weather of Las Vegas - The Wind from the West coming down from the mountains in this area can reach 40-50mph... not kidding! Luckily for this event, the wind did not pick up till well after Sunset. You have to take your chances with an event here...

05/31/2022 15:51:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is kind of dark, but I think that's what makes it a good place to get sake (convenient if you get asian glow). We didn't get any sake on this visit, but it says $5 sake bombs during happy hour. Therefore, I would definitely come back during happy hour because the rolls can get pretty expensive here. I got the Spicy Scallop & Salmon Roll ($11.95). The salmon was fresh and the roll was good, it was just so darn expensive! I wanted to try the seaweed salad as well, but as I was ordering I realized it was $8 so hastily changed to edamame for $3. All in all, a good place to come to happy hour with friends. Lots of tables (with cushions) and seats at the sushi bar.

We had excellent service and the restaurant was really dead at Noon.   Best thing was free valet parking! This differentiates Province from anyplace in  CA!

I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 15:51:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

Don't care for maple anything unless its on my pancakes, but with all of Thrifty's many flavors I know I'll find a new fave. Excited they have bubblegum! - I obviously have the taste buds of a 6 yr old.   My daughter really loved the cotton candy ice cream; I loved the technicolor goatee it gave her. My youngest enjoyed the circus animal cookie ice cream, she was picking out the cookies in between bites.   We'll be back soon to try more flavors. This was our first ever Thrifty experience. Yummy!!

05/31/2022 16:07:05 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic food & drinks at Tao Asian Bistro and the best way to get into Tao Nightclub.  The dumplings (5) for a starter were full of meat and had a little spice to them. For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!

05/31/2022 16:07:13 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 16:07:13 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 16:10:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

05/31/2022 16:10:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

05/31/2022 16:10:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Square shaped ice cream, you are delicious. Tried the cookie dough yesterday, and thought I tasted a hint of maple? Don't care for maple anything unless its on my pancakes, but with all of Thrifty's many flavors I know I'll find a new fave. Excited they have bubblegum! - I obviously have the taste buds of a 6 yr old.   My daughter really loved the cotton candy ice cream; I loved the technicolor goatee it gave her. My youngest enjoyed the circus animal cookie ice cream, she was picking out the cookies in between bites.   We'll be back soon to try more flavors. This was our first ever Thrifty experience. Yummy!!

05/31/2022 16:10:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic food & drinks at Tao Asian Bistro and the best way to get into Tao Nightclub.  The dumplings (5) for a starter were full of meat and had a little spice to them. For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

05/31/2022 16:21:34 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

Don't care for maple anything unless its on my pancakes, but with all of Thrifty's many flavors I know I'll find a new fave. Excited they have bubblegum! - I obviously have the taste buds of a 6 yr old.   My daughter really loved the cotton candy ice cream; I loved the technicolor goatee it gave her. My youngest enjoyed the circus animal cookie ice cream, she was picking out the cookies in between bites.   We'll be back soon to try more flavors. This was our first ever Thrifty experience. Yummy!!

05/31/2022 16:21:34 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic food & drinks at Tao Asian Bistro and the best way to get into Tao Nightclub.  The dumplings (5) for a starter were full of meat and had a little spice to them. For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!

05/31/2022 16:21:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 16:21:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

05/31/2022 16:40:23 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic food & drinks at Tao Asian Bistro and the best way to get into Tao Nightclub.  The dumplings (5) for a starter were full of meat and had a little spice to them. For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!

05/31/2022 16:40:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 16:40:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 16:46:27 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic food & drinks at Tao Asian Bistro and the best way to get into Tao Nightclub.  The dumplings (5) for a starter were full of meat and had a little spice to them. For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!

I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

05/31/2022 16:59:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

Don't care for maple anything unless its on my pancakes, but with all of Thrifty's many flavors I know I'll find a new fave. Excited they have bubblegum! - I obviously have the taste buds of a 6 yr old.   My daughter really loved the cotton candy ice cream; I loved the technicolor goatee it gave her. My youngest enjoyed the circus animal cookie ice cream, she was picking out the cookies in between bites.   We'll be back soon to try more flavors. This was our first ever Thrifty experience. Yummy!!

05/31/2022 16:59:35 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Fantastic food & drinks at Tao Asian Bistro and the best way to get into Tao Nightclub.  The dumplings (5) for a starter were full of meat and had a little spice to them. For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!

05/31/2022 17:00:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 17:00:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 17:03:05 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.

05/31/2022 17:03:05 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.  The restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.

05/31/2022 17:14:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 17:14:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 17:28:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

05/31/2022 17:28:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I recently used Vicky and Pierre to complete a new home purchase.  The process was seamless!  Vicky is SUPER responsive and we were able to close in less than 30 days.  These guys will do whatever it takes to get the job done.  I would definitely recommend the Cornerstone team, they are great!!

05/31/2022 17:28:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

05/31/2022 17:28:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 17:28:55 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 17:31:57 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

05/31/2022 17:31:57 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

05/31/2022 17:43:36 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 17:43:36 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

05/31/2022 17:58:32 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

I would definitely recommend the Cornerstone team, they are great!!

05/31/2022 17:58:32 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

05/31/2022 17:58:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 17:58:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again

That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!

05/31/2022 18:01:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

05/31/2022 18:14:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.

05/31/2022 18:14:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [yelp_polarity] If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again
