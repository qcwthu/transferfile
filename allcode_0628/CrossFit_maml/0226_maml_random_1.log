Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult.

Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.

It is now on show in Room 25. Special exhibition The exhibition "Painting in Spain During the Late 18th Century" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March.Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period--Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition.These three artists are also joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years--Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.The exhibition runs until 31 May. Lecture news    Lectures will be given along with the special exhibition every Wednesday.On 8 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 15 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Patter.On 22 and 29 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu.On 25 April, a Saturday, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often "tell a story" through their pictures.

(A) the problem of student suicides is getting worse according to a research on the accurate statistics (B) teachers have enough ability to sense the emotional distress of students (C) parents place neither pressure nor care on their children (D) both teachers and parents should learn more to deal with the problem of student suicides. [SEP] SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. "Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth," said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures.

(D) To protect the wildlife. [SEP] At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. "We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community." He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting   the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, "The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them." They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.

[SEP] New picture The National Gallery now has a fine _ by the 18th century Dutch painter Jan van Os.This large picture (89.1 cm x 71cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light bright colours on wood.It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery.The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778.It is not unusual for a picture to be dated two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to come out in their different seasons in order to paint them.This picture was given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on show in Room 25. Special exhibition The exhibition "Painting in Spain During the Late 18th Century" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March.Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period--Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition.These three artists are also joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years--Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.The exhibition runs until 31 May.

(A) the problem of student suicides is getting worse according to a research on the accurate statistics (B) teachers have enough ability to sense the emotional distress of students (C) parents place neither pressure nor care on their children (D) both teachers and parents should learn more to deal with the problem of student suicides. [SEP] SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. "Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth," said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures.

02/26/2022 21:57:12 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] What is the aim of the Predator Compensation Program? (A) To protect people in the wild. (B) To protect Masai's farms. (C) To protect lions only. (D) To protect the wildlife. [SEP] At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. "We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community." He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting   the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, "The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them." They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.

[SEP] Steven Jobs was born on February 24,1955,in  San Francisco,California,and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California.At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley". As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.

Heads nodded in agreement when he said, "High school English teachers are not doing their jobs." He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.

(A) the problem of student suicides is getting worse according to a research on the accurate statistics (B) teachers have enough ability to sense the emotional distress of students (C) parents place neither pressure nor care on their children (D) both teachers and parents should learn more to deal with the problem of student suicides. [SEP] SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. "Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth," said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures.

(D) To protect the wildlife. [SEP] At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. "We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community." He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting   the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, "The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them." They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

[SEP] Steven Jobs was born on February 24,1955,in  San Francisco,California,and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California.At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley". As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.

Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures.

(D) To protect the wildlife. [SEP] At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. "We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community." He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting   the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, "The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them." They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.

[SEP] Steven Jobs was born on February 24,1955,in  San Francisco,California,and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California.At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley". As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.

02/26/2022 22:36:29 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] All the statements are true except   _  . (A) More than 50% of women ages 18 to 64 have jobs. (B) 18% of working women took a vacation away from home last year. (C) 32% of working women have college education. (D) 80% of working women drive a car to work. [SEP] Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.     In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.     Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.     These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.     The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

02/26/2022 22:36:29 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the passage the author argues that   _  . (A) it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students (B) to improve the level of English requires the effort of several generations (C) English should not be the target of the blame of language deficiencies (D) to rid language deficiencies one should have sensitive eyes and ears [SEP] The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, "High school English teachers are not doing their jobs." He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.

[SEP] SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. "Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth," said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures.

The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. "We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community."

They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them." They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

[SEP] Steven Jobs was born on February 24,1955,in  San Francisco,California,and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California.At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley". As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.

(B) 18% of working women took a vacation away from home last year. (C) 32% of working women have college education. (D) 80% of working women drive a car to work. [SEP] Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.     In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.     Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.     These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.     The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

(A) it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students (B) to improve the level of English requires the effort of several generations (C) English should not be the target of the blame of language deficiencies (D) to rid language deficiencies one should have sensitive eyes and ears [SEP] The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, "High school English teachers are not doing their jobs." He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.

[SEP] Steven Jobs was born on February 24,1955,in  San Francisco,California,and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California.At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley". As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.

02/26/2022 22:58:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] All the statements are true except   _  . (A) More than 50% of women ages 18 to 64 have jobs. (B) 18% of working women took a vacation away from home last year. (C) 32% of working women have college education. (D) 80% of working women drive a car to work. [SEP] Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.     In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.     Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.     These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.     The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

02/26/2022 22:58:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the passage the author argues that   _  . (A) it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students (B) to improve the level of English requires the effort of several generations (C) English should not be the target of the blame of language deficiencies (D) to rid language deficiencies one should have sensitive eyes and ears [SEP] The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, "High school English teachers are not doing their jobs." He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.

It is now on show in Room 25. Special exhibition The exhibition "Painting in Spain During the Late 18th Century" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March.Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period--Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition.These three artists are also joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years--Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.The exhibition runs until 31 May. Lecture news    Lectures will be given along with the special exhibition every Wednesday.On 8 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 15 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Patter.On 22 and 29 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu.On 25 April, a Saturday, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often "tell a story" through their pictures.

02/26/2022 22:58:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can learn from the passage that   _  . (A) the problem of student suicides is getting worse according to a research on the accurate statistics (B) teachers have enough ability to sense the emotional distress of students (C) parents place neither pressure nor care on their children (D) both teachers and parents should learn more to deal with the problem of student suicides. [SEP] SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. "Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth," said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.

The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. "We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community." He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting   the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, "The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them." They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

[SEP] Steven Jobs was born on February 24,1955,in  San Francisco,California,and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California.At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley". As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.

(B) 18% of working women took a vacation away from home last year. (C) 32% of working women have college education. (D) 80% of working women drive a car to work. [SEP] Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.     In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.     Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.     These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.     The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

(A) it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students (B) to improve the level of English requires the effort of several generations (C) English should not be the target of the blame of language deficiencies (D) to rid language deficiencies one should have sensitive eyes and ears [SEP] The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, "High school English teachers are not doing their jobs." He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.

(A) the problem of student suicides is getting worse according to a research on the accurate statistics (B) teachers have enough ability to sense the emotional distress of students (C) parents place neither pressure nor care on their children (D) both teachers and parents should learn more to deal with the problem of student suicides. [SEP] SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. "Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth," said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. "It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems," Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures.

(A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

(B) Different table manners between British and American people. (C) Different ideas about the home between British and American people (D) Different ideas about how to get along well with neighbors between British and American people. [SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation.

The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired.

There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/26/2022 23:27:07 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Dr La Farge's research is of great importance to   _  . (A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

(C) Different ideas about the home between British and American people (D) Different ideas about how to get along well with neighbors between British and American people. [SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

(A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

(B) Different table manners between British and American people. (C) Different ideas about the home between British and American people (D) Different ideas about how to get along well with neighbors between British and American people. [SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/26/2022 23:49:42 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Dr La Farge's research is of great importance to   _  . (A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

(C) Different ideas about the home between British and American people (D) Different ideas about how to get along well with neighbors between British and American people. [SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

(A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

(B) Different table manners between British and American people. (C) Different ideas about the home between British and American people (D) Different ideas about how to get along well with neighbors between British and American people. [SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

(A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

[SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

(A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

(B) Different table manners between British and American people. (C) Different ideas about the home between British and American people (D) Different ideas about how to get along well with neighbors between British and American people. [SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired.

Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

(A) knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like (B) understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers. (C) regrowing many species that have been destroyed before. (D) figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss. [SEP] 400-year-old plants from the Little Ice Age were brought back to life, which could help us understand how the Earth will deal with climate change. Moss  found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier  on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life. Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps. Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists. Samples of the moss plant, covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD, were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts. Biologist Dr. Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island. Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years. This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed. Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied, including many species that have never been studied before. While examining an exposed area of land, La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum. It is a type of bryophyte  plant that mainly grows across Canada, the US and the Highlands of Scotland. Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems, suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate. Dr La Farge told the BBC, "When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab, I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches, suggesting that these plants are growing again, and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape, we've always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier. It's a whole world of what's coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be studied. The ice is disappearing pretty fast. We really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world; we don't know it all." Dr La Farge took samples of the moss and, using carbon-dating techniques, discovered that the plants date back to the Little Ice Age. Dr La Farge's team took the samples, planted them in dishes full of nutrient-rich potting soil and fed them with water. The samples were from four separate species including Aulacomnium turgidum, Distichium capillaceum, Encalypta procera and Syntrichia ruralis. The moss plants found by Dr La Farge are types of bryophytes. Bryophytes can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer. However, Dr La Farge was surprised that the plants buried under ice have survived into the twenty-first century. Her findings appear in proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

(C) They didn't have money to be in hospital. (D) Mrs. Syed was unwilling to receive the operation. [SEP] Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney  . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, "When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down." Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress. He said, "I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering disease. Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a chain, I was also very happy."

(A) modern technology is bridging the people (B) modern technology is separating the people (C) modern technology is developing too fast (D) modern technology is interrupting our communication [SEP] A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and... I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction . With email and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct  entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom  has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human  beings gets automated , the alienation index  goes up. You can't  even call a person to get the phone number of another person  any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone,  an ATM card, a voice mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise... they're a great help to us. It's some of  their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more. I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail   picked up because I didn't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier ...or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant   messaging with people who live near me, no cell phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm at home.

[SEP] For the British, the home is a private place in which he or she goes to hide away from the troubles of life. It is very seldom that one would be invited to a British person's home. It is rude to knock on a person's door if you are not invited. If you are invited, don't ask to see more than the downstairs that your British host invites you into. Never ask how much the house or any of the items in it cost. To the American, most of them want their home to be a place where they can entertain   and share their lives with their friends. They may be delighted to give you a full tour of their houses. They may also be pleased when you show your interest and pleasure in their houses. Both British and American people will _ quite a bit of chat and a drink or two before the meal is served. After the first mouthful, you should say how delicious the food is and ask something about it. Remember, never eat with your mouth open and make very little noise while eating. It would be nice of you to help your host in any way. Maybe offer to pour some drinks or clear up after the meal.

(D) Media's bad influences. [SEP] As we know, many teen celebrities  feel and think that having a slimmer figure can do great good to them. But, does size really matter? Are teenage fans trying hard to become like their celebrity idols ? Do celebrities really have the power to influence people, especially teenagers? For the longest time, many parents blame teen idols for influencing the way their kids act. Have you noticed how teens idolize the celebrities these days? Even, their personal affairs are being followed by kids these days. Take for example the case of Lindsay Lohan of Mary Kate Ashley. They are definitely famous teen stars. But, since they are trying to project an image to satisfy a lot of people in show business, their health and body suffer. Many kids are aware of this problem. But they are easily influenced by these celebrities to exercise and eat less. It is a fact that the media, and especially famous teen celebrities, can influence people powerfully. But teenagers are easily influenced because teenage years are the period when our personality and identity developments take place. Teens watching TV shows and reading magazines are easily pulled into the dieting and harmful eating habits because the media have some ways to pull these acts. They use thin models and celebrities to endorse  products or to star in an up-and -coming shows or movies. With fierce competition, celebrities are forced to eat less and do extreme exercise routines to get the roles or offers that come their way. Living in today's time and generation is a bit disturbing to a lot of parents. Media, especially as well as the celebrities, have a very powerful influence to drive teenagers to good or bad. It's good that we can control ourselves to avoid bad things from happening. If not, parents should really be aware and guide their teens to determine what's in ad what's out.

(B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 00:52:26 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

02/27/2022 00:52:26 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Visitors who use Fast Pass tickets   _ (A) can get discounts on tickets (B) will have a well-planned ride time (C) will often be checked at the exit (D) have to pay more for their tickets [SEP] As for visiting Walt Disney World. People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 00:52:26 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

02/27/2022 00:52:28 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] The Sherman Antitrust Act  _  . (A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust.

02/27/2022 00:58:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] What is special about Sydney's Great Coastal Walk? (A) It starts from Royal National Park in the south. (B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 00:58:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

(A) Touching by Feeling (B) To See or to Feel (C) Seeing by Feeling (D) Seeing Is Believing [SEP] "If you want to see something well, reach out and touch it!" That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 00:58:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

(B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 01:14:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

02/27/2022 01:14:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Visitors who use Fast Pass tickets   _ (A) can get discounts on tickets (B) will have a well-planned ride time (C) will often be checked at the exit (D) have to pay more for their tickets [SEP] As for visiting Walt Disney World. People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 01:14:59 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/27/2022 01:20:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] What is special about Sydney's Great Coastal Walk? (A) It starts from Royal National Park in the south. (B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 01:20:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

(A) Touching by Feeling (B) To See or to Feel (C) Seeing by Feeling (D) Seeing Is Believing [SEP] "If you want to see something well, reach out and touch it!" That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 01:20:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

(B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 01:37:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

02/27/2022 01:37:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Visitors who use Fast Pass tickets   _ (A) can get discounts on tickets (B) will have a well-planned ride time (C) will often be checked at the exit (D) have to pay more for their tickets [SEP] As for visiting Walt Disney World. People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 01:37:15 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/27/2022 01:42:56 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] What is special about Sydney's Great Coastal Walk? (A) It starts from Royal National Park in the south. (B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 01:42:56 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

(A) Touching by Feeling (B) To See or to Feel (C) Seeing by Feeling (D) Seeing Is Believing [SEP] "If you want to see something well, reach out and touch it!" That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 01:42:56 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

(B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 01:59:39 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

02/27/2022 01:59:39 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Visitors who use Fast Pass tickets   _ (A) can get discounts on tickets (B) will have a well-planned ride time (C) will often be checked at the exit (D) have to pay more for their tickets [SEP] As for visiting Walt Disney World. People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 01:59:39 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

(B) It takes about more than five hours to complete. (C) It really has the longest coastline in the world. (D) It provides visitors a variety of great landscapes. [SEP] Beaches are not only great for lying on and doing water sports, and in fact one of the best ways of enjoying them is a classic beach walk. Here at iWantSun. Co. Uk, we've been searching the globe to find you the world's best and most glorious beach walks, and here's our pick of the top. The Footpath of the Gods, Amalfi Coast, Italy The name says it all really and you truly do feel up there to walking along this wonderful mountain coastal path, which offers some of the most striking views on the planet. The path begins at town of Bomerano to charming Positano along the UNESCO World Heritage area of the Amalfi Coast. The whole walk will take you approximately four and a half hours to complete and pass over narrow rocky paths, past sheer cliffs and shining blue bays. Sydney's Great Coastal Walk, Australia Sydney's coastline is one of the most beautiful and diverse in the world. Here you have national parks, historic sites, steep cliffs, sparkling beaches and quiet bays all in one place. Sydney's Great Walk runs all the way from Barrenjoey in the north to Royal National Park in the south and takes an incredible seven days to complete. However, if you're not up to doing the full walk, then there are many different parts of the walk that you can do right in the city. Walking from the city's famous Bondi Beach to the sweeping curve of Bronte Beach takes just an hour, which takes in some top scenery. Great Ocean Walk, Australia The Great Ocean Walk stretches 104 km along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, located on the southern coast of Australia, from the resort town Apollo Bay to the magnificent Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles are the area's famous stone landmarks which stand out like giants from the sea. The walk passes through a range of landscapes and sights, from national parks, famous surfing spots and deserted beaches, to wild coastlines, cascading waterfalls, lush forests, historic lighthouses and ghostly shipwrecks. Day walks and shorter three-hour walks such as the Wreck Beach Walk or the Lighthouse Cemetery and Lookout Walk can also be enjoyed. So next time when you're looking for a beach holiday don't just think about the resorts and the sand, but consider a more active sun holiday, discovering some of the best beaches in the world.

02/27/2022 02:05:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] In the author's opinion, which of the following is NOT true? (A) Nearly everyone has been told a wrong number. (B) It's necessary for everyone to have a telephone. (C) He himself can not decide whether to answer a call. (D) A telephone directory may bring in unexpected calls. [SEP] Many people think a telephone is essential. But I think it is a pest and a time waster. Very often you find it impossible to escape from some idle or curious chatter-box, or from somebody who wants something for nothing. If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are taking your bath. Are you strong minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself,"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time" You are not. You think there may be some important news or messages for you. I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later. Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number? But you will say, you need not have your name printed in the telephone directory, and you can have a telephone which is only usable for outgoing calls. Besides, you will say, isn't it important to have a telephone in case of emergency--illness, an accident, or fire? Of course, you are right, but here in a thickly populated country like England one is seldom far from a telephone in case of dreadful necessity. I think perhaps I had better try to justify myself by trying to prove that what I like is good. I admit that in different circumstances--if I were a tycoon(business VIP),for instance, or bed ridden I might find a telephone essential. But then if I were a taxi-driver I should find a car essential. Let me put it another way: there are two things for which the English seem to show particular talent; one is mechanical invention, the other is literature. My own business happens to be with the use of words but I see I must now stop using them. For I have just been handed a slip of paper to say that somebody is waiting to speak to me on the telephone. I think I had better answer it. After all, one never knows, it may be something important.

People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park. When to go? While it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined. Where to stay? The question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer "Extra Magic Hours"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The "Magic Your Way Package" is a good value if you have a large family. What to do? Make use of the "Fast Pass" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.

(A) Touching by Feeling (B) To See or to Feel (C) Seeing by Feeling (D) Seeing Is Believing [SEP] "If you want to see something well, reach out and touch it!" That may seem a strange thing to say.But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round.But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is.You can feel how heavy the glass is.When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better.For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pockets.You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin.Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what "Don't touch!" means.They hear it often.Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.In shops, we often have to touch things before we buy them. The bottoms of our feet can feel things, too.You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a hard floor.All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling.One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin.Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin...... Most museums are just for looking.But today some museums have some things to touch.Their signs say, "Do touch!" There you can feel everything on show.

02/27/2022 02:05:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] We can draw the conclusion that Mr.Rady's work in Iraq is very_. (A) happy (B) tiring (C) busy (D) dangerous [SEP] When he stopped his car at a traffic light in Basra, Bassam Rady noticed the motorbike with two riders on it passed by him slowly. Suddenly the bike turned round and Mr. Rady, feeling dangerous, tried to drive off. Before he could, a man on the back of the bike took out a gun from his jacket and fired. The bullet went through the windscreen and just missed him. As he sped away another shot was fired, but missed the car.  Mr. Rady was an interpreter for British army in Iraq. As such, his life is in danger from the militia that once controlled the Iraqi city and is now returning.  More than a year ago Iraqi soldiers, backed by US, brought peace and stability to Basra by driving militants over the Iranian border in an operation called Charge of the Knights.  According to local estimates, however, about half have returned. Although they have not become as active as before, the militants are trying to shoot Iraqi citizens who worked with British. Most in danger are translators such as Mr. Rady.  The 31-year-old father worked with soldiers on dangerous missions but was refused resettlement in Britain at the end of his employment. He worked with nine translators. Seven of them have been killed.  "I'm like a cancer patient -- now that the militia is back, my family is just waiting for me to die," Mr. Rady said. "I see reports in the media that Basra is safe but it's not true. I know these militia people. I went to school with some of them. I didn't see them for a year but now they are around again. They have told me, 'Your day will come soon'." He takes security precautions and never follows a routine. This means that he cannot work because that would give the militants a better chance of success.  Militiamen belonging to the alMahdi Army took control of Basra between 2004 and 2007 with other Shia fighters. They enforced strict Islamic rules at the same time as running criminal rackets. British army was unable or unwilling to fight back and eventually went back to their base at the airport.

Despite  the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world. They use the mauka andmakaisystem.Maukameans "mountain". The mountains in Hawaii are always at the center of the islands, as these are volcanic islands.Makaimeans "the sea". The islands are small and the system is simple. Wherever you want to visit, it can always be described in terms of where it lies in relation to the mountains and the sea. A typical conversation between a native Hawaiian and a tourist might go as follow. TOURIST: Excuse me! Could you tell me where the Sheraton Hotel is? HAWAIIAN: Well... Let me see! From here it's two blocks mauka, and then one blockmakai. You can't miss it!

Rio is a beautiful place to visit. It is full of exciting parades, historical architecture and natural beauty. The most famous time of year in Rio is the spring when the samba schools organize a giant parade of dance, music and costumes. Samba is a type of fast Brazilian music, which is perfect for dancing. The carnival lasts two days and over 20 samba schools perform, a total of 70,000 people in brightly coloured costumes, all dancing and singing! It is a magnificent spectacle and millions of people watch the carnival on television around the world. Rio de Janeiro is a religious city and it is full of churches. Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill. On the top of the hill, along with a small church, stands a 30-metre high statue of Jesus with his arms stretched out. From this point you can see every part of the city.

(D) Ieoh Ming Pei got a Harvard undergraduate Degree in 1946. [SEP] On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential   structures.

02/27/2022 02:22:16 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] According to the recently discovered evidence,   _  . (A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

(A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

Despite  the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world. They use the mauka andmakaisystem.Maukameans "mountain". The mountains in Hawaii are always at the center of the islands, as these are volcanic islands.Makaimeans "the sea". The islands are small and the system is simple. Wherever you want to visit, it can always be described in terms of where it lies in relation to the mountains and the sea. A typical conversation between a native Hawaiian and a tourist might go as follow. TOURIST: Excuse me! Could you tell me where the Sheraton Hotel is? HAWAIIAN: Well... Let me see! From here it's two blocks mauka, and then one blockmakai. You can't miss it!

Rio is a beautiful place to visit. It is full of exciting parades, historical architecture and natural beauty. The most famous time of year in Rio is the spring when the samba schools organize a giant parade of dance, music and costumes. Samba is a type of fast Brazilian music, which is perfect for dancing. The carnival lasts two days and over 20 samba schools perform, a total of 70,000 people in brightly coloured costumes, all dancing and singing! It is a magnificent spectacle and millions of people watch the carnival on television around the world. Rio de Janeiro is a religious city and it is full of churches. Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill. On the top of the hill, along with a small church, stands a 30-metre high statue of Jesus with his arms stretched out. From this point you can see every part of the city.

(B) Ieoh Ming Pei studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he was young. (C) Ieoh Ming Pei got a degree for architecture in 1948. (D) Ieoh Ming Pei got a Harvard undergraduate Degree in 1946. [SEP] On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential   structures.

02/27/2022 02:27:45 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] According to the recently discovered evidence,   _  . (A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

(A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

Despite  the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world. They use the mauka andmakaisystem.Maukameans "mountain". The mountains in Hawaii are always at the center of the islands, as these are volcanic islands.Makaimeans "the sea". The islands are small and the system is simple. Wherever you want to visit, it can always be described in terms of where it lies in relation to the mountains and the sea. A typical conversation between a native Hawaiian and a tourist might go as follow. TOURIST: Excuse me! Could you tell me where the Sheraton Hotel is? HAWAIIAN: Well... Let me see! From here it's two blocks mauka, and then one blockmakai. You can't miss it!

Rio is a beautiful place to visit. It is full of exciting parades, historical architecture and natural beauty. The most famous time of year in Rio is the spring when the samba schools organize a giant parade of dance, music and costumes. Samba is a type of fast Brazilian music, which is perfect for dancing. The carnival lasts two days and over 20 samba schools perform, a total of 70,000 people in brightly coloured costumes, all dancing and singing! It is a magnificent spectacle and millions of people watch the carnival on television around the world. Rio de Janeiro is a religious city and it is full of churches. Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill. On the top of the hill, along with a small church, stands a 30-metre high statue of Jesus with his arms stretched out. From this point you can see every part of the city.

(D) Ieoh Ming Pei got a Harvard undergraduate Degree in 1946. [SEP] On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential   structures.

02/27/2022 02:44:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] According to the recently discovered evidence,   _  . (A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

(A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

(A) of the weather (B) the islands were created by volcanic eruptions (C) of the geological conditions (D) of the islands' location in the Pacific [SEP] The Hawaiian Islands are situated about two thousand miles away from North America, right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Despite  the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world. They use the mauka andmakaisystem.Maukameans "mountain". The mountains in Hawaii are always at the center of the islands, as these are volcanic islands.Makaimeans "the sea". The islands are small and the system is simple. Wherever you want to visit, it can always be described in terms of where it lies in relation to the mountains and the sea. A typical conversation between a native Hawaiian and a tourist might go as follow. TOURIST: Excuse me! Could you tell me where the Sheraton Hotel is? HAWAIIAN: Well... Let me see! From here it's two blocks mauka, and then one blockmakai. You can't miss it!

(A) the samba parade (B) the beautiful view of the city (C) the statue of Jesus (D) the small church [SEP] On the coast of Brazil lies its most famous city Rio de Janeiro. Rio is a beautiful place to visit. It is full of exciting parades, historical architecture and natural beauty. The most famous time of year in Rio is the spring when the samba schools organize a giant parade of dance, music and costumes. Samba is a type of fast Brazilian music, which is perfect for dancing. The carnival lasts two days and over 20 samba schools perform, a total of 70,000 people in brightly coloured costumes, all dancing and singing! It is a magnificent spectacle and millions of people watch the carnival on television around the world. Rio de Janeiro is a religious city and it is full of churches. Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill. On the top of the hill, along with a small church, stands a 30-metre high statue of Jesus with his arms stretched out. From this point you can see every part of the city.

(B) Ieoh Ming Pei studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he was young. (C) Ieoh Ming Pei got a degree for architecture in 1948. (D) Ieoh Ming Pei got a Harvard undergraduate Degree in 1946. [SEP] On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential   structures.

02/27/2022 02:51:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] According to the recently discovered evidence,   _  . (A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

02/27/2022 02:51:06 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] By writing the passage, the author mainly wants to tell us    _   . (A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

Rio is a beautiful place to visit. It is full of exciting parades, historical architecture and natural beauty. The most famous time of year in Rio is the spring when the samba schools organize a giant parade of dance, music and costumes. Samba is a type of fast Brazilian music, which is perfect for dancing. The carnival lasts two days and over 20 samba schools perform, a total of 70,000 people in brightly coloured costumes, all dancing and singing! It is a magnificent spectacle and millions of people watch the carnival on television around the world. Rio de Janeiro is a religious city and it is full of churches. Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill. On the top of the hill, along with a small church, stands a 30-metre high statue of Jesus with his arms stretched out. From this point you can see every part of the city.

(D) Ieoh Ming Pei got a Harvard undergraduate Degree in 1946. [SEP] On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential   structures.

(A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

(A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill. On the top of the hill, along with a small church, stands a 30-metre high statue of Jesus with his arms stretched out. From this point you can see every part of the city.

(B) Ieoh Ming Pei studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he was young. (C) Ieoh Ming Pei got a degree for architecture in 1948. (D) Ieoh Ming Pei got a Harvard undergraduate Degree in 1946. [SEP] On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential   structures.

02/27/2022 03:13:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] According to the recently discovered evidence,   _  . (A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

02/27/2022 03:13:47 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] By writing the passage, the author mainly wants to tell us    _   . (A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

(A) of the weather (B) the islands were created by volcanic eruptions (C) of the geological conditions (D) of the islands' location in the Pacific [SEP] The Hawaiian Islands are situated about two thousand miles away from North America, right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Despite  the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world. They use the mauka andmakaisystem.Maukameans "mountain". The mountains in Hawaii are always at the center of the islands, as these are volcanic islands.Makaimeans "the sea". The islands are small and the system is simple. Wherever you want to visit, it can always be described in terms of where it lies in relation to the mountains and the sea. A typical conversation between a native Hawaiian and a tourist might go as follow. TOURIST: Excuse me! Could you tell me where the Sheraton Hotel is? HAWAIIAN: Well... Let me see!

Rio is a beautiful place to visit. It is full of exciting parades, historical architecture and natural beauty. The most famous time of year in Rio is the spring when the samba schools organize a giant parade of dance, music and costumes. Samba is a type of fast Brazilian music, which is perfect for dancing. The carnival lasts two days and over 20 samba schools perform, a total of 70,000 people in brightly coloured costumes, all dancing and singing! It is a magnificent spectacle and millions of people watch the carnival on television around the world. Rio de Janeiro is a religious city and it is full of churches. Some, like the former Imperial Church, were built over 400 years ago while others, like the Metropolitan Cathedral, are very modern. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in 1976 and is so large that 20,000 people can stand inside at one time! Another important religious site in Rio is the Corcovado hill.

(A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

(A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

(A) different regions of the brain have to work separately (B) people with phonagnosia are good at facial recognition (C) regions of the brain for personal recognition are connected (D) person recognition is controlled by the same part of the brain [SEP] James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. "I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face," he said. "I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them."  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood.

02/27/2022 03:36:19 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] By writing the passage, the author mainly wants to tell us    _   . (A) to think twice before we act (B) to be grateful for what we have (C) it is no use making complaints (D) saying "thank you" has many disadvantages [SEP] Throughout our childhood our parents taught us to say "thank you" and it has become a habit -- something we say automatically  , along with "please". And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives. Just for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on. Now focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good! In fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy. Let me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables. There really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things. Realize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!

02/27/2022 03:53:21 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Other countries have similar sayings. It is true that all of us need _ We cannot work all the time if we are going to keep good health and enjoy life. Everyone has his own way of relaxing. Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

(B) a miner (C) a tailor (D) a soldier [SEP] Mark Twain left school when he was twelve. Though he had little school education, he became the most famous writer of his time. He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/27/2022 03:58:50 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Other countries have similar sayings. It is true that all of us need _ We cannot work all the time if we are going to keep good health and enjoy life. Everyone has his own way of relaxing. Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

(B) a miner (C) a tailor (D) a soldier [SEP] Mark Twain left school when he was twelve. Though he had little school education, he became the most famous writer of his time. He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

02/27/2022 04:15:37 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

(B) a miner (C) a tailor (D) a soldier [SEP] Mark Twain left school when he was twelve. Though he had little school education, he became the most famous writer of his time. He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer. Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad. Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try. The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat. How will they ever decide to which state they should travel? If only they could take two trips!

02/27/2022 04:15:40 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] The Sherman Antitrust Act  _  . (A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/27/2022 04:21:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Other countries have similar sayings. It is true that all of us need _ We cannot work all the time if we are going to keep good health and enjoy life. Everyone has his own way of relaxing. Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

(B) a miner (C) a tailor (D) a soldier [SEP] Mark Twain left school when he was twelve. Though he had little school education, he became the most famous writer of his time. He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer. Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad. Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try. The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat. How will they ever decide to which state they should travel? If only they could take two trips!

02/27/2022 04:38:31 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer. Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad. Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try. The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat. How will they ever decide to which state they should travel? If only they could take two trips!

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/27/2022 04:44:40 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

(B) a miner (C) a tailor (D) a soldier [SEP] Mark Twain left school when he was twelve. Though he had little school education, he became the most famous writer of his time. He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer. Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad. Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try. The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat. How will they ever decide to which state they should travel? If only they could take two trips!

02/27/2022 05:01:41 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army.

Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer. Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad. Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try. The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat. How will they ever decide to which state they should travel? If only they could take two trips!

The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large.

A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

02/27/2022 05:07:30 - INFO - __main__ -  [race-high] Which statement is NOT true according to the article? (A) In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different. (B) In the West, there is little difference between "sins" and "crimes". (C) An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another. (D) There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States. [SEP] The idea of "law" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is "right" and "wrong" and how "wrong" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider "laws" quite different from "customs". There is also a great contrast between "sins" (breaking religious laws) and "crimes" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become "big business." There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.

Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation.

He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts. In 1904, his wife died and then three of their children passed away. He died on April 21, 1910 at the age of 70.

Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer. Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad. Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try. The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat. How will they ever decide to which state they should travel? If only they could take two trips!

(A) affected only the companies doing business within state lines (B) sought to eliminate monopolies in favor of competition in the market-place (C) promoted trade with a large number of nations (D) provides a financial advantage to the buyer [SEP] One thinks of princes and presidents as some of the most powerful people in the world; however, governments, elected or otherwise, sometimes have had to struggle with the financial powerhouses called tycoons. The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons "capitals of industry" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel "robber barons", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth. The early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large. As the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business. There were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of such trusts. The Sherman Antitrust Act focused on two main issues. First of all, it made illegal any effort to interfere with the normal conduct of interstate trade. It also made it illegal to monopolize any part of business that operates across state lines. Over the next 60 years or so, Congress passed other antitrust laws in an effort to encourage competition and restrict the power of larger corporations.

In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.

/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
