[SEP] content: When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.

Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)

Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)

03/23/2022 16:13:25 - INFO - __main__ -  [amazon_polarity] title: The best Morandi title under $200.00 [SEP] content: The great strength of this book is its inclusive nature and the quality of printing. Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)

Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

[SEP] content: When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.

03/23/2022 16:23:43 - INFO - __main__ -  [amazon_polarity] title: The best Morandi title under $200.00 [SEP] content: The great strength of this book is its inclusive nature and the quality of printing. Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)

[SEP] content: When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.

Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always "escaped". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!

(the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost.

We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always "escaped". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

It covers a Reserve CA unit in Iraq in 2004 and provides good insight to what Civil Affairs does, but has some grammatical errors and editing issues. Good book, overall, but I'd like to see an active unit chronicled both in and out of the Global War on Terror.

If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.

In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

I caught myself reading "Crank" at lightning fast speeds because of how capturing her writing is. With writing in prose forms it offered me a new way of reading a book and having to learn how to read a book written this way. It was refreshing and daring. "Crank" is a detailed book about life, love, friends, family and drugs. You won't be disappointed.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money.

It's the only movie she ask for, but when she tried to watch it, it wouldn't work. There is a message that comes up saying wrong universal code. What does this mean, never seen this before. So basically I wasted my money & now need to purchase a new one.

Good book, overall, but I'd like to see an active unit chronicled both in and out of the Global War on Terror.

"Crank" is a detailed book about life, love, friends, family and drugs. You won't be disappointed.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram.

My main beef is this thing is a pig on batteries!Hyper sensitive for example while watching a movie the remote well turn on from the vibrations of the sub woofers and the remote is sitting on a pillow. If the remote is on a coffee table any one walks into the room the remote will turn on. While it is only on for 10 secs. it still is on and off constantly. Sent an e-mail to Universal Electronics on a way to reduce the sensitivity but received no responce, which I translate to meaning "not possible" Buyer beware and perhaps wait for the next model and perhaps this problem will be corrected.

This product is no longer being made! I put together a state of the art computer in 2004 using this leading edge ram, made by Kingston no less, and it is now no longer made!!! Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram. Not every vendor understands this and may only send you half of the kit (1 GB stick of ram).

03/23/2022 18:27:24 - INFO - __main__ -  [amazon_polarity] title: easy set up [SEP] content: Nothing could be easier to set up than this remote and very easy to operate.Support is there with a phone call for missing codes, fully programmable and a learning remote as well. My main beef is this thing is a pig on batteries!Hyper sensitive for example while watching a movie the remote well turn on from the vibrations of the sub woofers and the remote is sitting on a pillow. If the remote is on a coffee table any one walks into the room the remote will turn on. While it is only on for 10 secs. it still is on and off constantly. Sent an e-mail to Universal Electronics on a way to reduce the sensitivity but received no responce, which I translate to meaning "not possible" Buyer beware and perhaps wait for the next model and perhaps this problem will be corrected.

Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.

The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.

Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram. Not every vendor understands this and may only send you half of the kit (1 GB stick of ram).

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money.

It's the only movie she ask for, but when she tried to watch it, it wouldn't work. There is a message that comes up saying wrong universal code. What does this mean, never seen this before. So basically I wasted my money & now need to purchase a new one.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Anyone who is a fan already, has all of these songs and they sounded ten times better in a studio than they do onstage. If you haven't been a Chicks fan before, this one certainly won't convert you. Save the cash for their next album. Maybe it will be worth buying. This one is a stinker.

Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.

The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.

The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less.

In many cases the "band" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo. I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

It's the only movie she ask for, but when she tried to watch it, it wouldn't work. There is a message that comes up saying wrong universal code. What does this mean, never seen this before. So basically I wasted my money & now need to purchase a new one.

We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can.

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.

In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
/opt/conda/envs/meta/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:2105: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).
