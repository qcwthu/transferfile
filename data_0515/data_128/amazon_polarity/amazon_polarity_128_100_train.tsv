title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: I like it... [SEP] content: This was not a need but a want. I am a gadget freak and I also like good quality kitchen appliances.Works very well...to make MY Egg M?Muffins. I wish it had a lid..but it does not and so I use a small plate to cover.T-Fal...are you listening....how about a simple cover...with a simple handle... thanks :) This would give it 5 stars.	positive
title: Can't imagine a better performance! [SEP] content: I am clearly an amatuer regarding such matters, but I have never for a second regretted purchasing this set and find the performances and the recordings to be flawless. The Choral Fantasy was an unexpected bonus. I was not familiar with it when I bought this set, but now it is one of my favorites.I can't imagine anyone not being pleased with these recordings.	positive
title: Best Speaking Translator I've seen [SEP] content: I recently purchased & returned other speaking translators (voice phrase books / talking dictionaries) from other companies (other brands). This Franklin model is by far the best: clear, natural, speaking voice, vs. a computer-generated "robot voice", with others. My only criticism is that the speaking voice is too fast. At least it can be repeated as often as necessary.	positive
title: ultimate food count book [SEP] content: The Complete Book of Food Counts is essential to any successful healthy lifestyle. It is concise, clear and helpful in every way. I just had gastric bypass surgery and this book was recommended by my surgeon to help guide me nutritionally as I begin my new journey to eating right. This book will enable me to do that.	positive
title: not as the picture tells [SEP] content: if your looking for 10 great disc of 70's music then this is the place if your looking for a great box set to show off then your out of luck the box these CDs are pictured in is not included all i got was 5 CD cases (2 CDs in a case)scotch taped together i called amazone and they sent a replacement the next day but still no box ended up getting a discount and thats why it still got 5 stars sorry for the big run on mess but it may have saved you some money and time	positive
title: Million Dollar Consulting Toolkit [SEP] content: This is a good book for anyone considering starting a home-based consultancy. I have been cosluting for many years, the last ten or so from a home office. This is not an easy transition and I found the toolkit helpful in many ways.It would have been extremely useful had I had it when I started out many years ago. Useful when I made the change to a home office and I found it still full of useful things after 35 years in the business.For the consultant that operates alone this book should be on the reference shelf.(after it has been read of course!)Murray Harvey	positive
title: A must read for every lanlord and landlady [SEP] content: The landlord's Kit is an extremely well written guide to making more money and saving alot of headache in managing property.There are a ton of great ideas that really work.Mr. Taylor aka Mr. Landlord has been helping other landlords for years...it is great to see many of his ideas in book form. The forms,letters and notices are worth a fortune. Read this book and do what it says...it works!	positive
title: Real CSI show! [SEP] content: It's just like the real program on TV! I felt like I'm part of the team! It's no graphic play, but definitely entertaining! I bought the 2nd edition, too!	positive
title: Question, not a review [SEP] content: Does this movie have subtitles? It doesn't show that in the description, but with a release in Sept. 2011, I would have thought it would. My parents and I love this movie and I rated it based on seeing it on TCM previously	positive
title: Kindle [SEP] content: The Kindle device is truly amazing. I bought four of them; one for myself and three as Christmas gifts.I have two suggestions for future redesigns:1. Relocate the On-Off and the Antenna switches from the back of the device to the top leading edge. This makes it unnecessary to remove the device from its cover.2. To the right and left of the "amazonkindle" logo, add raised areas for thumbs to "dig in", making it easier to hold the device (especially when in bed, about to drift off into "la-la land"!).	positive
title: Good, but not quite 5 stars [SEP] content: If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix & Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me	positive
title: Graphic SF Reader [SEP] content: This book has Swamp Thing in outer space for a fair part of it, as he encounters various other dc figures in his travels, such as those from the planet Rann, and the odd Green Lantern, and even the New Gods.He does eventually end up back on Earth, and is a little peeved with some of the bad guys.As The Shadow would say, if Swamp Thing is after you, 'The weeds of crime bear bitter fruit.'	positive
title: saucepan [SEP] content: Product is very good. However the handle does get a little hot when boiling water. But otherwise good. Prompt delivery.	positive
title: Shadows Dance Sad Waltzes with a Sigh of Rapture [SEP] content: The above title is from a quote in the booklet, "in the north there are a lot of shadows. there are far more shadows than people. in the south the shadows are sharper and clearer. it is easier to talk to them. in the north, they dance sad waltzes with a sigh of rapture." - per kirkeby. This describes better than I can the exquisite interleaving of the fiddle of Ola Backstrom, the nykelharpa (keyed fiddle) of Johan Hedin and the sax of Jonas Knutsson. Each of these musicians is a virtuoso on their instrument and together these tracks are hypnotic and soaring at the same time. One of my all time favorite albums. Has proved excellent car music also, traveling through the snow fields of Minnesota I arrive serene.	positive
title: Considering the price, these are fantastic! [SEP] content: When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.	positive
title: great atmospheric gangster movie [SEP] content: I REALLY LIKED THE MOVIE LE SAMOURAI. STARRING ALAIN DELON AS ASSASSIN JEF COSTELLO.. I ALWAYS LIKED ALAIN DELON FOR SUCH A PRETTY BOY HE SURE PLAYS GREAT BADGUYS AND THATS HARD TO DO IF YOUR AS GOOD-LOOKING AS HE IS. ALAIN DELON PLAYS A HITMAN, A LONE WOLF, WHEN HE KILLS A NIGHTCLUB OWNER, A BEAUTIFUL BLACK PIANIST SEES HIM CLOSE UP BUT PROTECTS HIS ALIBI WHEN SHE IS QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE. ALAIN DELONS GIRLFRIEND IN THE MOVIE AND AT THE TIME ALAINS REAL LIFE WIFE, NATHALIE DELON PROTECTS HIS ALIBI TOO. JEF COSTELLO (ALAIN DELON) FINDS THE POLICE AND DOUBLE CROSSING MOB ASSOCIATES HOT ON HIS TAIL. I WONT RUIN THE ENDING AND THE GREAT CHASE SCENES BUT IT WAS A VERY GOOD FILM.	positive
title: The best Morandi title under $200.00 [SEP] content: The great strength of this book is its inclusive nature and the quality of printing. Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in. (PS the Morandi Museum in Bologna, Italy is worth a trip to that city in itself.)	positive
title: Good deal for the price point [SEP] content: I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter's 9th birthday. She requested binoculars so I wanted to give her something that was durable, water resistant and with decent optics, but not for $75-$100. These seem to meet all those criteria. I would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them. I advised my daughter NOT to test them for water resistance!	positive
title: a page turner [SEP] content: This was my first book by Phillip Margolin and I enjoyed it alot.Very fast moving and somewhat gruesome but good.I was able to figure out who the killer was about halfway through the book but that didn't take away from the suspense.I'll read more of his books-in fact the first chapter of The Associate was at the end of this book and the first chapter was enough for me to want to read it.He will be on my authors -to -watch -out- for-list.	positive
title: Gory yet beautiful, not as good as the others. [SEP] content: I was very happy that Sita survived the stake. Even for my tastes, I thought the book was a little too bloddy, but I still wouldn't have written it any other way. I thought that Sita pushed Joel into being a vampire too much, but I liked that she saved him from a painfull death. Everything leads up to the climax in Eddie's house very well, and the next book follows precisely how it should	positive
title: A very strong record [SEP] content: I really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. While this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. I really love her version of Springsteen's Tougher Than The Rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. Who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! Who cares about the "formula". It's a hell of an album. One simpl<y can't judge Emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. Just listen to it!!!	positive
title: Jean de Florette et Manon des sources [SEP] content: bien aimé ses deux films et aimerais les acheté si vous pouvié me les faires parvenire. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources en dvd. merci a vous.attend une réponse de vous.	positive
title: Russo novels seldom disappoint [SEP] content: The rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in Risk Pool are nothing less than adorable. Russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. Here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times. I've read six of Russo's novels and while this one wasn't my favorite, it's nonetheless a masterpiece. It starts to run out of gas in the last quarter of the book but by the end it's... kinda worth it.	positive
title: The Best Peeler Ever!!!! [SEP] content: I LOVE this peeler. The serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. Also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers. I know they call it a "soft-skin" peeler, but I've used it on potatoes and apples and eggplant with beautiful results. Since we got it, we now fight over who gets to peel the veggies! That never happened before!	positive
title: good productive [SEP] content: I purchased this product because it seemed interesting. Originally I thought I would use it for my creative writing. But it has become a daily tool for many things. It is very good	positive
title: Im in my Element! [SEP] content: Hearing this sound at "Q" in Adelaide made me only do one thing- go out and buy it. Why you ask, 'cos i was in my element. These raw beats produce an exillorating felling in my system. For those who play it hard, let yourself go and go even faster. But what ever you do dont turn back!	positive
title: Fusion Frenzy review [SEP] content: This game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.	positive
title: Thank you [SEP] content: The book arrived just on time. It was my pleasure to purchase book from your company. The book itself is very interesting too.	positive
title: Simply gorgeous [SEP] content: One of the places that most inspired Matisse was Morocco, a country of huge contrasts, vivid colors and dramatic landscapes .I missed the landmark exhibition for which this book served as the catalog, but I purchased it after vacationing in Morocco. Matisse's view of the country emphasizes the colors of Moroccan cities and landscapes -- intense orange-reds and azure bluesz. It is also informed and inspired by Moroccan design, which combines Mediterranean and Islamic elements to beautiful effect.	positive
title: Difficult decision [SEP] content: Excellent! This really is a great collection of mixes. When I pop this one in my car, I find it hard to decide which one to start with. Here's me thinking: "Let's see, I'll start with... the original version, NO WAIT! number three, NO TWO! FOUR, I meant FOUR! NO TWO!!!..." No wonder I'm always late for work - I spend half my day dancing in the car. A must-have for those who like remixed k.d.	positive
title: The title is an oxymoron, but they did a good job of making it simple [SEP] content: I actually really like this book, but I think you do need the extra guidance of a professor when using it. It's very easy to look up the pharmaceuticals and all related info, and I was actually able to use it easily when taking the open book section (looking up the pharms) of a pharmacotherapeutics test. I would definitely recommend this book.	positive
title: Incredible value not to be missed [SEP] content: This book is full of priceless information about places you would otherwise never hear about. It is not to be missed.	positive
title: Great movie! [SEP] content: This is the epitome of a "B" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!	positive
title: oh my gosh [SEP] content: phenominal game. like the other guy, i am about 21 percent through the game but i found the chase exhilerating, like no other in any game. the blurryness is from your panic and if you do well, you won't be very blurry but if you keep looking at the guys breaking down doors that you lock behind you, or get shot a couple times, it goes downhill fast, but that is what makes it so intense. i wish they made more games like this where you actually do things and flesh out the story before going in guns blazing (like half life 1). overall one of a kind game and actually pretty scary and intene. I don't even find games like resident evil or silent hill 2 to be scary or intense like this. hell of a game with great graphics on my 360 and great surround sound with an enthralling storyline and detailed world. very good for a mature gamer who has other games like devil may cry and halo to satisfy my bloodlust.	positive
title: Lost and Found [SEP] content: For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did.	positive
title: Great STORY + Great ACTING = GREAT MOVIE ! ! ! [SEP] content: "THE MAJESTIC"Everyone is fantastic in this movie. Very tight acting and very believable characters. It's easy to care for them and want what they want. Jim Carrey is fantastic, too. He can really bring a tear to the eye when he wants to. He does a SUPERB JOB and I am impressed. I didn't know Ace Ventura had it in him.If you like movies that are meaningful and thought pervoking then I highly recommend 'The Majestic'. Taking a serious movie in, now and then, helps to keep life into perspective. GREAT MOVIE!!!	positive
title: Great product I have used for years [SEP] content: If you are looking for a good product at a great price, this is it. I have used this ointment for years and have had no problems with skin breakdown. Great protection for anyone with irritating skin problems. Helps protect against diaper rash and more. Highly recommended by my doctor to me. Buying this in the one-pound jar is also more economical.	positive
title: Andy Williams at his best [SEP] content: These two albums are a collection of lesser known Andy Williams songs that are masterfully mixed and interwoven. The entire series of songs related to If Wishes Were Horses and the sense of living in the moment, using a New Christy Minstrals hit song, brings back wonderful memories and provides a provocative listening experience, as well as being a window into the personal challenges and emotions of the artist at that time.	positive
title: nice [SEP] content: Mine came defective but belkin replaced it after i had to return it at my expense. the new one is working fine just don't know if it is helping.	positive
title: Blossom47 is now happy. [SEP] content: With a love list I put some one on it:Sara,Jessica,Ruby,Kandra(A little.)Jessica,too.Also a H8 One:Punkstar,(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOUR A GOTH).So Your on the love list ,Becuz you rock,Angel's gettin' on the love list!Love Blossom47!	positive
title: A monster of a book. [SEP] content: Rambling, discursive, entertaining informative and highly individual. With particular reference to eastern Europe and Orthodoxy. Norman is a eastern European specialist and so balances up the usual highly Western European, Catholic/Protestant bias found in histories of this sort.	positive
title: Kept my attention! [SEP] content: I started reading this book while walking on the treadmill.. I normally hate doing cardio because i get so bored and cant seem to get in the grove. I enjoyed this book so much that i looked forward to doing cardio, just so i could simply read. It kept my attention, and kept me wanting more.. Its very different from Nicholas Sparks other books in that it does have mystery and intense parts!	positive
title: Love Them! [SEP] content: I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!	positive
title: Delightful story with wonderful ensemble of actors [SEP] content: This story of a poor British girl with limited means and a big imagination is one of my favorite movies, and always leaves a smile on my face (and maybe a few tears in my eyes, too.). The cast is absolutely dreamy, including Jim Broadbent, Stephen Rea, John Lithgow, the hilarious Kevin Kline, and the beautiful Phoebe Cates as the "Princess". Anyone who loves "period" pieces will love this film. (It is now being shown on the "Romance" cable TV channel, too.)	positive
title: I love this gadget [SEP] content: I maintain 4400 sq ft of wood floors and I own 1 of these. I am buying 3 more to place inconspicuously around my living areas. I like to sweep to touch up high traffic areas like the entry and kitchen. It makes things more convienent.	positive
title: Great finale for Jack Ryan. [SEP] content: I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book.	positive
title: Beautiful photos . Good information [SEP] content: Very beautiful and relaxing photos . Good articles with parties rules and settings of different festivals and with different person . Good DIY little projects . Very useful appendix with some flowers introduction, teaching of napkin floding etc. A good bookfor when you want to plan parties. But sometimes quite dull.	positive
title: These things work! [SEP] content: I am a serious walker. I have walked 10 miles virtually every day, except Sundays, for over eight years. I figure that I have walked over 25,000 miles during this time. I am 68 years old. An article about exercise and longevity at The New England Journal of Medicine got me started on such an endeavor. Plantar Fascitis (heel pain) has bothered me quite a bit lately. So much so, that I have been contemplating cutting back on my walking. Today, I received my order of these heel protectors. I put one on my left heel and I received immediate pain relief. I will keep you posted on how they work over longer term.	positive
title: The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street Lives On Today..Serendipity [SEP] content: A fabulous ending to over 20 years of letter writing. Penpals of sorts. A must read for anyone, but writers it can tear down any writers block you could possibly have. She is so articulate and real. I highly suggest this book!	positive
title: Wonderful masterpiece.... [SEP] content: The best movie chronicling the life of a composer I have seen to date. Except, the storyline involving Salieri's connection to Mozart's death, isn't exactly factual, it was clever to assume so. Tom Hulce as Mozart gives a breathtaking performance. He becomes the character. I loved his crazy laugh! This is definitely a movie to see - it was quite epic for me.	positive
title: Very enjoyable and fun movie [SEP] content: I really enjoyed this movie. I seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one I did. The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it "Gone with the Wind" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie.	positive
title: Best of the Bunch [SEP] content: Let's get something straight right now:The intelligentsia loves Empire Strikes Back. They say it's because Empire is one of the only blockbuster movies that actually has a downer ending in which the bad guys win. They enjoy being contrarian. They're deluded.The romantics love Return of the Jedi. They get all teary-eyed at the funeral pyre scene when Anakin Skywalker appears in his non-Darth Vader form at the end. They are simpering sentimental fools.Only degenerates love Episodes I thru III. They need counseling.The original Star Wars is without a doubt the BEST of the series. None of the other films come close. The good thing about this particular package is that Disc 2 contains the ACTUAL original, not the bogus "enhanced" Star Wars with the silly new graphics, symbols in themselves of all sorts of late-life regrets and insecurities on Lucas's part. No, Disc 2 contains the real deal. The best of the bunch, unsullied and unsurpassed.	positive
title: Good Show History [SEP] content: I have watched the show since 1956. It was fun to read about the show over the years.	positive
title: Gets an absolute beginner up and running. [SEP] content: This book is aimed at those who are completely new to Access. It will systematically, for the most part, allow a beginner to become familiar with Tables, Forms, Queries,etc... Good examples, CD contains video examples as well. If your new to Access and want to be held by the hand then buy this book.	positive
title: perfect [SEP] content: this coffee maker travels with me everywhere. it is well made and the extra shot a great hidden gem. buy it!	positive
title: Reply To Music Man from the UK or something along that line [SEP] content: the song they sing on the bus is "tiny dancer" by elton john where they all start joining in, hope this helped you	positive
title: A Role-Play Specific Doll - Great for the Ballerina Baby Girl [SEP] content: This was another Christmas gift for our 3-year-old daughter, who began taking ballet lessons this past fall. She was very specific about the Barbie she wanted, and it was this one.The Barbie is very articulated (knee and foot positions) which is probably better enjoyed by the older ballet and Barbie fan. Our daughter is younger and has more fun with Kelly spinning to the music, and the fact that one can hold Barbie by the crown on top and spin her as well. The ballet barre and bag haven't caught her eye; it's the dancing Kelly. Because the ballet shoes are molded onto both dolls' legs, these cannot be dressed up like other Barbie and Kelly dolls. These two beautiful dolls are specific to the ballet role-play.	positive
title: Wonderful Storytelling! [SEP] content: Jim Dale does a fun and incredible job as narrator of the Harry Potter books. After listening to Sorcerer's Stone I immediately picked up the rest of the series. I admire how he comes up with different accents for the many characters. I even ordered the UK version from ..., and nice as those are, I think Jim Dale's version takes the cake - or pumpkin pasties!	positive
title: Beautiful Picture [SEP] content: I have been looking for this blu-ray for my husband for some time. It hasn't been in any store I have looked and every else online had outrageous prices. I am so happy I looked on Amazon before giving up. We popped it in our PS3 and the picture is absolutely phenomenal. I even ended up watching it with him.	positive
title: Do not use a generic battery! [SEP] content: I want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, like the person from San Diego who reviewed the S410 on May 15, 2004, was recommending. Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue. So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake. If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.	positive
title: Best new Handheld System than Sony's PSP [SEP] content: I think it is cool for Nintendo to make this new Handheld System great for Fans of Nintendo. I mean the Reason why I said this is better than The Playstation Portible (Sony's 1st handheld system) because Sony doesn't know what the heck there making I mean Nintendo made more Games for the DS than Sony because Sony is making a little bit of Games for the PSP but I betcha the DS is going to be better.	positive
title: ok [SEP] content: These were quite heavy. My son said his feet sweat when he wore them with his boots. So he wears them around the house instead of slippers. They have held up to many washings. I would recommend them.	positive
title: A must buy [SEP] content: Having no idea what to expect before going to my first Rebecca's Statue show, I asked around. "Like Phish, but more bluesy.", some said. "Highly inspirational", a rollicking young hipster blurted out. The Statue was all these things, and then some. But could they make an album? Many spectacular live bands have trouble going from the live world to the studio world. Well simply put, they got it taken care of. This album ranks high among my favorites. The Statue is one of those bands that has so many influences it would be impossible to name a few bands or styles as their influence. All I can say is that I've played this CD for fans of jazz, blues, hard rock, pop, and bluegrass, and all of those people have bought "Drinking From the Water Clock", or gone to a Statue show. You will not be disappointed with this disc.	positive
title: snow treasure [SEP] content: This was a gift for my 2nd grade Grandson. He is an advanced reader, and we constantly set the goals for him. I read this the first time at age 28, and it was the start of my reading journeys	positive

title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Brash [SEP] content: I bought this album because I broke the first one (it was literally smashed during a move and in 3 pieces). I didn't hesitate to replace this album because it's so great. I hope I don't break this one but if I do, I'll replace it again.	positive
title: Good movie all around! [SEP] content: I bought this for myself a short time ago and I love it. An excellent piece for my movie collection.	positive

title: PLUS WHAT???? [SEP] content: I am a huge YES fan. I had this on pre-order, and I would like to knowwhat the difference is from the same item that was released in 2006??Same booklet (almost), the 2006 release is Same format, 2 DVD'sand has bonus material this one don't have. Search for "An evening of YesMusic Plus". The one released Aug 2007 is this single DVD version with'PLUS Nothing". It is missing the Bonus material, including the last twosongs.Everything else appears to be identical. Format, Sound. Why do they dothis? I don't understand. Well, back it goes. I have the 2 DVDAn Evening of Yes Music Plus"Evening of YES MusicPlus" with Plus. Then again, I have to give it 1 more star if youfigure the tiny bit more "Plus" you get is $48, verses $13 for this one...	positive
title: A Fresh Sound to a Point. . . [SEP] content: With some of the same tone and feeling as Nik Bärtsch's Ronin modal improvisations, this album of the postmodern avant-garde trio The Bad Plus demonstrates why they were selected for the recent album of Disney covers, Everybody Wants to Be a Cat. Their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist Anderson, two by drummer King, and one by pianist Iverson) are energetic and often noisy. Each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. The scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. The lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, Giant, arises as a fresh breeze. The well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. The problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. The musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick.	positive
title: Perfect Diversion- Beachside read! [SEP] content: Danielle Steele writes another diversionary read with a fun happy ever after ending! I love this kind of book for a quick mental getaway. Read it in one sitting and think of it as the perfect style writing for women who just need a quick fun pick up. Entertaining and fun to read.	positive
title: Robbie Shaw's BOEING 747: Great Book for 747 Fans! [SEP] content: This book is the greatest Boeing 747 book I have read so far; I have my own copy and I never tire of looking through it and admiring the great photos and detailed captions telling the whole story of the particular aircraft pictured, including its name, tail number, previous owners, etc. I also love the text; it is a great history of all the series of 747s: -100, -200, cargo, SP, -300, and -400. Some of my favorite photos are of a TWA 747-100, the Pan Am 747s, the SPs, and the Aer Lingus 747-100. The only things that are missing that I'd like to see are "classic" 747s (Delta, American, Braniff, National, etc) and interior shots. Otherwise, an A-1 747 book for Jumbo fans like me!Francis Smith (smitfj01@holmes.ipfw.edu) Garrett, Indiana USA	positive
title: A good book [SEP] content: Ishmael by Daniel Quinn is a novel about a man seeking knowledge of human fallacies andhow to save the world. It is about teacher who is a gorilla named Ishmael who has studied human nature for much of his life. Ishmael teaches the man about the two human cultures, the Takers and the Leavers. It gave a lot of insight into human nature and why Takers feel the need to conquer the land. The manner in which Quinn portrays his ideas through question and answer relation instigates self and social analysis. It bashes our culture which is a uncomfortable but necessary. Te reader is involved in the learning process. The format is tiring after awhile, and the book lascks plot. The realizations about everyday life make the book worthwhile and a very good read.	positive
title: Great overview of portable houses world wide [SEP] content: This book does a nice job of surveying the portable housing around the world in traditional and upscale modern applications. However did not cover the mobile home, RV's, double-wides and Modular industries here in the US which is the largest use of mobile housing in the world. Yeah I know, no style, history of crappy cheap construction and lot's of bad press. Regardless, millions are still sold and built in the US and will continue to be, as Mobile housing fits our culture and pocketbook better than Mac-mansions do ! Portable houses does a great job of introducing what other cultures have and continue to use.	positive
title: GEORGE FORMAN MODEL #GRP90WGR [SEP] content: This is a great item and the reason I chose it was the removable plates. It is so much easier to clean than the ones that you cant remove the plates.	positive
title: A tight fit, but worth every penny [SEP] content: I've always wanted to try something more than just the standard paper filters, but money was always the winner in the end. After having to trim some of the rubber molding to fit the filter in my Maxima (not supposed to have done that), it works well. I bought a spare just in case too.	positive
title: Great Product [SEP] content: This rootbeer kit is great. It is easy and fun to use. If your rootbeer is flat, you probably didn't let it sit in a warm, dark place long enough. It also tastes a lot better if you refrigerate it overnight before drinking it. Hope this helps.	positive
title: wonderful!! [SEP] content: this is a very good nancy drew book.even though it took me a lot of time ot locate,i'd say it's really worth the hunt.in this book,cindy austin,the daughter of two biochemists vanishes from her house so as to challenge nancy to find her.but when she gets kidnapped the second time,she's kidnapped for real.read on and you'll know what happens next.i'm proud i bought this book.you will be too,once you get it.	positive
title: Trimline Soft Recovery Collar 4" [SEP] content: This soft recovery collar was terrific for keeping our bunny away from her stitches. She was able to eat, drink and hop around without any problems. The rigid plastic collars were a nightmare! This one was so much easier on us and the bunny!	positive
title: Works as advertised [SEP] content: Works just fine on my Archos 504. As other buyers have noted, similar generic products WILL NOT work on Archos players; it has to be specifically compatible with Archos. Sound and video quality met and exceeded my expectations. I haven't tested this, but I would guess that using this cord prolongs battery life as well (because the player doesn't have to power its LCD screen, the biggest power-draining feature).	positive
title: better-than-average black metal [SEP] content: Once you get past the disorganized drumming (typical of black metal) you get creative & mellodic all girl metal from Greece! Imagine a riot-grrl version of Borgnagar, early Sirenia and (very) early Moonspell. Here's hoping for a second CD from these lovely ladies!	positive
title: I liked it [SEP] content: The book was in good condition. I ordered the wrong book but decided to keep the handbook that went with the book.	positive
title: Another Winner [SEP] content: I am a huge fan of MHC. I have to say this is one of her best. Not too many characters to keep track of. She has a tendency to do that. Which is a weakness of hers.This was very suspenseful. I had a hard time putting it down. No lags in this story. I love the fact that she gets her point across without the profanity that some authors think they have to have.I will keep her on my must read list.	positive
title: Russell Watson is versatile [SEP] content: Russell's versatility talent is shown on this album. The voice is just the voice. This one is not like his albums before which have many classic songs (kind of tenor)that for some is unlistenable,:)(you know..)I am not particularly fan of certain kind music. I do like pop,rock,classical,jazz or should i just say good music.So, now we have Frank Sinatra songs covered by Russell here. Though I am not fans of Frank Sinatra before, I can say I really enjoy this cd and that make me want to collect some Sinatra's album.Last, I would say as a fan of Russell's voice, for non classical audience this is the voice for you to enjoy.	positive
title: THE BEST CD OF THE YEAR!!!!! [SEP] content: What can I say? This is the best work EARTH WIND & FIRE has done in years. I'm most excited about two songs: 1)"Lovely People" (you can't help, but, just get up and dance to it); and 2) "Pure Gold" (Maurice's voice sounds so sweet and rich) I highly recommend that you buy it. You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: My favorite Keith Jarret CD [SEP] content: I have almost ALL Keith Jarret solo CDs, and this is my favorite.Maybe I am biased since it was my first Keith Jarret CD back in high school (wow that was LONG ago), but still it is beautiful.	positive
title: Color is Different [SEP] content: I bought the brown guitar strap. What was delivered was much darker than what is shown in here. I wanted a lighter one just as shown. Anyway, this strap is good. Cannot return the item as I am outside the US.	positive
title: A great addition to your studying material [SEP] content: I've purchased this book elsewhere. But this is not the point. I will compare it to Giles. Much better, both construction of the studying material and exam question-answer part. Unlike Giles, NPTE has thorough explained question and answer choices, and an option of pausing the test. NPTE has three exams. Giles though has four exams and visually it is constructed very closely to a real one, little if any question explanation. Bottom part you'll benefit from both. But if you're short of green go with NPTE. Don't know the difference between NPTE 2008 and 2009 editions though. I'd be thankful if you'll provide that info.Thank you,PoleginI just had a look at 2009 edition. All that's been added is a color print, that is it. Test questions are the same.	positive
title: Pretty good, but not perfect [SEP] content: I've been looking for a portable magnetic chess set. This one came highly recommended. I give it four stars. I generally like it, especially its ability to leave the pieces in place, while putting on the lid.It has some annoying features.The first problem is that a bishop looks a lot like a pawn. Especially in low light, or if you're in a hurry to set up, it's easy to confuse the pieces.The second problem is that some of the magnets weren't well glued to the base of some of the pieces. I went through the pieces one by one, and reglued the magnets to about 1/4 of them.The third, minor, annoyance is that it doesn't have letters and numbers for algebraic notation of moves. I tried using a P-touch labeler, but that ended up looking tacky and cheap, so I hand-lettered the ranks and files with a black Sharpie.I'd buy it again, even knowing these problems.	positive
title: Cow must-have! [SEP] content: Great book if you are thinking about getting a family cow, really the best book I've found on the subject. I love the author's tone and also like checking her webpage info that supports this book!	positive
title: Enjoyable read if you can suspend disbelief [SEP] content: I enjoyed this book, but I still like Stephen King's The Stand better. The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either "good" or "bad." I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading.	positive
title: This book will make your mouth water and your belly growl [SEP] content: This is a wonderful book about eating in the South, eating out and eating in, about a whole host of things like family and fellowship that gather around any groaning board in the south, and what you want to eat where and what the people who live there eat, how to cook it and where you're likely to find it at a reasonable price made by food-loving hands. John Egerton clearly ate his way across the south to write this book, and he was careful to stay well off the beaten path. It's anthropology, sociology, recipes, culture and good humor, from the North Carolina mountains to the swamps of Cajun country. This book will make your mouth water and your belly growl, but most of all it's a fine read.	positive
title: A sharp knife is a safe knife. [SEP] content: Bought this a gift for my dad, and he has been kind enough to let me use it. This knife sharpener is great. Used to use a honing stone - results were excellent but very time consuming. This sharpens everything I have tried (pocket knife, kitchen knifes, outdoor knives) in a few minutes.It is true that a sharp knife is safer than a dull one, but only if you are expecting it! Warn your friends if they borrow your freshly sharpened knife!	positive
title: Dustbuster [SEP] content: So far its a good vacuum and does what I expected it to do. tried other hand vacs butwent back to black and decker.	positive
title: Loads of entertainment [SEP] content: My son was given this when he was 6 months old. He had already mastered his walker and hated the megasaucer. I was worried that with not liking the megasaucer, he wouldn't care for the this also limiting his movement, but he loves it! It has so many types of toys attached to it and different sound options, it's great. The tray that is removeable is actually one of his favorite parts. He takes it out every time and loves hitting it against the other parts, or just holds it in his hand as he moves around. Funny how the slimpliest things are the best fun for babies.It does take up a fair amount of space, so be prepared if you're limited in that area. Another reviewer said it didn't have height adjustment, it actually does have two settings. There's a clip under the material seat that will help raise the entire seat up one time.	positive
title: This is the greatest all boy group I have ever heard!!!! [SEP] content: When I first heard the song "Say It" I was skating with my boyfriend. We had just started going out and we didn't have a "song" yet. I loved this song so much that we decided to make it"our song". I listen to it every night while I'm falling asleep. I love it so much. The only thing I would love more than this song is to have them sing at our wedding!!!!!!!!	positive
title: Great Carseat [SEP] content: I wasnt ready to put my 3yr old in a booster seat, but he was almost to outgrow the 40lb weight limit on his other carseat. The Regent is perfect for him! It was easy to install, and fits in our minivan great! And this seat will fit him for years to come. I'd definitely recommend this seat to a friend.	positive
title: Possibly the best sing-a-long soundtrack ever! [SEP] content: Almost thirty years since the music of the film first saw the light of day, the soundtrack from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is quite possibly the best sing-along soundtrack album ever. I mean, is there anyone in the world who hasn't heard such timeless classics as "Time Warp" or "Sweet Transvestite"?This isn't an album that'll appeal to everyone - some of the tracks are pretty naff, but that's part of the fun of "Rocky Horror..". The only regret about this CD is it doesn't include the lovely ballad "Once In A While" (which was, incidentally, cut from the film). In my opinion, that was one of the best songs. Never mind, you still have a great album here, but you really need to see the movie to fully enjoy it.Jon.	positive
title: Key Management Questions: Smart Questions for Every Business Situation by [SEP] content: A must read of every middle level manager upwards to start honing your questioning skills.	positive
title: Works Fine, Auto Shut-Off A Big Plus [SEP] content: This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise.	positive
title: Best Brush for Dogs with Undercoats [SEP] content: This brush is perfect for dogs with undercoats. (My dog is part husky.) You don't have to use a lot of muscle either to get all the undercoat and dead hair off. This has an ergonomic grip and a sturdy metal frame. I bought an imitation version of this tool years ago. Same shedding edge but a plastic handle. That plastic handle broke on the second use.You can feel that the Furminator is solid and substantial.	positive
title: Excellent value. [SEP] content: When the battery that came with my Canon camera stopped holding a charge, I was torn with spending a big chunk of change on a new Canon battery or just shopping for a new camera that used regular batteries. I was so excited to find this generic battery at such a great price.	positive
title: After a couple of days my tennis elbow was gone [SEP] content: Odd as the exercise sounds and as odd as the simple device seems to be. It worked. Within 3 days i was no longer hurting from tennis elbow. Keep doing the exercises though. Don't make the mistake of stopping just as soon as the pain goes away. Later on if you think it is coming back than go do those exercises again. So glad my boss told me about it.	positive
title: Kilzer is the man!!! [SEP] content: The first song I heard from this album was the radio friendly " Green Yellow Red". I rushed out and bought the thing and was blown away. There isn't a weak track to be found. I shortly discovered that they were all radio friendly. My opinion is that you could take any song from this album have a hit. It's a crying shame Kilzer never received more acclaim than he did, although he was pretty popular in the Little Rock/Memphis area for a while. Not only was he a great song writer and musician, but a very cool dude as well who never turned down a chance to play for anyone. I saw him perform at the Pi Kappa Alpha frat house on the campus of UALR. No band - only a guitar, harmonica, and the man himself, and he is just as good live as in the studio. If you enjoy great stuff with a timeless vibe, this is the album for you.	positive
title: Great debut, very under-rated as far as radio goes... [SEP] content: I have all 3 of Chris's albums, all are great, but I'm just surprised I've never heard much if anything from this one on radio. Good album all the way through but some of my favorites are "Beer or Gasoline", "Burn", "Drinking Me Lonely", and "Small Town Big Time". I would highly recomend all of his albums, he's true country and that's hard to find in today's pop and rock based country trends...	positive
title: Basic Leadership Principles with Excellent Examples [SEP] content: This book was an enjoyable, practical and applicable read. Phillips outlines a number of basic leadership principles and uses relevant examples from Abraham Lincoln's time as Commander in Chief during the Civil War. This book will be enjoyable both for Lincoln fans and those looking for basic concepts of leadership.The book is broken down into four areas: People, Character, Endeavor, and Communication with sub-chapters that further support each area. Each sub-chapter is synopsized with summary bullets called "Lincoln Principles" that highlight the cogent thoughts of that section."Lincoln on Leadership" is a good primer to provide a basic overview of leadership principles, and will not be useful for teaching about advanced leadership topics. However, Phillips' use of relevant examples from Lincoln's life made the book applicable to a number of leadership scenarios and made this book very enjoyable.	positive
title: The best [SEP] content: OMG you will be on the floor this is the best of Jeff Dunham. He is so funny you will never stop laughing	positive
title: Stonewall and General Lee [SEP] content: Jeff Shaara's GODS AND GENERALS is a very fine book. However, as has probably been said at least two hundred times in the reviews, its not at the level of his father's THE KILLER ANGELS. Part of the problem is that Jeff Shaara is limited in his choices on who to develop on the Union side that will bring both continuity and yet freshness to this prequel of THE KILLER ANGELS. Hancock is the obvious choice, but the Chamberlain is a mistake. It feels forced and flat. On the flip side, however, the choice of Jackson is inspired and easily the best storyline in the book.Despite the criticisms, still a very worthwhile book.	positive
title: ALWAYS A PLEASER!! [SEP] content: I am never disappointed when reading a Michael Palmer. I think the man could scribble on tree bark and I'd be happy.As always, the storyline is believable and easy to follow.Definitely worth the time to read!!	positive

We have it in the dinningroom beside our table...on carpet.She loves to eat at it - if shes ready to eat she goes and sits at the table...the chairs are really light wieght so she has no trouble pulling them out to sit in.The chairs are pretty sturdy to, she has me sit in them all the time and her daddy..lol - I would recommend trying it out -	positive
title: Item Very Small [SEP] content: The product is nice, but small. I was hoping for a larger one. The measurements are described, but, my mind invisioned larger.	positive
title: Home filter [SEP] content: Perfect, finally we have avery good water for everything. Before we use only Aquasana filters for drinking water and for showers, now we have filtered water for everything. Mike	positive
title: Even Frenchmen can learn from this book! [SEP] content: This book is a good start to understand how we the French are so different..of course to us the "Americains" are the different ones...I wish there were more books like this one about all cultures.Even for a native it is always good to revisit some of the history and to understand how behaviors and cultures are shaped by past experiences. It is true for individuals as well as for nations.I am a French living in the states married to an american and finally understood some of the cultural differences my husband and I have been arguing about for the last few years thanks to 60 million Frenchmen can't be wrong!If you plan on living in France, are living with a French or just interested in knowing why French can be so annoying read on! You won't be disappointed.Excellent job on the not so known Algerian war which I agree with the authors has contribute to shape contemporary France as much as WWII.	positive
title: Best I've tried so far..... [SEP] content: Have long, fine hair...& am now using this with my hot rollers...The Redken product made my hair positively CRUNCHY..(Tossed it out!).. This bottle is pretty small for someone with long hair, but gotta have something. It keeps the curls pretty well and adds some shine. Will keep using till I find something better....	positive
title: good for bad backs [SEP] content: I have a recurring pinched nerve in my neck, and I was very hesitant to start yoga for fear of getting hurt again. This video is very gentle, and offers easier versions of traditional beginner poses. I am getting stronger and stronger, and I can now do more difficult yoga videos without fear.	positive
title: Wow! If you haven't read this book, read it NOW! [SEP] content: I loved this book!It was written as a real 13 year old would write!I mean, it sounded like it could be my diary!I never got bored reading this book, and I read it at least 6 times!	positive
title: Provocative and interesting [SEP] content: This was a very enjoyable excursion into an out of the ordinary look at the Old One and various old ways. I didn't always agree with it, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and I recommend it.	positive
title: Not to shabby FOR THE PRICE! [SEP] content: Well Invicta definitely has the looks down perfectly. This watch looks exactly like the Rolex submariner. That is where the similarities end however. for the price I can't really complain, however if I would have spent over $100 on this I would have been honestly let down. It feels fairly chintzy in hand, the bracelet is something like you would see from a Chinese knockoff, and the bezel is not as tight as I expected it to be. But the watch has a good quality Japanese movement from Seiko. It works well and as I said in the beginning it looks exactly like a Rolex submariner.	positive
title: Buy it, you will love it [SEP] content: I wish Theresa Monsour has written more books, she is a great writer. I would compare her to John Sanford style wise, however Paris Murphy is very much different than Lucas Davenport is in Sanfords books. I can't wait for the next book!	positive
title: A very powerful story. [SEP] content: This book was very good. I would recommend it to anyone. It really opens your eyes to how some people were treated. It also has a very good story line and kept me guessing until the very end. It was one of the best books I've ever read.	positive
title: old favorite [SEP] content: I love the story; it's a tearjerker for me. Meryl is one of my faves and De Niro has great rapport with her in this movie. Seeing the fashions from the 80'a is always fun too :)	positive
title: Homeschooling: The Middle Years [SEP] content: This is a very informative book especially for first-time homeschoolers. It was well written and very well organized. The resources listed were very helpful.My only complaint was the unnecessary criticism of classroom teachers. Unless Ms. Henry was once a classroom teacher herself, I feel she is unqualified to claim that "the most average high school graduate could produce average work in this not-so-challenging college major." I was disappointed in this display of subjective writing in an otherwise well-written book.	positive
title: Hey I really like This! [SEP] content: This is a good one Laurnea! I have all of your CDs, I think?.I have been following you sense "Betta Listen" your first on Yab Yum / Sony. I have Laurnea II and New Territory both on JVC Japan.I can see the growth in this CD. And it takes you through a journey into Laurnea's world . I really like the smooth happy feeling it gives me and I want to listen to it over and over again. I will buy it as a gift for a lot of people. Her voice is amazing and comforting. Everyone should have this in their collection.Kellie	positive
title: This product does not work! [SEP] content: Dont buy this! It really sucks and does not warm the towels. The bars feel warm, but when you put a towel on the bars it only warms right where the towels touch. Not the whole towel. In the process of getting my money back	negative
title: Soft Metal Means These Break After 1-2 Uses [SEP] content: I was thrilled when these arrived in the mail. The price seemed unbeatable, and they fit securely to all of my standard bits. However, the metal in the hex screws is very soft, and after only 1 use the heads were completely stripped -- making these stop collars completely useless.I was using these in a fine woodworking application. But perhaps if you just wanted to use them as a guide for drilling into drywall, plaster, etc., then you could secure them less tightly to your bits (and thus, hopefully, delay stripping the cheap screws).	negative
title: Good information, but redundant. [SEP] content: I purchased this book to assist in staff training. I have found it to contain useful information. However, after the first chapter, it tends to repeat itself without introducing much new helpful information. There are lots of checklists for staff self-evaluations that, when scored, do not include information on improving their weak areas. Also, as this book was written for the UK, I have found the language to be interesting, but a slight drawback. There is quite a bit of UK slang (such as tatty, taken out of a skip, put a tick in the appropriate column, etc.). And there was an interesting, but not so useful for the US, chapter on British Telecom.	negative
title: Not a Garrett PI series #2 [SEP] content: I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Passage of Arms because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.	negative
title: Downright Silly, Not Funny [SEP] content: Chris Farley plays the role of a clumsy ninja, ridiculous to the extent that I feel that it is an insult to ninjas. The movie is plain silly, not funny. This guy is worse than Jar-Jar Binks.Hard to imagine anybody could find this show funny.This is the worst comedy that I come across so far.	negative
title: City Baby L.A. - Dont buy it, use a phone book. [SEP] content: This book is pages and pages of listings of things like daycare centers and their phone numbers. It is also geared toward the woman who is about to have a baby a lot. Dont waste your money. Buy "Baby's day out in Southern California" which is the great book recommended by the triple-A.	negative
title: Not Worth the Trouble. [SEP] content: While the game appeals to a certain juvenile streak, the fun quickly wears off. The humour value of being able to steal every car on the screen is limited at best. You are left with a repetive game with very little plot to drive it forward. You end up merely driving around the city in circles.	negative
title: Weak copy of need for speed [SEP] content: Everything about this game is lame, the graphics , the user interface, and the very slow since of speed, car's going 150 mph feel like 70 mph! you can pump up your ride to 600+HP! and cars with 200HP will beat you! If you are a fan of need for speed underground stay away from this stinker!! This game is very dissapointing! avoid it at all cost's!!!	negative
title: What a Pervert! [SEP] content: This was a horrible book!Anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been "watching [the heroine] from afar". He had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.It sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist."Love" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book.	negative
title: Crappy crap crap (crap) [SEP] content: This Clerks-esk low budget film is, shall I say, crap. I love Bam and his CKY disks and Viva La Bam make me laugh so hard I have to pee. This movie was poorly acted (no surprise) but the crew are actually trying to act so it just seems dumb. DiCamillo was annoying as usual. The "plot" was boring and average. There are a few truly funny moments but not enough to warrent buying this DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy a CKY DVD.	negative
title: Looks great - if only it worked! [SEP] content: This is a great looking player with seemingly solid construction however after approximately 45 minutes of use, the screen went blank. Thereafter, it would shut down after 20 seconds of play. I returned the item for replacement, hoping that I had just received a dud. The replacement player worked during its initial use however thereafter same problem as before. Moveover, the sound was never great - especially for use in the car. At full volume, it could hardly be heard above the road noise. I would not recommend this player but, as always, Amazon was super to work with and their customer service cannot be beat.	negative
title: College text [SEP] content: I had purchased this book expecting it to be in "very good" condition as noted by the seller. Unfortunately, it is in fair condition, at best. I was very disappointed. The extensive highlighting and underlining make it difficult to use.	negative
title: if you're not a right winger, this book is awful [SEP] content: i feel like i've been trying to read this book for years, but it's only been a day and it says i'm only 12% done, egads, i can't go on. the racial slur when the main character slams arabs, then realizing the girl he's with is an arab changes it to muslims....and she concurs! please....i'm stopping this now before i have to go out and buy an uzi	negative
title: unfortunate [SEP] content: i'm sorry to say this because Kevin Smith is one of my favorites and i'm a true fan so i gave this movie a shot too bad it was pretty terrible. I'm sorry but please miss this movie wait for Clerks 2: The passion of the clerks coming summer 2005	negative
title: Not very good [SEP] content: Although the author has obviously spent a good amount of time doing his research, the time might have been better spent developing a coherent plot or creating charaters of any substance. With all of the excellent books available, you might want to give this one a pass.	negative
title: lasted 6 weeks [SEP] content: lasted 6 weeks then inexplicably went out. not sure if i got a dud or if others have experienced this.	negative
title: What are you guys smoking.... [SEP] content: This game was the worst. I got quite far, but it was boring the whole time. The fist couple of missions are fun. Once they get too challanging you realize that your doing the same exact stuff as you were doing on teh first mission, just a lot faster. The cops have to intelligence at all, they just go directly at your car. The game is a MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY. I reccomend using your money wisely on something like Onimusha, that's a great game with better graphics, gameplay, plot, and variety. Don't waste your money or time. I am aware that this review is on the contrary to most of the others, but I feel that you should take my advice. After two complete hours of gameplay I was bored out of my mind	negative
title: Not a fan. [SEP] content: This particular product takes up way too much free space on my computer. Actually slowed it down a bit. I have 320 GB with 4 GB memory. Kaspersky seems to work better and I didn't have any problem with that at all. Would not personally recommend Norton.	negative
title: not the real Fantasia [SEP] content: Unfortunately, this is another example of the Idol folks trying to mimic trends vs. really letting an artist shine. Fantasia is a great vocalist and the overdubbing and layering on this CD hides her uniqueness--makes it a Beyonce ripoff attempt. Too bad--looks like we'll have to wait a release or two before we get the real Fantasia.	negative
title: I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review [SEP] content: Well.... I paid the 9.99 to read I Hate My Neck on my Kindle. This book was our book clubs next read. I've read about 40 pages and so far I haven't gotten into it. I don't feel like it is going to go anywhere. I'm not a person who would ever think about getting cosmetic surgery. I am what God meant for me to be and yes the sags are coming. I am almost 60. My secret is do what I can do (hair, make-up) for going out. After that, don't look in the mirror. LOL	negative
title: rock key hider [SEP] content: This rock key hider does one little good unless you happen tobe carrying around a screwdriver; that's right, the key is obtainable only by unsrewing the plastic on the bottom side of the rock. Oh, and did I mention that the rock looks as phony as a three dollar bill?Why didn't they simply make the slot-a slide version-a complete waste of money.	negative
title: Baptist bashing approach to St. John [SEP] content: If you would like an exercise in Baptist theology purchase this commentary. If however, you would like to know something about the Gospel of John, I recommend you try another commentary. Carson is almost maniacal about defending Baptist belief and therefore rejects the sacramental teaching of the fourth Gospel. He writes in a chatty style, using the lingo of a pseudo intellectual guru. This is possibly the worst commentary on St. John that Eerdmans have ever published.	negative
title: Not very good... [SEP] content: I really wanted to give this book a 2 and 1/2 stars. A quater of this book was really good. The rest was dull, confusing and not well written.	negative
title: Defective [SEP] content: They must be selling all their defective units now. The first one I got stopped working after a month. The one I got a week ago one of the fans didn't work when it came out the box, it also has a short in the cable. Beware of defective units.	negative
title: Dated Material, Some over 40 Years Old [SEP] content: If you are looking for a topical discussion of technical and business writing, I think you can do better.That said, the book is a quick, informal, benign read. Though it purports to be updated, some of the essays go back to the early 60s.Some of the techniques discussed don't quite agree with the methods discussed in Mike Markel's "Technical Communication" or Carolyn Rude's "Technical Editing."If your instructor requires it for a course, buy it used. You'll likely sell it to someone else when you're done, as I will. It makes no sense to lose that much value on the resale.	negative
title: Doesn't keep things hot [SEP] content: I may have just have gotten a bad one, but the one I recently purchased does not keep things hot. I have poured freshly made steaming hot coffee into the Thermocafe multiple times and within an hour it is barely warm. Since the job of the thermos is to keep things hot, I am considering this to be a complete product failure.	negative
title: They dont know what else to do...... [SEP] content: This has to be another effort to be alive on the music industry. The live performance is the same one that come with the DVD from Greatest Hits Part 1. They add "new tracks" as Proud which is on the soundtrack of the movie I know what you did last summer. Earache my eye its the last song from Follow the leader but live. One is from the tribute to Metallica. If all that is "rare" they are really desperate for money.Dont buy this CD buy the new tool Cd which is way better.	negative
title: Broke within 1 month, useless [SEP] content: Don't waste your money! We thought these beds would be perfect for our two dogs, and we ordered extra large to accomodate their respective weights (both under 100 pounds). We bought a total of four beds and three of them broke within one month. Like other reviewers, we saw that the bolts sheared off and as a result, the beds are not able to be repaired. We have asked for a refund; I am optimistic...	negative
title: Failed Attempted Frenzy [SEP] content: This game is not up to the standard of the other x-box titles. The graphics are bland, the landscapes are dull & boring. There are many other games being launched at the same time as this one. I would wait for something a bit more "Next Generation".	negative
title: London Blue Topaz Earrings [SEP] content: I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, it looks as if you could have bought this at a discount store	negative
title: Three weeks, and no results [SEP] content: I been using this cream for three weeks now, and not seen any results. Your better off making it your self. All you need is Baling Soda and Castor Oil to make a paste. Thats all.	negative
title: Well it hasn't caught on fire yet. [SEP] content: It doesn't work at all. The drive is recognized by the USB driver but the RAID utility can not find it or initialize. I have 20 years experience with PC, build my own, have done software and hardware raid under Windows and Linux. This thing should just work. Technical support has hung up on me after being on hold for 15 minutes twice. So I'm guessing they just have so many problems that they are dumping their call queues to avoid busy signals.Your going to be wasting a lot of time with something that really should be a non event.Stay away from this product.	negative
title: Sorry, not much here for me [SEP] content: I bought it for some insight on troubleshooting my PS2, disk read problems. Not much there, unfortunately. That in it's own self wouldn't be a killer, but the fact that the book is 2/3 "guide to games" cinches the deal. It's from 2001, so there are no games since then included in the guide. If you just bought a PS2 (like I did) and you find this for a buck at a flea market, it might be worth it.	negative
title: Not Impressed [SEP] content: I have never really been fond of Ethics and Moral code to begin with because most of the articles fail to realize the whole point of what they are writing about. This book really wasn't any different. The articles about Abortion are weak and they don't fully explain what their whole point of what they are writing about is. It doesn't help matters when every article in this book is so drawn out. Everything that is said in this book could be done so in about 2 or 3 pages instead it is drawn out to about 10 to 15 pages. The authors are basically repeating themselves over and over throughout the entire article.I personally don't think this would be a great buy but maybe thats because I find all the arguments in moral and ethic philosophies are very weak and not at all to the point.	negative
title: Icorrect Information [SEP] content: None of the songs listed in the below discription are on this CD. Save your money. If you are looking for Polly Browns hits, this is NOT the CD you want.	negative
title: Stick to Celtic Work RJ [SEP] content: Alright book. There are better books on Qaballah out there. I was quite suprised to see this author undertake this book, and disappointed. It seems these days that no one is content to develop a purely celtic magical tradition. Are the european peoples ashamed of their rich spiritual past and potential ? Come on people, there is so much to be discovered out there from our own genetic history without having to goto the middle east, Amer-Indians, Asia, the west Indies or Africa. People should be able to get what they want out of the tradtions they have a birth right to, leaving other peoples birthright traditions for them.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: My husband has been wearing Munsingwear for many, many years. He has noted that each time we purchase them the quality and consistency of fit deteriorates. This last purchase was the final proverbial straw. The leg openings, fly opening and placement, and waist band varied greatly with each pair, so much so that there were some he just couldn't wear at all; they were so uncomfortable. We will not be purchasing Mun singwear again. Ever.	negative
title: Baby Einstein Series [SEP] content: Frankly, for the $$ I was unimpressed. I had heard great things about this series and was sorely disappointed. Each of the presentations seem very "low budget." The filming content did not keep the attention of either my child or my nieces or nephews, ages 6 months to 4 yrs. Next time, I will tape animal/art programs from either Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and play my classical CD's in the back ground. Save your self the $$.	negative
title: Good writing, poor story [SEP] content: Not sure what's with all the rave reviews. I picked up this book thinking it would be a mystery set in mountain country, and to some extent it is. Box has a good writing style, but I did't care for the story. Children being threatened and stalked (or neglected and beaten), harmless animals exterminated, to name a few points I didn't care for. It certainly seems as if Box knows his outdoors; i'd just like to read a story that's a little more straightforward mystery and less rambling mess.	negative
title: Discontinued Product [SEP] content: Just spoke with Macco Akzo customer service - 800-634-0015 (Manufacturer of Liquid Nails products). This specific product line (DR-807) was discontinued in 2008. Any tubes currently on the market are at least 4 years old...	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: Do Not Buy [SEP] content: Sorry to post my very first bad review, but please do not buy this item. I have had a garden for years so I know how to grow one. Only one herb grew after planting them all. Please think about it before buying this brand.	negative
title: Don't buy this toaster [SEP] content: Update - after about a month, the toaster stopped popping up. After reviewing the warranty, I have send back the toaster at my cost (will only communicate via letter correspondence), and also include money for them to send it back - FOR A $20 TOASTER. DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER	negative
title: Not what it claims to be [SEP] content: When a publisher presents a book as being a work of history knowing that its author's research is suspect to say the least, I believe the consumer has every right to be upset about that.The problem with this book is not the occasional error or fact or misprint but that the author made claims to his qualifications and research that when checked turned out to be very questionable to say the least.It seems he was never a Lord as he claimed, nor ever a Baronet as he claimed, nor a PhD as he claimed. One asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.It is however a very good read. That is why I give it one star. It is entertaining. I only hope somebody writes a biography of its author one day (how's this for a title - "The Man of Many Names") as I am sure that will be even more entertaining.	negative
title: Not very accurate [SEP] content: The mechanism inside the step counter is "loose" so any movement adds steps. Also, the counter is on the side, as opposed to the top, and is difficult to read when you're wearing it. For the money - it's not worth a second look.	negative
title: Crap [SEP] content: This is junk, do yourself a favor and buy the one that costs $18 because it is much higher quality. I've gone through 2 of these things, the first one when I tried to insert the battery the connections where the batteries give the device power came out and were deformed in such a way I couldn't put them back in the battery compartment, so I sent it back and ordered another one. The 2nd one seemed to work for like 1 fly, after that it was simply a plastic fly swatter, even when I pressed the button, heard the little sound it makes and tried to kill a fly, it wouldn't kill the fly, nothing would happen. Multipe times I was able to trap the fly underneath the device and despite pushing the button the fly actually flew THROUGH the wholes not getting zapped once. I am done returning this, not once did I receive one that didn't properly work but twice.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Outdated and inaccurate [SEP] content: I don't know where to start. This book recommends activities that I consider to be catastrophically bad for hedgehogs, like keeping them on cedar shavings, which can cause respiratory failure. I just can't recommend.	negative
title: Repetition [SEP] content: This books seems to be a collection of smaller works all mashed together. Many sections are simply bullet point after bullet point. The name is misguided. A better title would be Sustainability ventures of business, government, and policy makers.	negative
title: Do not buy this if you have rhythm or know how to count. [SEP] content: This is perhaps the worst workout video I have ever seen - and I wish I could get my money back. These ladies can't count. There are no transitions, no call outs, no instruction. It's as if they showed up one day and just turned on the camera. If you have ever done any kind of aerobics, have rhythm or know how to dance, you will be extremely frustrated within the first two minutes. The moves don't match the music and they fluctuate between 1 and 3, with 2 and 4. Do NOT buy this.	negative
title: CRAP that sometimes works. [SEP] content: The interface is simple enough but it is just not well built. it freezes all the time. Talk to sirius support much more then I ever should... they can't fix it over 2 months to replace unit and STILL WAITING.DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. THERE SHOULD BE A GENERAL RECALL ON THESE. PEOPLE WHO PRAISE THIS HAVE NOT RUN INTO PROBLEMS YET!	negative
title: Not For Adults [SEP] content: This is a good book if you are 13 and under. There is not enough information in it for an adult. If a child wants to learn about five things about church, then this is the book for them.	negative
title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: You have a super computer ? buy, not don't buy!. [SEP] content: We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please..............	negative
title: Sort of readable but forgettable [SEP] content: This novel is trying to be an exploration of passion but comes off as bloodless and wooden. Fifteen-year-old fallen woman Olympia Biddeford, the main character, never comes to life, and the author's attempts to convince us her relationship with a man three times her age is a deep spiritual love is ludicrous. The book is by the numbers, and the attempt at 19th-century speak is irritating. Did not people ever use contractions in their speech back then? I cannot believe they did not, but I shall not argue with the author further.	negative
title: Same Formula, No Shift Here [SEP] content: Polar Shift is an incredibly formulaic book, with quite a few borrowed plot points from other generic adventure-action books. Entertaining at times, but very generic, and sloppily written, as if the authors had to crank out yet another novel before the deadline. Very little labor of love exhibited in the writing, I felt like the authors were just punching a time clock to collect their pay.	negative
title: How can you dial the phone with this thing on? [SEP] content: It covers all the buttons on the keypad, protecting them from dust, moisture and from being read and used. A pain to put on and remove. Useless design. Mic hole way to small to be heard properly. I had to cut the keypad section off and use the perimeter for phone cushioning. A full leather case is a better investment.	negative
title: Poison for your dishes? BEWARE! [SEP] content: I bought 2 of these tubs for kitchen tasks. I looked VERY carefully at the product description to see if they contained "microban", because I do not want poisons on/near my food/plates/kitchen utensils.The description doesn't say that these are treated, but THEY ARE!Does anyone out there know where to get tubs like this that are not laced with unnessary chemicals?	negative
title: Not the Same as the Old Splintertweeze [SEP] content: I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers. They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be.	negative
title: Not what I saw in the Quantum Pad Sampler Book [SEP] content: I got this book thinking it would fart just like in the sampler book that comes pakaged with the Quantum Pad. But, it dosn't do anything the sampler book does. All it does is get answers wrong!	negative
title: Bad product / bad support [SEP] content: Ours broke after a day. Customer support was difficult but after many frustrating calls we had replacement parts sent. There were no instructions but we eventually got it back together. It broke again a couple days later.	negative
title: Problem with the order. [SEP] content: I ordered this product as a gift. It was stated that it was the ice cream maker with a "bonus ice cream freezer bowl". When it arrived - no bonus bowl was included. I sent an email which was not answered by the time I called Unbeatable Sale, Inc. After checking they said that they had made an error when they offered the bonus bowl. Instead of making it right and sending the bowl, they said I could send it back which of course I knew. It was a take it or leave it situation. As this was a gift for Christmas, I decided to keep it but I am not happy with this company. I don't know whether it makes good ice cream or not since I gave it away.	negative
title: Chateau Benares [SEP] content: Disappointing use of synthetic instruments and over dubs when Mishra's skill as a guitarist would have been perfect.	negative
title: Good book, terrible kindle edition [SEP] content: First, the content of the book wasn't very coherent. Didn't seem to be organized in any particular way, but the stories were interesting at least. I did find it a bit weird that he used fake names for all his former bosses. Don't you think that they'll recognize themselves in the book?The bad part is that Kindle edition has a typo in literally every other sentence. Clearly the result of a poorly OCR'd book without proper proof-reading. Nearly every foreign word was garbled. This made reading a book about cooking (lots of French terms) really annoying. The publisher should be ashamed to put out such a shoddy product.	negative
title: Unbelievable [SEP] content: This is a most unbelievably badly written book. It must have been dictated and never proofread. I am amazed that it could find a publisher.	negative
title: Purely for beginners [SEP] content: After skimming through the book I found that it was hardly sophisticated as it was originally described. In fact what I read and saw was highly remedial and just plain common sense content. The book did not go beyond the very very basics of painting. I really don't know who I could recommend this book to. If you are seriously considering being a painting contractor this book would hardly prepare you.	negative
title: think of it as a very large mug as opposed to a bottle [SEP] content: The top part is the same as the smaller coffee mug oxo makes. This makes it great to drink from, but horrible to pour out of. As others have said the insulation isn't the best either. To me it wasn't a waste of money since I'm just going to use it as a giant mug and I don't need it to stay warm until the evening. Last time I used it, I filled with 200 degree F coffee and at 6:00 am, I didn't use it until 2 pm and when I poured it out it was room temp maybe slightly warm.So used as a large mug, used immediately (or within a few hours) after filling, it's not bad.EDIT (end of Dec 2009):I just threw it out. It doesn't hold heat anymore (about 1 month of use) and there is nothing redeeming abou it anymore.	negative
title: LUCY GETS A ROOMMATE/LUCY AND CAROL IN PALM SPRING [SEP] content: I am a very big Lucy fan. The only reason I rated this episode as one star is the bad quality of the tape, in particular I am talking about the audio. Whenever you guys see Lucy special boxed sets that seem to good to be true as far as the prices are concerned, DO NOT buy them. I have had problems in the past with these videos. We are better off ordering from Columbia House if they have these available. At least the sound will be superior. We all love Lucy, but we all love our money too. So be careful of these inexpensive tapes that cost 5 dollars or more!	negative
title: Watch Problems [SEP] content: The watch I purchased came to me not working and was sent back. A second watch was sent and also did not work. I sent the watch back and now have made several calls about the refund. The calls are either left on hold or just cut off after holding for a long period of time. I still don't have a refund.	negative
title: Catalina doesn't ruin girls; it makes ruined girls smarter [SEP] content: While Catalina can be at times a stressful environment, King's experience here can only be attributed to her own insecurities. Catalina is an incredibly strong academic school and the faculty here do everything in their power to help students do well. King obviously didn't have the natural ability or drive to succeed that is needed to flourish here, as shown by the fact that the writing in this book would not have recieved a passing grade in my freshman english class.	negative
title: Be wary of these discs [SEP] content: While I'll admit that the price is right: $100 for 100 discs and that the printable surface is superb using an Epson R300 direct to cd/dvd printer... I've had many failures burning a full DVD with this particular brand. My other burns that only make use of 25 to 50% of the disc were great, no problems. It's just when I burn a DVD that has about 4.36 gigs on it that problems arise, with skipping, stuttering and sometimes complete failure to recognize the dvd from both my computer dvd drive and my set-top dvd player. In short, I can only recommend this brand if you plan on not using the outer tracks of the disc because I surmise the dye on the outer portions of the disc media is not consistent and will lead to burn and/or read failures.I recommend TDK brands at this time over Memorex brands.	negative
title: Unimpressed [SEP] content: Not a good live performance. The band is not in sync. Godz original debut album is the one to buy.	negative
title: disapointed [SEP] content: I wanted the sound track from the movie the way the music was on the movie.not somthing eles that was not in the movie.	negative
title: Fleece Sheet [SEP] content: The product is good value at the sale price of 29.00. If it were priced at the retail price implied---$60.00---it would not be since the Company Store equivalent is much better quality. But for 29.00 for a kingsize set, its pretty good.	negative
title: Does'n work in car ! [SEP] content: It works in car (charging), but stops navigation. Vehicle Power Cable, when I plugged it in my Garmin NUVI 660 turned off the navigation mode, and put my device on charge mode. So how can I use my Garmin navigation system in the car ???	negative
title: Picture and Accuracy are deceptive [SEP] content: The picture shows the watch and another item....that other item needs to be strapped to your rib cage which is uncomfortable to wear. I would be able to go through the discomfort, but the product was not reliable either. As a consumer, I would like to know the accuracy. If it says my heart is beating 50 beats a minute, as an engineer, I know that it may not be the case. I want to know the range that my heart may ACTUALLY be beating at.	negative
title: Forget [SEP] content: Well, this aint Jefferson Airplane and definetely not Jefferson Starship. This is just Mickey Thomas trying to do his best and without good songs and the magic circle of Freiberg/Slick/Kantner/Sears he was falling down like Roman Empire. Being Finland's biggest JA/JS fan I bought this album the day it was released down here and played three times. Since that I have kept it far away from my other albums	negative
title: Super fast!! [SEP] content: This was the last book of a trilogy that I absolutely LOVED!! The delivery was fast and the quality was excellent. I will do it again. Thank You!	negative
title: This book is an outrage for any fan of Evita [SEP] content: This book is written for those people who want to read trash about Eva Peron. I stopped counting how many times he called her a 'little whore' and all the references to her 'whore's mouth'. It is disgusting.	negative
title: battery died after two years [SEP] content: I purchased two of these products, and they worked well at the outset. During various power outages and surges, they kept everything smooth and functioning. My complaint is that, after having it for less than two years, the battery backup died. It still works as a surge protector, but that's not why you buy a product like this. I don't know what the expected life on this product is, but two years seems too short for the cost.	negative
title: Trash [SEP] content: maybe i didnt know how to work this thing, or i got a faulty machine but i had to return it because i didnt like it. the pads were not responsive, unless i hit it extra hard buy reason 4.0 instead	negative
title: Musical Kleenex [SEP] content: Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, "Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew." I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's "The Orange Album" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone.	negative
title: You get what you pay for [SEP] content: As another review mentions... no MACROS!The LCD buttons don't really work.I do love the learning feature, I was able to program it to handle my iPod remote control! Battery life is good, might not be be for everyone.	negative
title: Horrible Construction [SEP] content: Do not waste your time or money. I should have taken the other 1 star comments more seriously. This product is a piece of junk. The 'leaves' fell off when rinsing prior to first use. Tried using one time and many leaves fell off. Trying to re-attach just causes others to fall off. I have no desire to bend the tabs further to fix a poorly constructed product. I'm sending this back.	negative
title: Scream 4 [SEP] content: Scream 4, directed by Wes Craven, stars the original cast mates Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is a horror movie, or shall I say a "good" horror movie. Surprisingly, "king of scary" director Wes Craven, does a mediocre job revamping the final sequel. It plays on the original Scream, and pretty has the same story line, just a tad bit more gruesome. The movie starts of with a series of movies with a movie. Scream 4, plays on the whole android/ iPhone bit, using an "app" to prank call people using the scream voice. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns back to Woodsbro to finish promoting her book. Coincidently it's the 10th anniversary of Woodsbro slaughter. The killer is threatening to kill everyone close to her, especially her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). I wonder who the killer is now....?	negative
title: Not a fan [SEP] content: MY previous review was deleted because some people marked it as spam when I was only giving my opinion. Just for the record...I've seen the first 3 Twilight movies & read the books...SO I KNOW WHAT I'm TALKING ABOUT. I'm just not a fan of this one sorry. Too much hype over a movie. I understand it's a fantasy, romance film, but I'm not convinced sorry. It's my opinion and I don't believe it deserves 5 stars.	negative
title: Missing text/sentences make this annoying to read [SEP] content: I was amazed when I first discovered the missing text/sentences in this edition, but I am halfway through this book and have many many times come across places where it looks like this: ......" said Vronsky. And the missing text is just not in there to read!This is a five star book but I give a 1 star rating on account of missing text which is unforgivable IMO.I don't understand how this has happened???	negative
title: The Sex Pistols [SEP] content: Sex PistolsThe recording is rough but ok if your a Sex Pistols fan. The packaging is far greater than the quality of the CD inside. Recommended for the experienced ear of a true Sex Pistols fan.	negative
title: so, to get the original theatrical releases on Blu Ray... [SEP] content: You have to buy EVERY superman movie? Including 3, 4, and Returns, which are terrible?That's really sad. The Theatrical Cut of Superman is an iconic classic, but the extra stuff that Donner added (the cheesy Lois Lane jokes, the lame "action" sequence at Luthor's lair) really detract from the original.Sometimes cuts are good cuts.Now, you CAN'T get the original theatrical cut of Superman, unless you have an old Laser Disc player. The original cut was BETTER. Better flow, less stiff bad jokes, and act three really cooked.I will NOT buy all of these terrible superman films, just to get that original Superman cut. I'll wait.	negative
title: Not impressed at all. [SEP] content: I was first introduced to Rachael Davis at the Smoky Hill River Festival in Salina, Kansas (where I'm from) back in 2005. Everyone kept raving about, "oh, she's got a great voice and an extraordinary talent, and she's a great guitarist, blah, blah, blah". Well, I bought the album taking everyone else's advice. I have met Rachael in person, and she is a very nice person and has a very sweet and sassy personality.Sorry to say, but I listened to the album for a good 5 to 10 minutes and it almost gave me a headache. It's nothing but just loud singing, screaming, straining, and shouting at the top of her lungs. And it is very boring to listen to. Nearly put me to sleep. Almost every song on here sounds pretty much the same.I was expecting better.	negative
title: Nazi Minister of Propaganda and Theologian [SEP] content: Just a note on Kittel."Kittel wrote a 10 volume Biblical Greek Lexicon Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the NT. The first 7 volumes were written while Kittel was Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, while the last three volumes of his Biblical Greek Lexicon were done while he was in jail for his War Crimes."[...]	negative
title: What a disappointment! [SEP] content: I've liked or loved all of the Pulitzer winners I've read. I bought this book because it won the prize and expected to at the very least -- like it. Sadly, I didn't like it and had to force myself to finish it. I hung on only because I knew it had to get better. And, it finally it in the last 20%. But, not enough to redeem the first 80%.	negative
title: What a brilliant marketing ploy and apparently still working today! [SEP] content: I recently read a comment on a Beatles Youtube video about how the man in the video wasn't really Paul. I thought that was settled back in 1969! I had no idea people still believe this crap in 2012. Maybe the rumor was started because of the Beatles perceived threat from the Rolling Stones (I never read anything about it, I'm just here to add a comment). It's totally brilliant though and keeps people buying their music even today, although they could sell it without this stupid rumor because their music is great. I would say the Beatles are my favorite band with the Stones a close second.	negative
title: Still Waiting... [SEP] content: I ordered this in the middle of March. If it takes much longer, it will miss the whole Spring season... Sure would be nice to have what I paid for. What in the world takes so long to mail a magazine?	negative
title: Dose not work.Waste of money [SEP] content: I got the first mall tycoon for my birthday last year and it didn't work I took it back 2 times and got new ones and none of them worked. When mall tycoon came out I got it again for my birthday, I'm a huge fan of these kind of games have them all. But just like the first one the first 4 times I loaded it and it didn't work and when it did it didn't work good. Its a waste of money and a big disappointment, I was very excited by the concept of building the mall but all that happed was that i was disappointed.	negative
title: Bratz runway Playset [SEP] content: This toy is a great toy for a young girl. There are four dolls that you can play with it.	negative
title: Will have adverse effects on your Xbox! [SEP] content: Seemed to work fine at first, just made the whole thing louder. A couple months later though, I started receiving an error relatively frequently on startup. It wasn't the Red Ring of Death, but an error nonetheless, along with a wierd moaning whirring coming from the Xbox. I thought the Xbox was going bad. I started looking for another one of these for my new Elite, and came across all the other reviews about this bad product. I took it off my old Xbox, and it worked great again. Luckily as far as I can tell it didn't do any noticeable long lasting damage. Hopefully it will still last awhile when I give it to my brother. It's definitely not worth the risk!	negative
title: already send? maybe no ! [SEP] content: I orderd them November 15, 2012 from Japan.But don't still receive them.Too lateI don't know when I receive.	negative
title: Getting old [SEP] content: I was disappointed in Child's "Without Fear". I want to see Reacher's character develop, get ripe with age, grow. He needs a major upset or something, not more of the expected same old, same old character. Might be the last Child book I will read.	negative
title: why so pricy? [SEP] content: I prefer to read on my Kindle but I can't see the justification for a higher price for the digital edition for this 6 year old book than for hardback or softcover. It's ridiculous and I won't support the publisher in ripping off Kindle users this way.	negative
title: Better disbanded [SEP] content: There's Imitation of Life and then the entire rest of the CD for which the strongest coffee is no cure. How they stayed awake to make it is a mystery. Listless. Like many groups, after a while their songs sound like bad parodies of their old songs. Probably because they're bored or their lives have gone far away from whatever their original source of inspiration was and so now they make songs the way a cow chews its cud. Oddly enough, the songs remind me more of a bad parody of old Genesis than Rem. If you like this alblum then you'll love old Genesis. Unfortunately, it isn't true the other way around.	negative
title: BAD BAD BAD!!!! [SEP] content: This CD IS TERRIBLE!!!! IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THE COMMERCIAL FOR "KIDS BOP" ITS ALMOST THE SAME THING!!! NONE OF THE ORIGANAL ARTISTS!!! ALL DONE BY "THE HIT CREW" !!! THE TITLE OF THE PAGE SAYS "VARIOUS ARTISTS" WHICH MEANS MANY DIFFERENT ARTISTS AND IT WAS ALL ONE STUPID BAND CALLED "THE HIT CREW"!!! DONT BUY IT!!! IT IS TERRIBLE!!!	negative
title: Not worth the effort. [SEP] content: There are a lot of worthwhile ideas and images in this book, as in Williams' other novels, but the writing style is so often tortuous and obscure that for most people I think it's simply not worth the effort to read.	negative
title: Not impressed [SEP] content: This book is all about evolutionism. I am a Christian and didn't appreciate all of the references to evolution, Darwin, and more. There was nothing in any description stating that was the direction this book would take you.	negative
title: Cool to have, but useless [SEP] content: I thought this book would be really helpful to have, but I have never used it. The drinks are very involved and require multiple alcohols per drink. I don't keep much alcohol on hand, so it wasn't really realistic for me to make these types of drinks.	negative
title: The phone is defective and being returned. [SEP] content: I wanted and got a light weight phone with a low profile, adjustable volume, mellow ringer, mute button, and speed dialing.I settled for a unit lacking an included headset and lacking caller id. However, I need a phone that works and this one doesn't. A defective phone is probably a fluke but when this one came in, I trashed my dropped-once-too-often phone and I just can't take the chance.	negative
title: Awful sound [SEP] content: I have thousands of SACD, DVD Audio and Dualdiscs. I mean, I know perfectly when a remaster worth it. This one DEFINITELTY is not a good example of sound upgrade. Horrible mix. Horrible sound.The others REM's editions (DVD + CD) are a very good example, but not this Dualdisc.	negative
title: Great series but surprises ruined [SEP] content: The order in which everyone gets voted out is on each disc you pull out. How dumb is that?Otherwise it's a fun season which is why I bought it. I will probably never find the time to watch the commentaries.	negative
title: Random collection of thoughts [SEP] content: As a former Marine who was schooled in Marine Corps values in Parris Island I felt this book was more a representation of Mr. Millers personal beliefs that over the years he has blended with those he learned in boot camp. The book did not flow very well and was just an OK read.	negative
title: CONFUSING [SEP] content: I thought that this book would teach me the basics of MySQL in a relatively short time. While I did learn some things, I spent most of my time figuring out how the author got from one step to the next. There were numerous typos in the code that left me, as a beginner, scratching my head. Most SAMS books are great, but not this one.	negative
title: Just showing his lack of military knowledge [SEP] content: The novel should be used as a textbook in elementray school. It is not only plotless, some of its assumptions are just, well Assumptions. I wonder why PLA would engage US in a situation like that. Why PLA wouldn't go all out when Taiwan declared its independence? Another good try on predicting future conflicts between major powers (Which US always wins, off course). But the lack of knowledge and understanding of Asian culture make this novel suited only for the not-informed Americans. But again why would they care when they think they are always right.	negative
title: DONT USE WITH HAMILTON BEACH WONT WORK!!! [SEP] content: These do not work AT ALLin the hamilton beach coffee maker. I trusted other reviews. All I got was hot water and a little color of coffee.Tried wetting first, turning it upside down, different coffee, everything!!! and only half the water comes out before machine turns offI have to send back now. Do not believe the "IF YOU BUY THIS< WITH THIS< AND THIS" you get all for one price.. These pods only could possibly work under pressure, which the hamilton beach maker is not!	negative
title: Baby Talk [SEP] content: I must say, I was disappointed by King's latest work. One of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. For example, in "IT", he brought all of the intricate members of the Losers' Club to life.I found Lisey as a character surprisingly flat; Lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. I also found the 'secret language' between Scott and Lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. It actually made me a bit embarrassed. A lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (I know, I know, it IS Stephen King, but I mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).I'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me. I'm going to go re-read "IT" now. ;)	negative
title: Boring songs with one great singer! [SEP] content: Linda disappointed me. Most of the songs on this cd are forgettable. She has the best voice in the business, but has been releasing mediocre songs with lousy record producers. Linda has said that she is retired, but before she does, she should give us a powerful album with multiple producers: Nile Rodgers, Jerry Wexler, Barry Beckett, Richard Perry, Brian Ahearn, Tom Catalano, Ron Nevison, and Peter Asher. What an album that would be! Linda, please don't let this be your last pop record. There are still good songs out there!	negative
title: Pessimism Abounds Here!!! [SEP] content: If you want a sarcastic, (read: mean spirited) look behind the scenes of a jaded military wife that seems to dislike the military, then look no further, for you have found the motherlode.The pessimistic tone of this book is very demoralizing, and I can only hope it isn't being sold in your PX, for surely it would send even the toughest of military wives running for the nearest divorce lawyer.Hilary Martin does the impossible with this book, with her sad attempts at humor dragging the tone of the book even further down into the depths of cranky regret.I am ashamed of this book, and only hope that the outlooks of other mil. wives are more upbeat.Don't buy it. I promise you will regret it.Refunds should be offered on this to every unsuspecting customer that had the utter misfortune to actually pay for it.(note: I only gave it one star because the Amazon system demands a rating and doesn't have a "negative star rating")	negative
title: Frustrating and troublesome [SEP] content: Just to try and help others avoid the problems I've had. This programme has eaten hours and hours of my time. Not only with crashes but also sound problems and rendering freezes and all sorts. I've wasted hours with tech support and despite my best efforts and following all their long and arduous suggestions none of the 3 major problems have been solved. I simply cannot produce an edited movie with it. I'm just about to give up after 5 long hard months of persistence and buy a different package. My system is 3.4 GHz and 250 GB with 1024 RAM.	negative
title: HEAVY DUTY ALUMINUM? [SEP] content: I just got hold of this so called heavy duty aluminum burger press. It looks good but "HEAVY DUTY ALUMINUM" it's not even close. It's more like light weight pot metal. It feels like aluminum foil at best and might crumble if I hold it too tightly. The threads on the adjustable part of this thing are very rough. I haven't used it as yet but will give it a shot this evening. I give it 1 star because at least it looks like the picture and 1 star because I haven't used it yet. I'll be back!	negative
title: The wrong way to carry on [SEP] content: Chris cornell is now a happy man, but his fans are far from feeling the same. his first solo album was a great rock album. the songs were touching, and the production was original and interesting. but 'carry on' is a combination of b songs and cheezy production. the only good song in the album is #3, but still far from each and every song in his debut solo.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! stay in the past and remember chris as he was and not as he is!!!	negative
title: Communist Blockheads. [SEP] content: Mr. Brzezinski feels that America must be replaced as a global village. How I and 250 million other people disagree must be beyond his puny immagination. A one-world governemnt is easier to conquer and force socialism by making the Global Community "hell on earth" where only a few thousands engineers run a billion slaves. Zbiginiew, The Trilateral Commission founder and member and long time anti-american elitest and CFR member I have one question. How did a clown like you ever land a job as Professor of John Hopkins University?	negative
title: A realistic life of Lucas would have been more interesting. [SEP] content: Great acting, OK directing and terrible writing. Washington, Ejiofor and Crowe and great as usual, Scott seems to be bored and the writing might just be mediocre if it wasn't claimed to be "based on a true story." Among the bizarre claims is that Frank Lucas' collaboration "lead to the conviction of three-quarters of the NY DEA." Reality: zero convictions. He only testified against fellow dealers. Also his relationship with Bumpy Johnson has been falsified. Johnson's widow calls Lucas a liar and the movie false. These are just two of about a half dozen major distortions. Gangster movies are apparently going back to Godfather style fantasy rather than to realism.	negative
title: What is this? [SEP] content: What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying "we're trying new ways", "this is our best album so far", "we do what gives us pleasure". One only needs to compare it with "Moving Picture", "Permanent Waves" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!	negative
title: Bad Movie [SEP] content: I can't believe that Bruce Willis would play in this very bad movie and he looks like he just got out of Bed and looks drunk all the time No class at all and the story line is not their and the movie jumps around way to much and so Bruce Willis should go hide in shame to have made this awful movie But I did love the Girls the only thing good about the movie. Don't pay to watch it ok rent some other movie like The Planet of the Apes" Very good Movie.	negative
title: Worst Zelda Ever [SEP] content: This game is the worst. It is horrible sailing from place to place for the first half of the game. It is way too comic bookey. It doesn't hold a candle to oncrina of time.	negative
title: my review [SEP] content: I didn't care for this movie, it wasn't the kind of movie I expected it to B I Thought it was a movie. About women being in love w eachother	negative
title: Not worth the wait [SEP] content: I can't believe it took 7 years for this. All I Need is the best song on the CD but its all downhill after that. Not sure who this album is supposed to appeal to, and by the looks of its success and availability, I guess not to many. Most of you seem to like it so I am obviously the minority here. I am still a huge fan of songs he did with the Doobies (i.e. Nothing But a Heartache, Dedicate this Heart, Your Made that Way, Losin End, etc.) and I liked If That's What it Takes, but most songs on Blue Obssession are nothing more than Easy Listening music that's not so easy to listen to. The upbeat songs sound forced. On Build Upon It, which is a Takin' It to The Streets rip off, before the song even opens and sets a tone, its already in the chorus. If this was Michael's first album, I would never buy his second.	negative
title: AWFUL!! [SEP] content: I bought these coffee mugs because everyone at work who has one raves about them. I wish I had passed. They only keep my coffee warm for one hour but worse than that, the red one got water between the layers and now it will mold and be ruined!! I feel I wasted my money on them and I really regret buying them. I am now going to have to buy another travel mug to replace these and I have only had them for a little over a week.	negative
title: Words cannot express how horrible this movie is..... [SEP] content: This "film" is a MST3000 episode waiting to happen. Terrible plot, beyond pathetic script, inept camera work, and the only aspect horrific about it was the acting. I cannot begin to state how vital it is to avoid this movie. It is a complete waste of time to watch and there are so many more films to watch in its place that can solve your craving for 80's slasher movies. Literally. Any other film would suffice. One star is generous for this piece of trash.	negative
title: Can't give it zero stars [SEP] content: I wanted to read this book because of the controversy it has generated. There are only 7 editors and contributors who wrote this 6 chapter, 170 page "textbook." The premise is that this "textbook" contrasts intelligent design and Darwinian evolution. In actuality, the book selectively promotes facts and theories that support intelligent design and ignores the other 99% of the existant data. This book is a horrible joke. A religious text masquerading as a scientific textbook. I have to wonder...what do the people who believe this book is credible think about cosmology, particle physics, the rest of the universe out there, and the rest of science that has been discovered in the last 2,000 years. Well, I guess if you make believe it simply doesn't (or even can't) exist, you never have to contemplate it or worry about explaining it. That does make life a lot simpler, doesn't it! I feel better now. Guess I'll stay here with my head in the sand for a while longer.	negative
