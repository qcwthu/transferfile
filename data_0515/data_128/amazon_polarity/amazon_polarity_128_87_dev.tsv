title: Awful and Disappointing [SEP] content: I was waiting for this movie for what seemed like a very long time.I was extremely disappointed - so much I had to turn the movie OFF!Awful direction - the world already has enough darkness - I thought a movie including quantum physics may include more light.When the 'good guy' isn't really, there is no one to root for.I don't know how it ended, but it wouldn't matter from where I could see and feel the writer was taking us.This is a movie where I didn't care for not one of the characters, which is when a story dies.I have only turned off a handfull of movies in my 40+ years and this was one of them.	negative
title: Faulty electronics in a nice design [SEP] content: There have been frequent failures of this mouse of the DOA kind. Many DOA mice do not communicate with their dongle and the Logitech reset procedure does not help. It isn't clear whether this problem is a design or a production problem.There have even been many DOAs of the same kind with so-called refurb MX Revolutions recently sold by WOOT.For details check either Logitech's customer blog or WOOT's.Note also that Logitech's reset procedure involves six button actions and a switch flip, since there is no reset button on this mouse to reconnect the wireless, a seemingly clear design defect.This is a huge black eye for Logitech, heretofore a company held in high respect.	negative
title: CISCO should be imbarassed to put their name on this POS! [SEP] content: THIS ROUTER DESERVES ZERO STARS!!!I've set up many routers. THis think is maddening.So i get the new router and automatically upgrade it to the latest software release before any configuration ( v4.2.1.02 (Jan 18 2012 14:10:55))Then I have one simple task - Forward incoming port 41790 to 192.168.0.50.That's it - the simplest feature on any $70 router on the planet. Guess what 3 hours later and the friggin thing still cannon do a simple port forward. I disabled the firewall, set up aUPNP service, set the software DMZ to the IP everything.Still doesnt work - Then I search online and find this has been a probelem with this router since 2007 thru three hardware revs and countless firmware revs. What crap.I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER CISCO ROUTER - THEY HAVE BURNED ME OF THE BRAND FOREVER>BEWARE _ THIS ROUTER WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY _ EVER!!!	negative
title: NOT in color [SEP] content: Called amazon rep. before purchase who assured me and double checked that this dvd was shown in COLOR. dvd arrived and i was excited,this being one of my favorite Christmas movies, only to be very dissapointed that the dvd, like the vhs version, is in black and white.(except for the dvd cover).	negative
title: What a waste!! [SEP] content: A complete waste of money!! The earpieces didn't fit in my ears and ouldn't stay in place no matter what I did. I threw them away.	negative
title: Frustrations, frustrations! [SEP] content: Had to figure out by myself why CD wasn't installing on my RedHat 7.0. (get patch from otn.oracle.com!) Wasted a lot of time when osborne could have just simply put a tip on their website. Tsk tsk...	negative
title: don't waste your money on this [SEP] content: I purchased this and only used it a few times. Now the darn thing won't run. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this product. When it was working, it was OK but now I feel like this was a total waste of my money and I would not recommend this to anyone.	negative
title: Odd taste [SEP] content: I got this sampler pack before investing in a large jar of the product to see what flavors I liked, but I didn't like any. They have a weird aftertaste and are quite thick. Try the Syntax Matrix Protien shakes if you're looking for a good tasting brand.	negative
title: bad [SEP] content: This item was poorly packed--very difficult to put together --it's just a plain shoddy fan. I would return it, but the time has run out!! Nancy peck	negative
title: Book of Dreams [SEP] content: I was a bit disappointed in this book. The beginning started out well and then I lost interest in the subject matter.	negative
title: Not happy with Liss chargers [SEP] content: I purchased 48 of these. I was at the end of my first box of 24 and had been consistently finding "duds" since the Liss cylinders were purchased. Even when I was able to produce whipped cream, the pressure would fizzle out halfway through the cream, and I would have to add another cylinder to finish it. At first I thought it was a defective cream whipper and suspected a leak. Finally after two unsuccessful attempts in a row to make whipped cream, I used a gram scale to weigh the cylinders. Out of a box of 24 NEW chargers 13 weighed less than 23g, 8 of them weighed 20g(the weight of an empty cylinder) and had no NO2 at all. The "full" ones only averaged 25g, so had an NO2 charge of only 5g not the 8g that is stated. Needless to say, I won't be buying this brand again.	negative
title: What's the deal with the math? [SEP] content: Um, this album WAS a sell-out. That's like trying to argue Saddam Hussein is not guilty. It's sell-out, face it. Is it thrash? No. It's sell-out. It's alternative with a bit of a metal edge made by a bunch of Gucci-wearing, (...). Let's call it for what it is.Why the 2 stars? I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands, such as Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Creed, Nickelback, Linkin Park, etc. etc. etc. These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well.(...)But please, people, this is sell-out since it isn't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play. Shame on them. This band died with Cliff.	negative
title: bad product no surprise [SEP] content: So I bought this system a year ago on Amazon.com & it broke less than a month later...the same thing old nintendos used to do..the motherboard is supposedly burnt out...I'm still paying the $400 this cost me..why no review for over a year..easy I've been offline since 2011.Sony won't even fix it..tip to buyers..don't buy anything from this seller or used in general from amazon..Amazon failed to send me an album order last year & recently asked me to review it..surprise surprise..my review was negative towards Amazon, & they refused to post it..imagine thatI doubt I will be buying from Amazon ever again	negative
title: doesn't close [SEP] content: They are all stuck, unless I'm missing something, but I wouldn't know because they do not come with instructions. You can't find any information online, either.	negative
title: N is for Not So Fast [SEP] content: This is the first Sue Grafton book I've read and I have to say that I enjoyed it--UNTIL the "quickie" ending, which was such a letdown after having read sooooo many pages to get there. It seemed like the author decided she was tired of writing, couldn't be bothered to explain or justify plot points, and just wanted to be done with it! Such a disappointment.	negative
title: misleading [SEP] content: The item pictured here is in the factory box and the title says it comes with VoiceXpress.Even though I felt the deal was too good to be true, i ordered it anyway. When it came, it turned out to be an outdated soundcard that doesn't work with Windows XP, and the L&H; Voice Express software? no. not included. What WAS included was a burnt CD including install files for VLC media player, Audacity, and Itunes. I -guess- the drivers for the soundcard were on there (somewhere) but I didn't bother looking.do not buy this product. It is completely and totally not what is advertised here.	negative
title: unncessary software... [SEP] content: I read a tutorial for converting VHS to DVD and it suggested a program such as this one. I bought a capture "card" and with it came software to do basic capturing and editing... all that this did. It comes with cheesy fade screens that I guess some who are into that stuff would love, but that's about it. It wasn't compatible with my capture card/system and didn't read my sound card so I couldn't use the program to actually capture, just edit. This box is just sitting in the corner now since I have no use for it.	negative
title: Shouldn't messiahs do more than make screwdrivers float? [SEP] content: You can't imagine my relief when I discovered that nobody in my bookgroup liked this book. If they had, I think I would have had to quit that group. This book was shallow and did not do justice to the title of messiah. A true messiah is about much more than making random items float, having vampires materialize out of thin air, and dying a predictable and annoying death. Being a messiah is about being countercultural and addressing the injustices in the world. This book drove me up a wall and it nearly went out the window many times. The only reason I finished it was because we made a promise to finish every book before our meetings. I would have given it a zero star rating, but it didn't go that low.	negative
title: College Text. [SEP] content: I did not care for the way this book presented the facts. Just a boring read. I must admit, I bought this book only because it was required for class. But even my professor was not 100% satisfied with this book and this is what he specializes in.	negative
title: It doesn't stay in my mouth [SEP] content: I don't know whether this is me or else but as said I cannot keep this in site and therefore use it, the taste of it is also disappointing	negative
title: Poor Debut [SEP] content: A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie. The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant "Russian element," which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst. The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins.	negative
title: Not all it's cracked up to be! [SEP] content: I received this as a shower gift and thought is was great until I tried to empty it. The can fills up before the liner runs out. This is a good thing because you don't have to replace the liner that often. However, it is difficult to get the liner to work again after you empty the can. Also, the first time I put a really full diaper in it, one of the clips that holds the diaper as you twist the ring broke off. (...)	negative
title: I cannot believe anyone likes this book. [SEP] content: The story would be fine if it were written by someone else. The author seems to randomly pick conflicting adjectives and gives no reason anyone should care anything for the characters. None of the relationships make any sense and there is no explanation why the characters care for each other or why they are where they are or what they are doing there. The heroine repeatedly insults her cohorts by calling them "boob" & "poop". This illustrates the quick- witted nature of this author. I hope she didn't quit her day job.	negative
title: Inaccurate product description. [SEP] content: This product did not include any information about the separate component you need in order for them to work. The Pods did not come with any instructions. How were we supposed to know you need to buy a unit to seal these!	negative
title: These chairs never arrived. [SEP] content: We ordered these chairs on March 5 and were called and told they would arrive on April 9. We were anxious for them to arrive until two weeks later we were called and "encouraged" to order our chairs from somewhere else. They could not get them even though they had them listed as in stock. Very disappointing!! At least they had the courtesy to call and let us know.	negative
title: I returned it to the Library.. [SEP] content: ...as soon as I realized that the storyline seemed to be going no where. Reads like a good writer writing as quickly as possible with the first ideas off the top of her head regarding characters and events.	negative
title: Or, "How to Torture Your Husband" [SEP] content: What better way to inflict pain (in classic Woodstock generation passive-aggressive style) than by withholding care and affection and substituting a disinterested third party into the relationship? There is absolutely no question as to the real villain of this piece. The central character spends most of her time trying not to be the screen on which the displaced desires of this sick family are projected.	negative
title: Bought 2 of these swivel recliners [SEP] content: We bought 2 of these swivel recliners for our newly renovated family room. We liked the fact that we could use them to watch TV and if we had company could swivel around to the rest of the family room and join the conversation.However, the design of the base is questionable in that there are only 4 spot welds holding the shaft holder in place to the base. In less than 1 year one of the chairs has already failed exactly at this design flaw. Had the company welded around the entire bracket this would not have happened.For the price I suppose it is a bargain but not if you have to replace furniture within a year. Would I buy another? Yes I believe I would however, I would have a welder run a bead weld completely around the base making it a sturdier product and last much longer.Bob	negative
title: Pros and Cons [SEP] content: It's got a nice bright bulb, and a very good, highly reflective cone which focuses the light well. The grip on the unit is pretty well-designed and comfortable as well.Unfortunately, that's the end of the pros. The switch is very sensitive, the slightest little touch or vibration and it turns on. I barely ever used it, but it was always dead when I needed it, and I had to replace the batteries every few weeks to keep it alive.Also, the cap on the bottom is very flexible and has very fine threads, so it's quite difficult to re-tighten the cap properly. The ring on the bottom is a very fragile piece of plastic, making the ring completely useless.I don't recomend this product.	negative
title: Great Value for the Money [SEP] content: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.	negative
title: Yet another expert telling you it's good to ignore your baby [SEP] content: And it's no doubt true that the baby will soon learn to calm itself because its mother won't respond to it.Babies really are a pain, aren't they? So demanding...But with this book, you can feel good about ignoring your child. Gives 'em character -- what every infant needs.	negative
title: Please Don't Buy [SEP] content: I rented this movie at my local library thinking I would buy it, like I bought many others. Are you kidding me the woman had spunk and a little sass that said that she had a brain and she demanded respect for herself. Somewhere between beginning and middle she became a brainless cryer.The prince was a boring lazy nare-do-well along with his rich and a obnoxious friends. The other prince was selfish and a workaholic. Tell me which one would you pick. Me neither one of them. Who does she pick and why ? A leopard doesn't changes it spots.Club Med anyone????????????So far this was THE worse K-Drama I've seen so far.	negative
title: Disappointing, family approved biography [SEP] content: The story of Lindbergh's unusual (strange) childhood and his courageous flight across the Atlantic were gripping. But overall Berg's biography of Lindbergh is a big BORE. So much nitty gritty detail....with no substance. Berg never gets to the heart of this man. In fact, Berg's portrayal of Lindbergh makes me wonder whether Lindbergh HAD a heart. He seemed oblivious to the horrors of Nazism and he appeared indifferent to his family. (So indifferent in fact that I now wonder whether Lindbergh could have been behind his son's disappearance and murder.)	negative
title: BORING boring borrrr . . . zzzzzzzzzzzzzz [SEP] content: The main character Carlos Castillo is an egotistical, arrogant jerk. His cohorts are portrayed as little more than sychophantic lapdogs. And somewhere in the book is hidden a plot. But it takes hours and hundreds of pages to figure out it's a plot not worth reading. Unbelievably bad writing. How does this author get away with writing such drivel?	negative
title: what a joke [SEP] content: Wow, you have some anger issues going on with Bosnians and Croatians. Of course you don't want to admit that the Serbs were the bad guys. That is human nature. And if you feel comfortable living in your own little world of dreams, then go ahead. The rest of the world knows what went on. Sweet dreams amigo.	negative
title: too bad........... [SEP] content: What a nice selection of songs! and excerpts from the 3 big piano/orchestral works. And lyrics and verses included! And then the whole thing is ruined because the chord changes are over-simplified, or just wrong. Too bad.	negative
title: Quaint and inaccurate [SEP] content: Quaint and inaccurate Reviewer: Eva Webster-Frizzell from Tennessee I have read and am appalled at the first of many inaccuracies in this book. The first, most glaring to anyone from the area is the caption of the two-page "homecoming" picture. The actual gathering is for a baptism. Anyone not recognizing this has spent a year not learning. Very disappointed in this book. I bought the book for my sister, a PHN working with people in very poor circumstances in the Sequatchie Valley of Tennessee. She had hoped to see the documentary but missed it. I hope she can look over the problems with the book, we can forgive Yankees who try to look at and into our lives and consistently get the wrong information. By the way, our widowed mother reared twin daughters without ever resorting to welfare.	negative
title: Now you're losing your mind in no time!!!!! [SEP] content: This set is absolutely horrible. I have used several different language tapes for brushing up on my Spanish. This one is not only bad, it's extremely irritating!Problem 1: The cover says that there are 2 tracks, 1 for Spanish and 1 for English. So, You choose to listen to 1, or both tracks. Wrong! No matter how I turned the dials on my stereo, I heard both tracks.Problem 2: The tracks are so rapid that it is difficult to tell what is being said.Problem 3: Each of the 4 speakers talks at a different volume level. One moment you can't hear, and the next moment your'e being screached at.Problem 4: (Last and certainly not least) An annoying high-pitched set of tones is played between EVERY section. This repeated shrill sound is enough to give you a headache! Sometimes the sections are short so you get to hear this sound after only a few phrases!Avoid this package at all costs!!!	negative
title: Less than It Should Be [SEP] content: I mean no disrespect to the authors of the recipes included in this book. Their efforts to share memories and look to the future through favorite recipes was valiant.But they deserved better than the rest of this book, which was repetitive and simplistic. Other than the translator, the modern-day contributors to the book clearly didn't know their stuff. They either should not have written anything, or they should have done a more substantial job with what they did write.	negative
title: Boring mess of sludge [SEP] content: Sorry but i have to edit my last review. At first i gave this album the benefit of the doubt and rated it 4 stars but after multiple listens it has failed to grow on me, unlike the great White Pony did. The album is just boring and overly noisey. Who mixed this thing? You can barely hear the vocals at all, they're buried under all the sludge. Some songs brake away from the monotony such as the explosive opener "Hexagram" which is as melodic as it is brutal. "Bloody cape" would be a good track on Around the Fur. And contrary to most fans beleif, "Anniversary.." is a wonderful ballad which almost makes up for the horrible failure of "teenager" on White Pony. The rest of the album just sends me to sleep, including the My Bloody Valentine sounding "Minerva". Overall, Deftones is a dissapointing album. It lacks both the emotion of Around the fur and the growing vision of White Pony.	negative
title: Sub-Par Star Trek Movie [SEP] content: While better than Insurrection, overall this movie stinks. I would actually give it two and a half stars. This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth. Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly. The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame. One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome. But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable. And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin. Sorry, no good.	negative
title: Do you shave your head? [SEP] content: I do, and while I'm not sure if the label indicates that this is not a product for your face and scalp... it should! It felt great going on and for a few hours. But by late morning and for the whole rest of the day I felt like I was covered in grease. You know that feeling you get after eating really greasy fried food? That's the one! It was hard to even wash off. Instead of this I highly recommend the Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil instead (ASIN:B0000C0XL8). You only need a tiny little bit and it works wonders just after shaving my head and face.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: I was disappointed with this book. It appears to be a compliation of various documents and forms just thrown together. Some of it is very, very basic and generic. I was looking for much more SAP specific information.	negative
title: Not Espresso ! ! [SEP] content: The AeroPress is disappointing.This does not even come close to a cup of good espresso. I Would not recommend the AeroPress. What a waste of money, mine went into the trash and i am so happy.	negative
title: Not good for HDD editing [SEP] content: I purchased this product with the hope that it would work better than Adobe's Premiere, but it doesn't. The only way to get my movies from my HDD camcorder into it is via my PC or a DVD, and it is too heavy and slow, and when I try to use the edit room it freezes.	negative
title: Rubbish [SEP] content: This sheet of plastic is a waste of money, big time. We bought it to fit the three man Eureka tent and it only just covered half the floor. We have since found out that we ordered the small floor saver as there was no option given to buy the medium on the web site. After a test setup on grass it had holes in it and no it doesn't have grommets in the corners. I could have bought better from the hardware for a lot less. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I can only think that the product must have changed if people gave good reviews. There is no way known that it could get a good review.	negative
title: Weak transmission [SEP] content: Like a lot of other people ours died after less then a year. We got a new one under warranty, which they were very good with. This one lasted about the same amount of time. I thought it did a pretty good job of keeping the box clean but eventually the rake would clog and the motor would stall. It is supposed to stop if encounters a clog, but occasionally we would find it slipping the pulleys against a clogged rake. Eventually both of them suffered a failure of a gear in the "transmission".I don't think this is the worst machine in the world and maybe if you pay enough attention to it, it will last longer. But ours needed to be taken apart too much, the bags and liners are an added cost and for the price it is not worth it. I will not buy any rake style automatic box again.	negative
title: FPS action [SEP] content: This is based on the James Bond movie. I tried out the game and it seems to demand a lot of button-mashing. It looks like the graphics are good.	negative
title: Very Satisfied with Product [SEP] content: I was very happy with the product and the company that shipped it. I received it very quickly.	negative
title: Piece of Junk [SEP] content: This is my second Tempo vacuum cleaner and we loved the first one purchased years ago. This one is a piece of junk. We opened the box, put it together, plugged it in and it immediately started smoking! Buyer Beware.	negative
title: Wouldn't recommend this product. [SEP] content: This product did not fit my iPod Nano even though the product description said that it would. I would have liked more specifics on which iPod this actually fits.	negative
title: Sorry, Amazon let me down this time... [SEP] content: It was sent in a plastic bag. No dust bag, no authenticity card, no box. Either open box or refurbished. I believe it is not brand new. The bag itself is of OK quality and it is definitely not worth even 10% of its MSRP.Back it goes.	negative
title: This Design is Retarded! [SEP] content: The guy from the Netherlands is 100% correct. This is an idiotic design. There's no way that the cable will reach both the tv and a separate tuner; which is at least half the reason for buying it. It's supposed to be video AND audio, duh! Maybe if I stand my tuner on its end behind the tv, it'll reach...Mine's getting returned immediately.	negative
title: Oh well, live and learn. [SEP] content: The product arrived on time and billing was on spot. Unfortunately the unit stopped displaying the video. Audio worked but video quit. Tried to get a replacement but the Outlet did not have any other units - no longer in stock. Upgraded unit (at least the cost was more) but got a smaller screen (7" vs 9"). Waiting for delivery of new 7" portable DVD player and credit for returned, defunct 9" portable DVD player. Expect things to go ok from here.	negative
title: Makes your coffee taste like plastic [SEP] content: The My K-Cup was incredibly disappointing. After buying (and loving) my Keurig B40 Elite, I was excited at the prospect of no longer having to shell out 50 cents for mediocre K-Cups. However, the My K-Cup was so bad that I would gladly pay a small fortune for every cup of coffee to never have an experience with it again. After washing it eight times and soaking it in various products, it still smelled the way it did when it came out of the box-- strongly of chemicals and plastic. This would be fine except that it also made my coffee taste like plastic. If you have ever tasted weak, plastic-y coffee with grounds in it, you will understand my pain. This did not get better with time. I have now had the My K-Cup for several months and, like a fool, I keep hoping that if I wash it enough, it will stop making things taste like petroleum. No luck yet. If I were you, I wouldn't risk it.	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: First of all, the 'feathers' are plastic. Not too good for shooting accurately.Bottom line, I don't recommend buying archery supplies online. Better to go to a local archery shop and get help figuring out which products will suit your goals.Good news is that Amazon's return policy gave me most of my money back.	negative
title: LE FALTA MAS ROCK!!! [SEP] content: ESTE CD ESTA MUY POBRE DE MUSICA ROCK-CONTIENE MUCHOS COVERS, POR FALTA DE TALENTO, Y CREATIVIDAD, NO ES DE ROCK, ES DE TROPIROCK- JA! JA! JA! MANA NO SOBREVIVIRA MAS!!!	negative
title: Cool design, poor function, makes you go OOOO [SEP] content: It looked cool; that's why I bought it. I should have known, since some great Amazon writer/reviewers said the thing was problematic.The design is about 40% wider than it needs to be, first off. But the biggest flaw is trying to seat the coffee pot into the lip to catch the drip. It wasn't uncommon for the pot to unseat itself, 1/2 cup into brewing, and just stop. The brewing is really slow, which makes for rich coffee, but the pot also fills full of grounds. I've tried both the gold filter and paper ones, same problem.After using this for 2 weeks, I am packing it up and sending it back.	negative
title: Head Lights [SEP] content: How would anybody know what these are like when Amazon says they are not available and dont know if they are even going to have them again! Ridiculous!	negative
title: Mobile Library [SEP] content: The greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. Most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. This device could revolutionize the future of reading.The downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). Secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. If you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. While the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.In short, I would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot. If you already have a large book collection, I wouldn't go getting rid of it for this product. Besides, what if your power goes out for a week and you can't charge it? What are you going to do, stare at it?	negative
title: horrible chemical smell [SEP] content: DO NOT BUY THIS! Thought this was a great idea. sounded quick and a fun way to add color to cakes. It did give color to the cake but the smell was horrible. Smellslike hair spray. Not something I want to eat or let my children eat.	negative
title: Smaller than you think [SEP] content: I was a bit suprized when i opened the package and saw how small the stuffed Animal was. I'm thinkg 17" plush toy is going to be a good size... Nope its not as big as you would think.	negative
title: Yu-gi-oh Figures [SEP] content: The figures are very cute, but smell like skunk. I have washed them, aired them out, and soaked them. The odor will not come out. So if you want very cute Yu-gi-oh figures, and can get passed the smell, order these.....if you have a good nose, stay clear.	negative
title: Not durable [SEP] content: It was a ton of fun--until my 3 year old managed to break in after only a few months. Not sure how he did it--the string snapped right above where the magnetic lifting piece is attached. For $30 I expected a toy that would last. Really too bad, because my son loved it.	negative
title: don't bother [SEP] content: I read the first few chapters and didn't care for this book at all. The wording was not something I cared for. I took a chance for $.99!	negative
title: Better left as a fun childhool memory [SEP] content: Ouch - I bought this thinking that my kids would enjoy it. I had fond memories of this being a fun show, a little strange, but good for little kids. Oh my this was so bad - my 8 year old was rolling his eyes after 3 min into the film, that past week has been then talking about how bad the acting, and special effects were in this show. Definately not a high point in Jim Henson's portfolio. Better left as a fun childhood memory, because if you watch it now the happy feeling will be gone.	negative
title: Who's singing? [SEP] content: This recording, like so many of the recordings listed by Myto, IDI, and other such companies has absolutely no information whatsoever regarding cast. I don't know about you, but I not about to "plunk" down my money for an unknown. Without cast information, they can rot on the shelves	negative
title: Woefully Lacking [SEP] content: This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It is full of grammatical, syntactical and spelling errors (for example, "a lot" is spelled as "allot" throughout the book). As far as the subject matter goes, it does an injustice to the word "investing." It would have been better to label it speculating or gambling. Even the late Al Frank, who based his stock buying on fundamental value, insisted on referring to the stock market as speculating. In any case, this book suffers from a classic case of confusing brains with a bull market. From 1995-2000, anyone could have "succeeded" in the stock market regardless of what market capitalization one decided to "play." Neither this book, nor most others on the subject, are particularly useful in knowing how best to "invest" in penny stocks over the long run.	negative
title: Endlessly Cliched [SEP] content: THE BONE COLLECTOR (1999) * * High calibre cast give good performances to no avail in this endlessly cliched suspense thriller. Never misses an opportunity to strictly stick to formula.	negative
title: Inaccurate [SEP] content: I was very disappointed in this scale. I was hoping it would match the weight at the Weight Watcher Center where I attend classes. I loved the design and the fact that it had the partial pounds that my old scale does not. However, I never could get this scale to weigh even close to the old one and one time within four hours I had lost 11 pounds. Since that is not possible I was forced to return this scale and stick with my old one.	negative
title: Confusing, and at times inaccurate [SEP] content: I used this book for an online class, books and test are bundled together and each time I took the test I had to challenge at lest one question, because it was simply wrong or inaccurate. Test quiz/test questions are non constructive for the most part. Many examples use non-standard fonts that hard to find, making assignments unnecessarily difficult to complete, in some exercises after following all instructions the correct result would not match the examples given again creating difficulty not needed. This books suited for online classes because it often gives instructions which are completely irrelevant in such environment. The books gives a good amount of tips and tricks about MS Office, books needs revising and grouping of lessons.	negative
title: NOT INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL GRADE! [SEP] content: Practice test one:Score: Verbal: 506 Quantitative: 420Practice test two:Score: Verbal: 600 Quantitative: 480Practice test three (3 hours before taking GRE):Score: Verbal: 520 Quantitative: 500(This had me an emotional wreck the day of the GRE)MY ACTUAL First time GRE SCORES:Verbal: 720 Quantitative: 620My only belief is that this book and program is designed to convince you to buy the courses. That being said, the 30 minute math tests did make me feel like I had all day to do the quant on the GRE.I'm not sure this helped me very much. I think I would've been better off just with a math review book.AND it is full of typos at critical points. For example, in one QC test problem it says "Circle 1 intersects Circle 2 and EXACTLY two points" and the problem requires it to be intersected at exactly one point to be solved.	negative
title: YOU NEED AN AMPLIFIER TOO...! [SEP] content: The product description is not clear at all but you need an amplifier for this. I had to pay to have the product shipped back even though THEIR product description was incorrect.	negative
title: Very misleading [SEP] content: DVD had several deep scratches causing itto freeze throughout the film. This DVD didnot advertise it having any scratches. Extremely annoyed and will not be ordering from this person again	negative
title: Warning - Made in China! [SEP] content: I have not yet used this product but was extremely dissappointed to see that it was made in China. It will forever taint my opinion of this product and Bosch. Unfortunately there is no way to know before buying it. It would have definately influenced my decision. Everytime we purchase something made offshore we are endorsing the manufacturers decision to not invest in America. We as purchasers need to begin demanding the place of manufacture to be prominently displayed in all advertising.	negative
title: Interesting but doubtful [SEP] content: The product met my expectations as book. The problem is that the handling of some aspects of the subject is bad science.	negative
title: Interesting Life made Less than Interesting [SEP] content: There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages.	negative
title: Very disappointing [SEP] content: Considering all the information and documentaries out on the subject of Frank Lucas and his Harlem Heydays, this one is extremely disappointing. Amateur and uninformative, this one was a stinker.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! [SEP] content: this game looked fun like many games, but when i bought it at costco and played it... only thing good that i can say about it is the graphics, but graphics don't make the game any greater. the only buttons that you really push are A,B,R,C and the joystick. try another game trust me.	negative
title: Merriam-Webster Children's Dictionary [SEP] content: I agree completely with the one star review by Tom. This volume is a piece of junk. We purchased it as a gift for our granddaughter and it didn't last a week. It fell off her bed onto a carpeted floor and the binding broke completely. Since it was made in China, it's not too surprising. If a publisher is going to sell a large heavy reference book aimed at children, they should make the binding heavy-duty for expected hard use. From what the other reviewers said about the dictionary's content, I guess we didn't miss much. Next time we buy a book like this, we'll try to check where it is made first.In summary, don't buy this dictionary for a child since it's content is inadequate and its binding is junk.	negative
title: Expecting More [SEP] content: If you've already got a pretty good handle on your divorce or separation, skip this book. I was expecting to discuss how to use my divorce as a springboard for an authentic, self -actualized life; instead I got lessons in how to put myself in my spouse's shoes, and other words of advice useful in salvaging what's left of the relationship with my spouse. I've done that work, I've agononized over this decision and see my present/future relationship with my spouse as business I have to attend to, in a professional way, as we raise our son. I'm past my spouse, and wish him nothing but the best as we continue to co-parent our son. Divorce will be the catalyst for my extraordinary life, but it will be a life I forge without the help of this book.	negative
title: mistake [SEP] content: There was no DVD in case. Can't really review when I didn't get the DVD. I wanted the DVD so I wasn't happy at all.	negative
title: signal problems [SEP] content: This is one of the worst wireless systems I have ever used/purchased. I purchased this to use with my high school music program, but there was so much static, interference, white noise, lost signals, etc. that is unusable. I even returned it to VocoPro for a replacement, hoping the one I got was defective. The replacement was just as bad. Even after placing the reciever less than 10 feet from the microphones, the problems persisted. To make matters worse, AA Duracell batteries do not fit. They are slightly longer than generic AA batteries, but the added length is too much for the unusally small tollerences in the battery compartment. Even generic batteries have to be forced in place. I ended up installing it in our theater for our administrators to use during staff meetings because no one seems to mind when they cannot understand or hear them talk. Do not waste your money.	negative
title: BADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD [SEP] content: I live in New Orleans and I'm a huge 50 cent fan so I got this movie and it SUCKED!!!! The movie didnot portray New Orleans as it really is in fact not even close. The story and acting were total garbage	negative
title: This book is a piece of... [SEP] content: You will not know what I mean untill you buy and use this book. It is not meant for first semester students as the review mentioned. It sucks...examples are so hard, and approach used in the book in so difficult to understand	negative
title: Not recomended unless you like the Power Rangers. [SEP] content: Wow, what a total dissapointment. If this were a Power Rangers Megazord I would have to give him 5 stars. But as a Transformer, he isn't. Yes, he's got good articulation, but thats it. His normal mode is very ugly, his cab mode does a poorjob of hiding his head and arms. His mini-vechiles don't transform at all, they only make up his arms and legs in super form (Megazord) and they can be swapped around, otherwise they are useless. Energon and Armada Optimus Primes are the worst Primes to ever come out. Like i said before if he were a Power Rangers Megazord i'd say nice homage to Optimus Prime and give it 5 stars, but sadly he's the real thing, and doesn't come close to being a "transformer" and only gets 1 star...yuck.	negative
title: Don't Bother [SEP] content: This was one of the very few films that I have stopped, rewound and slid back in the case before it was over. I thought this film would be a fun trip into fantasyland with crazy things and zany people, not to be taken seriously, just a lot of crazy zany fun. Well, it didn't even do that, it was bad folks, baaad. And movies have to be pretty bad for me to shut them down. Will Smith was not convincing in his character as he also was not convincing in his roles in "Independence Day" and "Men in Black". He looks much too young for these characters and shows not an once of maturity in his lines and actions. If he acted more mature, it could help offset his youthful looks. Its like watching a little boy playing grown up characters. Perhaps thats what turned me off "Wild Wild West". Don't waste your time on this one.	negative
title: Awkward lid [SEP] content: I purchased this kettle based on the reviews I read from amazon and was disappointed to find out no one mentioned how awkward the lid was. You cannot pour water from the kettle without opening the lid or else water will leak from the sides. This means the steam from the kettle will burn your hand. I am returning this kettle and forking over some extra money for a Russell Hobbs that has been tried and tested by me. Its a little bit pricey but my last Russell Hobbs lasted me 10 years.	negative
title: NOT FULL SEASON!!!! [SEP] content: NOT FULL SEASON!!! Wish I would have known beore I bought! No wonder it was only $5.99. Hope they add more episodes of the show.	negative
title: Do NOT buy this book. [SEP] content: The introduction had so many typos that (as a purist), I returned it before reading the last paragraph. If readers can live with that, great. Enjoy the book.As massive an undertaking as the color printing was (first-rate, BTW), the poor attention to proofreading such a small amount of text matter renders the integrity of the rest of the book highly suspect. I didn't want to proofread the 435 plates (in microscopic Roman numerals) for out-of-order errors, missing plates, etc.Regretfully,Andy B	negative
title: does not work [SEP] content: It says works on most household ant types, but I see ants walking to the edge then apart. Obviously they are aware of the flavor. So disappointed.	negative
title: IS NO STARS A OPTION? [SEP] content: I didn't get it and could only get through 3/4 of the movie.Please someone tell me the funny parts because I was bored silly and could not understand how EW gave this a A rating.Annoying, boring actors without anything to hold any kind of entertaining merit.	negative
title: HA HA HA~!!!! [SEP] content: You got to be kidding right ~!?? If you are an Intelligent Human Being, use common sense please ~! LOL You can not loose ONE body part by wearing this kind of gadget! LOL ~!!! You got to loose entire body fat mass by cardio work out, plus eat good. PERIOD. Gee, I could come up with TONS of silly Gadget like this to become a millionaire for silly consumers !! can not believe people actually spend a penny on these things ~! LMAO~!!! People are cute~!!	negative
title: Great move. BAD DVD RECORDING. [SEP] content: The movie is one of the best I have ever seen, but the movie was recorded badly because my Toshiba SD-3006 DVD player could not play the entire movie. It continues to stall in the switch layer change. The recording studio should do a better job for recording two-layer disc movies. Every other DVD movies play fine in my DVD player. Not sure if every other new DVD players stall in the switch-layer change for viewing Panic Room.So, I switch to the next chapter of Panic Room and rewind it a little, and I could finish the entire file without any problems at all.Walter Chan	negative
title: Can"t view it on my DVD player [SEP] content: I tried to play the DVD on my DVD player which attaches to my TV and it wouldn't play, says something about the region. I can play it on my laptop only because it props me to change the region on it.	negative
title: S4000 cable failure [SEP] content: Didn't work for me as a charging cable for an S4000 camera. Camera gave signal that either cable or charger was bad. I couldn't recommend it for this camera.	negative
title: Did not live up to the hype; not even close. [SEP] content: I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated. I read it in one night and it is definitely not something I would want to keep as a reference for anything. Get it out of the library.	negative
title: Boring!!!!!!! [SEP] content: Jeez, this book moved so slow that I actually fell asleep while reading it. I've generally liked Zahn's books before, but this one was simply not one of them. I shudder to think what the rest of the series is like.	negative
title: EVEN WORST THAN DEFAULT ANTENNA !! [SEP] content: The signal goes down, I buy this to increase my reception, but even at outside, the signal is worst than with normal antenna. Don't buy !!La señal se cae, compre esto para incrementar mi recepcion, pero aun estando afuera, la señal es peor que con la antenna normal, no lo compres !!	negative
title: Quality stinks for the price you pay [SEP] content: My daughter (9) was given this for Christmas. She was really excited about it. My husband hooked it up to the television & she tried to play with it. Not that we expected the best but the picture quality was terrible. You could barely make out the features (unlike on the box where they make it look so clear). The instructions barely walked you through how to play with the features. We spent about 2 hours trying to figure it out only to decide to return it. Get a cheap 3-4 MP camera & a makeover software for about the same price!	negative
title: hate it [SEP] content: the way it sounds in the discription this is a documentary. it is not.in fact it is a silent film that is pure fiction.not something you should get.i wouldnt even give this a one but i have to rate to do the star thing in rateing	negative
title: Could've been better. [SEP] content: Like the songs from Linkin Park and Goo Goo Dolls. Thought the other songs could've been better - a lot better. Especially the Transformes theme song. I do not like this version at all. The version by Lion on the original animated movie is much better.Also much better, and a more recent version, is a version of the song done by Black Lab. This should've been on the album and would've been good for the closing credits of the movie as well. [...] and you can hear their version (and see some YouTube videos of the song).I, too, hope an orchestral soundtrack of the movie comes out.	negative
title: Complete Waste of Money [SEP] content: The battery on my phone, as well as other reviewers', lost its charge very quickly and completely died just a few months after I bought it. I can not find a replacement battery anywere, locally or on the internet. Panasonic can't even replace the battery. Also, Panasonic's customer service is not lacking, it is non-existant. Do not waste any money on this company.	negative
title: Thunderbolt as an aircraft [SEP] content: The movie/DVD was not a description of the origin of the P-47, how it was employed as a fighter, the tactics employed and its opponents (FW-190, Me-109 etc) armaments, and development during WW-2. This was a feel good presentation as bomber, for which it was ill-equiped to function. No performance was given or comparisons made to other US aircraft. The P-51, P-38, the British Spitfire and Hurricane being good examples.	negative
title: Great Music, Horribly Produced [SEP] content: The songs on this album are all outstanding, but any Specials or Desmond Dekker fans out there are in for a disappointment. The producers decided to run all the instruments and vocals through a reverb effect in an apparent attempt to replicate Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound. In addition, most of the tracks are overrun by sustained synthesizer chords. Ska's catchiest attribute is its sharp rhythms, but the morons in the booth ruined it by drowning out the quality. What's their motivation? Lord knows, but I've always detested producers who try to become part of the act themselves by manipulating the message instead of fine-tuning it. Close your eyes, and you'll think you're trapped in some horrible karaoke bar. These two classic acts deserved better.	negative
title: not impressed [SEP] content: This book is only for those who manage a BI project development.If you are not involved in this sector, don't buy it.	negative
title: Picture Quality not good [SEP] content: I was suprised to find that this dvd is non anomorphic. For those of us with a 16:9 HD TV the PQ when upconverted is lacking. For a fairly new disc not to be "enhanced for 16:9" TVs is a crime.	negative
title: BUY SONY --DO NOT BUY COBY [SEP] content: UNIT WAS OK WHEN IT WORKED --ABOUT TWO MONTHS. RETURNED UNDER WARRANTY. I PAID TO SEND IT TO COBY AND THEY CHARGE $18 FOR RETURN POSTAGE. NO PROBLEM UNTIL..... THEY SENT A LESSER MODEL 7050 - WOULD NOT SEND EQUAL MODEL UNLESS I PAID TO RETURN IT. I MENTIONED THAT WARRANTY REPLACEMENT SHOULD EQUAL OR GREATER VALUE (WOULD YOU WANT A 25" TV IF YOUR 46' WAS SENT IN FOR REPAIR) THEY STATED THAT THIS IS THIER POLICY. COBY PRODUCTS ARE CHEAP YES. THEY ARE ALSO JUNK AND THE COMPANY SUCKS .. SONY IS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND SERVICE	negative
title: Very dissapointing [SEP] content: We can call it a road atlas. However, in that field it fails. Poor, difficult to read mapping (like white roads on very light gray background), plenty of empty space, no small roads, no coordinates grid, no relief shading or coloring, only limited amount of interesting places marked on the maps etc. I bought it in hopes I could use it for Africa overland travels, but it is way too limited. Very nice concept but poor implementation. If you only want to drive through "highways" and are on budget then this atlas may be somewhat useful, but probably Michelin Africa regional maps 741, 745 and 746 at 1:4.000.000 scale are better investment. It contains some maps of national parks and town that may be useful. Southern part of this atlas is advertised as 1:1.000.000 scale, however that does not mean it has more details! Actual mapping in this atlas is done by South African company Map Studio and their other atlases are same low mapping standard as well.	negative
title: volume 1 is way better [SEP] content: I think disney picked the best episodes and put them on' volume 1. volume 2 contains an extremely long and boring pilot (disc 1) and several episodes that I would consider to be "filler" episodes. on the bright side, amazon did a great job in fullfilling and delivering the order. hope this helps.--ben and his rescue ranger fan son	negative
title: directors cut horrible [SEP] content: I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides	negative
title: DON'T BUY! - PIECE OF JUNK! [SEP] content: I ordered this coffee pot based on the Krup's name and as a repeat buyer. Either they have gotten very bad at making them or Amazon got a batch of lemons! The first one the water indicator had so many air bubbles in it you could not tell how much water you put in it. I went on-line and exchanged it. The 2nd one had the same problem plus the auto shut off appeared to have shut the pot off 2 hours after brew but it really doesn't! Extreme Fire Hazard!I'm not going to blame Amazon for this one as they have never been a problem but Do not buy this!	negative
title: Microsoft 2007 home office [SEP] content: I do not like this new office suite.It is cumbersome and difficult to do basic things.I was also very frustrated that I could use the CD for one computer and when I tried to install the same program in my other computers at home, the CD will not work.Very poor introduction from Microsoft.Naresh	negative
title: It's The Voice, Stupid [SEP] content: Chan Marshall is famous for her voice. This album forgets that fact. Her voice is muffled, layered, and generally not highlighted. NOTE TO PRODUCER: You stink. All you have to do to record this lady is put a microphone in front of her and push record. By layering and otherwise obscuring her voice, you've not only ruined this record, you've insulted my intelligence. Folks, there is a recording of "To Be A Good Woman" (a great song) recorded on some BBC program. It shows how awesome this album could have been, had the person who recorded it not gotten fancy. I just don't understand it.	negative
title: Package looks good [SEP] content: Found this product to be totally useless. Followed instructions exactly in using this to attach pads to bottom of chair legs on stool in kitchen. Several hours later picked up bar stool and pads stayed on the flloor. Can't give less than 1 star so gave it 1 star for the packaging!	negative
title: Best of the Acedemy Trilogy but that isn't saying much [SEP] content: I wanted to give this book 1.5 stars but since you can't I settled for 1. Champions of the Force is interesting to a point. There are some space battles that seem to be ok, but the major problems haunting all of Anderson's Star Wars books persist. Another superweapon enters the picture: Death Star prototype, run by beings who are so inept its supposed to be funny but comes off just annoying. Kyp Durron returns to the light side, and Exar Khun is defeated but by the end of the story, Durron is treated like buddy not a mass murderer. It's simply not realistic. Admiral Daala comes back to provide Imperial presence but it's not really needed. Anderson tries but the book is to predictable and simply not all that good. Useless characters and plot lines abound. Really enough is enough. If you wish to read about the opening of the Jedi Academy pick up I, Jedi not this trilogy.	negative
title: How to destroy a band [SEP] content: I really curious about this one: I love rage against the machine. But then... I started to listen to it...F***, it is Soundgarden stuff! Lyrics with no meaning at all, that super-solos of Morello just ripped apart and it's kind of a agressive-free music with the lighter-asking songs.I can't believe that Chris Cornell could just change a work of a lifetime, Rage Against the Machine is now a legend. Audioslave is just a regular band that would be a garage band if the elements weren't VIP's.Just buy Battle of L.A. if you want some real stuff.	negative
title: The heat did it in. [SEP] content: We were in the middle of a heat wave when my probiotics arrived. The bottle was hot. Since this is a product that must be refrigerated I called the manufacturer who confirmed that it would be ineffective if it got hot. I called the Vitamin Shoppe and they gave me a refund for the product but not for the shipping. The person I spoke with was very polite and helpful. He said that they know the heat was an issue and they were discussing what to do. In light of that fact, why did they take my order in the first place and why did I have to pay shipping?	negative
title: The Space Between Us [SEP] content: This book is so depressing, it's just one misery from the start. You actually want something good to happen to these characters but its ends badly too. Even though I suppose its realistic, I would not recommmend it.	negative
title: Did I Get Some Little Kid's First Woodworking Project? [SEP] content: I realize that this is not a top-of-the-line item, but is it too much to ask that all of the holes attaching the doors and hinges not be stripped? It takes awhile to find all of those tiny screws when they're rolling around the box. Also, could just one of the pre-drilled holes be positioned correctly? Just one, please?As may be read in some of the other reviews, the darts are laughable. If the buyer is willing to do a little bit of repair work while putting it together; doing the work that a manufacturer generally does with even the most economical of merchandise, and the cabinet is not going to be the focal point of your rumpus room, knock yourself out.	negative
title: Stay away--it doesn't work [SEP] content: I plugged this in and tried doing backups. I kept getting funny messages. I followed the troubleshooting page for Digital Foci and also emailed the company. While they were helpful, they didn't fix the problem. I wound up returning it. They did issue a refund pretty quickly, but from what I've read from others, this isn't a great product. Suggest you stay away.	negative
title: Why would you buy this? Better alternatives [SEP] content: I would avoid this 'mission control' headsets for a number of reasons, especially since there are a number of alternatives. First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap. If you want more comfort and really plan to use this device, go with the Plantronics M175 -- I think it is worth the price difference and have used multiple units over the past 3 years.	negative
title: Need cleaning before use! [SEP] content: My set was arrived dirty, with some stains on it. Instead of going through the returning hassle, I had to have it cleaned before use. The quality of this cribset is so-so, comparable to $80-100 sets that you can find in local babiesrus or target store. But no way it can cost close to $200. The listing price is misleading.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Too many statistics, not enough meal planning. Just eat vegan and save $15! [SEP] content: This book is mostly a lot of trying to convince you with statistics and scientific advice to eat basically Vegan. While I appreciate the fact that most of the evidence is true, there is not enough direction in the form of menus and recipes. The only way to get more information is to join in (not free of course) on Dr. Fuhrman's website.Most people who pick up the book I feel already are ready to make a change and don't need the statistical convincing that he feels necessary to fill most of this book. If you are ready to make a change then save your money on this book and just buy a good vegan cookbook and lay off the processed foods(sugar etc). Not worth the money...	negative
title: Cheesy [SEP] content: I've never been a fan of Katzen's cookbooks. The original recipes were drenched in cheese, cream and butter. "Ethnic" recipes (except, perhaps, for those drawing on her own heritage) tended to be bland and inauthentic. Although the newer edition promises to correct these faults, I don't find that the food is substantially different. Bleah.	negative
title: Unbelievable [SEP] content: This is a most unbelievably badly written book. It must have been dictated and never proofread. I am amazed that it could find a publisher.	negative
title: Save yourself from undoubted fits of nacrolepsy. [SEP] content: It seems like Palahniuk is stuck in a lyrical rut that comes out more and more recycled with each novel, and although this was fine through the first five novels (with the exception of Invisible Monsters-which is probably slightly worse than Diary) it really bottoms out here.Insert comically dark one-liner here.Reinterate said one-liner every fourth paragraph.If anything, stick with Survivor, Choke, or Fight Club.	negative
title: Painless Vocabulary [SEP] content: I like the way this book is organized - as the title indicates, by theme. I am not more enthusiastic only because my vocabulary level is just a bit beyond the one presented. For someone who has studied German only a few years, I think this could be a nice supplemental source.	positive
title: Enjoyable Mysteries [SEP] content: If your a fan of the black and white mysteries of the 30's and 40's, like Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes, you will want to add the Mr. Moto series to your collection. I just watched them for the first time, and enjoyed all of them.	positive
title: What a Great Book! [SEP] content: This book by Marsh Collier is as about as good as it gets. It is easy to understand. Though the book was written a few years ago, all of the information is still relevant. A few of the tools, etc. that are listed and described are revised on eBay's site, but the changes are rather minor and her how-to lessons are perfect. I highly suggest anyone wanting to buy and/or sell on eBay purchase this book. A++	positive
title: Color is Different [SEP] content: I bought the brown guitar strap. What was delivered was much darker than what is shown in here. I wanted a lighter one just as shown. Anyway, this strap is good. Cannot return the item as I am outside the US.	positive
title: Great for Storing Your Laptop [SEP] content: I had originlly purchased this item to put my DVD player and cable box on below the TV...but there are other products better suited for that purpose. But, it was so good looking that I wanted to keep it so I found another use for it. Now I use this shelf to hold my laptop out of they way and off my desk in my office when re-charging the battery or when I'm not using it. I had it mounted in the corner so the cut off corners of the glass shelf is perfect for not scuffing the wall as it swivels slightly. It is also very good looking when my computer is not on it. Great design.	positive
title: High Quality - but slow leak [SEP] content: The ball came quickly and is made of a very durable material. I really enjoyed this product and use it daily. However, with excessive use there is a small leak - I need to blow mine up again every week. But I use it for 100 situps a night.I would recommend this product to others.	positive
title: good buy! [SEP] content: cant even tell it's fake! very good quality for a very good price! this will be my replacement whenever we travel to avoid losing my real ones. thanks!	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: An excellent beginning "invitation to the Christian spiritual life" for those searching for a closer walk with God!	positive
title: Napoleonic era Indian Ocean theater [SEP] content: If you're a general history buff, or a fan of Napoleonic wars, the Hornblower Series or the Aubrey-Maturin series, you will like this book. It appears well researched and documented- the story line is just a bit scattered, but so is the topic. East India Company, Admiral Pellew (the real one), hurricanes, battles, life on an Indiaman ship and a better understanding of France and England in the early 1800's. (Imagine 200 soldiers and sailors living for months inside a space the size of a mid sized American house). Overall a very good read.	positive
title: Good for pesky rashes [SEP] content: This is one of the most useful products for a light rash or that uncomfortable itch. Price was superior to stores.	positive
title: Great, but . . . [SEP] content: The switch fit perfectly and works great, but it sure would be nice if they would write better installation instructions.	positive
title: Alaskans like to listen to it to keep warm! [SEP] content: A friend of mine just flew in from T&T and she got me hooked on these tunes. To describe Soca is a little like Reggae on a sugar high. Very bouncy and very full of life and energy. Bright sounds that make you want to jump around your living room. Very good for cold dreary days in AK!	positive
title: Execellent, reliable, compact [SEP] content: My most recent purchases of the Rome Inside-Out city guides represent a replacement for one I literally wore out after three trips and constant use, as well as two for gifts for our two grandchildren who will be traveling with us. These guides are easy to use and contain an amazing amount of information in a packet about the size of a purse-size pocket calendar.	positive
title: Great perspective shaver [SEP] content: IDidn't finish it all yet, there is lot to read from here! Really it transforms my perspective and helped me to view what's matter in life and what it is an illusion. Reading it is easy and enlighten, now put it all in practice is definitively more challenge, but worth it! I'm not planning in turning into Buddhism as a religion but the teaching I recommend them to every one; if you can go to classes near where you live that helps too.I loved it, already gave it to many members of my family and friends!	positive
title: One of a kind gritty Global electronic epic [SEP] content: This is a very unique CD. Nearly 80 sprawling minutes of twisted beats, ethnic vocals, and blunted dub style production. It's a trip around the globe in your headphones. A wild mix of acoustic and electronic textures- it's not like anything you've ever heard. Don't miss this hidden gem. They also have a cool website/netlabel with tons of free music called CosmicCartel.com	positive
title: Probably the best camera for this price and quite a bit more, too [SEP] content: God, this is a wonderful camera. It's small, it's light, and it's got a genuine wide angle lens. You can still together shots for a 180 degree view, which is truly nifty, and it's got video capability and everything. On mine, however, the LCD screen proved vulnerable for reasons yet to be determined but depending on Kodak's response, I'm reserving judgement. These are awfully awfully nice cameras, tiny and high quality. I'd have a hard time getting anything else after this experience, even with the screen self destructing.ETA: and the kodak people were just wonderful, the camera was fixed, and I am happy all over again.ETA #2: The lenses are both digital, which means the camera's profile is flat all the time. A great advantage.	positive
title: Atom Rocks [SEP] content: You have to own this cd, Making Love and Redefining music. still looking for that girl that is "The cutiest thing I've seen since I encountered miss pacman!"	positive
title: Wonderful cookbook [SEP] content: I read this cover to cover and enjoyed every delicious word! YUM. I love to cook this way anyway, and having just returned from the Mediterranean, I had a great appreciation for the menus and foods (which I just recently ate - double yum). I'm excited to have this in my inventory of cookbooks.	positive
title: Good memory from Childhood [SEP] content: Our teacher read this book to us when I was in elementary school, over 30 years ago! And I still remember it. In fact, I have such a fond memory of it that I decided to purchase it for my own child. The book spoke to me as a child as I grew up in my own little secluded valley. A must read for your child!	positive
title: A very complete and detailed book. [SEP] content: This book has everything - a section on the making of the TV programmes with lots of behind the scenes information. An archive section dealing with the history of the cybermen from the view of the ArcHivists, with all the facts and theories you could ever want all woven into one timeline with lots of great illustrations. Also a section on the concept of the Cybermen, how it all came together, and even a story that never reached the TV screen. Written by David Banks, with additional material from Adrian Rigelsford, this book has everything you could ever want to know about the Cybermen. In a nice large-format book of 144 pages with lots of data on credits, cast lists and merchandise.If you are a Dr. WHO? fan or just want to see how to make alien race the RIGHT way, get this book!	positive
title: I love this film. [SEP] content: Dreyfuss is over the top in this one - in a good way. This is on my favorites list with Down and out in Beverly Hills. Hilarious movie with an extremely funny and memorable cast."You don't wanna make a scene in the Jockey Club!!!"	positive
title: It's a power chord. [SEP] content: I bought a power supply for gaming computer on new egg. I didn't notice it didn't come with power supply (something about using the old one and going green). They don't sell single power cables so I came here and BAM! It's a chord. It works. Problems solved. Compatible with any PC or monitor.	positive
title: Satin Jacket [SEP] content: I bought this jacket for work. Our company used to supply these type of jackets with our uniforms but stopped. I had the co. logo put on and it looks great. Very good quality and fit. I can recommend this jacket.	positive
title: Fascinating search for the Fifth Man, true life intelligence [SEP] content: Story of British spies ~ MI5 in particular ~ from one who livedthrough it. Wright was the first scientist to join MI5, the domesticspy-catchers, and led the way for others. The bulk of the book is taken up with the search for the Fifth Man ~ Wright's candidate is Roger Hollis, who was head of MI5 during the early Sixties ~ a well-hidden Soviet mole like Philby and his ilk. Reading it, at times, it appears that Wright considers himself responsible for every innovation in spy technology during the '50s and '60s, but if you can get over his view of himself, the book becomes a fascinating read, on a par with anything Le Carré wrote. As far as the Fifth Man goes, my mind is still open, but Wright gives excellent cause to suspect that Hollis probably was at least bent, if not broken.	positive
title: Hey I really like This! [SEP] content: This is a good one Laurnea! I have all of your CDs, I think?.I have been following you sense "Betta Listen" your first on Yab Yum / Sony. I have Laurnea II and New Territory both on JVC Japan.I can see the growth in this CD. And it takes you through a journey into Laurnea's world . I really like the smooth happy feeling it gives me and I want to listen to it over and over again. I will buy it as a gift for a lot of people. Her voice is amazing and comforting. Everyone should have this in their collection.Kellie	positive
title: Hiking Vermont [SEP] content: This book, along with "50 hikes in Vermont" takes care of every aspect of hiking I want to do in Vermont on a daily basis.Hiking Vermont contains the majority of short hikes of 5 miles or less. There are some longer hikes of 11 miles or more but if you're driving along and decide to take an hour or two to explore the woods, then this book is for you.You don't need a GPS to find the trailhead, the directions are well documented. This book also has perfect maps of the trail and a nice selection of pictures on the trail. It's my driving bible.	positive
title: almost perfect [SEP] content: I've loved these songs since early childhood, so it was a particular delight to find this nearly perfect recording many years ago. Sioned Williams's harp playing is just right and, despite modern misgivings about Marjory Kennedy-Fraser's approach to the traditional songs of the Scots Highlands and islands, the arrangements are truly beautiful. Lisa Milne's voice is lovely. My only beef is that a very formal voice singing traditional song -- however beautiful the voice may be -- tends to sound unnatural and over-produced. That being said, this is a charming addition to my collection, and I recommend it warmly.	positive
title: Like Finding an Old Friend [SEP] content: I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old.	positive
title: Classicly lovely and great for baby's vision [SEP] content: Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!	positive
title: student Bible dictionary [SEP] content: great investment for all 2 Have when studying the Bible. excellent resource especially the illustrations. I would recommend this student Bible dictionary for all.	positive
title: An album with all guts [SEP] content: This set of songs by MR. Jeffreys has been on my musical playlist since I first heard it. To me it's the best selection of material he has produced. Each song has it's own magic of rock,soul and roots. Here it is reissued on cd. The Lp I own sounds great, Now I can have the digital version as well.This is a must have for Garland Jeffreys fans."Guts for love" Is a soulful ballad that asks the ultimate question about love and commitment.Rebel love and El salvdore are top notch selections that will have you playing this cd over and over again.	positive
title: Clay and Ruben fan [SEP] content: I think Ruben's cd is great - very easy to listen to and sing along with. He really pulls you into it. I voted for Clay during AI but bought both the cd's and will support both of these talented young men.	positive
title: I LOVE this book! [SEP] content: It took a friend about a month to talk me into reading this book, but when I finally gave in, I couldn't put it down!! I think it is great and very well written. Not my usual genre but a pleasant surprise.	positive
title: Awesome, well done! [SEP] content: I was very pleased with how well the movie captured and conveyed the deep message of the book Way of the Peaceful Warrior. Very impressive how it all came together. For me, in addition to the entire book having a significant impact in my life, there were a couple of things that stood out extra and they were brought out in the movie as well. Meditate the move, be the action! Even though the time in the theater was short lived, hopefully many, many will find this movie and benefit from the great guidance it offers. I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of the DVD because this is definitely a movie I will watch many times over and share with as many as I can!	positive
title: peterlor [SEP] content: The previous reveiwer who suggests that this book is being removed and that Stephen Hawking does not want it published has got it entirely wrong. What he refers to is a completely different book. Universe in a Nutshell is a new work based on Hawking's new theories and the author and illustrators spent two years creating it. I know this because I was responsible for the artwork. It's a pity that so-called reveiwers are so ignorant and loud-mouthed without having the knowledge or intelligence needed to make comment.	positive
title: Invaluable if you want to improve - not for beginners [SEP] content: This is not a beginner book and it is not a learning book. It doesn't show you how to play classical guitar. This is a technique building book and it works extremely well at this task. This book is perfect for you if you have been playing classical guitar regularly and for some time now -If you are trying to grow in your ability past the beginner stage and the early intermediate stage.This book is something you should get if you have some time to commit to the guitar on a regular basis because the warm-up exercises and the various left/right hand exercises take time. Just doing these exercises will take an hour of your playing time.If you already have a repertoire and you want to become more technically proficient then this book is perfect. the exercises really do work. If you have the time to commit to this book your playing will improve dramatically. It will help you identify and improve technical points that you are weak at.	positive
title: Excellent to the max [SEP] content: As a Taylorphile I have to say that this DVD is absolutely beautiful, no wonderful, no it's beyond wonderful. The delivery was quicker than was stated. Best money I have spent in years. If it was just a CD it would be worth it. With the video it's fantastic. And no I am not James's mother.	positive
title: He is my favorite [SEP] content: I love this CD because I had heard him live and wanted some of this older music. I enjoyed very much	positive
title: Awsome [SEP] content: Great movie, even beter if you are familiar with the bible and not afraid to challange your faith.	positive
title: Really Great Bluegrass [SEP] content: The Bluegrass Brothers are one of the most talented and dynamic groups performing today. This is one of the earlier albums made before Victor's sons Steve and Donald developed into the truly great performers they have become. Like all of the Bluegrass Brothers' albums, it can only serve as a substitute for the times you can't be there to watch them live on stage but wish you were there.	positive
title: Great product [SEP] content: Works exactly as stated, you can also you the cord to connect directly to your PC which give it multiple purposes which is great in any product.	positive
title: Just Great......Again! [SEP] content: When I was growing up MASH just didn't do it for me. I was just to young to grasp all the subtle humor. Now being an adult I cannot pass up a chance to see this masterful classic. I recommend this series to everyone. I only wish that they would make the production of each season a little faster. I want to see it all NOW.	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: This book is an excellent survey of WebLogic Server 8.1 and, more generally, building applications with J2EE. It describes each of the functional areas of the server - JSP and servlets, EJBs, JMS, JDBC, security, administration, etc. It also reviews other technologies, such as web services, XML, and SOA, and how they relate to J2EE. The example application is thorough and useful. This is an excellent book for someone new to WebLogic Server and J2EE or an expert looking to polish skills.	positive
title: glissjr [SEP] content: I just love the purchased of the cast iron to cook cornbread. It is especially great with the two handles. You will not regret making this purchase. I am 100% satisified.	positive
title: vista operating system [SEP] content: Fairly good book. Covers the obvious but ignores many of problems of Vista. I went to Google, mentioned the problem and found out it was a common problem. Someone had the solution which worked. More emphasis should have been given to the differences between XP and Vista	positive
title: Right Tool For The Job [SEP] content: After using this drill at work (I'm a telecommunications technician), I had no choice but to buy it for my new house. This drill is perfect for all the little things like putting on faceplates, drilling in screws/bolts in hard to reach places. It even can do a decent job at drilling in wood screws into studs. All in all, this is really good product and I recommend it for anyone who owns a home.	positive
title: Excellent! [SEP] content: With an odd-shaped console and dashboard in our vehicle, I really needed more versatility than a permanent or window 'suction' mount could offer. Enter this product. The weight is enough to keep my unit where I choose to set it. The non skid rubber-like base is slightly moldable, to further enhance the "stays put" character of the product. The mounting stem locks into the base with a quick-release key. As an added safety feature, there is a locking lever which disables the quick release latch, avoiding unintentional releases from the base.	positive
title: It's about time! [SEP] content: All I have to say is that this was a great show that should have never been cancelled. Even though we, the fans, couldn't get it back we sort of compromised and asked for DVD Box sets. It took us about two years but our hard work paid off. This sounds like a great box set and it will greatly appreciated it my collection. The only thing I ask is that the unaired pilot be included in the third season, so everyone can have every episode. I have already preordered this set and I am sure to be happy with my purchase.	positive
title: Guide to Machine Quilting [SEP] content: After reading most of the book, I find it very educational and interesting. Always like the tidbits as they are helpful.	positive
title: By the fans, for the fans. [SEP] content: This is an excellent well-made documentary. I was not expecting that at all. It left me with an empty shallow feeling, but sometimes that's just how life is. If you consider yourself a KISS fan, you need to watch this documentary. It will make you see KISS from the perspective of true KISS fans. There is no happy "hollywood" ending here, you might even start to dislike KISS after watching this, but you'll definitely feel something for the fans.	positive
title: A good general look at the history of western architecture [SEP] content: Wodehouse and Moffett do a good job of jamming the whole history of western arcitecture into an easy to read compact work. They cover the biggies and touch on the lesser known but important works. There are ample illustrations and notations to diagrams and photographs. The writing is interesting and not full of boring technical jargan. This book is an excelent jumping off point for a time period or to get an overview of architecture in general. There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck. This book is certanily not the end all of any time period, but for casual scholors of architecture or those who need to know about a building in X time period, this a great book.	positive
title: Great product, but don't feel any difference after a while. [SEP] content: Received this from a doctor for food poisoning in samples. This nuked the food poisoning in just a few hours. Worked well. A couple months later, I got food poisoning again. Decided to invest in this for protection. Got my system going again. Once you are healed and use it as a vitamin, you won't really feel a difference as if you didn't take it. It's all on you to keep a good system going. All in all, this product works quite well.	positive
title: A Bistro at Its Best [SEP] content: Having first gotten to know The White Dog Cafe in my frequent meals there during college, I was delighted (understatement) to find that the restaurant had its own cookbook. The book, which is a solid thickness with plenty of recipe options, is one of my very favorites. There are items that are more complicated and others that are perfect for a backyard BBQ. Variety being key and inside bits of information adding to the richness of this book. For instance, in a recipe calling for fresh artichokes, the page would give you a little information on cleaning fresh artichokes. The kind of background many cooks need and most cookbooks neglect to offer. I would give this cookbook a five-star rating, but I am allergic to about 25% of its recipes so I can't say how great those are. Those I've tried, however, are yummy (never any leftovers) and popular with kids and adults alike.	positive
title: Excellent covering many influenced regions around the world [SEP] content: This in an excellent cookbook that traces Indian influences around the world. It has loads of interesting and exotic recipes and also has many of the much loved standard dishes found Indian influenced areas around the world, including surprising places such as Kenya. The initial history of the Indian influences is fascinating. There are even recipes for creating 19th century "British" style curries and different curry powder recipes. It's a great cookbook for both someone getting into cooking this style of food or for someone already with lots of different cookbooks seeking something new and interesting.	positive
title: BEAUTIFUL GIFT! & a great seller!! [SEP] content: Purchased this item for my parents' 24th wedding anniversary. It's a beautiful gift with lots of choice foods inside. I would recommend this as a gift for any occasion suitable for anyone - every foods inside will be greatly enjoyed by the recipient! Can't say enough about the seller (Art of Appreciation) - BEST GIFT SELLER EVER!!!! Accomodated my request to ship out asap. THANK YOU!!	positive
title: An excellent product [SEP] content: I use this product to retrieve data from a laptop or PC that is pretty much dead. A friend of mine had one (a different brand) that I borrowed. It works really well.	positive
title: Fabulous [SEP] content: I read this book for the first time in sixth grade for a book report. It soon became one of the few books that would burn in my memory for a long time. It took two hours of reading a day to finish in time for the book report, but it was well worth it.	positive
title: I love it! [SEP] content: I love lattes but hate to spend over $3 for one at a coffee shop. I already had an espresso machine without an attached frother so I decided to see if I could find a portable, non electric one on Amazon! Thank you Amazon for leading me to the Aerolatte. I purchased the original one first that I used at home, at work, and at our camper. I then bought the black To Go one to use at home and take to our camper on the weekends. I leave the original at work. My daughter-in-law and sister loved the lattes I made for them so I bought both of them one for Christmas. They love them! Plus, I try to eat healthy most of the time and having a warm latte made with decaf espresso, fat-free milk, sugar-free carmel flavoring for only 90 calories is such a treat and very filling! Need I say more?	positive
title: It's the best [SEP] content: It's been forty years and still no other work comes close. This is the standard. I would love to see someone do something that is as good, using Arabic script instead of phonetics. In the meanwhile, this will continue to receive my highest recommendation.	positive
title: Unexpected pleasant surprise! [SEP] content: We are very happy with the headphones. We can have people who are hearing impaired hear the TV, and computer without blasting out the other people in the room! Yea! Worth the price and value!	positive
title: Insightful and honest... [SEP] content: This book is great not only for sales people to understand how to navigate sales organizations, but also for those who deal with the sales process to know how you can help, what your role can be, and when there are problems. Part philosophy and part guidebook, I would recommend this to all of my friends and family as we are all, in the end, in sales. Some sell products, some sell ideas, some sell themselves for a job. This book applies to all of them.	positive
title: Pleased [SEP] content: I have this and the 2000 Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas cut. Both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, I'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound... the old style.	positive
title: The Best Simpsons EVER... [SEP] content: I love this collection. Nothing is better than "Clown College". Best freakin' episode ever. I'm really surprised I didn't get this box set first. Get it. Enjoy!	positive
title: A Must for Those Who Care [SEP] content: "Talking with Children about Loss" is the first book I would recommend to anyone who cares about grieving children. It is well-written, easy to understand, and easy to learn from and implement. Wish I'd found this book long ago.	positive
title: A VERY BEAUTIFUL BIBLE [SEP] content: VERY NICE,VERY COLORFUL SOMETHING WILL ENJOY WITH THE GRAND CHILDREN FOR A VERY LONG TIME .... PRAISE THE LORD JESUS	positive
title: As warm and colorful as the author's garden [SEP] content: Very affectionate as memoirs go, as the author's appreciation of San Miguel grows with the passage of 15 years. We see nervous visitors develop increasing resourcefulness as they become contented residents, while they introduce us to a parade of beguiling acquaintances. Familiar ground to those who love Mexico already, a worthy introduction for others curious why we do.	positive
title: Works well, after getting used to the band [SEP] content: The headset works well, after you get used to the odd headband, which sits in front of the ear pieces, and as such on normal headsets. You need to get comfortable with putting the band farther back on your head than you instinct may be... to keep if from falling forward.. but then it goes well.The only issues I have is the long chord, the cable wrap is just too heavy, so I took it off, and now I've got this ueber long cable to get tangled up in things. And the other issue has nothing to do with the headphones, but the fact that the laptop or computer doesn't always have the properly colored connectors, so always having to find the right plug to fit in the right socket for mic vs speakers is a pain.	positive
title: Introducing women's 'vows' in Bengal [SEP] content: This book takes on the complex role of vows made by women throughout the Indian subcontinent, but focusing on Bengal. The author explains simply and clearly the phenomenon of the vow and its significance and empowerment of women and goddesses in Hinduism. the stories behind the vows are fascinating and worth reading the book just to learn about them. What I liked about _Making Virtuous Daughters and Wives_is that it easily understood by those who have had little or even no background in the scholarship of Hinduism or women and religion.	positive
title: Angels & Demons by Dan Brown [SEP] content: I have read several of Mr Brown's books and enjoyed them all. Loved the DaVinci code but then someone suggested Angels and Demons. So I gave it a try. Easily one of the best books I have ever read. The storyline was interesting and believable. I love the way his stories unfold piece by piece. Would gladly reccomend this book to any and all.	positive
title: Judaism reinterpreted for the modern age [SEP] content: Fromm, a radical humanist (and a nonbeliever in God) still writes in the great Jewish tradition of optimism and of belief in human potential. Fromm had an excellent traditional Jewish upbringing, and although more traditional thinkers will disagree with his conclusions, they are at least well grounded in Old Testament texts.The book is a bit dated in that one of its intellectual underpinnings is the belief that human beings can perfect themselves through self-understanding, specifically through psychoanalysis. The twenty-first century has not been charitable to that conclusion.	positive
title: A great mix of ki ho'alu [SEP] content: A good mixture of different styles of slack key. My favorite is the first number, "Steal Away", that has a great classicak uke solo by Dennis Kamakahi. Panini Pua Kea is also great, recalling the Sons of Hawaii. Their version of Palolo, though, pales in comparison to the one by the Ka'au Crater Boys.	positive
title: Far Out! [SEP] content: What a little gem, and at a bargain price!! Originally released in 1970, at the dawn of the "progressive rock" era, this instrumental recording is short on the pomposity that marred alot of stuff from that time, but is high on whimsy and laid-back, otherworldly atmosphere. Lots of cheesy organ and fuzz-box guitar, along with tribal drumming. I'm gonna have to play this one on Halloween night - it'll be perfect.	positive
title: Up-to-date information on food sensitivities [SEP] content: Food Allergy Field Guide: A Lifestyle Manual For Families offers practical, "reader friendly", up-to-date information on food sensitivities; advice on reading labels, grocery shopping, eating out for those with food allergies; tips on emotional, social and psychology considerations stemming from food allergies; pointers for parents on helping their food allergy sensitive child to enjoy parties, field trips, and outings; how to detect hidden food allergies; one hundred kid-tested and approved recipes along with valuable cooking advice; and an extensive resource list. Food Allergy Field Guide is a "must" for anyone who must deal with food allergies for themselves or members of their families -- especially their children.	positive
title: Lindsays Rule OK -- but they cheated [SEP] content: CUSTOMER in Maui is right: this is a DDD upsampled ('enhanced') to SACD! One expects better from a 2000 recording by ASV.I still like the recording/performance inmensely, but I'm withdrawing a star, because the DDD origins of the recording are well-hidden from the buyer: a little DDD on the disc itself, and another on the box back; SUPERAUDIO is blazoned all over....	positive
title: The hippest new music around! [SEP] content: I love this music, it is so upbeat and fun! My kids and all my friends just love it too. This is the kind of music that attracts all age groups. I hope to see a lot more of this band in the near future.	positive
title: Nice polish [SEP] content: I did some price shopping on this item and saw it described in other places as "bright pink" with "subtle pink and purple micro shimmer". Well the micro-shimmer is so subtle you pretty much cant see it. This is a beautiful color dont get me wrong. Just keep in mind it is more of a DEEP pink rose color.Not Bright pink. And it has what they call a creme finish.I am an OPI fan, it lasts (on your nails) a good while. I dont know that it lasts the longest. I'm off to try China Glaze next.If you need a pink bright enough to stand out when going out yet tame enough for work i think this is a great medium.	positive
title: Perfect Angel is devilishly good [SEP] content: It's hard to believe that the most well known track on this album is the weakest. That notwithstanding this album is as near perfection as one could imagine or hope for. I bought a vinyl copy some 30 years ago and it still enthralls and moves me. The production, lyrical content and execution is a shining beacon in the wastelands of modern day R+B. Like all Perfect Angels you are a comet amongst the stars Minnie, still dazzling us with your brightness years after you passed by and long after other stars have faded	positive
title: recommended [SEP] content: Nice novel-had a satisfying feel at the end. I liked that the main character cobbled together a living. Lots of people put together a life in odd or disparate ways but you don't often find them in novels. I found this novel a convincing evocation of a certain kind of urban life.	positive
title: Great follow up to "Rich Dad Poor Dad" [SEP] content: This book is a fantastic sequel to "Rich Dad, Poor Dad". While the first Rich Dad book laid a great foundation and provided some high level direction, this book took what I had learned and added to it. There are some repeat "lessons" but they tend to go more in depth and have different examples that help me have a better understanding of the concept. In one of the books RTK uses an example of the financial education that you need to be financially free and compares it to the foundation of a building. These books are helping me lay that strong foundation.As a side note, I listened to the audio CD version of this book and the only things I didn't like were the speakers voice (very robot-sounding) and the fact that every time he mentioned a particular quadrant, he had to say both the letter and name of the quadrant... this got a bit tiresome and a bit Sesame Street sounding (ie "B, Business", "I, Investor").	positive
title: Best I've ever bought! [SEP] content: I love this opener without reservation ! I have arthritis in my hands and it's a breeze to use for me. As nothing on the opener touches the food it stays clean which was a big issue for me. I didn't like having to use two different openers for my dog food and people food or having to wash openers your not suppose to wash. The little jaws on the side to grasp and pull off the top is ingenious and works very easily. Since it separates the lid from the can by what looks like releasing the glue I've never noticed any debris or shavings of any sort in the food. I will never use any other opener as long as these are on the market as the quality is also excellent.	positive
title: Gorilla Gripper is a handy tool [SEP] content: I have used the Gorilla Gripper for a couple of weeks now. It make carrying sheet goods much easier. It grips very well when used as directed. Example: With a piece of sheet goods setting on the floor on the edge, place the gripper half way of the lenght, pick up as shown on the instructions and you can easly carry the piece with one hand. Money well spent, especially if you are working by yourself or carrying 3/4" sheet goods which are heavy.DLB	positive
title: Quick miss spelled word corrector. [SEP] content: I just got mine a few hours ago, so I'll just hit the high points here.1. Multifunctional2. Cheap!3. It took me one minute to get it going, (with one eye on the instructions and the other on the keyboard.) I got it right the first time.CONS:(There are some, but nothing of concern)1. If you were four years old, (skinny fingers) you could use the keyboard like a typewriter. As an adult, if you line up all four of your fingers on both hands--squeeze them together--they are still too big to type on it.--but so what, you knew it was small before you bought it.2. 500,000 words would have been a lot better for me instead of 110,000 words. (getting an update for a couple of bucks, from the company, with another 2 or 3 hundred thousand words- would have been nice. I didn't get it for the games or SAT's--I would rather have had the addition words.But did I forget to mention it's CHEAP!...EASY TO USE!...WORTH IT!?BYE!	positive
title: unforgettable [SEP] content: i read this book a very long time ago, and still think about it as baffling. it gives extreme insight into a culture the educated will never experience.it is very well written, the character, ruth's, ways are heavy as narrative. i can't even begin to explain this book, now that i think about it. it is a must read.	positive
title: Absolutely Addictive [SEP] content: I was totally enthralled and can't wait for season Four. It was historically accurate and I loved the fashions. They were so elegant. Very interesting saga. Well developed interesting characters.	positive
title: A Role-Play Specific Doll - Great for the Ballerina Baby Girl [SEP] content: This was another Christmas gift for our 3-year-old daughter, who began taking ballet lessons this past fall. She was very specific about the Barbie she wanted, and it was this one.The Barbie is very articulated (knee and foot positions) which is probably better enjoyed by the older ballet and Barbie fan. Our daughter is younger and has more fun with Kelly spinning to the music, and the fact that one can hold Barbie by the crown on top and spin her as well. The ballet barre and bag haven't caught her eye; it's the dancing Kelly. Because the ballet shoes are molded onto both dolls' legs, these cannot be dressed up like other Barbie and Kelly dolls. These two beautiful dolls are specific to the ballet role-play.	positive
title: Wonderful end of the book [SEP] content: What an incredible series this was. I still wouldn't call it perfect, but it is up there among the best 3 or 4 fantasy series of all time. Frankly, at least for now it would be 2 or 3 on my list. No, it's not perfect, but it was outstanding, and kept me going throughout. I finished the entire series in a week, and now can't wait to start the next set - though I may have to put it off for a brief bit while I attend to other things.As always, the dialogue is masterful, the pacing was good. I definately recomend this to any and everyone.	positive
title: Interesting facts presented [SEP] content: I read aloud to first and second graders. I am always looking for a different type of book to keep their interest. I have not read this to them yet, but I plan to shortly. I this book is not only interesting, but interactive with their young minds.	positive
title: Nuncrackers [SEP] content: bought this as xmas gift so don't know how the receipent likes it yet, but she's a big fan of Rue's so I'm sure she'll love it.	positive
title: This Book is a Classic [SEP] content: I cannot believe this book would be out of print. It is a great children's classic; the story is capivating, and I loved how Stover was able to give the dolls their own personalities. I wish this book was a required book in elementary school.	positive
title: Great CD (and easy to play) [SEP] content: This is a great CD, and was extremely easy to play. I don't know what all these other reviewers (if it is indeed more than one reviewer) are talking about. It easily played on both my stereo at home and my car CD player.	positive
title: Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews "The Marcos Dynasty" [SEP] content: This book by Sterling Segrave is a very nice modern history of the Phillipines. Starting with the Second World War the book brings the reader nearly up to date on events which have ocurred in the Phillipines since that time.An investigative journalist who was raised in the Orient, Sterling Seagrave tells the story of the Marcos regime bluntly with no glossing over of the rough edges. All in all it is a delightful read.	positive
title: Tool works great [SEP] content: What can I say it's a tool. Does what a tool does. It enabled me to adjust my weedeater from a piece of useless junk into a good yard tool. Thanks	positive
title: Innovative To Say The Least [SEP] content: Picture yourself back in 1989. You are in a music store thumbing through the "N's" you come across this particular CD and think to yourself, "Who are these guys?, Nine Inch What?, Pretty Hate What? I don't think so..NEXT!!". You probably weren't alone. It amazes me that this album is this old. If you put it into context with other releases from artists of the era will you realize that this album was released before "Violator" - Depeche Mode, just four months after "Disinigration" - Cure. It's really a tribute to how innovative this album is musically. This is truly a must have for music fans everywhere. I mean, how can you not own this album? The keyboards riffs are just great as for the synthesizers. This is my favorite NIN album. I think that's a consensus with many of the other reviewers. If you only buy one NIN make it this one. It's well worth it.	positive
title: A Must Buy [SEP] content: Nice cd.....all songs except a few r good and meaningful....Broken and Home stand out ....Home has got great lyrics "In My eyes u c the pain/with each lie i take the blame......"Buy it its a must if you are into rock with emotional lyrics...overall this cd is a 5 on 5... they could hav got better songs than soulfire and back up....these songs r jus ok....running outa pain is a good emotional song...The Way I Feel is another senti song which gets kinda hard in the verse .."coz i hate the way i feel tonight and i know i need you in my life...." ...Paul Walker has done an amazing job with the vocals but the bass and lead guitaring is so so compared to other bands like element 80 etc. Also get Let GO by 12 stones from the album daredevil	positive
title: Very good writing, predictable plot. [SEP] content: As others have said, the book is beautifully written. Both in the magic realism sections and the faux English ones. This almost disguises the fact that the plot is predictable and telegraphed rather too early in the book. But not quite.	positive
title: Genius without question and totally unique [SEP] content: I'm not a big fan of artists that rely on sampling to create their music, but Beck isn't relying on it for lack of creativity. He truly evolves the art of sampling and transforms it into something new. It is particularly impressive how he blends numerous styles that would at first seem conflicting, but he combines them in such a way as to be undeniably successful.	positive
title: For Those who have a devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus [SEP] content: This little book is a treasure of inspiring quotes, lessons and teachings for those who wish to grow in love and devotion to the Sacred Heart. St. Gertrude is taught by the great Teacher and shares what she has learned from Him. I have learned much and been unable to put it down. It is beautiful. I recommend it to any Christian who loves Jesus and wants to grow in that love and devotion.	positive
title: The Best ever [SEP] content: Jericho is the best show I have ever watched and it gives us a glimpse of what could come...I rate this series a ten. My husband and I are so disappointed that the show was canceled after the second series.Jake is my hero....	positive
title: Just started taking it [SEP] content: I just started taking this yesterday. I read the review about the proper way to take it (with food and a ton of water) and am sticking to that and haven't had any negative side effects mentioned in the other reviews. I took it once in the morning and once at night and again this morning. The first 2 pills made me feel really warm almost immediately. I was expecting this a little but it was more than I was expecting. I feel ok though after taking the one this morning. I'm hopeful that it'll help rev my metabolism and help me break this plateau for additional weight loss but it's too early to tell yet.	positive
title: Great Romance with REAL Family Values [SEP] content: There are many reasons to like this book, but my favorite aspect is that it shows a non-traditional family full of love and respect. Three orphaned boys find a little girl in a trash pile and band together to raise her as their sister. The romance element of the book is good, as well as the part where Mary Rose finds her biological father, but the relationships of Mary Rose and her four unconventional brothers are what make this book a must read.	positive
title: "NBC Beijing 2008: Opening Ceremony" -- [SEP] content: The title should be sufficient clue for those paying attention: it is the NBC presentation of the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony. Which means it is the presentation one watched (or not) on TeeVee when NBC originally boradcast it.What stumps me is why those who give it negative reviews expected something other than that it is clearly labeled as being: "NBC Beijing 2008: Opening Ceremony," complete as NBC broadcast it.	positive
title: Nirvana's Incesticide [SEP] content: This is Nirvanas 3rd album.Its some of their more early stuff.Its got at least 5 really great songs on it. The picture on the cover is something that I think is pretty cool. The name is a little wierd but its from Nirvana so youve gotta love it.There is a remix for the song Polly on this cd which is a great song off their earlier cd Nevermind.The best song on the whole cd is Anyerism which has cool lyrics and sounds great.This isnt the best cd from Nirvana.In Utero is the best cd they ever made but its from Nirvana so I like it.Its worth your money.	positive
title: Outstanding movie...who knew? [SEP] content: If you are seeking an hour and a half of great entertainment, watch this movie. It's an intelligent, energetic, upbeat caper movie, with lots of twists. I had never heard about it, but came across it by browsing on Amazon, and the online reviews convinced me to try it. The characters are appealing, the action is steady, and you never know what's coming next. Even the music has a beat.Hurrah for little-known Canadian movies!	positive
title: Jerry Lewis is as nutty as can be [SEP] content: This is a hilarious movie.It's one of those films that the whole family can enjoy.When I watched this movie I LOVED it! So buy this movie and bring on the laughs!!!	positive
title: The long wait is over! [SEP] content: Finally! It only took 20 years! Jeez! If this release is as good as it looks, this is going to be a Godsend to the people who have been sentenced to what little has been released in the past!! I look forward to October 26th, which coincidentally, is 3 days after Johnny Carson's birthday!! I can hardly wait!!!!	positive
title: Review: Ghosts of the Rich and Famous [SEP] content: As with all Mr. Myers' books, this is a well written account of supposedly haunted dwellings -- in particular, those of famous folk. He draws no conclusions, which gives his tome an air of journalistic honesty. Very interesting, somewhat spooky in places, and quite entertaining.	positive
title: Can't go wrong [SEP] content: This really is yoga for everyone. I would suggest it for those who want to really get into yoga. It's got a wealth of information, lots of detail in the yoga practices, and lots of different routines. It is great how much is on this one video.	positive
title: Gory yet beautiful, not as good as the others. [SEP] content: I was very happy that Sita survived the stake. Even for my tastes, I thought the book was a little too bloddy, but I still wouldn't have written it any other way. I thought that Sita pushed Joel into being a vampire too much, but I liked that she saved him from a painfull death. Everything leads up to the climax in Eddie's house very well, and the next book follows precisely how it should	positive
title: first time parent ! [SEP] content: My baby loves to be here he can move by him self and do what ever he wants here love this product !!!	positive
title: Definitely Recommend [SEP] content: Lots of fun and very challenging for all ages. I only don't like the time it takes to set up the card's configuration and that the cars sometimes aren't stable enough on the playing surface. This is a very addictive game. Love it.	positive
title: When its great they take it away [SEP] content: I absolutely love this product, never had long fingernailsand using this I do. Of course now it can't be found.My sister is having the same luck with the product. Whyoh why is it gone.Unhappy in Kansas	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: I didn't think this game would be quite the hit that it is. My first graders love it. It is always their first choice when choosing games. I like how it is versatile. We can change how we play but the first graders are still learning. This game helps with word chunks, rhyming, reading, initial sounds, long vowels, short vowels and more. I recommend to all to buy this for your beginning reader -5year old to-average 6 year old to-struggling 8 year old.	positive
title: UN CUENTO PERECTO [SEP] content: Aunque toda la obra de Garcia Marquez es brillante, considero que Ojos de Perro Azul goza de las caracteristicas de un cuento perfecto. Es magico e inesperado. Transporta al lector a un mundo de ensueño que se va revelando sutilmente. Definitivamente, vale la pena leerlo, mas de una vez.	positive
title: Master Hardware Guide For All PC Hardware [SEP] content: This is a paper back "bible" for buying PC hardware of any type.You can read it at home and highlight or otherwise note your favorite choices. Then, when you are making your purchase(s) it is small and light enough to take along with you to help with your decision(s). From monitors to modems Mr.& Mrs. Thompson take you by the hand to advise and offer expert opinions in terms anyone will find easy to understand. The book is well written and is a must have for anyone buying computer hardware for a personal pc.	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: My wife and I are very happy with the Uniden TRU 5885-2 telephones and answering system. The sound on the handsets is like that on a wired phone; very clear. And they work flawlessly everywhere in our apartment. There is no loss of performance or static anywhere. Three speakerphones (each handset as well as the base) is a great convenience. Also,we find the ability to store 100 different numbers in each handset a plus; especially when they are used by two different people.The answering machine also has excellent sound and is easy to use. Was surprised to read that the message capacity is approximately ten minutes, and consider this a limitation. Most of the current machines have a capacity of 15 to 30 minutes. However, if we keep up with the answering machine on a daily basis, the ten minute capacity should suffice.	positive
title: Excellent for beginners! [SEP] content: I am 50 and this was my first Yoga. AM and PM yoga are so short (10min and 20min respectively) that it is hard to have an excuse not to do it! I saw immediate effect of PM yoga on my body. I slept better and the body was not stiff the next morning. Now I do PM yoga before going to bed. Both teachers talk in very soothing and claming voice that automatically calms your mind. I have many Yoga books on my shelf for some years, but this video is the first time I really did any Yoga! I highly recommend this tape to anyone interested in relaxation of body and mind. Namaste!	positive
title: Carmelo Anthony is the best [SEP] content: It looks like Carmelo Anthony sucks but he rocks. The best fade away shooter ive played with.	positive
title: The best books made. Ever. [SEP] content: I've read what most people call classics. The Tolkien series. 2001: A Space Oddessy, along with the stories that followed. But, Dan Simmons's Hyperion, along with the following Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion, blow every other book away. From the start of Hyperion to the end of The Rise of Endymion, this series will not let you stop reading. These books are magnificent.	positive
title: Sturdy but grips move. [SEP] content: PROS: I weigh 185 lbs. and these bars support my weight with absolutely no problems.CONS: The grips do not stay in place. They slide back and forth, which can get annoying when doing extended exercises.	positive
title: A Thousand Kisses Deep [SEP] content: Makes a perfect gift for yourself or that special person.Botti's music is moving. A Thousand Kisses Deep is onepiece where Botti seduces the audience with the perfecttone and extraoridinary tunes of his saxophone.	positive
title: Fun interesting story! keeps you engaged [SEP] content: We rented this on Amazon Prime last night on a whim (via our Roku). What a pleasant surprise!!! The movie is well done, and the story couldn't get much more bizarre. I love how the filmmaker shows objectively both sides of the story. I don't want to ruin the plot for you, but overall this isn't your typical documentary. It's really entertaining, and miss Joyce Mckinney is the star :)	positive
title: Buffy goes to college [SEP] content: Many BUFFY fans say the 4th season with Riley and his initiative is the weakest of the lot,but I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that that the good stuff outweighs the,um,not so interesting.I,myself,find the iniative thing kinda lacking but,hey,there are great episodes here and the growth of the characters is fun to watch.HUSH is positively creepy in ways BUFFY has never been before.Plus Faith returns to wreak havok.The picture and sound are great,although there is a note from Joss explaining why these episodes aren't in widescreen and apologizes for the crummy episode!.I wonder which one he means?Oh well,this season is still well worth your time.	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: These DVD's are wonderful. The scenery is fantastic and the music is well done. I use them for riding my stationary bike and they make my workout 100% more enjoyable.	positive
title: Can one really be THAT good? [SEP] content: Probably yes, but it made me feel miles off!The format of the book, with different colours print to differentiate between the narrator and Marjorie Hinckley's words made it easy to read. It was uplifitng and interesting. The topical lay-out worked well. Such a cute lady!Personally, I found it slightly distancing that Pearce wrote about herself in the 3rd person. 1st person would have personalised the content more but that's a minor point.	positive
title: clean cuts [SEP] content: cuts real clean some other blades i bought before didn't cut real clean and smooth these blades do , grip feels nice too better than bamboo	positive
title: Best gift I ever received. [SEP] content: My husband gave me the Kindle for my birthday and it was the best gift he ever gave me (for my birthday). Even better than my laptop! I have arthritis in my hands so holding books has been painful for me. The Kindle is lighter and easier to hold than a book, and I am so happy to be able to read, read, read. Thanks, honey, for the wonderful 58th gift you've given me for my birthday. Now you all can figure out when I met my husband, and how old I am!	positive
title: Didn't know what I was missing [SEP] content: I have to admit that I really didn't think much about Johnny Cash until I saw Walk the Line. I always thought he was cool, but didn't know much about his music. After watching the movie I decided to pick up a "best of" type album. I definitely feel like I picked the right one. Man, he had a great voice and you get to hear him at the top of his game at different points in his career. If you like Johnny Cash, or are a little curious about his music, this is a great CD set. I defnitely recommend it.	positive
title: If Your Looking For A Good Crue Album... [SEP] content: Greatest Hits is the most suitable title for this album. Released in 1998, Motley Crue's greatest hits is a great compilation album for any die-hard Crue fan. On the album you'll find hits such as: Kickstart My Heart, Dr. Feelgood, and Smokin' In The Boys Room. If your into the heavier Crue stuff, you'll find hits such as Too Fast For Love, Looks That Kill, and Shout At The Devil! If your looking for a good variety of Motley Crue songs on a single album, then Motley Crue: Greatest Hits is the album for you.	positive
