title: The special effects were cool... [SEP] content: And that was about it. The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.	negative
title: bad vacume advance [SEP] content: had the dissy in my car and had lots of trouble with it at idle played with the cam and dissy settings with no luck, finally pulled it out and sent it off to be tested and got a report back that it was pulling on 40 degrees of advance at idle.had it adjusted and re curved for my application and now the problem is solved, Not very happy for what is meant to be a quality American product.I recommend if you purchase one have it tested and set to suit your application other wise you may have no end of troubles.	negative
title: Vulgar, distasteful, dumb [SEP] content: There's no doubt that Popa Chubby has a fair amount of talent, but "Booty & The Beast" suffers from guitar hero stylings and a lack of taste. The CD is just like Chubby's live shows-brash, outlandish, and just short of the type of thing that could give New York City a bad name in the blues forever. Avoid at all costs.	negative
title: Chalk another one up for DOA [SEP] content: Like most of the other 1-stars here, this review is for Amazon's terrible packing and the apparent flimsiness of the product. Unfortunately, I never received an unbroken skillet. On the bright side, 5 stars for Amazon's excellent handling of returns.I ordered the skillet and received it via 2nd day UPS with a 2-inch crack down the side. I returned it and received its replacement via next-day FedEx with the handle broken clean off. Aren't these things supposed to last decades? At this point, Amazon seems to want to cut its losses and refund my purchase price.ATTN: Amazon-- Maybe it's cheaper to spring for better packing materials than having to pay for return shipping and trashing tons of these skillets?Based on this product's noted propensity to break either during shipping or during use-- and in light of its notably skinny handle-- you may want to spring for thicker, slightly more expensive cast-iron cookware.	negative
title: Fans of this book [SEP] content: I can't resist any longer, I must finally just state it baldly: conservatives are borderline illiterates. The reviews of this book have made it so clear. Poor spelling, punctuation and grammar: loved it. Good spelling, punctuation and grammar: did not love it. Does this matter? Well, as it indicates a lack of little things like education and involvement in the world -- the real world, not A.M. radio -- I think it does. I promise I will take the conservative line seriously when it comes spelled and punctuated properly.	negative
title: Great Idea--unbelievably bad sound! [SEP] content: I ordered this game for the kids to play over the summer. With over 5,000 geography questions, I was looking forward to it myself! We were all very disappointed to discover that the sound was so bad that we couldn't understand the question most of the time. If you could understand Charlie Brown's teacher, then you'll love this game!	negative
title: Convert [SEP] content: Geza Vermes is a renowned scholar who seems to have focused on researching from his own psychological backgrounds. A former Catholic priest who converted to his parents Judaic roots, he seems to continue his efforts to process this experience through his scholarship. Unfortunately, his writing and exegesis are so clouded with his own hang ups, that they strain credulity.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!! [SEP] content: My 6 year old bought this seat with her own money. She was very excited when she saw how real it looked (on the box anyway). It is defintely the biggest piece of junk we have ever purchased!! The seat cover never stays on. Her doll which is 15 in long barely fits (cleary states on the box it is for this size doll). This could of been made so much nicer. It was a very cute idea but awful quality. Fisher Price should be ashamed to have their name on the product.	negative
title: blah, blah, blah [SEP] content: Spoiler alert - if you saw "Full Impact" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. Not even close.	negative
title: Several hundred pages of fluff... [SEP] content: If you have no idea what you're doing get this book. It does a good job of summarizing the apps in SBS. If you want hard core, real-world examples and tips look somewhere else...if I knew where I'd tell ya.	negative
title: No story resolution [SEP] content: This story was about as deep as one of those bars of hotel soaps on the cover. I didn't give a cr*p about any of the characters or their neurosis'. The ending provided no resolution to the 1 of the 2 main storylines. The author also wasted to many pages talking from the perspective of an in-utero & newborn. Reading this, I thought I was projecting myself into one of those "Look Who's Talking" movies. Waste of time.	negative
title: I think I will by buying another cupcake book [SEP] content: I bought this booking thinking WOW! With 500 recipes how could I ever want another book? I have tried 2 of the recipes (buying special ingredients from the grocery specifically for these recipes) and I was very disappointed. The cupcakes came out dry and course. I followed the recipe perfectly and I really don't think I will try another recipe. However, there are some really good ideas in this book. I really wanted to make the Key Lime Cupcakes this weekend so I made white cupcakes from a box mix and then followed the directions for the filling and frosting from the book - they turned out great! I'm sure I will use some ideas from this book, but probably not try to make another recipe from scratch.	negative
title: Fantasy and dangerous [SEP] content: This book is a fantasy and dangerous. Most of the items on this book and all of Buscaglia books are fantasy. Yes, Leo kind of acknowledge that it is wishful thinking what he is talking about but that statement is meant for you to let down your guard. And if what he said is able to pass into your subconscious mind, it can be very dangerous. As his book has many trojan virus that if pass into your subconscious mind can wreck havoc. Just as a computer virus can wreck havoc to your computer system, so can Buscaglia mental virus within his book. I will give you an example of a virus in his book. One of the book point was "Learn to trust again" and "Love trust". If that one point was able to by pass your conscious mind defense and into your subconscious mind, it can wreck havoc to your human computer (Mind). And there are many more virus within his book. Be wary of Buscaglia book readers.	negative
title: at the end [SEP] content: when this was 1st released on vhs back in the 90s i bought it then i bought it again but now its not what it used to be its so dated their is nothing much to it, they stand in the same place playing the same songs that they did on every dvd after this - when this came out it was something cool that they have made a live vhs cause all that were available just a song from london and that was live as well, but now its clearly a dvd to cash in cause they look tired in every other dvd	negative
title: Lousy Customer Service [SEP] content: Can't say how good a GPS this is. After I plugged it in to be updated, I get a message No Maps Found. TomTom customer service is absoutely lousy. I've been able to learn to where and how to return this defective TomTom One. The company is not standing behind it's product, and neither is Amazon.	negative
title: Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati [SEP] content: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read "Into the Wilderness" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author.	negative
title: Fragrence Review [SEP] content: The product is fine. The scent a little weak. The bottle is not a shape that is easy to use. Possible a little pricey.	negative
title: "Not in stock" [SEP] content: "Not in stock" is what I always eventually hear when trying to get this product, a-f-t-e-r, of course, I complete an order and have been waiting a week. This product is no longer being made! I put together a state of the art computer in 2004 using this leading edge ram, made by Kingston no less, and it is now no longer made!!! Spend half a grand on a computer and throw it away in 6 years!Beware, if you are lucky enough to get something at a premium from some collector then make sure you realize that it comes as a kit that contains (2) sticks of 1 GB ram. Not every vendor understands this and may only send you half of the kit (1 GB stick of ram).	negative
title: easy set up [SEP] content: Nothing could be easier to set up than this remote and very easy to operate.Support is there with a phone call for missing codes, fully programmable and a learning remote as well. My main beef is this thing is a pig on batteries!Hyper sensitive for example while watching a movie the remote well turn on from the vibrations of the sub woofers and the remote is sitting on a pillow. If the remote is on a coffee table any one walks into the room the remote will turn on. While it is only on for 10 secs. it still is on and off constantly. Sent an e-mail to Universal Electronics on a way to reduce the sensitivity but received no responce, which I translate to meaning "not possible" Buyer beware and perhaps wait for the next model and perhaps this problem will be corrected.	negative
title: Not a Rabbit on it. [SEP] content: I ordered this because I collect Spode rabbit dishes. There is no rabbit on the one I was sent. It has quail and ducks. No rabbits. Yet rabbit is the first word in the title. The Rabbit Lady	negative
title: Do not buy it! [SEP] content: Got the battery with the docking station. I only got three pictures before it went low. I have had no luck with it keeping a charge past one picture since.	negative
title: Buyer Beware, Not What It Looks Like [SEP] content: Recently I cancelled my cable connection after seeing that I could save $35 a month by just buying this book and using it instead. What I got was really disappointing, it doesn't even have Facebook inside it. My kids are now restless at night because they can't see their friends' pictures and updates. My wife isn't too happy either, this book hardly mentions anything about celebrities. This is really misleading and I am contacting the publisher. If you are looking for the whole Internet ON PAPER then look elsewhere, don't buy this!	negative
title: Misleading [SEP] content: This product is very misleading. The commercial is so misrepresentative of the product. Nothing about this product is fun. The directions are hard to interpret and the "arm" itself could not crush a cottonball. Poor packaging. I would not recommend this toy for anyone.	negative
title: Not as described [SEP] content: I tried this on Dr. Brown, Playtex & Avent. It doesn't fit it any of these 3 brands. Not recommended.	negative
title: cheap [SEP] content: great series but cheap packaging wish i knew had crappy packaging would not have bought; will have to buy dvd cases to put in or have to replace the dvds eventuallyStargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection	negative
title: For the rest of us... [SEP] content: Any book from InstallShield will target, market and promote the use of InstallShield's packaging tools. I've found the range of books from InstallShield to only contain approximately 30% of useful material for those not contemplating using InstallShield's development tools.The only book which had a generic focus on Windows Installer has been Mike Gunderloy's book. I say "had" because it is no longer in print.If you are not planning to commit your investment in Installshield's products, I would not recommend any book from InstallShield Corporation given cost and the overall content which will be applicable to your MSI development efforts.	negative
title: What a load of crap! [SEP] content: This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!	negative
title: Not Free SF Reader [SEP] content: Realware is nowhere near as much fun as the other three books in thewhole Ware series. The theme and tone have changed considerably.You get a feelgood romance thrown in there for no real apparentreason. The Realware of the title is the technology to be able to makewhatever you want, basically. Chuck in some aliens and other dimensions.	negative
title: Disatisfied [SEP] content: I didn't like it because it will not allow you to bookmark a page so that you can continue where you left off. Plus it will not allow you to highlight anything so that you can go back and review it later. It's pointless to read anything because of the two reasons mentioned earlier. This is the earlier version. From what I understand the later version will let you do these two things.	negative
title: Problems right away! [SEP] content: Well, we put the elliptical together, that was not bad. Except, the computer won't turn on unless you disconnect and re-attach the power connection at the wheel each time. Then it turns on. However once it turns on, the resistance is very tight and although on the screen it LOOKS like the resistance decreases or increases, in fact it stays the same, which is way too difficult for me being a beginner. I barely can walk on it.....So something is very obviously wrong with the system and the computer...So i will call customer servie tomorrow and if they are of no assistance i guess i do a total exchange with Amazon...oh how much fun will this be????	negative
title: Honestly one of the worst books I have read [SEP] content: This is by far one the worst books I've ever read, it was a waste of about four hours of my life. The characterization is decent, but with the differences between them, it's hard to believe that they are friends in the first place. Also, the idea of the bulimic girl who is best friends and best enemies with this spoiled b*tch is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs. Read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants instead.	negative
title: a bad book [SEP] content: just looking that the preview that's available i can already tell that this is a bad book. some of the drawings look like kindergarten drawings or chicken scratch. stay away from this book.	negative
title: Look Elsewhere [SEP] content: Programming is very time consuming and can get down right frustrating. And the extra price for the useless remote control is silly. Come on, who seriously uses a remote control when you can just reach up & push the buttons or turn a knob, especially while you're trying to drive safely. Quality of the sound however is quite good, but then again most radidios in this price range are worthy of quality speakers, such as the SR60's from BA that are in my car. This radidio really, really needs a SD memory card slot. Even a USB slot would have been acceptable, but I hate having a wire flopping around from my I-Pod.	negative
title: MUST READ [SEP] content: Hi! I did not read this book yet but my close friend Brandy said that THIS BOOK IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!I have a baby now who is 6 months old and the method described in this book looks very interesting. Also, sounds like a hilarious read with some good facts about understanding your body. Nothing like a book with some good humor in it.PS- Brandy is pregnant!	negative
title: Another American Idol Miscalculation [SEP] content: There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards.	negative
title: Base started melting after a year [SEP] content: We liked this product very much at first, but it has not stood the test of time. After about a year we started smelling a burnt plastic smell when we used it. Now after another half year, the plastic base has begun to melt significantly. I opened it up and one of the power wires seems to be overheating. I'm going to buy another carafe, but not a Chef's Choice.	negative
title: Useless theories [SEP] content: This book lack proof big time. Most of what the authors say in this book are fallacies or opinions where we have to ask ourselves, "Is this really true?" or "Ahhh, this makes sense only because it is common sense." Without any knowledge of change management skills, half of the book is common sense.	negative
title: good timin [SEP] content: This dvd has the songs you remember as a teenager during this era. All the wilson brothers are together along with mike love. This dvd gives you a good feeling and can be watched time and time again. The dts sound is great and the picture quality is good.	negative
title: Massacred!!!! [SEP] content: I was so excited to finally find a piece by Torroba "Twelve Interludes" for guitar and string quartet that I never heard before but have been looking for for a long time. Unfortunatly, the performers totally massacre this work. They have sloppy playing through out and the recording is dead acoustically. What a disapointment.	negative
title: For conoisseurs only! [SEP] content: As a non native English speaker and a former student in languages, I consider myself a pretty good speller. But I know that some people find English spelling really frightening. Unfortunately this is not a book for them.It is for people who master well enough the language and can make distinctions between various forms and spellings of English. Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities.	negative
title: worst shoe polish ever used. [SEP] content: i don't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating. it gives the shoes a nasty, rusty, ashy look with very minimum shine. it may be ok to use for primary coating, but not for top coating. i foolishly bought 3 of them, based on the positive feedback, and obviously i'm stuck with it because i don't use them.	negative
title: Not a real trooper... [SEP] content: This movie is Ok, with some fresh humor, but most of it is just plain old "shock humor". The plot and storyline is poor, and the actors are average at best. But, it's still is better than "Serendipity"!!	negative
title: Musical Kleenex [SEP] content: Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, "Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew." I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's "The Orange Album" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone.	negative
title: Not worth the price [SEP] content: Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.	negative
title: By a CD player that is reliable and will last [SEP] content: I had wanted a CD player that would play lullabies for my son to help him relax and go to sleep. I returned this player 3 times before completely giving up on it. Every model I brought home failed to play an entire CD. It didn't matter whether it was sitting on a table or mounted on the side of the crib. It would stutter, skip, or just plain stop.For the same price, I bought a great little colorful Sony boom box with a ton of features that hasn't missed a beat. What's even better - it will be useful to my son when he is old enough to play his own CDs and carry it around - a much better investment.	negative
title: Not worth the trouble [SEP] content: This product is very weak, not very powerful and unsuitable for massage it is just a toy and I sent it back	negative
title: Mathematical techniques of extremely limited usefullness [SEP] content: The two stars in my rating are not so much a comment on quality (although it has all the glitter of a 1940's graduate math tome), but as a warning that it is likely to be of value to an extremely limited audience. I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it.	negative
title: Worked great but a lot were broken [SEP] content: I couldn't find clay targets anywhere so I looked online and found them here. The targets were exactly what I was looking for but I expected to get a lot of broken clays as I had read in other reviews. Sure enough I did. I only received about 40 of the 90 clays intact. I was able to salvage about 5 others that had simple breaks that I could glue back together with ease. Still, the shipping costs greatly decreased the value of the clays and then only half the clays surviving transport made the value even worse. I will still search out clay targets but I will not have them (at least this brand) shipped to me again.	negative
title: Cable doesn't work at all [SEP] content: Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.	negative
title: Not As Good As Gold Cup [SEP] content: It is oil and will probably work for most Spyders and Tippmanns but I would still recommend getting Gold Cup oil for only a couple dollars more. The Gold Cup is much better at lubricating than this oil.	negative
title: great until it breaks [SEP] content: We bought this when we got a puppy and our daughter started potty training. It was great with cleaning up messes from both. HOWEVER, after not using it for a few months, I pulled it out to steam our couch, and it no longer worked-it wouldn't spray. I followed directions posted in a review to clean out the tubes, but that didn't work (and I broke off a piece of plastic taking off a tube because the tube had glued itself to the plastic). At any rate, it seems the heat box was no longer working and was overheating, and the heat light was on no matter what. When I put it back together, it still wouldn't spray, and then I could smell the machine overheating. I chucked it. Now I'm looking for a larger steam vac that will do whole carpets and upholstery.	negative
title: Not all Americans are Evangelical Christians! [SEP] content: The title, Ping Pong: A Play about American College Life suggests that this play creates an impression of life in an American college. When one begins to read this dross, one quickly realises that the title should be changed to 'American College Life: An Evangelical Christian Extremist perspective'. The content is tedious, predictable, and unrepresentative of life in colleges in the U.S., and the whole plot can be summed up in a pamphlet. The anti-Semitic and unpleasant religious undertones are particularly disturbing. The book should be avoided.	negative
title: Dont waste your $$$$ [SEP] content: This was the second RoadPro unit that I tried, as the first one came to me as a previous return from another customer. Now I know why it was returned....don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk! Although the temperature part of this unit seemed to work fine, I was never able to get a calibration on the compass. tried several times, tried replacement battery, tried different mount positions, IT WOULD NOT WORK! I ended up going "old school" with a mechanical "bubble type" compass.	negative
title: Gauge Set? [SEP] content: I do not know how well this works, however, the picture and title indicates purchaser will receive two items. The title reads: "Malco FCMS Facing Gauge and Overlap Gauge Set." How can a "set" be only one? It is more than misleading, it is blatantly false if purchaser receives only one device.	negative
title: Very poor, not recommended [SEP] content: It sounded great and has great features, but manufacturing quality was horrible. The 'select' button didn't work most of the time, and the USB connector was very fussy.To make matters worse, it disconnected (bad USB connector) during download to my SD memory card and killed a $60 card.Then to add insult to injury, the customer service from RCA is absolutely awful. No phone support, very slow reply to email questions which led to a toll-call to a secret phone support number, during which the support person denied that the player could be at fault. When I asked to talk to her supervisor, she told me that no one there could help me.For fun, I tried to contact the corporate offices. They don't seem to exist.I would not recommend purchasing a Lyra, or anything else from RCA.	negative
title: probably the worst movie i ever seen in years [SEP] content: this movie is totall junk, bad act, bad plot, bad actress, even the nude and sex scenes are annoying. this tile should go directly go tho garbage can. keep your money and stay away from this crap.	negative
title: not what they say it is [SEP] content: I was so mad when I got the package. The name for it is "travelmate cas seat", well...there was NO CAR SEAT !!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth $78, if it does not include a car seat!!! I was BS!!!	negative
title: Antonio, definitely not Desperado! [SEP] content: Really, just because 2 women get it on in a bathroom stall doesn't make this a great, ground-breaking film. So what?Antonio, I love watching your more gritty or your more humorous films. This story line really doesn't compliment your diverse acting abilities and it only tends to pigeon-hole you to specific roles. Bad move.Didn't like the female star in this. All fluff and no substance.Isabow	negative
title: Not worth $10 [SEP] content: I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - unfortunately, I paid almost $50. For me, this is the worst PSP game released to date. The graphics reek - pixelated and foggy, I was surprised at how low the quality was. This looks and feels like a PS1 game.I'll tell you how bad I think this game is ... even Need For Speed Underground Rivals, is better. That's saying a LOT.Please understand, I'm not a Midnight Club fan. If you love the franchise, I imagine you'll like this game, and hey, to each his own. But if you're a Gran Turismo fan, and you're looking for a realistic racing simulation, sad as it is, Ridge Racer for PSP is still your best bet so far.	negative
title: ccccrrrrrraaaaapppp! [SEP] content: this album is junk. they shouldn't be allowed to carry the name Crematory after this. bought this on a gamble and crapped out big time. this is just European poser metal with keyboards thrown in just to really piss you off. this one angers me every time i see it. if you like keyboard slathered weak crap then this is for you. as a matter of fact you can have mine.	negative
title: rock quarry [SEP] content: We have bought three of these, and on all of them, the rock quarry doesn't work. How can this toy be still on the shelves if it doesn't work?	negative
title: Liars [SEP] content: I have a scatmat and orderd two more. After a couple weeks they canceled the order because they are "out of stock". I go to the store site and they are still in stock but the price is a lot higher than before.	negative
title: Just Plain Boring [SEP] content: What was that? The lack of quotation marks alone are enough to get on anyone's last nerve. I thought everyone learned how to use quotation marks back in the fourth grade, but Mr. Haruf obviously did not. The countless number of run-on sentences didn't help much either. I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days.	negative
title: I give up. [SEP] content: While I never thought the Wheel of Time series was anything utterly extraordinary, the first three or so volumes were a fairly good read. But now it's become clear that Jordan is just treading water: Path of Daggers is a bloated, boring, virtually plot-free attempt to keep the series from heading towards any kind of conclusion. This is the last one I'm reading, period.	negative
title: Amazon rip off [SEP] content: Don't buy this product from Amazon. I bought this product because I thought I was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead I received one. The picture that they have is very deceptive. It clearly showed 10.	negative
title: Full of inaccuracies. [SEP] content: There are some interesting technical details in this book, which might make it worth reading for a Titanic enthusiast.There are numerous contradictions in the book to known established facts. Stokers assaulting people with shovels for a place in the boats? Attempted stabbing of the radio operator for a life belt? Male passengers being shot? The bridge phone not being answered for minutes? Collapsible boats disintegrating immediately?I'm a good portion through this book, and I'm doubtful it's worth more of my time. It's an old book written in a different time, the price is right, but this is fiction.	negative
title: A real stupid book [SEP] content: One of the most boring and stupid books I`ve read in a long time. Full of ignorant remarks. From Mr Clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better "equipped" than the asian males, via people saying Comrade Doctor etc to each other in Russia, ten years after the Soviet Unions fall, to the "fact" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up.  Yes, and I spell terrible...	negative
title: Don't rely on the name... [SEP] content: This is my 3rd Rowenta and I'm very disappointed. I iron almost every piece of clothing for myself and the kids and need a realiable iron. I like the retractable cord and steam but after less than four months the leakage that everyone refers to started, what I didn't notice mentioned is that when it leaks it could leak VERY HOT water!Definitely not worth the investment as you'll end up wasting more time trying to scramble to get your clothes dry if you happen to get the iron to work for longer than a minute.	negative
title: OK Change From Metal Brushes [SEP] content: These have a very different feel from the metal brushes I have used, but they have some practical advantages.One minor downside on this particular set was that the end caps came off in my hands as soon as I started playing. They were very poorly glued on, but remounting with more and better glue solved this problem. I did not experience this with another set I bought.	negative
title: Do not buy unless you have to. [SEP] content: I got this for school, I thought it would be a good read. I was wrong. I could have passed the class without buying the book.	negative
title: Material and cut questionable [SEP] content: I have worn Levis for years. This style does not fit in a similar fashion to previous 569's. The material also feels extremely thin and not as durable as their previous lines. I would not recommend these jeans.	negative
title: Robbery [SEP] content: This is a horrible disc, all of the songs, save one or two, have been reworked. If your looking for a cd to hear bygone favorites, as they were originally done, this is not the disc.	negative
title: Dreadful! [SEP] content: They lose their "stick" basically immediately. I have on a new set that I literally just put on for the first time, and they are sliding down my back. Useless. Save your money!	negative

title: WAY WAY WAY too much sex [SEP] content: I'm no prude, but when a book needs to rely on sex every page or 2 it gets really tedious. Please. It isn't necessary for the plot. The participants were married for heaven's sake.	negative
title: Do not buy! Does not work properly! [SEP] content: I bought this secondhand in the hopes I would be able to see my small GB SP screen better. I was wrong. It took a lot of struggle to get the magnifier on. Once on, it flopped back down uselessly, and there was no way to tighten it.Do not buy! It's a waste of money! :(	negative
title: Junk [SEP] content: I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star.	negative
title: Charger ok, batteries not [SEP] content: The title says it all. Batteries drop the charge after a few days regardless of use. Older Eveready rechargables stay charged (with same charger) for many weeks. I won't trash the charger, but the batteries are useless for my camera application.	negative
title: Mac Owners Beware [SEP] content: My wife purchased a Rocket ebook for me for Christmas. She started here at Amazon. She carefully checked the Rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the Rocket. She was assured that everything required to use the Rocket with a Mac was included. Wrong! Any Mac currently being made or made during the past year or so requires a Keyspan connector between the e-book and the Mac USB slot. This costs $80. It is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. It took me more than an hour to get through to the company. At first they responded by saying it was at their Website and/or in the FAQ section, but we "went to their Web site together" while I was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public. The company does literature. Guide provided on the ebook. Regardless of how much I may eventually enjoy this toy, I'll never develop a high regard for NuvoMedia, which makes the Rocket ebook.	negative
title: Am I Nuts? [SEP] content: I purchased Good Night Moon for my baby Grandson. I thought this was the most over rated book ever. I told myself maybe I am old fashioned and remember the books I read to my children. after reading all of the reviews written in by customers, I finally found a couple of "Men" that see it my way. "Dad" and "Book Dad" hit the nail right on the head. I also think all of these people love this book because they think they have to like it for some reason. This Grandma can not recommend this book when there are so many better ones out there.	negative
title: A slow, tedious read [SEP] content: A friend recommended this book. I do not know why. My opinion: I found it to be a slow, tedious read, mainly because it contains many detailed descriptions about people, settings and situations irrelevant to the story - what I consider "filler" and a waste of the reader's time. I think the book could have been much shorter. Furthermore, the characters and plot were never believable. A college student helps new friends hide a murder with which he had no involvement, and then helps those friends commit another murder to help ensure the first murder - again, one in which he had no involvement - is not revealed. The author uses her characters to display her knowledge of language and literature. I guess she had to use it for something.No, I've never written a book and I probably never will. And, yes, it's easy to criticize someone else's work. Still, I did not enjoy reading this story.	negative
title: Didn't Work [SEP] content: Ordered this HDMI cable for my Roku streaming player. First time I connected the cable the picture had a lot of static. Went back to using the A/V cable that came with the Roku. Tried again later and the HDMI cable didn't work at all. I only paid $1.69, so it wasn't worth returning. Threw it away and bought a new HDMI cable from Best Buy and it works great.	negative
title: Expected so much and got so little [SEP] content: ...The battery doesn't stay charged, the phone goes dead in about 2 minutes and the reception is really bad. I love the way the headset fits and REALLY needed a phone like this...hopefully it will work good for me once I try the new battery. So far I feel pretty bummed that I spent so much money on this phone.	negative
title: Broke after 3 years [SEP] content: Totaly dead after 3 years. Nice picture and sound, but I expect something I spend over 1500 on to last much longer.	negative
title: really boring [SEP] content: don't buy this book if your in the USA... You wont understand any of it. It's for English, Irish, or whatever people... PASS	negative
title: Not true to size [SEP] content: I had to return the item because it was not true to size. There was no way, that this item was the size it was marked. I ordered an extra wide shoe, and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them, without them being loose on her. I wasnt happy at all.	negative
title: dissapointing customer service [SEP] content: never got the NATROL and the company cancelled the order. Tried to email customer services with no reply.	negative
title: Okay... [SEP] content: After reading a couple of Iris Johansen's books, I thought that this book would be entertaining and a fun read. My main complaint with this book was the lack of character development/relationship between Jane and Cira. Where was the connection? Just because someone has a close resemblance does not make them the same. I felt like Ms. Johansen began with a neat plot twist but let it get lost between the pages. I would suggest taking less time weaving a frayed "fantastic plot" and more time with actual character and story development.	negative
title: Internet connection required... [SEP] content: ...because no mention was made of that (by the manufacturers) they get my one star review.Here are the minimal system requirements so the rest of you don't buy a program that won't run on your system.1. Internet connection required.2. CPU; Pentium 4/ 2.4 Ghz single core processor3. RAM; 1 gig4.

title: Quirky Compared To 4-Port Hub [SEP] content: This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed.	negative
title: Kyle is Vile [SEP] content: The premise of this book is ridiculous -- since when is Raleigh, North Carolina, the "heart of Dixie"? But even more ridiculous: the notion of a memoir in which the author "made stuff up." Why did she have to do that? Because the truth wasn't interesting enough? In truth, even this exaggerated memoir isn't interesting enough, in large part because Kyle Spencer is too young to be writing a memoir and because she takes herself way too seriously and thinks way too highly of herself. Her delusions of grandeur are embarrassing to read. ("I pictured myself leaping onto some carpeted auditorium stage, preparing to accept the third consecutive Pulitzer of my young career.") And her writing is just plain bad. ("I thanked Susan B. Anthony for getting the women's lib ball rolling.") Her attempts at self-depracation ring false. Get over yourself, Kyle!	negative

title: Little Quack's New friend [SEP] content: What a rip off. I mean it was .01 but 4.99 shipping so money was made. This book has 3 pages all the rest have been ripped out and are missing. You can see where pages are missing. three pages is all that is left the story of the 3 pages make no sense. VERY UNHAPPYI want to send this junk back!	negative
title: DOES IT SHOW HIM SCOLDING THE BEAMING, GENUFLECTING FATHER ERNESTO CARDENAL?

I want to know before I throw down my twenty.DOes it show him during Mass telling the mothers of a youth soccer team massacred by the US backed contra to shut up and stop asking for prayers for their dead kids?THe Mass was supposed to have been in their memory.	negative

title: HE STOLE THE VOICE FROM BUCKET HEAD! [SEP] content: This is getting out of hand! I want my original Star Wars, mat pantings and all! I want Boba Fett's real voice, not a bad actors cheasy dub over! I don't want to see a digitized version of Harrison Ford's head dodge a lazer from Greedo's blaster! Hey, why don't we add Jar Jar Binks in the next release, he could be chewbacca's old friend, It would add continuity. What happened to George Lucas, he screwed up Episode 1, Episode 2, and most likely Episode 3, but why did you have to take this from everyone. Sure It's just a view changes, but it's the little things in life MAN! Common, I'm not gonna tell you it wasn't fun watching STAR WARS on DVD! It will always be one of those movies to unique to be qualified a "movie", well lets hope any way. Prey there are no signifigant Special effects advances within the next 10 years. I'd pay $100 for the original trilogy to be on DVD and so would 1000's of other people. JUST RELEASE THE ORIGINAL PLEASE, FOR THE FANS!	negative

title: We need George Irving [SEP] content: I have every Patric McManus audio tape performed by George Irving and they are a delight. I purchased this latest book on audio cassette. What's with the music (banjos) and southern "good ole boy" accented reading? I always thought that Idaho was north and west of the Mason Dixon line. This tape is a bust. I never fully realized what a talent George Irving has for bringing these stories to life. Please dont' tart up the tapes with music that doesn't fit the time frame or geographic area on which these stories are based.	negative
title: Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete [SEP] content: I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded.	negative
title: worst book ever [SEP] content: contains almost no illustrations or examples. No answer key either. Worst math book ever.	negative
title: Very basic [SEP] content: I didn't find much useful information in this book. It explained the obvious (don't weld in a hayloft - it might catch fire, etc.) but offered little meat on techniques.The author was apparently quite taken with a young lady welder - she appears frequently in the photos!	negative
title: Mis-titled and Crap [SEP] content: I recieved a Photoshop CS3 not Photoshop CS3 Extended.it was also a pirated version so i recieved no code to use it.	negative
title: A disappointing DVD [SEP] content: The "Sonic Christmas Blast" DVD consists of the Sonic Christmas Blast special (about 22 minutes long) and 3 Sonic Underground episodes. The Christmas episode itself seems like only a child would enjoy it (and probably a young adult that saw the special when it originally aired in the late 90's). The animation and plot is laughably simple and ridiculous.As for the 3 Sonic Underground episodes, they're terrible. Children might be confused by the sudden change of characters and plot when the Christmas special ends and the Underground episodes begin. Underground is a completely different series in which Sonic has a brother and sister and is on a quest to find their mother. The animation consists of moddy dark colors, the plot itself is a little dark (very much so for a children's cartoon) and in each episode Sonic and his siblings sing a terrible song that makes Barney seem like Pavarotti.If you're buying for kids, it may be a decent DVD. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.	negative
title: corny wack Movie [SEP] content: Ben Stiler is the kind of Cat that I can respect for keeping a Actign Hustle going,but His films are so fluffy&lame it hurts. Jack Black has Potential but is trapped into One trick Pony status as a Actor.this film is boring from start to finish&never reaches a point of hitting at what it was suppose to.	negative
title: Random Walk is dead [SEP] content: While the book is excellent and well written, random walk theory has been proven incorrect time and again. Academia now is shifting away from random walk. Professor Andrew Lo of MIT, for example, has done substantial work showing that technical analysis may be profitable. If the markets were random, this would not be possible. That said, this book was written before such work was available, and offers excellent insights. However, if you are looking for help in your trading and investing, try the technical analysis section.	negative
title: way too simple [SEP] content: This book is far too basic. Almost all of the book isabout very simple electrical concepts; the "hydroniccontrols" portions are only examples of these generalconcepts. I was greatly disappointed with the book --most manufacturer's web sites have much better andmore understandable descriptions.	negative
title: Typical Lindsey [SEP] content: This is a prime example of why I stopped reading Johanna Lindsey's books in the 80s. I would hazard a guess that her fans like to read the same story over and over and over and over. What else would explain the huge sales for her books, when they are virtually identical? This book is just like Fires in Winter, which is just like A Heart So Wild, which is just like... Well, you get the idea. Face it: Ms. Lindsey writes by template. She uses one plot, changing only the details such as names, places, physical characteristics. The first time she wrote the plot, it was great, then she wrote it at least 10 times in the 80s alone, and probably more than that in the 90s. It wears thin. But, hey, the masses apparently like endless repetition. Personally, I'd rather read a writer who bothers to try different plots, not one who writes a formula every time. If I could give all of her books no stars, I would.	negative

title: Overpriced cheap plastic crap [SEP] content: After spending over $80, what I got was a flimsy cheap plastic Chinese-made crap. It makes a very annoying high-pitched noise, and the power plug is proprietary, means you have to pay extra and buy from Panasonic if you ever lose it.I should've just spent $40 and get a Remington.	negative
title: Rumble Fish [SEP] content: Rumble Fish was not an exciting book.Infact it was horribe I would not recommend this book to any reader. This book was written for special minds. This book is about Rusty James and his brother moter cycle boy they think that they are all bad and all but they are not. they end up loseing it all in the end.	negative
title: More than reader can swallow [SEP] content: Barbara Freethy bit off more than this reader can swallow. Writing a dumbed down version of "Russia House," "Parent Trap," and Anastasia, the author actually has a great plot and story idea, but she didn't research, didn't build up enough detail and didn't enrich this with real characters. The plywood cutout characters failed to elicit any emotional attachment from me and the whodunnit aspect of the story was apparent from the beginning. I wanted to get lost in the prose and the story, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Such a good story idea. I miss Cold War stories and I wanted to love Julia as much as Hayley Mills (Parent Trap), but it was not to be.	negative
title: Waste of money [SEP] content: This book is a total waste of money. Very little information but alot of words. If you want to read a story buy this book but if you buy it for information save your money	negative
title: There goes a couple hours of my life [SEP] content: Dan Brown is not your author if you are looking for a thought-provoking book, or even a credible plot. This book can be a fun read, but it is (thankfully) forgettable.Readers can enjoy the scenery--although several of the scenes were unnecessarily graphic--just don't look too closely at the details!Even with plot holes and a high gross-out factor, I was enjoying the book right up until the end. The plot twist and plot complication completely lost me. I had a hard time believing the characters' motivations at that point.This book is not the best or most entertaining Dan Brown book available.	negative
title: Vo5 charged hair metal [SEP] content: Theres no denying Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible vocal range and Richie Sambora, unlike many 80's guitarists can really wail when he wants to. The first half of this album fares much better then the second half. Theres arena rock gems like "Let it Rock", "You give love a bad name" and "Livin on a Prayer". "Wanted:Dead or Alive" is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic. IT will make you grateful Kurt Cobain came along and destroyed this kind of spandex and Vo5 charged poodle hair metal. In any case the album does make you wonder how much you got to fork over for those girls in the album jacket to wash youre car.	negative
title: Thank god I got this from the library... [SEP] content: First the disclaimers: I only read the first 100 pages and I'm a pretty extreme left winger on social issues.I never imagined this book could be so awful. It is essentially a package to present mindless blathering on political issues and uses every canned cliche of the "liberal media." I couldn't finish it. I'm so irritated by this book I'm venting it out here rather than waiting a bit and crafting a more decent review.I really enjoyed the entire Ender series and generally have found OSC's other books at least passably readable. However, I seriously doubt I will ever consider picking up another of his books without first getting some glowing recommendations.	negative
title: TRY THIS [SEP] content: Put this DVD on, do NOT smoke any pot, snort anything, drink anything, etc. Then tell me what you think.	negative
title: Annoying heroine alert [SEP] content: Connie Mason books are often unpredictable. The hero is not a bad sort- really. He wants the dowry that would come with the woman but he is also somewhat of a decent type. When given the chance to cheat, he does not take it. The heroine is very annoying. All of the back and forth she does with I want you, I don't want you, I want you, I don't want you just killed this book for me. I could not get past it. I am all for strong heroines who stand up for their rights but she got rather ridiculous. I am affraid Ms. Mason overwrought her on that. Otherwise this book would have scored better for me.I would not recommend purchasing it. Go to the local library and see if they have it. It really is not worth the monetary expense.	negative
title: A piece of crap [SEP] content: it's a piece of crap, and not a product as described, i wouldn't buy this. it's not at all as the picture portrays,	negative
title: DOA [SEP] content: I have purchased after market batteries before. I know not to expect the battery life to be as long and the overall battery to last as long as the Cannon OEM, but I was not expecting it to be DOA. Maybe not all are like this and I just got one of the defective ones. I will not waste my money and buy another one.	negative
title: Please, do not waste your money! [SEP] content: I've got it very fast and was very dissappointed.It's not authentic... and it's defenetely not a smell as Vera Wang parfume.Please, do not think that Vera Wang can smell so bad.... as this liquid...	negative
title: Mind numbingly mindless [SEP] content: After 3 hours of playing this game my brain went into shut down mode, kinda like from staring at a wall for 3 hours. Belive me this game is just pretty, and if you like killing things mind-lessly then, by all means play this game! The Maximum IQ you can have to enjoy this game is 125. If your IQ is higher than 125, then you will not like it in most cases.	negative
title: Snorkle [SEP] content: Very poor product. It was a gift for my nephew, and it broke the first time he tried to use it. Would not recommend this snorkle.	negative
title: Flimsy and overpriced [SEP] content: An absolutely terrible product. I got suckered in to buying one of those creme brulee sets, where the ramekins were too small and the torch inadequate. The ignition mechanism is extremely flimsy and mine broke after one use. It is also overpriced. You will get much more use out of a burnz-o-matic torch that attaches to a mini fuel tank and for about the same price.	negative
title: Disappointed with service [SEP] content: I ordered three pair of identical slippers, two of which were incorrectly sized. I contacted the seller twice and never got a response. I filed a complaint with amazon and the situation was resolved within two weeks. This is the first time I've run into problems with a seller and was pleased with amazon's response to my dilemma. As for the seller, I'll not do business with this seller again.	negative
title: Please do not buy [SEP] content: I'm on my third coffee pot in one year of this model. The First two were exchanged. This one will be going into the trash. Received as a wedding gift. Returned the first on because it didn't keep coffee hot, the second one over heated and damaged the base of the pot. NOW THIS ONE, shuts off after making one cup and does not continue to make any more coffee. I have to shut it off and restart it 8 times before it will make 10 cups of coffee.	negative
title: Piece of Garbage [SEP] content: The first one i bought only worked a few times. It must be a bad drive. I returned it and got a replacement. Same thing happened. The drive will not even load and I have tried a few different computers. Stay away	negative
title: The best import album you'll ever buy... [SEP] content: I bought this album in the UK, and it really is brilliant. Its everyhing you ever wanted from the UK Club scene rolled into 2 CD's. Its, the culmination of popular songs from the clubs of Ibiza to the UK charts. Any Americans into the club music of the UK should definately buy this CD... its not the best Kiss album the radio station has ever released but it sure does contend with the other compilation albums of this year.	positive
title: Great book for the rockabilly guitar novice [SEP] content: This book does an excellent job at pacing you from exercise to exercise than into songs that play on what you've learned. Although the Travis picking style can be difficult to get your head around. I would suggest first taking some basic lessons from a guitar teacher comfortable with the Travis style, than get this book.	positive
title: Loved it. [SEP] content: I couldn't wait to see how it ended. (To me, it was more a book where I wanted to know how it ended, rather than just drinking in the current part of the story - it really pulled me along). Once it did, I'm sorry that it's over. It's in my head now - I keep thinking I can go pick up my book and read, then I remember I finished it, and my heart sinks a little each time.	positive
title: Gary Gygax is the Master. [SEP] content: I have been roleplaying for years, many many years. I have seen games come and go, I have seen the white box set of G. Gygax. I have seen games like RuneQuest, Warhammer FRP, MERP, Torg, so many games.Yet this is the real start, the real truth of how great roleplaying can be. You might find 3rd edition more intricate, more things to do in it, but the original AD&D players manual and DM manual were the best in my humble opinion.This book shows how to create characters quick and just start roaming the worlds that the DM makes. GET IT. and the Dungeon Master Manual by G. Gygax. You will love it better than almost anything else the roleplaying world has to offer.	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: These DVD's are wonderful. The scenery is fantastic and the music is well done. I use them for riding my stationary bike and they make my workout 100% more enjoyable.	positive
title: A valuable resource with hard to find information [SEP] content: When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever. It broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously.	positive
title: Works but watch where you put it [SEP] content: Careful to put the adaptor at a high place like on top of your desk hutch. Do the same for the wireless access point. It makes a much better signal.	positive
title: THE BEST EVER STAR WARS NOVEL [SEP] content: AMAZING - Thrawn is back! When I first picked up this book I could hardley put it down. Zahn writes in a style matched by no one. The story is that it turns out the Bothans were the ones responsible for helping Palpatine destroying a long lost world. The news comes out and everyone wants to either kill the Bothans or save them. Then Thrawn comes back from the dead ready to lead the Imperials to victory while the Republic destroys itself. Zahn includes all the classic charactars whom other authors have seem to forgotten - Mara Jade, the Noghri, Pallaeon. On top of this he mixes Stakpoles Rougue Squadron and Booster Terrik. All in all this action packed novel has you eating out of it's hand. Buy it at all costs. Oh yeah, Just try working out who or what the Hand of Thrawn actually is - when you do read the next book you'll be in for quite a suprise.	positive
title: Fun workout! [SEP] content: I absolutely HATE working out, but this DVD is actually fun for me! I am not at all coordinated, so I know I don't look like the "Island Girl" in the video, but as long as no one sees me, I love doing this workout!	positive
title: Darkly Beguiling [SEP] content: Any collection of Robert W Chambers's "King in Yellow" stories is a rare and welcome gift, and the best of those stories--"The Yellow Sign," "The Repairer of Reputations," and "In the Court of the Dragon"--are included in this volume. Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle. The missing stories, in this reviewer's opinion, are as follows: "The Prophet's Paradise," "The Street of the Four Winds," "The Street of the First Shell," "The Street of Our Lady of the Fields," and "Rue Barree." Had the current volume included these tales, I would have given it the highest possible marks. Still, it is an excellent collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the work of the inestimable and terribly underrated Robert W. Chambers.	positive
title: Terrific case for running with Nike+ [SEP] content: I would highly recommend this case if you are a runner and are using the Nike+ iPod system. I have had this case for almost a year and I still love it. I use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. I live in very hot climate and I don't even notice that I have it on my arm. The dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. In the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. This case provides a tight fit for the iPod and the Nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the iPod. I will buy another as the neoprene is beginning to split where it has to fit over the receiver but it definitely was worth the price, considering how much I have used it.	positive
title: A solid effort [SEP] content: This was a solid effort, not as good as their ealier stuff, but better than a lot that would come later. This album was a top ten hit in the US when it was released in 1982 and produced two hit singles "Wasted on the Way" and "Southern Cross" and a third minor hit "Too Much Love To Hide". Other strong songs include "Into the Darkness" and "Daylight Again", which is an excellent update of the Stills classic "Find the Cost of Freedom". This release is helped by the addition of 4 bonus tracks not included on the original release.	positive
title: Wrong Point of View [SEP] content: My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country.	positive
title: Spoiler [SEP] content: For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?	positive
title: Hot Hoops Additional Equipment [SEP] content: This game has been very entertaining for my grandson, however, I need to know how to purchase additional basketball balls for the game.	positive
title: A masterpiece, a mind's voyage to its own feelings [SEP] content: This film made me cry, scream, and tremble with emotion. It inspired me, it made me see the world in a different way. The fact that this film is out of print terrified me, I had it once but soon got lost, most probably in some guy's hands. I got to have it. I need it.	positive

title: Kizuna [SEP] content: The First Japanese Animated Gay Love Story: Leave it to the Japanese . Not only did they develop the transistor radio, but now they're first out of the gate with an animanted gay love story! And it's a beaut, all about two high shcool lovers whose relationship is threatened by a sinister Mafioso who tries to come between them. Frank, in the extreme!	positive
title: Great solution if you have an xBox 360 [SEP] content: Setting up this remote was a painless user experience. I plugged it in, let the Logitech software download the latest firmware, input the list of brands and models of the equipment I have, the software suggested a list of activities, and less than five minutes later everything just worked.I did the configuration on a Macintosh - a lot of times vendors deliver poorly written software for the Mac, but the Logitech software for this remote didn't suck. They also included the USB cable needed to program it, and since the packaging allows you to press a button and see a demo, they included a second set of batteries to ensure you didn't end up with a dead set.I picked this because I wanted to be able to control my xBox 360, but it also works with my Apple TV.Apple MA711LL/A TV with 40GB Hard DriveXbox 360 Console Includes 20GB Hard Drive	positive
title: Excellent [SEP] content: All of James Patterson's books (Women's Murder Club) have kept me in suspense. I would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them	positive
title: To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising [SEP] content: What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as " Touched with fire" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II.	positive
title: Just like when I was a kid! [SEP] content: I bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. The music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. She has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!I would definalty reccomend this toy!	positive
title: Views of a formulator of Omega 3 products [SEP] content: I was very happy to find Dr. Schmidts book, "SMART FATS". Having spent several years researching EFA Balance, I found the information in his book to be very accurate and a wonderful information source. This country is in dire need for Omega Balance and for the knowledge to know why. Hurray for "SMART FATS"!Stanley R. Mann, VP. Research and Education Integrity Direct Inc.	positive
title: Fish Fry [SEP] content: This item was used at a Fish Fry. And it was fantastic, once we put the fish in all we had to do was wait forit to float to the top. It came out golden brown. Next time will use it for a Fun Raiser an let the pot pay for itself.	positive
title: Elvis' Wall of Sound [SEP] content: Highly relevant to how one appreciates EC's third album is the quality of the production. While the quality of the songs and songwriting is as great as the other reviewers state, many were turned off by the 'Wall of Sound' production values introduced on this third album. I still feel that all of the reverb and track layering, although often suited to the thematic content, mars my experience of these great songs, decades later.	positive
title: Amazing..Great Book [SEP] content: This is the one to read. I even gave it to my husband to read. Easy to read. I read it in 2 hours. This book gave me the reasons people act the way they do. Then it gave me a way to talk to those kinds of people.	positive
title: A movie worth watching! [SEP] content: Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!	positive
title: We bought 2 [SEP] content: It's great to have the sounds but setting the alarm was a bit confusing.....overall, it's great and we enjoy going to sleep to the sound of a waterfall, waves, summer night, etc. ... as well as waking up to the same	positive
title: Good value [SEP] content: Two Bruce Willis movies on one blue ray makes this a must have for Bruce Willis fans and the price is at a excellant value.	positive
title: By far my fave AC/DC!!!! [SEP] content: Overall this is a great live cd, it contains most of thier best and most populer songs. However the album doesnt really stick to you. By this I mean most of the songs get old fast but, still it's a great cd for any kind of AC/DC fan.	positive
title: Love this. [SEP] content: I love Maynard anyway. So, no matter if it's Tool or A Perfect Circle, I'm pretty much sold. I do like Undertow. However, 10,000 Days is my ultimate favorite Tool CD.	positive
title: Convicting [SEP] content: We do not live in the same world as the first century Christians that's for sure. Maybe if we lived in the Middle East but here in America it's a whole different story. I pray I never have to endure the pain and hardship the 1st and 2nd century disciples did. Though I long to be as spiritual and faithful as them. This book has some sobering challenges about how we live too materialistically. I know I could live without my stuff but it's like sin; once you've experienced it it's hard not to want it again. I don't miss living in mansions or having servants since I never did, but take away my indoor plumbing electronic entertainment and even just freedom to drive down the street and it's a real challenge to imagine getting by without. Thank God for all the blessings you have and never forget how good you got it. Now get out there and be spiritual. This book will help you do that.	positive

title: Great finale for Jack Ryan. [SEP] content: I think this would be the pinnacle of Jack Ryan's career. I don't think you can top being the Chief Executive of the country.Despite the number of pages, the classic Clancy thrill is there to keep you reading it. Reading this (again) post 9/11 and the Iraq Invasion gives me the impression the the current job holder wants to be a Jack Ryan (not).The pace is there. Clancy's attention to details is there too.However, for me, the Hunt for Red October would still be my 5 star Clancy book.	positive
title: What can I say but PURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT! [SEP] content: This is the perfect blend of people, cats, and mystery. Braun has gotten a style that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen while treating all of us cat lovers to two of the smartest cats on earth. All I cat say is don't start it until you can read it straight through because you will not want to put it down.	positive
title: Replacement straps for old lamp [SEP] content: The price was good and delivery excellent. The reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.Always be prepared. PS: This is a simple design that kicks the behind. A creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. For me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a Works Enduro Rider steering dampener.	positive
title: Great radio [SEP] content: This retro look radio has a great sound and good reception. I was surprised at the quality of the radio for the price. It is a fun item to talk about with friends.	positive
title: great movie! [SEP] content: I recently bought this dvd for my partner. we sat down and watched it 2gether. The story is about a young boy and his family, in some parts of this movie it can be a tear jerker. This movie will touch your heart, if you purchase it you wont be sorry. this movie has feeling.	positive

title: Flight Simulator Delux [SEP] content: The simulator was delivered quicker than I expected. All parts work as advertised. My problem is my graphics card. I need to up date it. The simulator is slow and jerky. I will review it again when I get the card.Overall I am very satisfied.	positive
title: Typical Snowmen Fun [SEP] content: I love the snowmen books! They have limited text and allow children to make up the story as they look at the book.	positive
title: Even Better than the Original [SEP] content: The songs on this CD are even better than the original High School Musical CD. There is a wide variety of music from the dance numbers like 'I don't dance',and 'Work it out', to the over-the-top songs such as Sharpay's 'Fabulous'. It includes some romantic songs such as 'Everyday' and a song where Troy realises he needs to make some changes in his life shown in the song 'Bet on it'. The songs certainly tell a story and make you want to see the movie. Great entertainment for kids and parents will enjoy this CD also.	positive
title: Helen Reddy [SEP] content: Contains two top 40 songs from the seventies that is not on her greatest hits album, Bluebird and Music Is My Life.	positive
title: So Much Fun [SEP] content: My 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! We take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. She gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!	positive
title: True BUF Memories [SEP] content: It's difficult to add to the previously written reviews of this book, since those reviewers already said it all. I can only concur with their opinions and thoughts, and add that the book brings back a flood of memories. Since my particular experience was mainly with the BUF, I immensely enjoyed reading this book. From the boredom of alert duty to the tedious flights from Anderson to SEA during Arc Light, all may not have been glamour or glory. However, excitement and drama certainly did occur during those war days. The camaraderie and friendships that developed were deep and lasting. It's a "must read" for any former SAC mamber, especially B52 personel.	positive
title: Satified customer [SEP] content: I read the reviews on this product before making my purchase...some good, some not so good. When I first charged the battery (about 5 hours) and used the trimmer, I was disappointed. My fault. Then I charged the battery overnight and used the trimmer for about 30 minutes without taking my finger off the trigger. Not bad. Again...my fault. Then my wife used it and only pressed the trigger while she trimmed. She loves it and there were no issues with time restraints. We were able to trim out the entire area of our flower bed (about 20' by 20') with no issues at all. Then I trimmed for another 20 minutes using her technique. Great for trimming around pavers, walkways, and inside thick plant beds. This is a nice trimer, but the battery is definitely not a quick charge. Follow the instructions and it works well.	positive
title: Absorbing [SEP] content: Reading this reminded me a little of Murakami's The WindUp Bird Chronicles in terms of the surrealism. There was a time when people were made of paper. A boy's cat is butchered and the grieving boy revivifies his cat by making paper organs and becomes the world's first origami surgeon. A woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. A baby Nostradamus is born. A man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to America with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker. It's a story of lost love, of planetary wars, the struggle for free will and ethnic issues.Certain chapters are told in columns which, to me, adds to the experience.This is not a book for everyone, and I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already appreciate bizarre stories.	positive
title: Great Toaster Oven [SEP] content: I really love this oven. The toaster feature at the top is great!! If you plan on doing cooking in the oven, it is important to preheat and turn the tray from front to back halfway through the cooking time. Things	positive
title: Daughter loved [SEP] content: Nice costume, but it was a little bit longer than expected. Worked fine at the end with a few pins.	positive
title: Annalee Classic Snowman [SEP] content: Perfect. I bought it at a great discount price, the item is in perfect condition and exactly what I would expect from an Annalee item. I was especially excited to be able add to my Annalee Christmas collection at this great price. I'm very pleased with the purchase, the easy with the purchase, and the prompt delivery. I look forward to more wonderful buys like this from Amazon.com.	positive
title: The Original! [SEP] content: I would have given this 5 stars, but settled for 4 because I was expecting the Re-release version with the new footage. Its the original theatrical release. Don't get me wrong, I love the original, but I was hoping at least for both versions of the film, like the DVD release had. I actually stopped it it when I realized it was the original and threw the DVD in!	positive
title: WONDERFUL [SEP] content: I LOVE THESE KNIVES. VERY MODERN LOOKING AND THEY WORK GREAT. MY HANDS NO LONGER GET TIRED FROM CUTTING AND THEY LOOK GREAT IN MY KITCHEN	positive
title: Works great! [SEP] content: This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.	positive
title: One of my favorite [SEP] content: This book was one of the favorite I have ever read. Huxley disguises the meaning of the book at the beginning, but if you give it a chance, you will love it. The story of the future in which everything has been sacrificed, Brave New World is about a man who knows about Earth's past, but the people created by bottles are ignorant of the world. The people are made to repeat a cycle over and over without knowing any reason for life. In savage reservations, where people live in the past, like we do today, one	positive
title: kmtcpp [SEP] content: I dont really agree with many of the opinions above. Jaco had worse days than others, and every Jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his "bad ones" is absolutely wrong. If you've heard the "stuttgart aria" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. Compared to Weather Report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. This is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the N.Y series, with an outstanding 17' Teen Town!!!! A must buy in my opinion.	positive
title: Very funny Abbott & Costello comedy [SEP] content: Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are sidewalk photographers who get mixed up with bank robbers and wind up at a ski resort. This film has the famous A & C verbal humor, and plenty of visual comedy, too. Lou's mishaps on a skating rink are amusing, and a frantic chase finale has Lou turning into a giant snowball! The supporting cast features Sheldon Leonard as the criminal mastermind, and fans of '40s music will enjoy vocalist Ginny Simms. If you saw this on TV years ago, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the print quality of this edition. Replicating the original theatrical viewing experience, the tape includes two coming-attractions previews (the first trailer is the only segment boasting less-than-superior quality), and you'll also see a Woody Woodpecker cartoon and a documentary short about exotic birds. A fine show from Universal.	positive
title: Pretty good, for clip art [SEP] content: This book has a good selection of classic tattoo designs, and I would consider it a good value for the price. The artwork is good, not amazing, but certainly adequate. Each design is offered in color and in linework. If you're looking for a good, all-purpose book of flash, and not necessarily a lot of authentic Sailor Jerry stuff, this book (and CD ROM!) is a good choice.	positive
title: A great album and also an awesome reflection of the 70's! [SEP] content: The first time I heard it was when I was 11,my dad had an old LP and I loved it.Agreat addition to any collection if you like Grateful Dead type country-rock. The song Henry is a great reflection of early 70's marijauna laced lifestyle,and Glendale Train tells a wonderful story.	positive
title: A great little radio! [SEP] content: This is the second Sangean DT-180 AM/FM radio I have purchased. I needed to get a second one as my wife was always taking mine to use when she worked out. A great little radio that I use on my motorcycle, at work, and just out and about. Long battery life and it picks up the stations I listen to. Very happy with this radio. I suggest buying your own earphones. The ones with this radio are just odd.	positive
title: Sweet! [SEP] content: These things are great!!! Constructed very well, I thought they would be more flimsy but was happily surprised. I foresee many wonderful years of popscicle making. So far I made orange juice pops, chocolate pudding pops, and frozen yogurt pops.......the choices are endless!	positive
title: For the right audience, a good book [SEP] content: There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.	positive
title: Good so far [SEP] content: Good book so far (chapter 7), and has created some pretty good discussion in my men's group. It's relevant and worth your time.	positive
title: END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY [SEP] content: END OF EVOLUTION MASS EXTINICT & BIODIVERSITY by WARD,PETER is a brilliant look into the history of planet Earth and the life that once inhibited this planet. Throughout the history mass extinctions have occured resulting in the destruction of old world also resulting in the evolution of a new world. Throughout the book Dr. Ward describes these mass extinctions and warns of another mass extinction that may take place if Human Beings are not careful. I strongly advice anyone who is remotely interested in Geology or in any sciences to read this book!	positive
title: Who can resist The Saint? [SEP] content: Roger Moore is at his finest in this series. His true personality shines with zinging one-liners, and of course, what red- or blue-blooded female can resist his amazing good looks!But seriously, these stories are set in the top globe-trotting sites on the planet in the 1960's, which brings back such retro nostalgia. The scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the American series "Batman". The stories themselves are very well-written and the adaptations for television are first-rate.If, like me, you're sick and tired of television programmes today which offer a buffet of violence and sex, with nothing left to the imagination, then I urge you to buy this dvd set and enjoy television from a time when good manners were included, ladies wore hats and gloves to go out and about, and the cars were tres cool.	positive
title: Purchased as a going away gift!! [SEP] content: I purchased this for a co-worker who was tranferring to another division and across the country. Yes, she just got engaged and she could use this book to look fabulous in her wedding gown.	positive
title: This book will change your life. [SEP] content: ...If your looking for a meaningful long term romantic relationship then this is the book for you.This book explains everything that is misunderstood about true love. It emphasizes building a foundation of friendship and respect, and in time romance. It even explains how to get the coldest people to warm up to you.This book shows how "love is a predictable human response". If your a logical person, this book explains love in logical terms. Or actions and reactions.If your looking for help on how to inspirer and maintain a long term relationship, then this is the book for you.	positive
title: movie review [SEP] content: We are Bruce Willis fans, it could of used a little more plot but I would give it 3.5 stars,fun to download off of Amazon, still had some interruption in streaming	positive
title: Great BBQ brush [SEP] content: I shopped around and bought this because I wanted the brass wire bristles which don't rust. Long handle and scraper edge make cleaning up easy. There are cheaper versions out there but look at the construction. This was part of a birhtday gift to my son and he loves it. He uses it all the time and is very happy with it.	positive
title: still great [SEP] content: I've Seen This Twice In Theaters. The First Time I Couldn't Stop Focusing On The Beautiful Animation. The Second Time I Wanted To See It With My Friend. Everyone I Talk To About This Movie Loves It But What's Not To Love. It's Funny , Got Some Action , And Is Pretty Dramatic In Scenes. The Pickles And Eggs Joke Is So Funny So Suspend Belief And See This Movie. You Won't Be Sorry. Who Cares If It Flopped? My Friends And I Sure Don't.	positive
title: This guy can sing! [SEP] content: Long Time Coming is a stylistic change for Jonny as he has moved away from the blues. Instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!	positive
title: The most accurate translation available today! [SEP] content: As a Bible College graduate, I have had the privilege of reviewing more than 50 different Bible translations as well as studying the Hebrew and Greek texts. When I study the Bible, I want to make sure that what I am reading is accurate. Mr Rotherham was a good Hebrew and Greek scholar who was very careful in how he interpreted the Sacred Scriptures. Although there are other good Bible translations, there are also several poor translations. From personal experience, I believe that The Emphasized Bible is the most accurate translation that we have available in English today.	positive
title: Good watch - almost great [SEP] content: This watch is really good for the price. It's loaded with well-made features, but it has one major flaw that prevents it from being a great watch: the display. Unlike the nice silver color of the digits as seen on the official picture, the numbers actually show up a dull bronze. This makes the watch very difficult to read without a direct light source or the backlight on.Other than that here are some good points:-well designed interface-well builtA few minor faults:-unit runs a little fast (gains about 30 seconds/month, i.e. gains about 1 second per day)-the design of the band/case is somewhat blandOverall conclusion: I recommend this watch.	positive
title: New insights into the Nazi hierarchy [SEP] content: In his biography of Joseph Goebbels David Irving has provided some masterful and provocative insights into the inner workings of the Nazi hierarchy. However, the book is sometimes confusingly organized and Irving's use of the present tense when describing past events can be irritating and seem a bit amaturish in so seasoned a writer.With these caveats in mind, this is still an important book and necessary reading for any student of World War II. Mr. Irving is neither a Holocaust denier nor a proponent of the Nazis or their ideology; he simply has a different point of view. It's amazing how vociferous and censorious the academic history establishment can become when their 'established' truths are challenged; and in this book, Mr. Irving has done just that.	positive
title: save the landfills from swifer [SEP] content: I worked in Korea us they had an itema that attracted dust..seemed magnetic and the covers were washable. I am also older, very, and disabled so regular mops are just too heavy for me..however I didn't like the waste, the landfill issues and the cost of the swifer...Im so glad that I found this option and feel a little better on the environmental scale of life.	positive
title: Great product, but don't feel any difference after a while. [SEP] content: Received this from a doctor for food poisoning in samples. This nuked the food poisoning in just a few hours. Worked well. A couple months later, I got food poisoning again. Decided to invest in this for protection. Got my system going again. Once you are healed and use it as a vitamin, you won't really feel a difference as if you didn't take it. It's all on you to keep a good system going. All in all, this product works quite well.	positive
title: Best Game for PSP...Period!!! [SEP] content: This game looked cool in the advertisements, and I'd never played the console version, so I bought it with my Christmas money. It is the best PSP game I have, and I have at least 10, and have played many more. The controls are AWESOME, the storyline and characters are CLASSIC, and overall it feels like you're playing a classic Western film as Clint Eastwood or John Wayne. The details get pretty gorey, though, with brain splatter, blood squirting, and dismemberment, so it's not for the faint of heart. The one thing that could be better is the length of the game. It's definately not short, but if you added several more hours worth of story and a dozen more bounty missions or so, then it would be PERFECT.	positive
title: MICHELLE....YOU GO GURL!!! [SEP] content: I had the pleasure, blessing and the privelage to meet and hear the wonderful vessel of God speak at my church's Women's Season Recruitment Night and it was truly a blessing. This is what the Co-Pastor at my church is using in her women's season bible study. Michelle is such an awesome author because she is so serious about being an instrument of righteousness for the Lord and she basically is saying in this book that if you want to be blessed and highly favored in the sight of our heavenly Father than you have to seek Him early, seek Him reverently, seek Him prayerfully and seek Him as if nothing else on earth really matters. This book lets you know that those of us who half step with the Lord as far as being in His will , will always be half blessed. I strongly recommend all of her books. Michelle, I thank God for you and your ministry and continue to be blessed and highly favored.	positive
title: One of my all time favs [SEP] content: Read this around age 10 or 12 and it was transporting. The first time I went to England, it felt like I already knew it. I've reread this book a hundred times.	positive
title: Wow, what a neat Software [SEP] content: These CD's have been around for years and I never bought them with our first child, but wow what a difference it made for my pre-kindergartner. He is spelling, reading, etc. And he is addicted to the PC (in a good way). Highly recommended.	positive
title: great book!! [SEP] content: this book was extremely well written! Ann M Martin really went into detail and description about the setting and about stacey's feelings of love towards her student math teacher Wes. If you're in middle school and are crushing on someone, you can truly relate to stacey.	positive
title: awesome book about Paul [SEP] content: Wow - when I finished reading this book, I felt like I had been right there with the Apostle Paul through all of his missionary journeys, trials, and triumphs! I felt like Paul was my close and personal friend! The author takes the basic historical facts and truths about Paul and weaves a story around it. It made me want to get out my Bible and read Acts and other Pauline epistles. (Which I did...) Although this book is long, please don't let that intimidate you. It is worth the read!	positive
title: One of their best [SEP] content: If you haven't heard GBV, well, you shouldn't start by listening to their ablums. You should go see them live. They tour all the time, so get off your butt and go be amazed. Once you've done that, Bee Thousand is a good placed to start as far as recorded material (though I'd personally choose Alien Lanes.) You'll be amazed what a few losers from Ohio can do with a 4-track and a fair amount of beer.	positive
title: Coordinate plane [SEP] content: A great book to read in the classroom, and given students a different view of the coordinate plane. Helps them to make sense of the reason behind what a coordinate plane does for organizing data.	positive
title: 60 years old but still a gem [SEP] content: This book celebrates its 60th birthday this year but it's difficult to top it for the most straightforward, comprehensive overview of the curriculum process. There are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by Tyler, in part if not in whole. The style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that Tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. The best modern book on curriculum is by John Biggs ("Teaching for quality learning at university") and he pays tribute to the influence of Tyler's book on his own work. Unfortunately Tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read ABOUT but few have actually read. Do read it - it has pearls of wisdoms for today's educationalists or for anyone interested in schools and what they do, and it is only 128 pages long!	positive
title: This book will leave you.. SPELLBOUND. [SEP] content: I am 32 years old and still read this book. In the 90's Pikes book were like the Harry Potter back in England and the States. It has many turns and twists. Its could've made it into a movie. I want to read this book. I will keep reading till the the day that I die.	positive
title: Very moisturizing, love it! [SEP] content: I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.	positive
title: Get to know yourself! [SEP] content: This book will blow your mind. It's amazing how the author takes complex psychoanalytical concepts from giants in the field and boils them down to where us lay folks can understand them.	positive
title: Clever and Easy [SEP] content: Very clever layout and easy to understand recipes. The beautiful photos make a snap to imagine cooking these things yourself. Highly recommended!	positive
title: Pizza Tiger [SEP] content: If you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.Easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and I am in the pizza business.On a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as I used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.Daddio	positive
title: 12 years of trouble-free use [SEP] content: I have had a set of these Novi 4-channel wireless intercoms for over 12 years. Mine are set up on different wiring circuits in my current home, and they work just fine. I'm not sure why other people are having trouble with them not working on different wiring circuits. One caution: I used to live in a condo, and, apparently, one of the neighbors received a set as a Christmas present, because we began to hear their conversations the day after Christmas. We just switched channels, no more problems.	positive
title: Great, but missing things. [SEP] content: I thought this movie was wonderful. It was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. The acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. The only thing is, they left out 3 major events! Chloe and Buck's wedding, Amanda and Rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. But I won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. I did like this movie. I really did. I just have to wonder why they left these parts out.	positive
title: SAVE YER DOSH WITH TOSH! [SEP] content: I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER AND I THINK IT IS GREAT, I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE. AC-3,DTS(OUTPUTS)GOOD FEATURES, AND GREAT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY FOR A GREAT PRICE."BUY IT NOW"	positive
title: Good Entertainment, Nice Surprise [SEP] content: Watched with some friends and we all agreed that especially for a sequel, the movie was very good in keeping with the flavor of the original.What so commonly happens is that multi sequels just keep adding more and more action,usually going way over the top.However MBI3 had the action and added heart !	positive
title: Good [SEP] content: fast, good, safe, easy use, no problem, low price. play game now have more fun and happiness. will buy next one soon.	positive
title: Great Memories! [SEP] content: I first saw this Nintendo Powered movie at a young age. It has been over 10 years since seeing it and after watching it recently i was brought back to the great 80's a time of New Kids on the Block and the ever mighty grafics of the Nintendo Entertainment System!	positive
title: A great ending... [SEP] content: A 3 book series that is well worth the read. Clever and well written. A little dated but hey, what can you do? Anyone interested in the Sci-Fi Fantasy genre should invest in these books. I went to the author's web page and mailed my copies to him, now I have signed copies! Hooray for me!	positive
title: This is a Great Remote [SEP] content: I use this remote along with the universal expander to run a DVR, a DVD/VHS and home theater that are set up in a storage room and connected to my family room TV (i.e. the equipment is behind a wall).PROS: It works better than I had hoped. The radio connection works every time. Programming is fairly easy and it runs off-brand equipment just fineCONS: The touch screen is a little to small for fat-fingered people.	positive
title: Excellent game. [SEP] content: Madden 2004 is a great game for the average EA Sports fan. There aren't many flaws and Madden is great with his commentary. The stadiums are of high detail. The gameplay is great. Sometimes it won't load. If you have run a different program before you play it, odds are it won't load either at the beginning or the end. I like the trophy presentation at the end of a victory in the Championship game or the Super Bowl. It's a great game with excellent commentary from Madden and Al Michaels.	positive
title: Playpen [SEP] content: this playpen is a great one i love how the basient is on the top and it is so easy to set up it will be well used	positive
title: Great plot and character development [SEP] content: I enjoyed this book as it drew me in from the first page. I was a little confused towards the end of the story because it went off on a different vein than what I expected but it ended up evening out and it finally made sense. The intricate storyline kept me turning the page and I read this book in 2 days.I would recommend this book to people who are into thrillers.I give this book 5 stars for the clear plot-line and interesting character development.	positive
title: Will have you rolling on the floor laughing [SEP] content: If you are in vet school (and even med school) you must have this book. I've read this book like 10 times and I still laugh so hard, even two years after graduation.	positive
title: A good general look at the history of western architecture [SEP] content: Wodehouse and Moffett do a good job of jamming the whole history of western arcitecture into an easy to read compact work. They cover the biggies and touch on the lesser known but important works. There are ample illustrations and notations to diagrams and photographs. The writing is interesting and not full of boring technical jargan. This book is an excelent jumping off point for a time period or to get an overview of architecture in general. There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck. This book is certanily not the end all of any time period, but for casual scholors of architecture or those who need to know about a building in X time period, this a great book.	positive
title: Fans may not like, but it was innovative [SEP] content: The eighties had to be a hard time for bands, music like everything else was changing and Kiss went right along with that and tried to do something original, and they did it.Fans may not like it, and later they changed back to the original sound, but if you listen to this album, which i like by the way, you hear the influences they had on later to come bands.Some guitar riffs and styles i can hear in later Bowie sounds, also bands like Journey,Boston etc. ,and i can even hear a little of the mid eighties Joan Jett.So while it may have been not to fans liking, it was innovative for what it is.	positive
title: Cushy Mat [SEP] content: I really like this mat, it is very cushy and easy to roll and store. The length is just perfect, but the one thing I would change about itis that it could be a little wider.	positive
title: Fantastic [SEP] content: Fantastic Shredder. I've had others that granted, were cheaper, and they were total JUNK. This one is flawless. You don't have to position the paper just so in the slot, like with my last junky shredder. It's a little bigger, size-wise, than others, but worth it for how it easily chews up a whole envelope full of junk mail.	positive
title: Take It To the Beach! (Or Perhaps the River?) [SEP] content: If you like adventure travel books and aren't interested in reading the fifteen thousandth book about Mt. Everest (enough already!), then you've got to read this book. A real winner. When's the movie?	positive
title: Great DVD [SEP] content: I bought this DVD for my wife after she saw the movie and fell in love with the love story. It was shipped on time as promised and well protected. Great experience.	positive
title: Sweeeet! [SEP] content: Man is this fun to watch! All these classic old jazz players reminiscing about this ultimate jazz photo and the times surrounding it. Full of funny vignettes and some snippets of very fine music, it's a primo history lesson. Diz in particular is hilarious.So many legends here; the extras are superb. A 90-minute movie is now a 6-hour treat! That's what Special Features should be: special.A true must for any fan of jazz in the 50s, a golden era.	positive
title: highly satisfied [SEP] content: this product was as expected and instead of paying over a hundred dollars we got almost the same thing for 13	positive
title: Love it! [SEP] content: This Pan is amazing it stays hot just like it says it does. I love the color and can't wait to Braise in it, so far I have only made green beans.	positive
title: indispensible [SEP] content: As a person of partly Greek ancestry, and Protestant upbringing, when I contemplated conversion to Roman Catholicism, I asked the priest why I should not become Orthoodox. He smiled and said that would be going in the right direction but why not come all the way home. He gave me this book. Indeed I became a Roman Catholic.I count as kin and the best of friends and brothers in Christ many Orthodox. I am thankful and do believe that I understand them and their religion better than ever for reading this book. Though it condemns certain errors, Soloviev speaks with a true voice of love for the Orthodox.This personal note is all I can add to the excellent reviews that have gone before mine. I do recommend this book especially to Orthodox Christians who are so very important to the future of all Christendom.	positive

title: Worth It. [SEP] content: We have used this pad for 6 months now and so far it fits the crib mattress, is convenient to change and has held up well in the wash.	positive
title: Pretty good [SEP] content: This is a pretty good trimmer. The vacuum is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job. The battery is also pretty reliable. Cleaning is very easy, and I don't believe it ever has to be oiled, which is quite a convenience.	positive
title: snow treasure [SEP] content: This was a gift for my 2nd grade Grandson. He is an advanced reader, and we constantly set the goals for him. I read this the first time at age 28, and it was the start of my reading journeys	positive
title: Percussion as it should be [SEP] content: This is a truly inspired album. Leon Parker, unlike many of his contemporaries, does not buy into the Dennis Chambers school of drumming (aka showing off). Parker, on the set, is a minimalist in that he has stripped his set to the bare essentials. On top of that, his actual playing on the set is drumming as it should be - he lays down a funky riff to support some fantastic side musicians. On top of this, Parker explores different modes of expression through percussion, such as his body and voice. The CD contains inspired playing by Parker and all musicians, but also contains amazing ensemble work. I highly reccommend this.	positive
title: his best, incredible [SEP] content: "slow turning" is easily one of my favorite cds. the whole cd is great. it fits perfectly with shawn colvin's "fat city" and sarah mclachlan's "fumbling toward" as 90's records you can never tire of, whether you're driving, working, or relaxing. although my favorite song of his, the earlier "riding with the king", is not on this, i still give this cd the highest praise because there are no bad tracks. a rarity.	positive
title: A must have for any fan of Giuffria [SEP] content: David Glen Eisley is a very under-rated vocalist. Most of the tracks on here are from what would have been the 3rd Giuffria album along with a few Dirty White Boy tracks and of course the few from what turned out to be the House of Lords debut. I loved this from start to finish.Just listen to this version of "Pleasure Palace"...absolute masterpiece. No disrespect meant to James Christian as I think he fits in great with House of Lords, but I'd still like to see how the rest of the HOL stuff would have sounded with DGE.	positive
title: As advertised [SEP] content: As advertised, shipped quickly, good price. Worked fine. Longevity yet to be determined, but right now I would order this item again.	positive
title: Worth the money [SEP] content: This is a typical Amanda Quick novel. Only a few of her books did I not throughly enjoy. The Paid Companion was an excellent and enjoyable read.	positive
title: Very Good for it's price [SEP] content: It's nicely built, very fast thanks to it's F/1.4 and has very smooth and quite autofocus.As most of reviews noted, it is very soft in the corners when stopped down but with this kind of lens, you don't really care for the edges, especially as you get a wider angle than most of it's competitors in the category.I am very pleased with it, but if you are looking for a good portrait lens i would recommend the CANON 50mm F/1.4 instead.it will be much sharper at corners and will cost less.	positive
title: Excelente Reloj [SEP] content: Excelente reloj, tiene numeros claros y faciles de ver. Es muy facil de configurar. Es un muy buen reloj por este precio.	positive
title: Great Movie [SEP] content: I enjoyed every aspect of this film. I have it on my Kindle where I can watch it any time I want.	positive
title: Not Tim Conway`s best films, but you could do a lot worse [SEP] content: These are not two of Time Conway`s best movies, but they are not bad. You could do a lot worse. They are far better than most ofthe gunk that oozes out of hollyweird these days.In the Longshot, Tim Conway, Harvy Korman, and freinds are a bunch of race track bums who get a $10,000 loan from a loan shark tobet on a longshot in a horse race. It has some good laughs, but considering the talent of Conway and Korman, it really should havebeen a lot better.In They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way Tim Conway and Chuck McCann are a couple of bumbling cops that are sent by the governor intoa prison farm to find out where an old man hide his loot from a robbery. And with Dub Taylor as the warden and Richard Kiel (Jawsfrom the James Bond movies) as the intimidating bad guy it makes for some good laughs.Like I said, these are not Conway`s best movies, but there are some good laughs in them and well worth watching.	positive
title: for true fans [SEP] content: i bought this Bender head for $107 with my tax refund. best decision ever :P haha. it is a great bender head. the little antenna is in a little area right above it so if u keep it in the box you can't see it, but i recommend that you do keep it in the box so it can look like those heads with the water in them. plus its a cool box to keep. the dvd's do sometimes get stuck so i just decided to put them in a cd case holder and put the head on dislplay. the reason i gave it four instead of five stars was cause the dvd's get stuck and because sometimes its a little hard to open the Bender head. it includes all the episodes and movies! i really love it.	positive
title: finger puppets [SEP] content: looked great on my diaper cake made for a baby shower. Product came quickly and was so cute I purchase again.;	positive
title: Shivering [SEP] content: I must admit that while i was read it i was sad,afraid and thrilled at the same time.The character of Mike Noonan was excellent and the plots and events as i turned the pages just kept getting better and better.The characters of Sara Tidwell and Max Devore were just horrifying.I finished the book around midnight and the image of Sara standing with her son did not help me get sleep.It is a must read for anyone as it has everything...love,suspense,sadness and ofcourse horror.Another Stephen King book done and i am not yet done.	positive
title: The Classic [SEP] content: If you grew up on N64 and Still love gaming: You will still love Mario Kart 64. Play This game.	positive
