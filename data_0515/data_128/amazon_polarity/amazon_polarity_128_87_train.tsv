title: Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere [SEP] content: Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.	negative
title: Corelle Apricot Grove 16 pc Set [SEP] content: This was a Christmas gift. We are very displeased with this set, almost returned it. The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less.	negative
title: good for kids, I guess [SEP] content: The music is way too "synthy" for me. In many cases the "band" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo. I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is.	negative
title: Few words to describe how bad... [SEP] content: I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book. It is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and "created" a book. I could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book.	negative
title: A Little Disappointed [SEP] content: I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there.	negative
title: Amazon rip off [SEP] content: Don't buy this product from Amazon. I bought this product because I thought I was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead I received one. The picture that they have is very deceptive. It clearly showed 10.	negative
title: What? [SEP] content: I adore Angelina but this movie had to be one of the stupidest I had seen since I saw Hancock, which was worse. What was the summer of 2008, the summer of the worse, most lame movies ever? It looks like it was.	negative
title: Sadly Disappointed [SEP] content: I am a book lover who hardly lets anyone near my books for fear of getting it handled too much or horrors--bent at the corners and such. As such, I've never in my life came across a book I would so much throw against the wall. And I did, too with Tall, Dark and Cajun. I can't say about her other books since this is the only one of hers I've ever read. I'm sorry, but I was so irritated by the writer's inaccurate reactions to the human behaviours. The funny parts weren't funny, and the steamy parts were gross when characters were quoted as saying,"Oh. Oh." Or something like that. I felt that the writer was just moving the story along and not actually writing.	negative
title: They were not mean for heavy use [SEP] content: I have used mine *heavily* since I bought them in March 2005. The fact that it has an extension cord is great: you can use the short cables to attach to your iPod in your armband without a mess. This works great for the treadmill.9 Months have passed and the left headphone is not woking very well. Just checked and it would cost me $30 to get a replacement. I guess its a bad assumtion to make that all prodcuts come with a one year warranty huh?The headphone plugs do come lose easily, so you have to watch over them when taking them out of a bag or untangling them. Sound is great, but I am dissapointed that they lasted only for 9 months.	negative
title: Do NOT buy blu-ray set for regular DVD! [SEP] content: Okay, first I don't have blu-ray. I refuse to go to yet ANOTHER video format. But I wanted a DVD of the new transfer of A&C MEET FRANKY with the correct logos (the last DVD had Realart Titles). So I bought this set as I knew the blu-ray was correct. So what did Universal do for the DVD disc? They stuck in the old Comedy Legends disc from 2000. A transfer from the dupe 35mm fine grain with plenty of white dirt and a bad audio "fix" in the main title (a trumpet riff repeats annoyingly). My question is, why BOTHER to put two discs in this set if one of them isn't going to be of the new transfer? Phooey. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure the blu-ray disc is great and if that's what you're after I can recommend it blindly. But if you want the latest transfer on DVD, it ain't here.	negative
title: Defective product [SEP] content: The transaction was smooth but the product was defective as the CD on which the software was loaded had been scratched to the point that it would not load.	negative
title: No Bonus Tracks included [SEP] content: I bought this CD for my wife as a gift. The list of songs on this website include "La Tortura" and "Hips Don't Lie". However the CD I recieved does not contain those 2 songs. Those two songs were the reason I bought this CD for my wife. It wasn't until 30 days later after receiving the CD that my wife mentioned those 2 tracks were not on the CD; therefore I cannot return or exchange this CD for the correct version anymore. Please watch out for that when you order this CD. It seems Amazon is shipping the original version of the CD which did not do so well without the Bonus tracks.	negative
title: I should have read the reviews! [SEP] content: Yep, they're right. 100% correct...These lids don't seal at all! Buyer beware. Don't assume that just because it has the Rubbermaid name (which is usually a good choice), that it is a good product. It isn't. Markedly below what I have come to expect from Rubbermaid. And I can't return it because I got this container and then didn't use it for about 2 months. Oh well...at least I didn't pay that much.	negative
title: breaks easily and has bad warrenty [SEP] content: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out	negative
title: Buyers Beware [SEP] content: These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent."Totally Buble" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called "Totally Blonde" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album." - Michael Buble	negative
title: Beautiful but useless [SEP] content: I love the quality of these tongs..wonderfully built, BUT alas USELESS in the real world. Engineers were asleep on this one.Not near enough grip for any practical purposess.Let me know if want mine I will sell them CHEAP!	negative
title: MicroSuede Down Throw Brown [SEP] content: Unfortunately, an alternative to the product I ordered was sent to me. Alternative was not acceptable. Am presently working with merchant regarding refund. Spokesperson from merchant has been very prompt and courteous.	negative
title: an unsatisfactory purchase [SEP] content: This tension rod is thin and very weak. It could not hold itself up. Sadly, I will be returning it.	negative
title: What a waste of a cd [SEP] content: If you buy this cd, you like to throw away your cash. Anyone who is a fan already, has all of these songs and they sounded ten times better in a studio than they do onstage. If you haven't been a Chicks fan before, this one certainly won't convert you. Save the cash for their next album. Maybe it will be worth buying. This one is a stinker.	negative
title: What a piece.... [SEP] content: Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality.	negative
title: Dirty, pages bent over - really used! [SEP] content: As above. I will use it but have to sanitize it first. Only bad experience I've had in the past 25+ years.	negative
title: Written for a twelve year old girl. [SEP] content: I buy my books based on reviews by Amazon. After having read 1/3 of the book, I decided to reread the reviews again and I wouldn't doubt that they are written by the author or her friends and almost all are dated around the same time period. One reviewer stated some drivel about being unable to sleep without the light on again or some such nonsense. This book is "simple". Emily did this or Emily did that. The couple were professing there love on their first date. No suspense. Nothing but boredom. I don't plan on reading the rest of this book and I'm angry that I even spent a dime on it. So beware if you are thinking on purchasing this book and look at the dates on the reviews. I should have guessed these reviews were false d/t the 11 five star reviews. Come on! Not one person gave it less? I tried to find something else she had written and was unable to. Probably because the publisher wasn't going to take a chance on losing more money.	negative
title: Not impressed at all. [SEP] content: I was first introduced to Rachael Davis at the Smoky Hill River Festival in Salina, Kansas (where I'm from) back in 2005. Everyone kept raving about, "oh, she's got a great voice and an extraordinary talent, and she's a great guitarist, blah, blah, blah". Well, I bought the album taking everyone else's advice. I have met Rachael in person, and she is a very nice person and has a very sweet and sassy personality.Sorry to say, but I listened to the album for a good 5 to 10 minutes and it almost gave me a headache. It's nothing but just loud singing, screaming, straining, and shouting at the top of her lungs. And it is very boring to listen to. Nearly put me to sleep. Almost every song on here sounds pretty much the same.I was expecting better.	negative
title: Not a very powerful heater for its size. [SEP] content: I purchased this heater for our patio room which was the guest room for Christmas visitors this year. I found that the heater took a long time to heat a 16 X 12 foot room, and it needed to be run almost constantly to maintain the comfort of the room. Also the full wattage setting didn't seem to heat any better than the 750 watt setting. I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long. It remains to be seen how long this one will last. I never did try the remote, so I can't speak to that.	negative
title: I REALLY tried... [SEP] content: Maybe this just isn't the best introduction to McEwan...I just could NOT get into this book. Everyone I know has read and loved it, but I got the the third break in the writing, closed it, and had NO desire to pick it up again (so I haven't).My main question is: Isn't it a good idea to introduce the PLOT within a few chapters??? There's just a lot of detail for detail's sake...the first three chapters could have been summed up in about a sentance or two...maybe, "He is an excellent doctor, and not the type you'd want programming the music at your parties" would have sufficed?Maybe this one gets better...it's a shame that the opening bored me so much that I'll never find out.	negative
title: Great Idea - disappointing product [SEP] content: I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.	negative
title: Very Poor Quality [SEP] content: Do not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible. I work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes. This set is very poor quality and not worth the money.	negative
title: Worked ok for a week, then bit the dust [SEP] content: Would not recommend this transmitter. It worked ok, but there was way more static than my previous one. Worked for about one week - now it won't turn on at all. Maybe I just got a defective one.	negative
title: Horrid Version [SEP] content: If you are a fan, avoid the DERAM versions at all cost. If you are new to the Moody Blues music, then get whatever version you can to just experience the experience.Unfortunely, the Deram discs (at least the ones I have) suffer from a bad mix. Sounding muted at the dynamic tracks, and then way over the top on surround stage with no center stage on other tracks. (of course I know it was recorded on quad to begin with, but how can you almost completely lose some of the spoken parts?)I've heard much better from lesser disks on lesser systems.Point being that this is supposed to be a "better" version. "[ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED]"NOT even close!!	negative
title: Good Idea, Ineptly Done [SEP] content: I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on "The Switch," won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here.	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: I bought this instrument aware of some of its faults. I'm used to new stringed instruments not holding its tune, but have never seen it untune right before my eyes. Stretching the strings didn't help at all. After giving up, I put it back in the included bag, figuring it would take a while until it could work as intended. A couple of hours later I heard it untune in the bag and then a bag; the bridge flew off. I guess that I'll get around to fixing her one day, and to be quite honest, I had her even less than that, but I'm really thinking of returning her despite the nice rich barritone sound I briefly heard before she literally flew apart.	negative
title: I never got it [SEP] content: HI I never got the baby pool and I didnt know who to call to let you know I didnt get it I would like If I can get that pool some time soon seen as I paid for it if you have any questions to ask me call me at 508 540 4272 I would really like that alot thank you so muchChristina Jones	negative
title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: Not exactly for dummies [SEP] content: I bought this book after purchasing another book on Frontpage that was way over my head. I bought it thinking that it would be basic enough to begin to learn how to use Frontpage but it is not. It is similar to the other book describing features of Frontpage that I do not understand. I have used other "Dummies" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that "it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book. It is probably a very good book for someone with some experence with the basic concepts, but it was not helpful at all for me. I went out and hired someone to build my webpage.	negative
title: Fell Apart in Less Than 60 Days [SEP] content: I have had good luck with this product in the past, but the latest one tore apart at one of the seams. It was used for maybe 50 hours of exercise. Because Amazon does not allow returns after 30 days, I am out of luck, and out $12.	negative
title: Not too great... [SEP] content: We bought this cord to plug into our Sony car stereo so we could listen to our MP3 players over the car stereo system. The cord doesn't make a very good connection, and frequently has to be jiggled to get both channels of sound. It is very annoying. I would recommend getting a more expensive cable if you want good, consistent sound quality.	negative
title: Uber Aweful! No Flavor Here... [SEP] content: When you read the (Klassic 3 Seed) ingredients, you can't dispute that this cracker is probably healthy.... but only if you can get it down. This has got to be one of the hardest, tasteless things I've ever eaten. I even tried this with different spreads. Eating healthy does not mean you have to sacrafice taste. I don't know who wrote the first couple of reviews but I'm convinced they must be associated with the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor... keep shopping. There are many other good tasting and good for you things out there to spend your money on. Hope my honestly helped.	negative
title: Why? [SEP] content: I am personally tired of all the "Women are wonderful, Men are horrible" rhetoric, sheist. This movie is a complete waste of time, and plastic used to make the DVD. Ask an honest question. If men are dogs, what are you calling his parents, in particular, his mother?I'undi.	negative
title: Context is everything [SEP] content: I read this book before Frey revealed that it was fiction, and kept thinking, there is no way that this could be true. It did hold my attention, but in that "truth is stranger than fiction" way. Once you know that it really isn't true, its just a badly written and improbable tale made up by an idiot.	negative
title: Calphalon Convenience but Poor Baking Results [SEP] content: After several weeks of use, I've also found that these sheets tend to burn dough on the bottom long before you see any hint of any browning around the edges. This has caused us problems on several established recipes and the sheets don't seem to allow for any workaround, i.e. lower oven temperature and/or shorter bake time.Like all Calphalon, they clean up very easily but what's the point if you can't trust them with your food in the first place?PROS* Extremely reliable nonstick surfaces and durable construction as you'd expect from CalphalongCONS* Uneven baking results will leave you with lots of "surprise" burnt items.	negative
title: John's Gone Hollywood! [SEP] content: The Street Lawyer is a disappointing LITTLE book that reads, to me, more like a 90-minute, cookie-cutter movie script and not the full-length, page-turning novel I'd expect from someone capable of A Time to Kill or The Partner. The opinions expressed by the author appeared long ago in The Communist Manifesto, there's no character development, and the loose ends left in end are too numerous to mention.If you can't wait for a copy at the library, at least wait for the paperback.	negative
title: When everything is just average... [SEP] content: Compared to HITNF, Q2k & Tribe, this must be their best album so far, but if you just listened to the complexity of OM I, the sad beauty of Promised Land, the energy of Warning, or the divine tech-metal of Rage for Order, even the more commercial Empire, you will be sadly dissapointed. Do yourself a favour, check out Pain of Salvation, or Evergrey... Maybe Wolverine?	negative
title: Nothing comparable to the Aztec [SEP] content: It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer), but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain, derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would have expected much more by the author of the Aztec.	negative
title: What are these other reviews? [SEP] content: This controller is terrible. The only positive thing I could say about this controller is you can throw it at the wall and it won't break. The sticks are hard to move and don't allow for the pressure sensitivity required for enjoyable gaming. The buttons are stiff. The handles are big and uncomfortable. The included headset is uncomfortable to a grown adult. I didn't use the included headset after the first night. Overall, I would say move on to the next after market controller.	negative
title: You Can Do Better... [SEP] content: I bought this book along with another book for baby shower decoration ideas. Boy, was I disappointed. The book is boring and the ideas are not at all original. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one.Now, if you want a really good book with great ideas, try "Themed Baby Showers: Mother Goose to Noah's Ark" by Becky Long. It's an excellent book with excellent, original ideas.	negative
title: Badly written [SEP] content: The confusing presentation, clumsy writing, and numerous factual errors make this book almost unreadable.	negative
title: Disappointing..... [SEP] content: I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer.	negative
title: I am certain that Mr. Beckwith's intentions were pure. [SEP] content: However, I feel that one should do complete and thorough research in order for his writings to be of any benefit to the reader. I appreaciate his efforts but would recommend other sources for a true seeker of the truth.	negative
title: seam ripped after only a few days & couldn't be fixed [SEP] content: My kids were so excited to get this last Christmas. I read the reviews,but purchased anyway hoping that if we were really careful, things would be different for us. My kids are small (20, 30 and 35 pounds, when we purchased this) and they were super careful in the ballpit. (All shoes, hair clips, and accessories came off before going in) They treated it as gently as they possibly could. Unfortunately, it ripped along a seam within the first month. We made several attempts to fix it, but it continued to get small rips in different places along the seam and never held air again. So disappointing. It's seriously just a poorly made product.	negative
title: UNrealistic [SEP] content: While parts of this book make for a good read, it is hard to believe that such a spastic person has everything work out for just in time to write a book. If you must read this, skip the	negative
title: these guys ripped me off! [SEP] content: I purchased a box of 12 Uniball pens, I even showed the listing to friends to make sure that the add was for 12 pens and not one. But they shipped me one pen, and charged me 6.99 shipping to boot! I refused the shipment, as per my postal carrier's instructions, and tried to contact the company, but they never even tried to get back to me. So, lesson learned.	negative
title: i dont want part of a differential equation, i want all of it [SEP] content: chapter one is all it took for me. no worked out examples. chapter one explains the thoery and what is happening with the heat equation but the problems at the end of the chapter have answers which the text did not tell you how to get. either way, a partial differential equations class requires lots of studying but i recommend not using this book.	negative
title: pants are dragging [SEP] content: Will not shop with this vendor again. I ordered 2 pair of jeans. After washing them to shrink, they were still 3 inches too long. CLOTHING TAGS DID NOT MATCH the actual size. I'm a guy, I build houses but can't sew, so now I have to pay a seamstress. Vendor sucks, but Amazon was good about the whole thing.Dano.	negative

title: Revelations ?? Hardly !! [SEP] content: It is difficult to fathom what was intended when the hype said " The never before told story" Excuse ME .... what was never before revealed ? Ms. Crier can't be criticized for cashing in on the notoriety of the case any more than any of the other "authors" but it was hardly worth the $26 it cost to read her take on the case.It is amazing to me that there are still people (among whom are self proclaimed law experts) who maintain that Peterson was convicted on flimsy, circumstantial evidence. The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence. That pretty much says it all !The book was definitely not worth reading in my humble opinion.	negative
title: Gave it away just to get rid of it. [SEP] content: Bought it as an after-thought with another sexy DVD, which I liked very much. Good actors on this one, so expected better. After seeing it, I told my husband to just drop it in the garbage, he suggested we give it to a friend who will watch anything. Except for a couple funny lines, I thought it was a total waste of my time. Mary	negative
title: This stuff is garbage [SEP] content: DO NOT, under any circumstances buy this RAM.PC133 SDRAM. How basic can you get? According to the specifications, it should have had no trouble working in our computer. Well this stuff is junk. Had to put the old RAM back in to get the machine to boot up, and now off to find something reliable.	negative
title: Not her best work. [SEP] content: I was somewhat disappointed in this one, and I have enjoyed Hunter's previous writings. Petty as it seems, I was distracted and annoyed with the silliness of the verbiage used by the main character as a substitute for "cuss words". I could have read right on through normal profanity and enjoyed the story a little more.	negative
title: Call it InterDev for Dummies [SEP] content: The Mastering Series is poor book for mastering ASP. Consider it a basic help file with some simple examples. To learn ASP and InterDev, get the Wrox book. Microsoft Press should be embarassed putting out this material.	negative
title: Way Out There [SEP] content: I admit to being sucked in by this one. But, after spending part of an evening reading it (it is a quick read), I was rather miffed by the ending, which was really implausible. The DaVinci Code has a much better ending.	negative

title: A book for specialists [SEP] content: More than a book it is a collection of papers, not always easy to understand and written in academic language. It could be used as a reference by one who knows already the subject. Not recommended for beginners	negative
title: Didn't fulfill its promise, but I'm glad I read it. [SEP] content: One of the other reviewers perhaps said it best: I really wanted to like this book. As a mid-life motorcyclist (Harley) and pilot, with a penchant for old airplanes and motorcycles, I have long harbored the dream of restoring something really classic; a Harley J, a '32 Ford, a Stearman biplane, etc. So I grabbed the book without a second thought, anticipating a real restoration chronicle. What I got was part soap opera and part Pirsig, with a too-large serving of jobbing out a restoration to various subcontractors, and not enough nuts and bolts. Wish it had been edited bt Tom and Ray Magliozzi (The Tappet Brothers).	negative
title: Read the reviews before you buy [SEP] content: As the previous reviews pointed out, most of these are not the original recordings and definitely not worth the money. I would give it 0 stars if I could.	negative
title: So so aweful [SEP] content: This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.	negative
title: This isn't what I expected [SEP] content: I ordered Onieda flatware to add to my existing set. The pattern is called "Flight". The flatware I received was not quite the same pattern, and the quality of the flatware was cheap and light weight. My original set is nicely weighted and looks very good. I was highly disappointed.	negative
title: Ok, but not great [SEP] content: The book didn't seem to be updated much. I liked the SAT for dummies book better for studying.	negative
title: Big disappointment [SEP] content: I remember how happy I was when I bought this cd several years ago...and how disappointed I'd been afterwards. This cd is just pure crap. I could have never expected something so commercial and bad-written from who I considered (and I know I'm not the only one) the king of r'n'b.Apparently double-up is just as bad as this one, so I've never bought any cd from Robert again.This is really a waste, the guy used to be so talented!	negative
title: Not so good book [SEP] content: This book is not as good as the other I bought. I would not recommend it.It give reader some information but other books are better to read and understand.	negative
title: Worst book ever [SEP] content: I was truly interested when I heard about this book. Part of it takes place in the SF Bay Area where I live. I concerns (I thought) gold coins and Priests Grade, two subjects also of interest.I give it 1 star because there is no 0 stars. It is the worst written book I have ever tried to read. I have tried to force my way thru thinking it would get better. It never does. I tried over and over and over. It is so badly written I had to look at the page numbers to be sure it wasn't bound out of order. I think the other reviews were written by the authors mother and she never read it. GARBAGE !!!!!	negative
title: The Hunter [SEP] content: too creepy to keep reading. knowing there are a sackful of books about the same bad guy convinced me that the hero guy I like in crime novels was not forthcoming.	negative
title: not well made at all [SEP] content: My mom purchased this for my daughter who is 12 months. The velcro on it very sharp and scraped her face, to where it drew blood. Also, one of the dolls feet has no toes sewn but the other one does. The diaper and pants constantly come off. It is a very soft doll excpet for the velcro edges being so sharp. She purchased it from amazon to, not sure if it was a defected doll or what. My daughter plays with it without the clothes on it now. I personally wouldn't spend the money for it, my daughter likes every doll she has just as much as this one.	negative
title: Whiney and chock full of sloppy reasoning [SEP] content: Maas whines for page after nauseating page about how everything bad in the world is a result of capitalism. He stops just short of blaming it for earthquakes and volcanoes. However, he completely ignores the fact that over the past 200 years, capitalism has brought about unimaginable increases in standard of living, longevity, and prosperity for all, while every attempt at socialism has brought about misery, poverty, and death.	negative
title: DIDN'T WORK VERY LONG [SEP] content: I was going to keep looking for this item and reorder it when it became available until I read the review from lady from Louisville, Kentucky. Just like her I had this oven for about three or four months - used it about five times and it just quit heating up. Maybe the manufacturer should look into this. I too, had thought that I may have gotten a dudd until I read her review.Diane -	negative
title: If you buy this its your fault [SEP] content: I love the people that come in here and say the negative posts are all from the same "few people".. lol go check out the star wars galaxies forums and see if we are a vocal minority. Soe spies. Anywho... this game was the best one ive EVER played, hence why i stuck around for a couple years. I had a blast... wish i could tell you it was fun now, but its absolutely abismal.Make your own decision but dont say you werent told... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.	negative
title: Don't Recomend [SEP] content: I disliked the use of language - you can have a good book and not fill it with explicatives. Also the flow was very choppy.I would not recomend wasting your money on this book.	negative
title: Stay back! [SEP] content: Living in a country where stations don't need much power to get good coverage, I figured this might be a good buy. I was wrong, way wrong.Even the weakest of stations step over the transmitter's signal like it wasn't there. I had to resort to tuning slightly off frequency so the FM stations would be tuned out.. and even then performance was only marginal.I'm taking this thing back to the store tomorrow. Not worth it.	negative
title: tired social darwinism [SEP] content: This stuff is not total BS, but I would be hard pressed to give any novel so aestetically displeasing as this anything more than a 7, even with some great passages. The characters are one dimensional, the philosophy is half baked, and the plot is does not exist. A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy	negative
title: JAWS OOPS!, YOU DID IT AGAIN. [SEP] content: Jaws the Revenge is not simply a bad movie, but a stupid and a shameful one, a rip-off, andf that's still a surprise, because the film is the fourth in a series that has still served universal pictures for many years, and the movie stars lorraine gary, the wife of the chief executive officer, wasn't there someone in charge that the film has to be at least this bad, I Guess not, because the film would have been called Eminem the Revenge. Rating No Stars.	negative
title: Unreliable [SEP] content: Phone died after two days of operation. Handset would not connect with base. Also, handsets get VERY HOT after being on the charger for a few hours. Returned.	negative
title: Quirky Compared To 4-Port Hub [SEP] content: This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed.	negative
title: Waste of Money [SEP] content: I have done 3 experiments from this kit so far and every single one was a flop. I even went to the store and bought new yeast because I thought maybe it was old but it didn't make any difference. I wish I could get my money back for this kit. It was a complete waste of time and money.	negative
title: excelente libro, pesima presentacion [SEP] content: de la mitad en delante hay una exagercion de version y palabras incompletas. compra otra version. se dificulta cpmletmente la lectur y la hce obsoleta	negative
title: Incredibly Noisy [SEP] content: While it does move a good amount of air, the Whisper 60 emits an incredibly loud buzzing noise. The noise can really fill a room and quickly become very annoying. The Whisper AP150 I bought to replace this is much quieter (even quieter than my Whisper 10) and the closest I've seen an air pump get to "silence." This one, however, is quite the opposite.	negative
title: Very poor base design & instructions [SEP] content: Followed directions to the letter. The pole base (mine came as 2 pieces) came apart because the two pieces didn't fit together well. There's no reference point or specific depth mentioned as to how deep the poles should be connected together. So we tamped them as far as we could drive them, and filled both pieces with concrete as instructed. After a few days, the top split from the bottom. Now I have a base filled with concrete and concreted in the ground, and an upper piece filled with concrete and laying on the ground. Worthless. I hope their return & exchange works well. Very poor design & instructions. Buy something else.	negative
title: Not for me [SEP] content: I hate to give low points since I know what it takes to make these films. But somehow I wasn't enthused about this film.	negative
title: Difficulty [SEP] content: Well I have mixed feelings about this headphones. They're in all regards superb for the price unfortunately I about a month after buying my first pair they broke. The left ear went dead. I thought it was just my bad luck so I bought myself another pair and low a behold a little over a month later the same problem. I tried to contact amazon and J Lab to activate my warranty. It has been over a week and I have not gotten a response from either Amazon or J Lab. So I would say avoid this product if you can not because of the product itself but because overall they're for the consumer who likes to throw money away repeatedly.Addendum: I contacted JLAB and they sent me a new pair because I was within the warranty. My opinion of these head phones has increased substantially.	negative
title: AWFUL [SEP] content: The seller themselves were prompt with shipment and great with packaging, but this product was not worth the care the took. We couldn't use the product at all. The holes were not properly drilled to allow any screw keep the product in place in the computer. The plastic is beyond cheap. We have gone back and ordered a proper aluminum bracket and hope to have better luck. Please beware when purchasing this item!	negative
title: had to return it [SEP] content: I was delighted with the features and appearance of this watch after I recieved it. I needed to have a couple of links removed from the band (not a small guy...5'8", 220lb. Three separate jewelers were not able to remove the links, so I needed ot return it. Bummer.	negative
title: Lame At Best! [SEP] content: An Elitist List written by someone who in my opinion is far from balanced, who has appeared on Fox News 8 times in the last 20 days promoting this, and not appearing on any other major network due to lack of invitation???I rest my case.Poor Al! Cover material.	negative
title: Missing text/sentences make this annoying to read [SEP] content: I was amazed when I first discovered the missing text/sentences in this edition, but I am halfway through this book and have many many times come across places where it looks like this: ......" said Vronsky. And the missing text is just not in there to read!This is a five star book but I give a 1 star rating on account of missing text which is unforgivable IMO.I don't understand how this has happened???	negative
title: Far Different From Other Nelly Tracks [SEP] content: I have listened to a number of Nelly Furtado tracks now and then but her latest single "Maneater" is massively different from all her other offerings. This is the first single released from her brand new album "Loser" and is a vivid revelation of the Canadian female solo artist's versatality and lack of fear to trespass into unaccustomed territories. This song is absolutely sensual and the sexy voice of the singer lends it more than just a shade of wickedness. This track has spend more than a fortnight at the pole position of the UK Singles Chart and in the process becomes the first single of 2006 to accomplish this amazing feat. "Maneater" is a great track and illustrates another new dimension of this female vocalist'd msic-making.	negative
title: good writing unfortunately plagued with misogyny [SEP] content: As someone who generally appreciates good writing, I looked forward to reading this collection. It only left me infuriated. Updike is an amazing writer. He truly knows the art and beauty of the craft. But all of his stories belie his misogyny. Men resent their wives, women are portrayed in one or two negative ways--it ruined the whole book for me. So I switched to Flannery O'Connor instead. Good writing, no misogyny.	negative
title: Silly, Amaturish, "Most Beautiful" typifies poor writing [SEP] content: To suggest these works well or even moderately well written is to confuse the issues we have judged to be important in good writing. Burkowski has an obvious gift for crafting fine sentences, and to construct tales directly from life experience or perceived life experience is a beautiful thing, but not to spend even a moment making any sense of or trying to understand these experiences proves a true lack of insight. Semi-literate six year olds, lost in a chaotic twirl of inchoate thoughts and ramblings are capable of the same. All of this is not even to mention the trite, ridiculous heart that palps pitifully within each of these ill-considered works. Literature is more than this! For those who believe there is genuine meaning in organized human expression for the sake of communication, please do not be midlead by these silly stories.	negative
title: You get only 10% of what you want to know about the breed [SEP] content: This book should only cost 10% of its price, because only 10% of its content is actually devoted to the American Bulldog breed. Don't blame the author, though. As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is "standard" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% "standard" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed. YOU CAN GET MORE VALUABLE information from the few good web sites in the internet.	negative
title: I wish I could give it zero stars. [SEP] content: I received this as a birthday present. I first tried making a loaf of honey wheat bread and followed the instructions from the manual. I was happy with how easy it was....I was unhappy with the results. Basically after the cycle was over, I was presented with a soggy brick of half dough/half undercooked bread. It was inedible and I basically wasted a bunch of ingredients. I thought maybe it was just a first time around mistake on my part and decided I'd give it another shot. I made the easiest possible recipe and once again I wasted 4 cups of flour plus all of the other ingredients on a soggy half baked lump of dough that had to go in the trash. I've never had a brand new machine just not work at all. It was really disappointing. If you're thinking of buying this bread maker I urge you not to.	negative
title: Zzzzz [SEP] content: I'm glad people don't write science fiction like this anymore. If they did, I'd be reading westerns instead.The science is terrible, and the characters and plot are even worse. If you want to read good science fiction, look somewhere else. And L. Ron Hubbard had the skill to make even the most incredible action scenes boring.	negative
title: 5 minute treat [SEP] content: The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix. Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear. If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.	negative
title: Too much talking [SEP] content: You will spend more time hearing biographical anecdotes rather than the actual hands details you may be looking for. Hire a makeup artist.	negative
title: Wow - what imagination [SEP] content: Despite the fact that the witnesses, ballistics, autopsies, and sheriff reports all point to the fact that there were no "Christian martyrs" at columbine, the author tries to get us to swallow the stories anyway, as if we have no other source for information. He claims that the sheriff and media are covering the truth, his "truth" being that there is a war against Christianity (sheriff and media are fighting Jesus). That is just the beginning of the bunk this guy tries to force feed young America. This is propagand on the largest scale. The good side is that most will realize that this is put out by some who are desperately trying to hang on to their time in the spotlight (and make a little money while they are at it), even if they have to use tragic teen deaths to do so.	negative
title: These are not 18/10 Stainless [SEP] content: I had received 2 sets of this silverware from Bed Bath and Beyond... Sept. 2006.I ordered this set to replace some missing pieces.NOT a matchI read the product description 18/0 and thought it was a typo because further down on the page in the product description it says, " Crafted of durable 18/10 stainless steel and designed to be used on a daily basis"I'd send them back, they are cheap compared to what I had, but my hubby already had thrown them in the dishwasher and we were already using them before I really had a chance to check them out.I could pick them out just by weight alone...	negative
title: If only I could give 0 stars... [SEP] content: Die Trying's debut LP is an extremely sad excuse for music-- every song sounds the same, and to make matters worse, DT sound like a carbon copy of Papa Roach. Yep, DT appear to be playing Papa Roach b-sides (I don't think I need to tell you how bad that is).Die Trying are for those of you who find Papa Roach's sound to be the best thing since sliced bread. If you have taste in music though, give this album a wide berth.	negative
title: Horrible Movie [SEP] content: This movie has made it into the top ten WORST movies ever. Virtually no character development and when there was it was too little too late. The director is applauding I could have directed this movie better drunk. And villianizing the wolf.....jeez THATS a brand new idea. Ugh. If you want to see a movie about real men surviving and connecting man to man I highly recommend The Brotherhood of the Wolf. Don't bother with this movie.	negative
title: Worse than a bad case of diarrhea [SEP] content: Some time ago, I had a really bad case of diarrhea. I thought that after I flushed the toilet, it would be gone forever. Little did I know that Sarah Palin and her handlers were siphoning from the sewage pipes of Los Angeles County and repackaging it into a 'documentary.'Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have made a film with more right-wing propaganda than this piece of garbage.	negative
title: Sorry, I found it boring... [SEP] content: Actually, we read this in our book club and nicknamed it "The Practical Tramp". Outside of a mildly interesting view of the era, the characters weren't all that likeable or relatable.	negative
title: Cables [SEP] content: Connected this cable to my TV and to a HDMI Sat. Receiver. Worked fine to begin with then the colors went crazy and stayed with the wrong color and bad image. Cable was well constructed but something caused problems. When things went funny the audio went off and would not come back on through that cable.	negative
title: Don't waste your time and money- see the Matrix instead [SEP] content: This was a poor movie, not even saved by two, or should I say one and a half action scenes- one where the major fights an Uzi toting baddie and the end fight, with a bug-like tank. The music and environment shots were too long and horrible- as boring as Blade Runner. There are a lot of incomprehensible technotalk scenes AND lots of philosophical psycho-babble scenes. Plus, the animation is UGLY. The major looks ugly, the men look poor, and there's a lot of black. While I didn't LOVE the MAtrix, it too was confusing, it made alot more sense than Ghost in the Shell.	negative
title: My movie review [SEP] content: The Amazon quality was excellent, but I did NOT like the movie!! I enjoy the availability of quality new movies provided by Amazon, and thought thi would be a good movie! Not so!!	negative
title: Show, slow, slow... [SEP] content: I've read and enjoyed this author's previous series set in Alaska, so I was really looking forward to a new sleuth and a new setting. However, this novel reads more like a travelogue with a bit of mystery thrown in as an afterthought. There are endless (and I do mean endless) descriptions of the scenery, the flora, the fauna .. and minute-by-minute descriptions of Maxie's daily activities. The suspense, when it occurs, is good, but there just isn't enough of it.	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: I'll PAY you to take my copy away [SEP] content: My wife and I have made a film that we have entitled "The Watching of Blair Witch Project." This new film depicts the two of us trying desperately to get through Blair Witch Project. Included are horrifying scenes of the intense nausea and occasional vomiting caused by the incessant, unnecessary, annoying camera motion throughout Blair Witch. You will also find frightening the utter boredom we experienced, watching three immature teenagers babble and scream and the babble some more for 87 minutes. I highly recommend "The Watching of Blair Witch Project." If you're at all interested in seeing the original film, Blair Witch Project, I'll give you a dollar to take mine far far away from my video library. The used DVD stores won't even take it from me.	negative
title: Bitterly disappointing...... [SEP] content: What can I say, even though I'm for most free expression and have owned adult comics filled with all sorts of stuff for years, I found this one boardering on disgusting and offensive. but that's what really got me annoyed - the "art" is just plain awful, something you'd expect from a 13-year old with too much unsupervised time and clearly an inflated opinion of his talant. Half the time the characters don't even look human - nor anotomicly proportioned nor drawn with any consistancy.There is no interest in any more volumes, overpriced for the thin book that showed up, and I'd advise others to spend your money on something that is a better value and is a better product.	negative
title: worst game ever [SEP] content: Im a big gamer and i have to say i was excited too play this game but after 5 minutes of playing it i regreted buying it. its really hard to understand. making songs on this game sound fun but its really crappy and boring save your money and dont buy this waste of time game	negative
title: Monkey Madness!!! [SEP] content: On a trip to the United States I passed through the lovely town of Portland, Oregon and found this atrocity in a massive used book store. The cover looked funny and entertaining, but all these thoughts were quelled the moment I began to read the book. Nonetheless its sheer stupidity kept me turning the pages.Upon reading this book, I was struck by the ignorance of this author. Not only does this short novel lack any coherent structure, but also is a sour attempt at humor. I can understand that Bush's face looks like a chimp's, but joking about how he has been switched at birth for a "hairless chimpanzee" is unimaginative and banal. My question is, "who cares?" If you want to chastise a political leader, why not do so intelligently, citing resources and using facts to back up your claims. Quotes used out of context don't cut it.A very unhappy read. Overall very disappointing and a waste of your time. Hardly worth a review.-John	negative
title: cr^p [SEP] content: This movie sucks. It's not a Jet Li movie. Jet li has some bs small parts in the movie. Jet Li should have gotten a lot more time in that movie. It's not a good martial arts movie.	negative
title: Absolute Garbage [SEP] content: There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well.	negative
title: Defective [SEP] content: I purchased a total of 8 (2-10 foot & 6-6foot) HMDI cables. The 6 foot cable that we used, didn't work.	negative
title: All The Words Are There... But A Poor Quality Book [SEP] content: This book is acceptable in its words, but the edition is poorly published. I was looking for something to use for writing my Thesis. I am not sure I can (or should) quote this edition for my Thesis.	negative
title: What went wrong? [SEP] content: Whomever designed this was definitely a minimalist. The "slot" for business cards is barely useable, the zippered compartment for the keyboard is a challenge to zip up- hope you're not in a hurry and there is absolutely NO room for an extra stylus, a memory card/stick. Save some $ and look for something else.	negative
title: Falls apart [SEP] content: I love the idea of these but they keep falling apart. I bought 6 total because my original 2 fell apart so often that I wanted to replace them but those fell apart too. My kids are no more than 30 lbs using them.	negative
title: Not Worth The Buy [SEP] content: I bought these strings last week and have already broken string, and other strings show signs of fraying only one week in.	negative
title: Does not live up to the hype. [SEP] content: After reading this book for my October bookclub meeting, I was hard pressed to find out what all the hype about this book was about. While there were aspects of the book that were thought provoking, I failed to see the merit this book supposedly has. I also found myself wondering why his conversation was worth publishing. I found it interesting that on many occasions when the book got boring, which it often did, I could jump around and not lose a beat....that's not saying much. In the end, I just did not like the book very much, again, aspects of it were thought provoking, but all in all I'd not highly reccomend this book. The Road Less Traveled was better.	negative
title: SUPER OUTDATED [SEP] content: This product is very old but durable. To sync it you need to have a super-downgraded active-sync. I used it for personal notes and word documents, but it did not last long. the internet service needed for it is too outdated to use. I would not recommend this product due to its battery life and inability to connect online or to a computer without very downgraded synchronizing tool. Just save your money for a windows phone...	negative
title: Very dated material [SEP] content: The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful. It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated. Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices. It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book.	negative
title: costly but worth it [SEP] content: I long quit listening with my SR-60s because of the pad discomfort. Now they are so old the pads were turning brown anyway, so I looked into replacements. With a little bending up of the head-piece, these L-CUSH's fit great, and I can listen to excellent sound without being tortured by the way they feel on my head. The price seemed a little excessive, but after all this time it is like getting a new pair of Grado's for $25. Really not a bad deal, and I couldn't find any other way to rescue these headphones.	positive
title: Love it! [SEP] content: A delightful, light and pleasant tea with wonderful health benefits. We originally purchased because we heard it was a natural aid for breathing difficulties and sinus problems but grew accustomed to the flavor and drink it regularly. My husband adds raw honey to his tea and after drinking will eat some of the seeds in the tea bag, too.	positive
title: Exactly what I expected [SEP] content: Mostly older songs, some "crossovers" duplicated in other Hal Leonard fake books. If you are looking for more recent music, say from the last 15 years or so, this book will disappoint. Meets my needs exactly, so very satisfied. Bought a used copy for the price break. Some of the pages had been dog-eared as place markers, but utility and completeness not affected.	positive
title: Spoiler [SEP] content: For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?	positive
title: amazing [SEP] content: this carpet cleaner makes wonders! just spray it over, let it sit for a couple of minutes, and rub it with terry towel, after it dries off, vacuum and it makes your carpets look like new. Probably the best carpet cleaner i've ever used.	positive
title: Ah the games woman play [SEP] content: While I generally don't like to see women play games to win a man, Pandora's character begins her games in a way that is engaging and entertaining. There does come a point at which you just want to say, oh give it up already.... but just as you say that, the heroine herself begins to question the game as well! Great timing, witty dialogue	positive
title: This is readable although it is DC crossover [SEP] content: It is not even near three books with death and return of Superman, but it has great ending. You don't have to know lot about DC history before events in this book. Three and half stars , maybe...	positive
title: Print Cartridges [SEP] content: Excellent bargain...I have ordered this product for the past year and will continue to do so. Excellent print life for the cartridges.	positive
title: Fusion Frenzy review [SEP] content: This game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends. The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics.	positive
title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: This Hard Drive actually works! [SEP] content: After suffering with a useless Maxtor 160 HD, this WD drive works as advertised. I wanted a HD that you could simply 'drag & drop' files onto the WD desktop icon - saved & done. Files can then be recovered or reviewed easily by clicking on the same icon. The USB power source eliminates one 110 V plug in from your setup. A final plus - the WD HD is compact - 1/4 the size of the Maxtor!The Maxtor HD required a schedule for saving files - totally useless - it made a nice hum (so does my clothes dryer) & the entry screen appeared on the desktop, but it never worked!! Want to buy it cheap??	positive
title: Mean Girls was The Best film ever made and still is today since 04. [SEP] content: Mean Girls I would have to say was the best film I have ever seen. It had great acting by Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, Rachel McAdams as Regina George, and of course Tina Fey as Sharon Norbury. The other performers were great as well. The script/ dialouge was great I loved it. It was just the best film I've ever seen. If you love comedy's/romance's thoose type's of films you will defently love Mean Girls.	positive
title: This book will change your mind about war. [SEP] content: I recently took a class on war, and this book was used as one of the textbooks. After reading this book, my entire preception of war has changed. Mr. Blainey has shown me so much that I never even thought about before. Not only that, but he exposes several myths about wars. For example, some people believe that wars can happen by accident. Blainey even puts up a good argument for it, but in the end, he explains why that is folly. It is truly an excelent book that I would recommend to anyone interested in war.	positive
title: Very good UK entry [SEP] content: While we in the US load up on VH1 celebreality, the Brits make a great zombie mini series. Once again, corporate America complains about the internet, yet they don't make it available in the US. If you liked Dawn Of The Dead 2004/28 days etc, you should "seek" this one out. Very enjoyable story of an outbreak on the set of Big Brother.	positive
title: Pricey ~ but it delivers the goods [SEP] content: Good information on the periods, materials and types of antique boxes most frequently collected. Photography excellent and item pricing accurate. I love this book and it's helped me enormously.	positive
title: Works great! [SEP] content: This thing is very fast and works exactly as advertised. I'd buy it again. The only minor issue I have with it is that the cap should be easier to take off.	positive
title: Yummy! [SEP] content: These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!	positive
title: Connor loves it! [SEP] content: I'm so happy that I bought this for my new little man, Connor Thomas. He loves it. At first I was only going to buy one but I got such a good deal, that I got three (blue, white and green.) And what a good decision that was! Connor loves his blankets! We have to have one with us at all times. They're light weight, perfect for crib bedding, beautiful, and sooo soft!!! WOW! I wish this brand sold them in larger sizes for my bed. I'm very please with my purchase. If you buy one you won't regret. Worth every cent.	positive
title: Good seller good product [SEP] content: I mistyped my shipping address but Cables Unlimited corrected the problem immediately and re-shipped at no extra cost. They provided great communication and cooperation. When the ZipLinq arrived, it worked fine. I use it to connect my MP3 player to my car stereo. ZipLinq provides a secure connection at both ends, it is easy to adjust the length of the cable and the sound quality is excellent. The retracting cable works smoothly and it makes storage easy and convenient. I hope it lasts a long time.	positive
title: Move Over Harry Connick, Jr [SEP] content: I purchased this CD yesterday and I totally agree with the majority here Matt Dusk is a wonderfully talented new artist with a lush voice and he isn't bad to look at either. The title song "Two Shots" is a great song written by Bono. My personal faves are "Lonely Road" and "Every Mother's Son". For the reviewers who stated that there is nothing new and original here try listening to it again. I think Ole Blue Eyes would be quite impressed with Matt.	positive
title: Very romantic [SEP] content: You can listen to the entire album without skiping to the next track.A very nice mix of country, folk and popular music.Must have album for dinner parties!!!One of the greatest voices I have ever heard.	positive
title: Funny [SEP] content: Best show on television. With the rest of the television becoming reality tv, it is good to see something well writtten, funny and no canned laughter.	positive
title: Organic bar with good taste and texture [SEP] content: This is one of the better tasting bars I've tried, but as always, your mileage may vary. For the most part, I'm not a huge fan of "nutty" bars, but this is an exception. While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other "energy" bars on the market that are packed with sugars. I think these would be great to carry along on a hike or other day outing where you want something quick. I'll be purchasing more of these.	positive
title: Great MP3; Needs work on the video and shuffle play flexibility [SEP] content: This ipod is great for storing your entire CD collection and still have plenty of space for your latest 100-2000 pictures to share with family and friends. I would like to see some improvements from Apple on the following:1. Video quality - the screen is small and the quality is not real great especially in fast moving action shots2. Must use iTunes - This is sad because there are better applications out there3. Shuffle Play is limited - It is difficult to set a shuffle play for anything smaller than the entire ipod or a playlist. For 2 - 4 GB that works ok, but when you have your entire CD collection loaded up, it is difficult to just play a particular Genre or even artist.	positive
title: Carcassonne The River 2 [SEP] content: I cannot play without the River 2. It adds a whole new dynamic competitiveness to start each game. A must have	positive
title: loves to read [SEP] content: The book is a very good read for anyone who likes drama mixed with romance. Altho most of the time I could predict where the plot was going, it was still very interesting to see how the author delt with it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense.	positive
title: This spectacle is truly fantastic. [SEP] content: To experience Alejandro Sanz, you need to see where he`s comming from. for those who didn`t know who Sanz was before the unplugged, this is a great chance to see what is all about. This concert take place in Barcelona, and you can see his "Tour Mas" one of the biggets points in his career. take the opportun ity to see him live, and to discover the real Alejandro on stage.	positive
title: Interesting, well-written! [SEP] content: Greatly enjoyed learning about the history of zero and loved Kaplan's writing style. His enthusiasm for this topic is clear throughout the book and he keeps the topic interesting and dynamic, rather than reverting to a textbook format.	positive
title: Great help with plantar fasciitis! [SEP] content: This support and the night split fixed my plantar fasciitis when nothing else did. Highly recommended! Buy this!	positive
title: Enjoyable Small Group Swing [SEP] content: Until I heard this cd, I never made the association of the similarities of playing and tone between Pete Fountain and Benny Goodman. I suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections ("Oh, Lady Be Good", "Avalon", "Shine" and "Rosetta" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of Red Norvo), guitar, bass and drums.Except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with New Orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set.	positive
title: Awesome sweeper for pet hair! [SEP] content: I absolutely love this sweeper. I keep it charged all the time and use whenever there is anything to pick up. It actually picks up pet hair better than my vacuum cleaners.	positive
title: Fascinating [SEP] content: This a very interesting book, and will give you information you probably never knew... some entries are a little glossed over, but for the most part it will keep you busy for a while. It doesn't discuss information from the the most recent novels (Like the 2nd Han Solo Trilogy) or the Phantom Menace of course, but oh well.	positive
title: Portable [SEP] content: I love the portability of this new Interplak. I've been using their products for over 15 years and was able to easily take it with me on a recent trip.	positive
title: A nice change of pace. [SEP] content: This is by no means a strong tea, it was not meant to be. The flavor is great. I normally make my tea from scratch but have these around when I am on the run. The price is very reasonable and I will certainly be purchasing more. For something a bit different, I certainly recommend you give this tea a try.	positive
title: To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising [SEP] content: What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as " Touched with fire" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II.	positive
title: It's that good [SEP] content: This book is so good you will stop reading it less than half-way through so you can start experiencing the NOW that it describes so well.	positive
title: This lady sings the Blues! [SEP] content: Shemekia can belt them out with the best of them. I first got "Wicked" and knew she was a young singer with a voice that had the power of the older more experienced female blues singers. When I got Turn the Heat Up, her earlier Cd, I was impressed with her vocal range, her gospel feel, R&B , all around blues. Shemekia is going to be a force on the blues scene so take notice! Congratulations on your Handy awards, we will be hearing more and more of you Shemekia! I would give this a 4 1/2 star rating if there was one. Her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come.	positive
title: wanda the whale [SEP] content: It works great just alittle slower than doing it your self.But it is great too have helps alot very easy too use not hard too put it together great little thing too have if you have a pool	positive
title: Corrs at there best and Great quality [SEP] content: I am a huge Corrs fan, and have every album and DVD they have ever put out. I strongly believe that there first two albums are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out. SOund is fantastic, video is fantastic and it is an overall fantastic buy and must have for any fan of great music.	positive
title: Great Bargain!! [SEP] content: I also bought the Sylvania DVC860D DVD & VCR combo as a replacement for a cheap "Monkey Wards" VCR I bought 8yrs. ago for a much greater price than this unit. What a great Christmas buy at $99.99! It works great in re-running VHS Tapes out of my library and has played all the DVD's I have burnt with my new Plextor 708A DVD Burner.Also, this unit even hooked up to my 14yr. old TV using RF cables: how about that! This product does it all that they say it will, and is a fantastic bargain. I truly recommend this product to all. Remember, just because it cost more doesn't mean its better!!	positive
title: The best book in the world!!!!!!! 5/9/1999! [SEP] content: This book is very interesting. I just got it today from amazon.com. Have you read the part about the youngest married couple or the longest fingernails or even the biggest tumor?! I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for something to read that is exciting and facinating.!	positive
title: Love this Camera [SEP] content: So far I have had no complaints with this camera. It gives me all the manual options I like to have. I love the way it recycles so quickly so I am ready to take another picture. Somtimes the camera is out of focus and I can't quite figure out the problem. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm sure it's a setting that I'm not quite of. With all the options, I sometimes forget what setting I have it on.	positive
title: BAY AREA MACK DOWN [SEP] content: TAKE THIS ALBUM FOR WHAT IT IS. IT IS THE PIMPS EARLY BOOTLEG, BAY AREA UNDERGROUND, RAP. OLD BEATS WITH BETTER THAN AVERAGE RHYMES. BUT IF YOU LOVE TOO $HORT, YOU NEED TO OWN IT...	positive
title: Outstanding [SEP] content: Probably the finest expose written detailing the forgotten history and law behind the way our country used to view military operations and service. Much of today's understanding, regarding the military establishment and our government's use of it, is a recent development. Up until the Korean war, the military was under the exclusive direction of the Congress; but this book shows how the Executive branch has usurped Congress's authority with the public's knowledge and acquiescence.	positive
title: The Pushcart War! [SEP] content: This was one of the greatest books i read as a child! I loved the characters of the pushcart king, old anna, and wanda gambling. this is a great book for anyone who just likes stories that could be real, could have happened-but didn't. It's a sweet story and it can be enjoyed by kids 5 to 50. I would recommend this book to anyone. BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!	positive
title: why you should add this CD to your collection [SEP] content: I just returned (Wednesday, Sept. 29), from one of the most brilliant concerts I have ever witnessed! As per usual, most of us "oldies" wanted to hear the old stuff, Aqualung, etc., but I found the new CD, and the cuts he played live to be outstanding. It's definatly worth the price, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for oldies, buy one of the earlier outings. This one's a keeper.	positive
title: Another winner in this series [SEP] content: I am a big fan of Shirley McClintock and her family. I've read every one as soon as I could get my hands on them, and reread each so many times I'm afraid I will have to replace the books soon from sheer wear and tear. Shirley is the non politically correct, common sense first opposite of every fluff headed "heroine" that clutter too many mysteries. The mysteries are clever and beguiling but it is the the people in the books I want to know more about. They are real, flawed, full flavored, and interesting. My only complaint is that Ms Oliphant cannot, under the present law, be forced to write more, more, more.	positive
title: Farmer Fan [SEP] content: This quilting book was exceptional. It was very detailed and easy to understand. I was impressed with the variety of farm quilts. They showed great detail. I liked the variety of colors that were used. My daughter loves the Denim and Bow Tie Quilt. She plans on decorating her daughters room in some type of country theme and this is a great bedspread for a girl. The pockets add alot of character. The techniques of this book were well explained for the beginner to the more advanced quilter. This book will be a great book for your quilting collection.	positive
title: Heartbreaker [SEP] content: Exciting and fast paced. I must admit I had identified the wrong villan. The plot is amusing in places when Nick's emotions for Laurent become so conflicted. A good read.	positive
title: Excellent, Excellent, Excellent [SEP] content: BOOT CAMP is absolutely the best SAT preparation book I have ever seen. Mrs. Manning's style of writing in BOOT CAMP is captivating. She writes as if she were speaking in person to the student. Her style used in presenting the material is so creative that the reader can't wait to get to the next page. All sorts of useful hints are given on how to master all of the material. When you buy this book, you will not be able to put it down, and you will be learning without even realizing you are. Mrs. Manning has a gift for bringing to the reader exactly what he or she needs in order to master the material given on the SAT. If you want to inspire yourself, while perfecting your SAT score at the same time, buy BOOT CAMP now. You will be very happy that you invested in such an incredible book.	positive
title: Thoroughly engrossing! Historical Fiction fans must read. [SEP] content: For me, Noah Gordon has created a "time machine" in The Physician. In its pages I am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. I can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a "touched" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! The ending made sense and felt good to me. So much so that I located and purchased Mr. Gordon's other books! If they are near to The Physician's satisfying read, I'll be very happy indeed!	positive
title: EXCELLENT BOOK [SEP] content: THIS IS THE BEST AND THE ONLY BOOK TO EXCEL IN TEA EXAM. I SAT FOR IRS TEA EXAM ON 03/09/07 AND I MUST SAY THAT PART A & B WERE MUCH EAIER THAN THIS BOOK. MATHEMATHICAL SECTION IS ABSENT IN IRS TEA EXAM.IF YOU CAN SCORE 70% ON THIS BOOK, ITS MUCH LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD SCORE OVER 80% ON THE ACTUAL TEST.	positive
title: where to get book [SEP] content: I got the book by calling 954 597 9922. The book was a great help in understanding the deliberate lies of the Nation of Hate otherwise called the Nation of Islam. Trager destroys their arguments and shows the true authors of the slave trade, the Nation of Islam's fellow Muslims. Of course, Farrakhan and company deliberately ignore that fact.	positive
title: Post "Twice Removed" masterpiece [SEP] content: This album is pure pop! Every song is so catchy that a person who likes Heavy Metal will actually sing to this. Almost as good as Twice Removed! SLOAN ROCKS!!!!	positive
title: Good works [SEP] content: I heard about this book at a seminar and on ordering this used copy, have not been disappointed. It is a great joy to find this used volume of a deceased author, and I thank you so much for sending it so quickly. This is a volume to keep in the family!	positive
title: Rankin & Bass Do King Kong [SEP] content: Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie. Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs. Check it out.	positive
title: Fans of the show will love the soundtrack! [SEP] content: If you like the show Charmed, then you'll <u>love</u> the Charmed Book of Shadows Soundtrack.It really sets a charming mood. This soundtrack is a wonderful mix of different music that any fan of the show will love.	positive
title: Takes stress out of dinner [SEP] content: This book has taken stress out of dinner. however, I use it more as a guideline because the recipes are not exactly healthy. I definitely subsitute.	positive
title: Very nice, and a good value for money [SEP] content: I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra	positive
title: Pizza Tiger [SEP] content: If you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.Easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and I am in the pizza business.On a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as I used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.Daddio	positive
title: Good Introduction to Parallel Programming with MPI [SEP] content: This book is a great introduction to the theory of parallel programming. It is important to note that it is not a great reference for MPI, but it does a good job introducing the basic MPI functions and how to implement parallel programs using them.If you are looking for a good parallel programming primer, this book is a good start. If you are looking for an MPI reference guide, or a detailed discussion of more advanced MPI use, look elsewhere.	positive
title: Wish I had gotten this for my first!! [SEP] content: This may be one of the best baby products on the market! My younger daughter will never use a traditional high chair. this takes up so much less space and allows her to "sit" at the table with us while we are eating. it is transportable... clean and simple... easy to use! i can't say enough! love this high chair! would never have gotten the huge one i used for my first (cute but cumbersome)... this rocks	positive
title: BIG SIZE COOKIE BIG SIZE TASTE [SEP] content: Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies are not just for breakfast. You can have one anytime and they are so big you will enjoy eating them for a long time. We ordered the Oatmeal Raisin cookies and they were so moist and delicious. I wondered where they were going to so fast and discovered that my husband was taking them to work with him. So they must be very good because he is not a dessert person at all!	positive
title: Great Piano, but lost the sheet music..... [SEP] content: A very nice little piano for a toddler. Our daughter pretty much just mashes her hands on it (16 months old), but she enjoys doing that. Anyway, we lost the sheet music that comes with it. Does anyone know of a way to get the sheet music for the Melissa and Doug learn to play piano? The sheet music is letter coordinated with letters above the keys for this piano specifically.	positive
title: Excellent product so far [SEP] content: Product worked as advertised, no problems, easy to assemble, quite, easy to operate. it kind of bulkly & heavy, but glad to reuse my old dvd drive & now its portable. yes I would recommend this product...	positive
title: fits well [SEP] content: it keep me warm it keep me warm and the colors help to change out the day. It is good to wear to the gym also.	positive
title: Wonderful [SEP] content: Clear directions on how to work at healing your karma at this particular time . I am reading it again - the energy work is great .	positive
title: An incredible album from an incredible woman [SEP] content: She lends these songs a weight that they never had before. I mean, c'mon, you gotta give quite a lot of credit to a woman that can take trite song like "Last Train to Clarksville" and make it mean something to the listener.	positive
title: Great Seat [SEP] content: I searched forever for a good seat for our daughter. I came to this one through reveiews, and I am so glad I got it. It is so easy to put in and switch from our two cars and it fits in my husbands Civic, which I was very glad it did. It is so soft and our daughter loves it. She know can see out the window at what's going on around her. And unlike her baby car seat this one does not move when it is strapped in, which makes me feel SO safe. I don't know how I lived without it. And knowing how well it did with front and side impact ratings is a MAJOR plus. Very glad we have it.	positive
title: I AM CRAZY ABOUT ALBERT HAMMOND'S "YOUR WORLD, MY WORLD" [SEP] content: Ever since 1989 when I listened to the tracks in this wonderful album, I have never heard anything better. I am so crazy about the lyrics. Infact, one particular number,"Now that you're gone away" keeps reminding me of one particular girl I was so much in love with but lost somewhere along the line. My biggest worry is that despite my love for the album, I cannot lay my hands on one. Please anybody who can let me buy one should let me know through my e-mail:fredochu@yahoo.com I am a Nigerian journalist with one of the country's leading national dailies, "Daily Champion". Anybody who lets me have this album would have given me one of the rarest opportunities and collection. Is Albert still alive? If he is, could somebody tell him that he is great. I look forward to having the album and I am prepared to pay the cost of it. Fred Chukwuelobe.	positive
title: BAPs Are Here to Stay! [SEP] content: This book is a great humorous expose! As a older almost retired BAP I can see we successfully passed down our way of life. Only the brand names have changed! I laughed and I gave it as gifts to several in the next generation.	positive
title: 1 GB SanDisk USB drive [SEP] content: This is the best USB drive I have purchased. The speed in which it transfers data is excellent and it is very reliable. Hurray for the 1 GB SanDisk USB flash drive.	positive
title: Eternity..Awesome [SEP] content: Having listened to this CD a number of times, I find it to be delightful. All though the first 3 cuts are a little hard to understand as they are sung so softly, the rest are really great!To me the music has such a cool mix, a sureal sound that kind of just floats along. and lets the mind wander. The instrumentals are very fresh and well played. I find this CD very enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new and exciting listening experience. I can hardly wait for the next CD! I thank you for letting me express my views.J Head	positive
title: On teh Chopping Block [SEP] content: What can I say? I loved On The Chopping Block. Bobby Jaye getsbetter with each book. It was like old home week. Hearing about the lives of cousins Claudia and Joyce, a deeper look into Brady Kincaid and what he's thinking makes me hope that Bobby Jaye's next book will continue with himcoming back to Early and joining the police force. Of couse there is the enigma of Alice Drinker and Brady, can't wait for her to sort that one out.A terrific read. Couldn't put it down. Even stayed up late to finish it. Rock on Bobby Jaye	positive
title: I Liked It [SEP] content: It was a great film, the DVD was sent before I expected it @ my home. I would recommend this film, It's hilarious!	positive
title: Well made [SEP] content: Finding a hose coupling this size was not easy. It is well made and grips tight to the hose. Made of some top quality plastic that takes a pretty good beating. Not exactly rocket science, but when you need a hose coupling in this size, this is a decent product.	positive
title: Very Inspirational,as the truth often is. [SEP] content: This Truth shall set you free.I would recommend this to everyone that is searching for the truth about who we truly areand how we should behave towards each other and ourselves.	positive
title: This CD is simply wonderful! [SEP] content: It takes you places you've never been, and once you start lisening, every bit of stress just floats away. I've bought it twice, but have given it away to loved ones because it's so beautiful. I'm now about to buy it for the third time. Bravo, Beethoven!	positive
title: Versatile and Enduring [SEP] content: If you love to cook, this is an indispensible piece of cookware. From stovetop to oven, this is a high level tool. If you can deal with the weight of cast iron, which is considerable and part of the charm, the enamel cooking surface is perfect for browning and braising, among other things. An excellent product that will last forever if you treat it well (like don't ever use metal utensils which scratch off the enamel).	positive
title: Great! But The other C.D.'s shine too! [SEP] content: This is not the only great C.D. from this artist. Too many people have overloked his other C.D.'s This a a great album though, and my favorites are the title track, "Say your'e wrong" which has a great melody and has been stuck in my head for 20 years, it's that catchy! I even did a varation of the lrycs myself for fun! "Space" is a beauftiul soundscape! Julian, keep making music! You are a gifted songwriter!	positive
title: A Worthy Record [SEP] content: As the child of Polish Holocaust survivors, I read Sara's Children with a great deal of personal interest. The author succeeds in faithfully recreating Polish Jewish life prior to World War II, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. We all know all too well the ensuing horrors Nazi Germany inflicted upon Europe's Jews. The mutual help the Garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. If you read only one book about the Holocaust, I heartily recommend Sara's Children, Suzan Hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record.	positive
title: An Underrated Guilty Pleasure [SEP] content: Although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. De Palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. Had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.The DVD offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great.	positive
title: Highly Recommended [SEP] content: I've had one of these exact pumps in my Drag car for 15 years and I've just now had to replace it due to normal wear and tear. I highly recommend these pumps for any application.	positive
title: Berganza bloodless? Oh please! [SEP] content: Teresa Berganza is the greatest Carmen ever, period. No other Carmen has ever understood this role better. Berganza lacks nothing in fire. It's just that Carmen is NOT a pre-Pagliacci verismo opera. Regina Resnik recording is SUCH a vulgar affair, that it fully deserves Mario del Monaco as Don Jose. The only Carmen worse than that is Horne's in DG.	positive
title: Remarkable principal dancers [SEP] content: Darcy Bussell and Roberto Bolle must be two of the most beautifully proportioned people on the face of the earth. This is an excellent classic ballet that highlights two extraordinary soloists.	positive
title: The best defense of moral realism [SEP] content: I recommend David O.Brink, _Moral Realism and the Foundations of Ethics_ (Cambridge UP, 1989). In my judgment it is the best defense of moral realism. Although it does not deal with religion directly it argues for an objective naturalistic ethics--just what theists say that atheists cannot have.Michael Martin	positive
title: upgrading my vhs to dvd. [SEP] content: got this as a joke gift on vhs almost ten years ago. it became a staple at parties with friends instantly. everyone loves it. wore the tape out, had to come here to get the dvd. five stars, easy. highly recommended.	positive
title: pretty good cover [SEP] content: This is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. It fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though I have a tall 27 inch frame. I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.	positive
title: Shiva Has Done It Again [SEP] content: I didn't know what to expect from this DVD until I actually got out on the mat and began to follow the practice. It's a challenging practicethat will build your core - not by doing ab work but by flowing in a graceful practice.Although Shiva guides you through the practice, she encourages you totap into your own flow and add your own movements to the program.The time flew by and I can't wait to do it again.This is a great workout for someone who only has a limited amount of timebut wants to move into the flow.If you are a fan of Shiva Rea, you'll enjoy this work.If you are not yet a fan of Shiva, this DVD compliments her Core Abs and Fluid Power.I rated this DVD five stars. You may want to give it more.Namaste and enjoy it!PS. My goal is to join Shiva on a retreat in the near future. If you aren't on her list, sign up at [...] You'll get her monthly newsletter called Pulse.	positive
title: the best BSC video! [SEP] content: I love books and movies about Christmas. There are so many things going on with the members. Kristy wants a baseball mitt for christmas and has to do chores around the house to pay for half of it(but isn't she supposed to be a millionaire?!); Stacey is sneaking holiday treats because she has diabetes and misses them and Dawn is getting on her case for it and all of them together are volunteering at the hospital and planning a christams party for the sick kids as well as their baby sitting charges. Fun things they did on the side were playing christmas carols on the piano, having a christmas breakfast, the party, seeing santa at the mall and trying to do a secret santa though it was a disaster. A good film.	positive
title: Worked like a Charm [SEP] content: I read reviews that the cards were bogus and were already claimed by the time you get it in the mail. Well, I bought mines and had the physical card delivered, rather than getting the code by email. It worked, and bam. Live for a full year and at cheaper price than what Microsoft charges you for. It's worth investing in Amazon when you need a card. Saves you about $20 each time, maybe even more.	positive
title: Very good, but.... [SEP] content: This movie was very good, but it really threw me off in the beginning when just Ash and Linda drive up to the cabin. Where the hell are the other people? If you just glaze over the first 5 minutes, and skip up to where the last left off, when the Evil gets right up in Ash's face, you should be fine, because the movie is great otherwise from the part of the prologue with Ash and Linda. Especially good is the scene when Ash and the furniture break out laughing together!	positive
title: The Best Ever! [SEP] content: I have tried to find something, anything that would open up my sinuses without taking some drug internally. I have also tried various sprays, both drugs and saline solution, with only moderate relief. After trying this, I am hooked. It has a slight burning sensation when it is first inhaled, but then.... POW! It starts to clear everything out.I am a walking commercial for this product.	positive
title: Logitech Headset [SEP] content: Nice, durable, comfortable headset. You can drop it without breaking it, which is important to me. Only problem was the battery, which pretty much gave out on me after several months. They replaced it and hopefully this one will last longer.I dont like the volume control which goes low every time you turn it on.	positive
title: Good for the money spent [SEP] content: This was worth the money I spent, which was about $3. I would not pay any more than that, it's simply not worth it. The "chain" (really just some plastic beads) is a LOT shorter than I was hoping, but it's easily removable so I will attach a longer chain. It looks authentic enough, and any real Pirates fan will know what it is.	positive
title: Greatest book on the subject in existence!!! [SEP] content: This is the greatest book that my family and I have ever found on the subject of child training! My parents raised me with it and I hope to do the same with my own children. I hope that this book will bring as much blessing to everyone who reads it as it has to my own family.	positive
title: Great, Great, Great! [SEP] content: Yet another great read by Brenda Novak. I Love the Dundee, Idaho books...all of them are great, not one disappointed! I love how characters from the other books mix in and we can hear about them again!	positive
title: Good for Starting a Collection [SEP] content: I have liked almost every recipe that I have tried from this book. I have purchased it twice. Once for myself and once as a gift for a friend. I would recommend it for anyone starting out a vegan kitchen. If you already have loads of vegan cookbooks, you might want to just skip this one and get a specialty cookbook like "The Mediterrean Vegan Kitchen".	positive
title: Excellent and fresh investigation of godly character. [SEP] content: Uncommon Graces is an uncommon book. It is one of those rare offerings that brings together wisdom, insight, biblical integrity, freshness, and creativity, and presents it with clarity and economy. This is no dull laundry list of Christian duties. It will both challenge and excite the reader. It was a real joy!	positive
title: Brother Labeling good as always [SEP] content: I am quite pleased with the TZ231 1/2" Tape. I prefer the 1/2 over the 3/8" tape because it is easier to read as folder labels.	positive
title: essential reference book [SEP] content: Unless your French is perfect, never be without this excellent reference book. Mine has lived next to my computer for the last 15 years, and I use it every day. Ian Joiner, Altiplano Training.	positive
title: Best value speakers [SEP] content: The installation is very easy and the speakers sounded great. I used them to replace some rear surround in wall speakers that deteriorated over time.	positive
title: Getting to know a family next door! [SEP] content: Interesting and engaging would be the two words if you were asked to describe the film in just a second. I believe the film leaves no effort in putting things in the most genuine way possible. The film beautifuly depicts the 70's and its quite believable as you witness the settings, the costumes etc. Reasonable performence from almost everyone in the film, specially Christina Ricci as the curious young girl. She delivers an excellent performence, very genuinely shows a sexual maturity in a young girl. Her friendship with Sandy, her relationship with her father is believable and you can't take your eyes off her. The film will definately grab your attention and you will definately feel you are witnessing a family next door.	positive
title: Good book but what about the others? [SEP] content: Bonnie Bryant has been my favorite author and once again she has out done her self. The book was good but she( Bonnie Bryant) should have the other characters suchas Maxi,Veronica,and other people around the barn? The book is great and I'm definetly going to continue reading the series!	positive
title: Brash [SEP] content: I bought this album because I broke the first one (it was literally smashed during a move and in 3 pieces). I didn't hesitate to replace this album because it's so great. I hope I don't break this one but if I do, I'll replace it again.	positive
title: Vampire Diaries continues [SEP] content: to bring interesting, complicated plots with good acting.Every episode answers questions and asks new ones. I just wonder how long such a strong story line and cast can continue.	positive
title: Works on Wii [SEP] content: i got this for my Japanese version of the game..works perfectly in my Wiitried with dk1(us and japenese), dk2(us and japenese), and dk3 (japanese)	positive
title: For indoor workouts [SEP] content: When it is too cold to ride the trainer is perfect for your fix. I love my cycle-ops wind trainer because it allows me to get a good workout whenever it rains etc. It is relatively quite as well as being easy to fold up and put away. The bike fits easy with the built in skewers that lock perfectly without coming loose no matter how hard you hammer the pedals. You will feel confident locked in because it is very stable. The video is a little cheesy and I only looked at mine once or twice when I bought it. The girl and guy are just too darned happy, meanwhile I'm going through pain and grimacing trying to keep up with them. If you are into spinning you can spin away and never leave the comfort of your home. All in all it is a good accessory to have if you are a dedicated cyclist.	positive
title: The supreme Supreme [SEP] content: Mary Wilson has provided valuable information about the Supremes, but particularly Florence Ballard, showing that Ballard was not a loser, but a very talented woman, frustrated by the world of business. The Supremes have never received the just attention and accolades they deserved. This work provides a personal history behind the top group, not just top female group, of the sixties. A must read for any course on music history.	positive
title: HEELLLOOO [SEP] content: You guys got the pictures for the dachshound and lab switched!It makes it kinda confusing for people who want the lab game...Which would I get if I ordered it!?Which is right the words or the pictures?	positive
title: They have done it again [SEP] content: Flash 5 - Director Games: Where will they go next. Granted the books by epic software and Kris Jamsa are a bit more expensive than the rest of the books, but WELL WORTH IT. I bought the book so that I may see and learn how others are using their creativity to do games. Glad I bought this book. It has a great deal of code and actually walks you through them. Sometimes it can get difficult to follow, but it makes me just that much better when I get through it. I have already been able to sell the concept to a client and used one of the games from the book, changed some of the graphics, just a little of the code and I now have a finished piece that I can sell. Awesome job, awesome book and awesome games.This book is not geared for the starters, but trust me, you will learn a great deal from this book if you are just starting out. I have been working with Macromedia products for a couple of years and am glad I added these two books to my arsenal.	positive
title: Gene Was Special [SEP] content: He healed me twice. Both were nothing short of miraculous. Angels worked through him no doubt. A very special book from a very special man. A must have. His energy comes through it and that is priceless.	positive
title: The test of time [SEP] content: This recording has been measured praised and condemned (well, no one would be foolish enough for that) over time, but is the best reflection of the power and majesty of Mahler's most coherent symphony. The complaints about the sound not measuring up to the modern digital recordings reflects a need for thunder over substance and a bad stereo system. Walter Legge produced recordings that surpass the restrictions of his time and place and the sound on this is magnificent.And the conclusion, where Scwarzkopf's voice floats over the chorus in the Aufstehen is unequaled.	positive
title: Heavenly voice with no equal. [SEP] content: Hayley Westenra's new album "Pure" will affect you deeply if you like uncommonly pleasant singing. It's a "stealth" voice, to be sure, in that it sneaks in sweetly and harmlessly enough, but by album's end you find yourself wondering what just happened. You'll scratch your head and ask, "Did I just experience the finest human voice in all the world?" Then you'll look in the mirror and notice a goofy ear-to-ear smile on your face that tells everything.So let's just get it out in the open: Hayley Westenra has the most heavenly, ravishing, soothing and uplifting voice in the universe and "Pure" will almost make you forget about Norah, Barbra and Celine.As obscure as she is in the USA today, word of mouth about "Pure" will eventually elevate Hayley to a dominant place among popular music artists. Get in on the magic today!	positive
title: The original source of all Federal Reserve System research [SEP] content: This book, originally commissioned by the author Ezra Pound, is discovered upon research to be the source of the majority of present day information on the Federal Reserve Banking System. Compiled from information originally found in the U.S. Library of Congress, the research in this book has been confirmed, validated, and verified by many authors from many different fields of research. A good companion to this book is another book by Mullins entitled "The World Order." That book, and "Secrets of the Federal Reserve" are both books which have sent many people scurrying for cover, and has caused a barage of misleading information which, in itself, has only served to give even more credence and credit to what Mullins says about the subject matter.	positive
title: Welcome to Steve Aylett. [SEP] content: This book will make you laugh, because it is very, very funny. I firmly believe this.	positive
title: excellent book!... [SEP] content: this was an excellent book. it revealed everything that happens on the streets and in the drug game. the book kept your attention from cover to cover. it was definitely a 5 star book. i am an unpublished author, and reading books is my inspiration for writing. this book inspired me to write what i feel and not to hold back anything. i congratulate her, and meow meow productions. be sure to read the book by shannon holmes, called : B-more careful. an excellent book indeed.	positive
title: Awesome book with great detail!!!! [SEP] content: It was a very exciting and was very insane at times like flying through a Mcdonalds as a falcon or something like that. It made me feel like I was right into the action sort of. If you havent read it I really recomend it to be read by you peoples out there. I never Cassie could do all of that by herself because I thought that she might lose it or something. It's also very neat that she saved ax because she never was familiar with the brain surgery that she had done on ax. I hope that everyone gets the chance to do that by them selves just like Cass did. I also repeat it is an awesome book and got very insane sometimes.	positive
title: Religious George [SEP] content: If you want to read a book of about 90% of new material then this is the book...keep in mind it may not be a biography in terms of the man's life or artistic output...it's very much about his religion mainly the India type religion aka yogi's, marehishie? ...and how all that came to be and why it became to be and just how involved George was into all that...brief discussions on the backlash in his involvement and most of all the meaning of his involvement on popular culture as we know it...most people are aware of yoga, chanting, indian religion and 95% of that is the responsibility of George Harrison's involvement...but keep in mind when purchasing this book the book's main focal point is the religious aspect of his lfe...with a very very brief over-view in the beginning chapters.	positive
title: Fun and games! [SEP] content: Besides great Richard Scarry stories, there is even a game inside! It is a very fun Christmas time story book.	positive
title: You Know You Are Going to Need One [SEP] content: Good to keep on hand when the other one goes, or install if you don't have one. Add it to an order.	positive
title: Want Want Big Shelly Crispy Rice Crackers (Sugar) - One of my favorite snacks!! [SEP] content: I love these crackers...to me they are the perfect blend of salty and sweet and go great with peanut butter! I am happy to find them on Amazon and not to have to drive 1.5 miles to an Asian market.	positive
title: My First Garlock but Definitely Not Last...... [SEP] content: This was my first Dorothy Garlock book but I have now read about 15. This book is the beginning of four books that share characters. I love how Garlock doesn't abandon her characters and we see how their lives continue. Unlike other authors, she changes the setting and creates a whole new world for subsequent books. They can be read in order or they are wonderful stand alone stories. Here are the ones in this series:Edge of TownHigh on a HillA Place Called RainwaterRiver RisingI would recommend all of them!!Enjoy!	positive
title: Sounds really good [SEP] content: I read through Amazon's reviews and on other sites and most people liked these speakers and they are higher quality than the bottom line type. They have a long warranty which says something about the quality - IMO. I'm using as stereo speakers with a 2 channel Onkyo receiver and an Onkyo CD player and also for TV and DVDs. For small speakers the sound is very good. They have a very wide frequency range and I compared with more expensive speakers and these had the same type of specs. I don't know if that actually means anything but it is a way to gauge. I used on the floor and now they are perched on 30" stands. Either way sound good but I prefer the stands.Bottom line is if you are looking for an upgraded smaller speaker and don't want to spend a fortune these are the way to go.	positive
title: Sensationally wicked masterpiece! [SEP] content: A best-seller in its day, Quaker City is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Anyone who likes Edgar Allen Poe or the Marquis de Sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important American novels. I'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and I look forward to more of Lippard's novels coming back to print. Devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to Jarry's Pere Ubu, Faulkner's Popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century.	positive
title: Sturdy, Compact but Spacious [SEP] content: i bought this to keep just random personal papers and stuff in, nothing really "valuable" to outsiders. So i can't speak to the lock and safety, but the product is designed well. plenty of room for lots and lots of files inside every-day commercial file folders. I like it a lot, and it's pretty compact and inobtrusive	positive
title: Its not what you think..... [SEP] content: Your supposed to think chain letter is about some evil curseor a demon out to kill.....but its not. I really suggest this book for more people who enjoy a more of a fictious plot, but not some monster risen from the dead plot. everything in this book could of happened.	positive
title: intriguing [SEP] content: This is the story of a former child prodigy who begins to lose his ability as he matures. We meet him as adult, who is teaching music at a college, and still longing to recover his previous ability. One day, he is summoned for jury duty and becomes involved in a murder case involving a young mentally ill man and his Zen teacher. He also becomes romantically involved with one of the jurors. At the same time, the narrator begins teaching a promising Korean boy who shows signs of being a prodigy. Salzman weaves all these threads into a deft, intriuging web about what it means to have talent and what it means to be human, although the book drags a little at the end, it is well worth the read.	positive
