title: cheap quality [SEP] content: The metal that was used for this necklace looks cheap and left stains on my skin. I returned the product immediately but I have not received my refund yet after a month.	negative
title: Awful. [SEP] content: Why can't Weezer release another cool album like "Pinkerton" or "The blue album".This is even worse than their last "green" album that contained the annoying hash pipe.Do not buy this, its crap!	negative
title: Not what you think it is! [SEP] content: Although this documentary may be very good...it is NOT a colorized version of the original Sink the Bismarck movie! We bought it as a gift for someone who had asked for the movie and were VERY disappointed!	negative
title: Can You Say Poser? [SEP] content: The My Scene dolls are such posers! They're nothing but wanna'be Bratz (and need I remind you that the Bratz are way cooler!) This Masquerade Madness doll is a copy of the Funk n' Glow Bratz and she doesn't even look half as pretty. Why can't Mattel just except the fact that "Barbie's Pink Reign of Idiotic Terror" is OVER. GIVE UP MATTEL MY SCENE HAS NOTHING ON THE BRATZ DOLLS!~From: Kazami Ami a BRATZ fan	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: I bought this instrument aware of some of its faults. I'm used to new stringed instruments not holding its tune, but have never seen it untune right before my eyes. Stretching the strings didn't help at all. After giving up, I put it back in the included bag, figuring it would take a while until it could work as intended. A couple of hours later I heard it untune in the bag and then a bag; the bridge flew off. I guess that I'll get around to fixing her one day, and to be quite honest, I had her even less than that, but I'm really thinking of returning her despite the nice rich barritone sound I briefly heard before she literally flew apart.	negative
title: Cables [SEP] content: Connected this cable to my TV and to a HDMI Sat. Receiver. Worked fine to begin with then the colors went crazy and stayed with the wrong color and bad image. Cable was well constructed but something caused problems. When things went funny the audio went off and would not come back on through that cable.	negative
title: TEMPERAMENTAL SCALE [SEP] content: Had it in use for only 3 weeks! It suddendly started turning on & off for no apparent reason. It is now officially dead!Quite displeasing as this is my second Tanita (first one lasted 10+ years). I'll post my venture with Customer Service...trust the novel will have a happy ending.Jim	negative
title: Pretty redundant, extra tracks are live tracks [SEP] content: If you already have Welcome to the Videos and were thinking "Hey, this one has "You Could Be Mine" and a bunch of other tracks on it" save your cash, all the extra tracks are from the Use Your Illusion Live In Tokyo DVDs. The animated menu is kinda cool, but, yeah it's not worth it.	negative
title: Where's the Wash? [SEP] content: Lee Smith's 1985 novel FAMILY LINEN was our book club selection for this month and so far before the meeting members of the group have all said one thing: "It is boring." The story doesn't go anywhere and it takes several paragraphs even pages to discover who is telling what part of the story.There are no surprises, even the identity of the murder as it was obvious from the beginning.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS.	negative
title: Absolute Garbage [SEP] content: There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well.	negative
title: Don't judge this movie by it's cover [SEP] content: This movie isn't bad...but it is not what the DVD cover makes it out to be. It is not a comedy. It is a drama with one or two funny lines.	negative
title: I had high hopes for this book - they were dashed [SEP] content: I was excited to begin this book, as I had read "The Bone Collector" and loved it. After I got into "A Maiden's Grave" I found myself searching for any periodical to read to avoid finishing "Grave". Deaver does a great job with narrative, making you feel as if you were there. The problem was that the plot dragged on and on. I felt like shouting "let's be done with this, already!" There also seemed to be a sense of hopelessness that pervaded the storyline - that doesn't make for enjoyable reading.	negative
title: Quality Product, But Overpriced [SEP] content: High quality product, very efficient detergent, however the price here is $0.27 per load versus WalMart 110 load version at $20.87 which comes out to $.21 per load with tax. Apples to apples, that equates to $13.11 per bottle at WalMart (adjusted to 64 loads), versus $17.28 here. If you are buying 4 bottles, as with this bulk purchase, the cheaper option represents a savings of $16.68 which is well worth the price of a trip to the store.	negative
title: Not the Ireland I Know [SEP] content: An anthology which attempts to introduce a listener to Irish music but fails to include The Chieftains, is akin to discussing Irish literature and failing to mention James Joyce. Most of these tracks are the new-age approach to celtic music which are not traditional. Irish music is my favourite music of all, and here are my recommendations:Dolores Keane with John Faulkner - Sail Og Rua (simple, gorgeous minor-celtic harmonies that send shivers down your spine)Dolores Keane - A Farewell to Erin (fantastic)The Chieftains - Anything, start with Best Of or Greatest HitsThe Dubliners - The Best Of (my 2-cd set came from Holland through Amazon.com and it's fantasticThe Johnstons - Barley Corn (gorgeous husky female voices, great fiddle & guitar playing)The Johnstons - Bitter Green (their version of Lord Thomas and Fair Ellender, in 3-part harmony, is one of the most haunting things I've ever heard)Happy listening - slainte!	negative
title: My Beautiful Johnny Why? [SEP] content: I did not like this film at all I found it very boring!!! And I honestly hated How hidous They made Johnny depp. That bothered me the most!!!! yuck!	negative
title: Horrible time getting laptop to recognize TV [SEP] content: This device works great if you are going from RCA jacks to Coax and I'm sure with most S-Video devices. There are two problems I had with it that forced me to return this product and get a different brand. The componant video in will not work if an S-video cable is plugged in, even if it isn't hooked to anything. This is only a problem if you are using multiple video sources.Second, Most laptop computers (I tried a compaq with high end ATI, a dell with intel graphics chip and an HP with Nvidia) simply will not detect the TV through this box. I returned it and got another and they still did not work. All three of these laptops worked instantly with the same setup and a different brand box.	negative
title: Don't buy this combo [SEP] content: I would suggest buying a different brand combo. This one makes noise when it is not playing but the unit is on. Also, you have to select "Timer Record" on the remote control or your timer will not record. Then it takes you into DVD mode until your program is on. Other models you just have to turn off and the timer will work. Also, the auto tracking is just terrible on this if it is a tape recorded on another vcr. Your have to use manual tracking and it doesn't get the picture right after doing that either. Plus the dvd doesn't always pick up where you left off if you stopped watching the dvd in the middle. Sometimes it starts back at the beginning.	negative
title: Don't Waste Your Money [SEP] content: I bought this unit plan to help provide decent study guide questions and was highly disappointed in the entire product. I can't get over the lack of originality in these "lessons." Don't waste your money.	negative
title: This Is The Kenny G Of Country! [SEP] content: I simply do not understand what all the fuss is about with this man. There are much better country acts out there which deserve more media attention than Brooks garners. His songs are soulless (Barry Manilow likes him, so it must be so) and unenjoyable. The hype machine is in overdrive for this guy. He is the Kenny G of country. His act is unchallenging, tries too hard to pander to his audience, and is a misrepresentation of his genre of music.	negative
title: BAD Book [SEP] content: My family is originally from Eatonton, Ga, so I was interested to see what Mr. Moreland had to say. My dad knows a lot about the stalking case against Mr. Moreland and my mom knows some of the women portrayed in his book. We really wonder how someone can say the things he has said in print about these people and get away with it. He has defamed some very fine people and attempted to denigrate a whole town. As a black woman growing up in small town Georgia in the '40s, I experienced the typical incidents of racism, but I've experienced much worse in other places! Blacks and whites in Eatonton get along very well and have for many years. There are numerous black elected officials there at both the city and county levels. Mr. Moreland's "true story" is simply not true, either with respect to the "fabricated" stalking case or the race relations! Besides, he's a horrible writer...actually, the whole book reads like it was written by a boy! I'm sorry I bothered.	negative
title: Waaay too small [SEP] content: The sizes on this outfit really do run quite small. We had a wedding to go to and wanted our little guy to look cute. The outfit was on him, a little snug, but our son is in the 95 percentile for height so we are accustomed to things not quite fitting (we typically leave a button or two undone or something). This outfit seemed fine while I had my son laying on his back and all buttoned up. But when I picked him up he started turning red in the face and couldn't breathe. I ripped the clip on bow-tie off immediately and he immediately gasped a huge breath and started crying. Of course I felt awful for forcing the outfit on ... I layed him down to start taking the outfit off when he pealed into another scream... the suspenders had come lose in back and the metal had dug into his skin (even through the shirt). I should have bought the 9 month size for my 3 month old!! I felt aweful and my poor son felt worse.	negative
title: Ouch! [SEP] content: Only 4 songs make this album worth listening to: Shock to the System, Masquerade, Life me Up, and Miracle of Life. These four tunes are excellent; especially the enchanting instrumental, Masquerade. This album just shows you what happens when a lot of talented musicians all try at once to grab the spotlight (or the YES name) at the same time. Enough already. This album makes it clear that in spite of the valliant attempt at cohesiveness, individuality kills the group as a whole. Maybe the guys will realize this down the road.	negative
title: 2nd one not so good [SEP] content: This is the second Apex stove I have purchased. The 1st one lasted 15 years before the steel braided hose started leaking at the pump. Since it was cheaper to buy a new unit than replace the hose I purchased the Apex2. The 2 did not fair as well as the first one. The unit started leaking form the steel braided hose in the same place as the 1st, after 5 uses in a year. I do like the stove it has a good burn and I like the adjust-ability of the unit. The flame can be set on full blast or a very low simmer. The base can be adjsuted to be level on just about any surface and I never had to replace a generator on the 1st Apex and it got a lot of use. If it was not for the hose going bad so soon I would give this unit top billing, even with it's heavy weight. I may try to repair the 2, but I can't trust it anymore.	negative
title: You have a super computer ? buy, not don't buy!. [SEP] content: We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please..............	negative
title: Back to Norelco [SEP] content: This razor from China worked so so for two weeks then died. Price was low and if it kept working I probably would have kept it. But now I think I will go back to Norelco, if they are still made in Holland.	negative
title: Offensive [SEP] content: I purchased this book as a general guideline to becoming a finer gentleman. There are a few things I read in this that is downright offensive and insulting. The book goes on to say things like "a gentleman never drinks from the milk container" and things like " don't joke about not being a bomber at an airport before your flight. I especially liked the " if you are at someones home and there isn't any ash trays provided, don't ash in a potted plants or saucers.There is an illustration on how to tie a bow tie, but the book doesn't cover any other tie knots. So basically the author thinks you should already know how to tie a necktie but not to ash in plants. I would not buy again, I need a book on etiquette that is designed for people who already show a basic level of class. I thought as though I was being talked down to the entire time. Take out all the condescending nonsense and this would be an excellent book.	negative
title: Not Worth The Buy [SEP] content: I bought these strings last week and have already broken string, and other strings show signs of fraying only one week in.	negative
title: Same Old Same Old [SEP] content: So basically, the playstation 3 is exactly like playstation 2, except with better graphics. The games are obviously beautiful, but the gameplay and storylines of most games are subpar. Yes it's exciting because it's a new system, but it's really nothing new at all. I expect to get bored of it really soon. If you want something awesome, get the Wii. Trust me, now THAT'S a real next generation console. The graphics may not be as great as ps3 or x360, but if you buy games only because the graphics, then maybe video games aren't for you and you should stick to DVDs. Anyway, the ps3 is definitely inferior overall compared to the Wii. Go ahead, take my word for it and sell your ps3 or use the money you were gonna buy it with on a Wii, and have almost 400 bucks leftover.	negative
title: Can't believe these are abridged!!! [SEP] content: Why, why why??? Would they do this?!?!?! What was the company thinking releasing this chopped up version of such a cool show. They've cut out a bunch of dialog, shortened songs and really took the heart out of the series.If you want the TRUE, complete, original episodes, but the older DVDs which are sold on Amazon as Seasons 1 & 2 and Season 3 Part one. True, you won't have all of season 3, but at least you'll get the others as you once watched them when you were a kid!Jem - The Complete 1st & 2nd SeasonsI can't get the link for season 3 through the insert application, but maybe this will work:http://www.amazon.com/Jem-Season-3-Part-1/dp/B0002M5TP2/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1330456782&sr;=1-1If you want the real think, don't buy this chopped up, abridged "complete"(NOT) set!	negative
title: An okay gift... [SEP] content: I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose...	negative
title: It's a Mystery [SEP] content: I still have not received my product yet. I have sent one e-mail sharing the fact that my product has not been received. It was promised for Sept. 14. It is now Sept. 25 and I don't have it or a response to my first e-mail.	negative
title: 2 stars out of 4 [SEP] content: The Bottom Line:The DaVinci Code begins well enough, though the audience is asked to believe that upon being gutshot a character would use his own blood to leave cryptic clues for his pal Tom Hanks, but quickly gets bogged down in the endless machinations of the plot and ends up collapsing under its own weight--airtight this ain't.	negative
title: Badly written [SEP] content: The confusing presentation, clumsy writing, and numerous factual errors make this book almost unreadable.	negative
title: Didn't Last Long [SEP] content: This product worked for about 2 weeks. While it worked it did what it was supposed to. After two weeks it would not turn on at all. I emailed Flowtron customer support. After 1 week they finally replied. They stated that they believed the transformer was inop and asked if I could replace it myself. They said they would ship the part to me. I replied back saying that I could replace the part, gave them my address, and attached my receipt for purchasing the product. That was on October 5th, 20 days ago. I have not received any other response nor have I received the part. It's 2010 wake up and get decent customer service. Another junk company.	negative
title: Not a fan. [SEP] content: This particular product takes up way too much free space on my computer. Actually slowed it down a bit. I have 320 GB with 4 GB memory. Kaspersky seems to work better and I didn't have any problem with that at all. Would not personally recommend Norton.	negative
title: ITS CANCELLED GET OVER IT! [SEP] content: ITS TRU GTA3 FOR GBA HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. IT WAS DISCONTINUED ABOUT A MONTH AGO. IF ANYONE NEEDS PROOF GOTO IGN.COM LOOK THROGH THEIR PREVIOUS NEWLETTERS IN ONE OF THEM IT WILL SAY THAT THE COMPANY CREATING THE GAME WAS UNABLE TO FIT ALL THE INFO ON SUCH LITTLE MEMORY. SO EVN THO IT WOULD BE GREAT ITS NOT GOIN TO BE MADE AND NEVER WILL BE TIME TO GET OVER IT!	negative
title: Complete rubbish [SEP] content: So being a Ducati buff and just having bought a secondhand 999R at a snip of a price with only 300 miles on the clock I was sucking up all that was the 999.... so you can imagine my disgust to get this load of rubbish, some guy on his bike on a track doing nothing and then it kept getting stuck and still nothing happens! Ducati is elegance and style and charm and Italian.... but dont waste your money on this ...I agree with the giy who says Ducati ...hunt 'em down and bury them	negative
title: Boring and repetitive [SEP] content: This author was recommended to me by my hair stylist, but I can't imagine why. I found the book to be boring, immature, and repetitive. Although it started out with an interesting premise, it soon just kept repeating the same theme over and over. I had to force myself to finish it, especially when the author decided to add Biblical teachings and it went from bad to worse. I don't recommend it.	negative
title: KT Tunstall's Eye to the Telescope [SEP] content: I received the KT Tunstall's Eye to the Telescope with David Bowie recorded cd; not KT Tunstall. The cd is labeled as the KT Tunstall Eye of the Telephone with jewel case. This is clearly the publishers error. Can you please replace this cd with the KT Tunstall cd ordered.	negative
title: hate it [SEP] content: I am a ten year old girl and an avid reader. I felt like I was being forced to read it. Sometimes I was sucked into it and wanted to keep reading it and then it would get really bad. It took me a month to read it. Normally it would take me a couple hours if it were really good.	negative
title: Booo! [SEP] content: Ok, I admit I smoke and drank alot in my twenties, but the stories I vaguely remember are much better than this dribble. Maybe I should write a book? All the talk about her poor hygiene, smoking, and drinking just makes me believe that if I saw her in public I would quickly move away from her. Other things she writes about make me dislike her as a person. I read chapter after chapter hoping to get any heartfelt emotion out of the pages, but no dice. Five star reviews and a New York Times best seller? I dont get it? Lame.	negative
title: well let me change that not even a star! [SEP] content: to start off im a female and i thought it was moroly disgusting for these women to flap their body parts around! real or fake! if you are a high society woman and are thinking about watching the vidio... DON"T! if you are a slum then go for it... its right up your alley!	negative
title: Not up to her previous works, but a must for fans. [SEP] content: Judging an author's body of work by only reading one novel, and her last novel written at the very end of her long life, is infantile, the equivalent of watching Steven Spielberg's "1941" and judging him to be a mediocre talent and not worthy of further viewing.This is Mrs Thirkell's final completed novel and like the majority of her later works, not up to the standards of her finest work of the Thirties and Forties, but it's a must read for fans of the Barsetshire series. For newcomers to her books, I would recommend any of the Barsetshire novels of the Thirties, but particularly "Summer Half", "Wild Strawberries", "Pomfret Towers", "The Brandons" or "High Rising". These early novels can be read as stand alones that introduce the characters featured throughout the series and are witty, dry, well-written comedies of manners.	negative
title: Really crappy rip-off of Robert Rodriguez' classic Planet Terror. [SEP] content: Do yourself a huge favor. See Planet Terror, with great cast (Bruce Wllis, Josh Brolin, Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowan) and by legendary director.	negative
title: Not worth it [SEP] content: I am taking masters classes on line and need to use the headset for presentations and the like but these initally did quite well and then they just stopped working. The Mic would not pick up anything so I sent them back and tried another pair and the samething happened. So, now I need to find a different headset. These don't come with any drivers to install so it's just a windows generic type setting. I think if they had some install program and some drivers it might have been a different story. They are comfortable and the sound is great but if you can't be heard, what's he point. I think cyber acoustics is a good company and produces a good headset but they missed the mark this time.	negative
title: A diappointment [SEP] content: After reading other reviews I thought this would be a great game. I found it frustrating as games could not be replayed to learn the layout and there were way too many tiles to have a good feel of hidden tiles. Also, I am not sure if it is Vista or the game but it has to be reloaded each time I play. Definately a disappointment. Certainly don't purchase if you are expecting a more traditional Mahjong experience.	negative
title: You get what you pay for. [SEP] content: Usually I use Merkur blades, but I saw these available and figured, "I'm sure they'll be fine." The blades felt dull; they were flimsy, and a couple of the blades in the pack had grime on them when I opened them. My skin was irritated like never before and I got more small cuts than I had from my safety razor since...well, ever, really. Immediately, I hopped on Amazon and ordered a pack of the Merkur blades.	negative
title: A Rose by any other name [SEP] content: The massive instructions on how to convert Quicken for PC files to work with Quicken for Mac should have scared me away, but they didn't. Don't plan on transferring data files from PC to Mac. After hours of converting financial entries, Quicken created category files and my account names that are too long for Q Mac, etc. it still failed. Turns out splits in my wife's paycheck didn't transfer correctly along with other things. Bottom line I've loved Quicken on the PC and wanted to keeping using it on my Mac, however I guess without stating over that ain't going to happen! If intuit isn't going to make these two products compatible, then they shouldn't give them the same name.	negative
title: Much Less Than One Star [SEP] content: I bought this book on the basis of customer reviews. The reviewers must be very good friends of the author, or the author himself, although they were well written and his book was not. I just put it into the recycling. I can't imagine who I'd pass it on to. The writing is incredibly pedestrian, full of cliches -- but worse, the morality is that of a six year old -- eye for an eye. I'm half afraid the author will go after ME for writing this review -- but hey, save your money. Also -- I received an anonymous letter recommending this book. Obviously, the sender was afraid to reveal his/her identity as well! Anyone can write a book and anyone can publish -- buyer beware.	negative
title: "I Wanna Be Like Mike" [SEP] content: This cd wasn't all that good to me. Is it me, or is he trying too hard to be Michael Jackson?? There is only one M.J. and they'll never be another. The man is a legend. Justin, you are trying TOO HARD!	negative
title: Cheap generic item substituted for TKO [SEP] content: I received a cheap generic set of bars that look nothing like the picture, and are not marked TKO. The box says "push-up bars" with no manufacturer name or identification of any kind. However, they slapped a little bar code sticker on the side of the box that says "TKO Extreme Training Push-up Bars". I found a set of bars that look just like the ones I received selling for $10. Very dishonest! Another reviewer reported the same thing, so this was not a mistake or a one-time occurrence. Buyer beware!	negative
title: Arkon Portable Fold-up Stand Apple Ipad, Galaxy, Tb, Kindle [SEP] content: don't use can't hold weight of Ipad. Would be great for mini ipad. My ipad fell over with it o my desk and cracked the glass, so it had to go i for repair.	negative
title: This music makes me feel strange. [SEP] content: I bought this when I was in my early teens because I saw their pictures in Creem or Circus, and they looked so cool. Kiss was the band in black, and these were the guys in white. (Would be interesting to know how much influence the record company had in the choice of costume.) The music is interesting only because of what it says about the era. This is not good music. The delivery is just fine, but it's all so meaningless and soul-less. Much great music is one or the other, but not both! Still, I hope all these guys are doing OK; I'll never forget Angel.	negative
title: Poor quality for the price [SEP] content: Scale would not set to zero and always had to be adjusted. Scale was off 3 to 5 lbs. I returned it for a full refund. I would not recommend this product.	negative
title: Nasty stuff! [SEP] content: This stuff is nasty! Don't waste your money. Makes me shudder the same as when I have to take some sort of vile cough syrup. Wish I could return this non-returnable, non-edible product:(	negative
title: Don't buy this product [SEP] content: This product was a big disappointment. It's not able to receive the US Atomic Clock signal in south Florida (Miami). I have tried it at several locations in Miami. It has also problems to receive signals from the remote sensor when it's placed more than 20 feet from the main unit. A friend and me bought one each and both units have the same problems. You cannot even switch from F to C on the main unit, something that you can do on every digital thermometer I have seen, even on a $ 5.00 thermometer. No, I will return this thermometer, it is a bad product.	negative
title: Zzzzzz [SEP] content: All that I really need to say is, while me and two other friends were playing this game on multiplayer, I was beginning to fall asleep. One of my other friends actually DID fall asleep!I found this game to be utterly slow and relatively safe in terms of what it can do--this is not a good thing. There is nothing innovate to speak of. How many times can they redo WWII video games? There's no story line, unless you enjoy sham remakes of what really happened. There really isn't much historical fact here either.But I guess most people that play this junk are too fat and lazy to open an actual text book to learn what really happened.	negative
title: Poor Execution [SEP] content: When I bought this book I was looking for a source of "options" that I could apply to the design of my own Smart House. This is more of a coffee table book, not a useful reference. For some unknown reason the editor chose to print the text as white print on a black background, which I find almost as annoying as reading text that is entirely bold-face. On top of that the author chose to showcase several houses that are starkly contemporary and amazingly ugly in my opinion. In sum: this book has nothing much to offer the prospective home builder.	negative
title: Disappointment [SEP] content: My 3 year old daughter already has an adorable 2.5" Strawberry Shortcake set with lots of pieces and lots of room for imaginary play. She loves it, but it only came with one doll. I've searched for the individual 2.5" dolls but to no avail, so out of exasperation, I bought this set so that SS could have a friend. While the extra dolls were exactly what I was looking for, the rest of the set was a complete disappointment. There are only two pieces in addition to the dolls and their hats, and they are nothing more than kids meals toys. She was SO disappointed when none of the pieces came apart for play that she almost cried. I ended up taking the scooter and the cake off the platforms so that she could play with them and threw the rest away.	negative
title: Depressing [SEP] content: The acting was very believable, however the subject matter was so depressing that it was difficult to watch. I wanted there to be a happy ending.......	negative
title: Rental Nightmare [SEP] content: I'm sure it's me but I rented a couple of these and it never went to my TIVO. I don't think I'll be renting (or buying) a download again.	negative
title: Modes Demystified review [SEP] content: I found this way to complicated and hard to understand. In addition, there's dozens of scales to memorize and is (in my opinion) very tedious work. After going through the entire CD several times, I still had no idea what modes were. Until I found Desi Serna, his CD made it so easy to understand and use it makes me feel silly it took me so long to get it. Check out Desi Serna, he is very easy to understand on all his CD's. Finally, I get it!	negative
title: Music is DEAD. [SEP] content: This man has ruined "country" music. He is pop and has dollar signs flashing in his eyes. I can't stand hearing his name and country music in the same sentence. Hank would commit suicide if he could hear this today. I hope him and Kenny Chesney will take Tim McGraw and all go hang out on Kenny's island so Randy Rogers, Jason Boland, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Wade Bowen and many others will get the respect they so desperately deserve. Trace is nothing but a marketing stunt and I have ZERO respect for all the worthless, mindless EXPLICIT his label has put out in his name. Support live, real music. Not this. I expect to see him and Britney Spears on tour together sometime real soon!	negative
title: Bad Idea [SEP] content: This is a charity item. Buy this through Janis Ian's website only so the money will go to the needy.	negative
title: UPDATE on Do NOT buy & COMPATIBLE WITH THESE PHONES [SEP] content: Not until I was putting the darn thing back in the box did I see the sticker on the box. This module is compatible with 8, count 'em, 8 phones. The Xircom website does not list them when you click for the listing (it takes you to their 56k modem module page instead) and the Amazon site simply says that it is compable with Nokia phones.According to the sticker on the box: "For Nokia Handsets. This model is compatible with the following handsets: Nokia 6110, Nokia 6130, Nokia 6150, Nokia 6190, Nokia 5110, Nokia 5130, Nokia 5150, Nokia 5190"With all the different mobile phones out there, why any company would make a product that was compatible with only 8 of them is the ring of a poor business plan.	negative
title: Not As Advertised [SEP] content: The bag is black, just as in the picture. There is absolutely nothing on it with a Mossy Oak break up pattern as the title suggests. And as far as the zipperless compartments that are described in the features, The one I received has not one, but two zippers on each compartment. Maybe they're zipperless zippers, I don't know but they work just like the one on my jeans so I'm calling them zippers that zip.The bag is nice enough but it is nothing like Amazon's description!	negative
title: Chose Carefully [SEP] content: The film, Adventures Of Tartu, is a one of the best WW II British propoganda films. Robert Donet is one of the finest actors of that era. However, the video and audio transfer of the film by Alpha Home Entertainment Studio is terible. The video is dark and the audio is way out of sync (so badly it is unwatchable). I did not return the copy of that DVD because it would have cost more to return it then to keep it. I then ordered another copy of the film (from another source) manufactured by Terra Studio (which is also available from Amazon). The Terra Studios copy was of much better quality and is well worth watching. Be careful of the source. It would be nice if Amazon would post Studio specific reviews for DVDs rather then compiling multiple manufactures reviews into all like DVD titles.	negative
title: Buyer beware [SEP] content: Real seat of your pants flying on a foggy night experience without instruments. Rosetta Stone is NOT the way to go to acquire another language unless you have someone familiar with the language guide you. Having had experience using software that works from basic to intermediate levels, this one is the pits by comparison. Better have the ability to decide whether you will be happy with the program while just looking at the box, because once you open it, you're stuck with it. Makes for pretty expensive garbage....	negative
title: Shes not angry anymore...but still can't sing [SEP] content: Bought this cd for my wife. Who admits that she fell in love with alanis after Jagged little pill (mainly due to the 'you oughta know' song).Alanis is a mediocre singer at best, nowhere near the voice of talented canadian singers like Diana Krall or Celine Dion. There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music. At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men. And those women are loyal and do not care if they can not sing along without a thesaurus. Therefore it is irrelevant what I write about this cd....	negative
title: If only I could give 0 stars... [SEP] content: Die Trying's debut LP is an extremely sad excuse for music-- every song sounds the same, and to make matters worse, DT sound like a carbon copy of Papa Roach. Yep, DT appear to be playing Papa Roach b-sides (I don't think I need to tell you how bad that is).Die Trying are for those of you who find Papa Roach's sound to be the best thing since sliced bread. If you have taste in music though, give this album a wide berth.	negative
title: Deliver Us from Untalented, Egomaniacal Sean... [SEP] content: Sorry to be rough on you Sean, but, after reading "Deliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism," I have to ask - who told you that you could write? That person is not your friend. As with your radio show, the book is filled with empty anecdotes, circular logic and outright lies. And, despite its obvious shortcomings, I stuck it out and read it from cover to cover, hoping for a payout so at least the four hours of my life weren't wasted. That payout never came. Well, at least I can get 75% of the cost back when I sell it used on Amazon.com. So I'm out, what, 4 hours and 4 bucks? Oh well, it could be worse - I could've read your other book, too...	negative
title: Way too dark for my taste [SEP] content: And convoluted. The over-kill in the story made me put the book down - how many things can yuo expect to happen to two people? Enough already.	negative
title: Okay [SEP] content: When I got it, the top ball was a different color than the rest of the ring and had glitter in it. Defeats the purpose of being clear.	negative
title: broken globe [SEP] content: Globe fell out and broke.Sent several e-mails about a replacement globe with no answers.Poor customer service. How to get another globe?	negative
title: Sort of like Toy Story on Qualudes [SEP] content: I can put up with the ages old wisdom of scaring the crap out of kids about the big scary world and the nasty people who live in it, and so what if the falcon is the bad guy and the rodent is the good guy so long as there are no BB guns under the tree, but lets have some fun! This is a kids movie. Stuart is sort of likeable and Snowball the cat has some good lines, but I only watch this sort of thing because I am sure I will feel good at the end and I ended up thinking this movie would make kids not want to go outside. Happy I watched it first.Stuart little is a poor stepchild in a genre filled with excellent heartwarming films.(Aladdin, Lion King, Toy Story, Finding Nemo).	negative
title: Never got it [SEP] content: I tried contacting the company about never receiving the set, but they just responded "The USPS tracking says that the package was delivered." What a help they were. I did receive a one bottle package later in the week of Daves Special Edition Insanity Sauce, although I haven't tried it yet... I was more excited about the variety in flavor rather than the "hottest-sauce-ever-made."	negative
title: fun while it lasted [SEP] content: I purchased this for my wife's studio about 8 months ago; about 2 months ago the CD door started to stick and was difficult to close; now the CD player stopped recognizing CD's altogether; it is now just an AM/FM radio. Looks nice, but function came in second to form.	negative
title: Review of Boxed Set only (film itself = 5 stars) [SEP] content: Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on "anarcho-syndicalist commune" and you'll see.You do the maths. Twenty bucks for some cards?Someone's having a laugh, and my guess is he's not part of a self-perpetuating autonomous collective.Olly Buxton	negative
title: dissapointing [SEP] content: i was dissapointed with this guide book ... not so much because of the information it contained but because the maps were ilegible and therefor useless ...also because the information was not available easier by a detailed index ... i had to flic thru the pages to find the section i needed so in my opinion poorly laid out ...it felt to me more like someones impression of the place rather than factual information which i would have prefered ...	negative
title: :-( [SEP] content: Love Gino...Didn't like this at all...too way out and not like the old days...Isn't that why we buy music? To hear what we know???	negative
title: Total rip-off [SEP] content: You would think when ordering a CO2 powered air gun that the gun would accept a CO2 cartridge, right? This gun does not accept CO2 cartridges. It came with no instructions, no schematics, no receipt...just an ornamental gun in a box.If this is what the manufacturer considers an air gun then you should avoid this manufacturer. This useless gun is going back!	negative
title: Why can't they make a decent romantic comedy? [SEP] content: Another idiotic, so called "romantic comedy". Basically the story includes Cameron Diaz(who can't act if her life depended on it but still has fame and twenty million per movie) and Christina Applegate acting like fools in pursuit of some guy, convinced that he is the one. There are plenty of jokes and gags follow that supposed to be hilarious and aren't. Granted, some movies are stupid but funny. This one doesn't even come close-its simply dull, ridiculous story that doesn't evoke any emotion in you and you definitely don't give a damn about any of these characters	negative
title: Horrible [SEP] content: The movie is horrible. Acting is crummy. Godzilla is all messed up. I would get something better like Godzilla Vs. KingGhidora or Godzilla Vs. Spacegodzilla.	negative
title: I wanted to like it, love watching Timothy Olyphant, but... [SEP] content: it just wasn't very interesting. Violence without much character development or plot. Justified is way better than this. Granted, I only watched the first one, but it was too unsatisfying to watch more.	negative
title: Forget About It [SEP] content: This item puts out bad sound quality. In my personal auto it is so-so but in my van at work it is horrible. So forget about it.	negative
title: They should force prisoners to watch this as punishment. [SEP] content: I'm a hard person to bore. I can sit through the entire 4-hour direcetors cut of Dances With Wolves or a chick flic and be more entertained. This is actually boring, boring, boring.	negative
title: What a letdown. . . ! [SEP] content: I started this book with fervor and hunger and ended with a "toss out the window" of the book and a vow to find a new author to follow. In his haste to complete this book John Grisham forgot that readers are not dummies and that we expect the author to be true to his characters and his audience. After reading this book, I've taken a long pause from Grisham. . .	negative
title: Opened Box [SEP] content: Drill shipped as an open box. Looked like it was returned by soemone.Drill is great though. Have 2 units and like them and use them daily.	negative
title: Buyer Beware [SEP] content: I bought two of these earbud sets to go with LG phones. They arrived promptly, but although the packaging was identical the items inside were not. In addition, they did not match what is pictured on this website. The ear bud sets that I received looked used, and they did not work with my LG phones. I contacted the seller for information on returning the items (I had to pay to ship them back...fyi), and after I confirmed with the seller a week later that they had received the items, I was told they would process my refund. Two weeks and several emails after that, I only received the proper refund when I informed Webtreo that I had disputed the charge with my credit card company.	negative
title: Too many unnecessary details [SEP] content: While the authors provide a very comprehensive overview of data mining, they do go into too many details and as a result many critical points are lost. The authors are clearly motivated and therefore they discuss all they know in data mining. They should have selected some of the key points and elaborated on them.	negative
title: CBS Screws Up Again With Producing DVDs [SEP] content: The only reason I give this box set one star is because I can't watch it EXCEPT on my computer. For 4 1/2 seasons' worth, I've enjoyed these episodes on my Dynex flat screen. But - and I've had this experience with several other CBS DVDs, for some reason there is some glitch in these DVD discs where they cannot play on my TV set. So BEWARE! I will not purchase another CBS set of DVDs unless I test them at the store first, which is, of course, impossible. I LOATHE playing DVDs on my computer, which I use for - dare I mention it - work.LET THE BUYER BEWARE. CBS IS GUILTY.	negative
title: Nothing Special [SEP] content: These are no better than normal heel cups you can buy at your local pharmacy. It looks as if the product should provide more support and hold the cup in place better. However, the elastic ankle support is so flimsy that the heel cup easily becomes dislodged and will slide up when inserting your foot into your footwear, even with the product under your socks. Also, the cups themselves do not add that much cushion. Look for another product.	negative
title: Compelling Moments, but Disappointing Overall [SEP] content: I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it. There were several things that did trouble me however:1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person. I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her. Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived. Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements.3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting. For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian.5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy.	negative
title: Bad Movie [SEP] content: I can't believe that Bruce Willis would play in this very bad movie and he looks like he just got out of Bed and looks drunk all the time No class at all and the story line is not their and the movie jumps around way to much and so Bruce Willis should go hide in shame to have made this awful movie But I did love the Girls the only thing good about the movie. Don't pay to watch it ok rent some other movie like The Planet of the Apes" Very good Movie.	negative
title: hell [SEP] content: it is sad that so many people misunderstand the christian idea of hell (including many christians.) we know much more about heaven than hell, for heaven is the home of humanity and therefore contains all that is implied in a glorified human life: but hell was not made for men. it is in no sense parellel to heaven: it is the the darkness outside, the outer rim where being fades away into nonentity.	negative
title: Barbershop Claptrap [SEP] content: This book is nonsense. It makes sense to me that the world's most powerful have influence on world events--even undue influence. It makes sense to me that some hope to create a new world order in which economic ties erode and eventually override political ones. While I think Curtis Dall may have many truthful things to say, his style is so full of inuendo, half truth, and guilt by association that I could hardly recommend this book as a credilble source for one working on a Ph.D. in History. I do not essentially disagree with Dall--I just think his approach is that of a amatuer who is not fully there mentally--and for that reason his potentially good book falls short--rediculously short.He reminds me of the claptrap one used to hear in the old Barbershops of the 50's and before. Belly-scratching bloviating. This tome belongs on the shelf with the UFO books.	negative
title: Violets that need watering! [SEP] content: This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind. And, that also is a disappointment.	negative
title: My First Golf Book [SEP] content: The binding on the book was broken - pages could easily be pulled from the hard cover. A child's name was written on the back inside cover. I would not characterize this book as being in good shape. Very disappointing.	negative
title: Sure, it is cheap, but quality justifies the price [SEP] content: I have own one of these for about 1 year now. When I first I got it, I was really happy. a big tv for less than $600 bucks. After I used it for 1 month, it stopped working. No image. Trying to find customer service number, took forever, but finally find it somewhere hidden. Called, took forever, and got one of local authorized repair center to pick up the tv. After 2 weeks of repair, got it back. Ever since, I have little problem here and there, but still exceptable, afterall, I only pay less than $600 for this. I would not buy another Apex tv. Quality is really bad in my opionion. Out of focus in the corners, color is off, and unstable sound.	negative
title: Befuddling Ladies [SEP] content: I have just finished reading this book. There seems to be a lot of information little heard of before. This would be beneficial except the author's writing is confusing. He writes of Elizabeth Loring, Frances Wentworth, Peggy Shippen, Margaret Moncreife, et al. (and the men in their lives). Yet they are interspersed throughout the book. The chronology is not consistent, and one becomes confused as to which person the author is writing about. The author intermixes actual facts (?) with book reviews which creates further confusion to one not well versed in the subject. The book appears to be a collection of essays thrown together.	negative
title: Starting to go gray [SEP] content: Starting to go gray. Thought i would try this on the grays that are popping up in the front. It was gunky and it didn't look that good. I like the lipstick one much better and have been using that one with great success. Don't buy this one. It's not worth it- try the lipstick version.	negative
title: Are we pretending everyone is married? [SEP] content: The authors pretend that parents neither die nor divorce. Insisting the marriage is the rock upon which all else (behavior, well-being of the child) is built, they send a clear message to non-traditional households: this book is for people who play the game of life our way only, and everyone else can suffer the bad behavior they deserve to.	negative
title: Dud [SEP] content: Where oh where are my beloved Charlatans? Gone are those no-holds-barred organ riffs, the percolating bass lines, and the psychedelic guitarwork. In its place is a "mellow" album that is pretty dull. I understand that bands must mature and move onward. However, this shouldn't occur at the expense of boring the band's audience. This is not the same group that I had come to love over the past ten years.	negative
title: Bourne w/o brains [SEP] content: Just how did the hero learn to drive like that? How did the bad guys find the taxi driver's apartment? Our hero lacks self awareness even with the knock on the head. Bourne knew he was trained, this guy is shallow. Disappointing.	negative
title: directors cut horrible [SEP] content: I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides	negative
title: Buy Demons & Wizards Instead [SEP] content: Having only been familiar with Demons & Wizards (the side-project of Iced Earth's Jon Schaffer and Blind Guardian's Hansi Kursch - a project which I absolutely love) I figured it was high time to check out Schaffer's prime band. I could not have been more disappointed. If The Blessed and the Damned is Iced Earth's "Best Of", I will definately not be wasting my time checking out their other cds. This may sound harsh, but I had high expectations after listening to Demons & Wizards. Schaffer, hook back up with Hansi and make a third D&W cd. Please!	negative
title: what a waste of time [SEP] content: well there are some nice ideas in this show but absolutly no realism, everything scientific riddle, no matter how weird it is, is dissolved in 40 minutes, and the old doc seem to have worked on everything. I allways switch to another channel when this show is running so dont spent your money on it, its just a waste of time	negative
title: The Charm Escapes Me Completely! [SEP] content: I couldn't even get through half of this poorly-written book. It was as though the authors were trying way too hard to think of catchy descriptive words to fit in ad nauseum. I thought it would be "hilarious", but I didn't find it funny in the slightest, in fact it was very boring and empty. It didn't hold my attention, the characters were one dimensional and the writing was oh, so completely bad!I found myself thinking after turning virtually every page, "what a waste of time this is". I finally tossed it into my garage sale box after forcing myself to read almost 1/2 of the book. The popularity of this mindless piece (rather than the subject) makes me worry about the state of society!	negative
title: Very cheap. [SEP] content: These broke when I was screwing them into the wood (in pre-drilled holes). Specifically, the screw broke where it attaches to the hook. I managed to get one screwed in all the way without it breaking. I tugged on it a bit with my pliers to test it and it broke free with hardly any effort (2-3 lbs weight).	negative
title: misleading [SEP] content: The item pictured here is in the factory box and the title says it comes with VoiceXpress.Even though I felt the deal was too good to be true, i ordered it anyway. When it came, it turned out to be an outdated soundcard that doesn't work with Windows XP, and the L&H; Voice Express software? no. not included. What WAS included was a burnt CD including install files for VLC media player, Audacity, and Itunes. I -guess- the drivers for the soundcard were on there (somewhere) but I didn't bother looking.do not buy this product. It is completely and totally not what is advertised here.	negative
title: Not what I saw in the Quantum Pad Sampler Book [SEP] content: I got this book thinking it would fart just like in the sampler book that comes pakaged with the Quantum Pad. But, it dosn't do anything the sampler book does. All it does is get answers wrong!	negative
title: An unintentional primer for Luddites [SEP] content: Want to know why many people fear and loathe technology? Read anything Kurzweil has written. This book draws the incredibly arrogant conclusion that just because computers will soon surpass human being in computing power, they will become superior thinkers and spiritual beings.What a load of crap. Tell me, who will write the software that exceeds human intelligence? The machines themselves? Or perhaps the geniuses of modern computing, who can't even write code to shut down a modern PC without crashing it 20 percent of the time.This book is a catalog for sci-fi horrors. It happily forecasts a world with no privacy, filled with carbon-based morons even less willing than today to create works of art or use the one organ that sets us apart from other beasts.But,hey, it will be a great century for blow-'em up computer games.	negative
title: Shameless double dipping [SEP] content: I've been waiting to get a blu-ray player for many reasons. Mostly it is because I am waiting for my favorite films--LOTR and Star Wars--to be released on blu-ray. The *real* version of LOTR has yet to be released, thus I haven't bought a blu-ray player. This is shameless double-dipping from New Line. The theatrical and extended versions could easily fit on a blu-ray disc. That is the point of blu-ray!!!!! More space on the disc = more video!!! If they had released the extended versions, I would have bought them and a blu-ray player on day one. In addition, I might have bought more New Line films on blu-ray by now too. Instead, New Line has chosen to alienate me as a customer and not receive any income from me (not that they need it). Their loss, not mine. I'm still happy with my extended cuts on DVD.	negative
title: Cool idea, insufficient execution [SEP] content: This should have been a CD-ROM or DVD product. The stills did nothing to inspire or educate me on motion graphic techniques. Nice philosophic text though.	negative
title: Just Read The Book or Watch The Documentary [SEP] content: This movie was so bland I watched it with a group from school and was the only one who didn't find it gave me an emotional response.I personally think AnnaSophia Robb is better at playing very moody roles (as in "Bridge To Terabithia") for some reason she just didn't make a great Bethany. I thought her brothers were the highlight of the film because their proctection of Bethany seemed so real and their emotions so radiating in this surprisingly dry film.I know Bethany Hamilton was pleased with the movie though, which is more important then me being displeased with it.	negative
title: Bad product [SEP] content: I knew when i bought it that it was $20 under all the other sites and that should have thrown up warning signs but i still bought it because the other Doc product i bought (from a store not online) Has been working for 3 years if not more now. But i have had this product less then a month and already the moter is dying and i have to smack it to start moving again. Don't buy these they just plan suck if u want something that is going to last go somewhere else.	negative
title: Beautiful writing, but very slow [SEP] content: In spite of my only chosing 2 stars for the book, I can see why "The Light Ages" was chosen for the World Fantasy Award. Macleod obviously is an experienced and careful writer, and his depictions of the town of Bracebridge and the lives of the people there are so well done that I could almost see the individuals he described.That said, though, I was not able to finish the book because the action is so slow moving. Macleod loves his descriptions of the people and the work of removing aether from the ground, but he spends so much time on those depictions that the narrative just creeps along. I finally gave up, even though I enjoyed reading about the world Macleod was creating, because I felt it was taking too long to get to the action.	negative
title: NOT SO GOOD OVER TIME [SEP] content: UPDATED NOV 22 2009DOWN TO ONLY 1 STAR - PIECE OF JUNK .... BUT THE BATTERY LIFE SEEMS FINE. It just has so little suction and the wet pad idea is just a dirty mess maker. I use it for light (I mean really light) dust-busting, but it is not shaped or designed for just that, so I can't even use it as an effective dust-buster except for a few spots around the house.DO NOT RECOMMEND.I was pleased with the quick light cleaning at first. However over time, it really turned out to be much less useful than I first thought.The suction is terrible and the cleaning pads are a mess. Taking off the dirty ones, washing and replacing makes the whole thing problematic.The pads are attached with velcro and stretch and wear poorly when washed. Thus they do not fit that well once used and washed several times, and the velcro has it's own typical loss of adhesion after constant use.THUMBS DOWN in the long run.	negative
title: CNN describes it as "klunky"; no ecosystem built around it [SEP] content: This 30 GB system is even bigger than Apple's 80 GB video iPod.Hardly any accessories are built for the Zune, no airplanes are installing video adaptors and power adaptors for the Zune, but they are for the iPod. Same with cars.Wireless function is severely hampered. You can get a song "squirted" to you only if the other person gives you permission. Even then, you can only listen to the song three times or for three days, whichever comes first.DRM is even more strict than Apple's Fairplay.Why bother with the Zune?	negative
title: one of the worst movies i ever seen [SEP] content: I think Will Ferrell is not even funny at all i wish that he would hang it up. he just not funny at all the movie sucks if i was you i would not think of getting this movie i would pass. I got this movie and i thought that it would be a good movie and it was not it is as bad as Elf the movie just plain bad..	negative
title: lLost Highway-Lost picture! [SEP] content: What a great shame this beguiling movie has been given a dreaded "pan and scan" release. The widescreen format is especially important to convey the unique sense of tension only David Lynch can achieve- through directing,lighting and set design. I'm afraid I didn't even bother to watch the dvd for this reason and intend to return it as I regard Lost Highway as Lynch's best, most satisfyingly bizzare film to date.	negative
title: Boring and pretentious [SEP] content: I really can't believe that a person would find this movie interesting. The story is unbelievable and simply stupid. I cannot describe to you how little sense this movie makes. One reviewer felt it necessary to use Latin, so why shouldn't I add to the pretention? Hic est malus, Pater optime (in the spirit of Julien Sorel). This movie has no plot. The lead character is not even intelligent enough to shoot himself.	negative
title: Doesn't come with link spring [SEP] content: I thought that this was a reasonable price for the bed especially with the free shipping. The problem is that it doesn't come with the link spring frame that the mattress sits on. The description says it does not include accessories or mattress. I thought accessories meant the bedding. I would never assume the frame wasn't included. They need to be more clear. To order that part, shipped to my area is $172.14. That makes the cost of the bed closer to $800. I think I could have found it cheaper elsewhere. Just do a search for Saigon Daybed on internet, other companies sell it.The only other thing is that the top piece on the back and the sides is wicker. It is pretty, but it looked like wood to me in the picture. I wondered where the wicker was!!	negative
title: Beautiful, but lopsided [SEP] content: I give this product only 1 star because it is not level. I saw the same comment but thought maybe it was a one-off. It looks to be quite consistent with this product so I am returning it. I usually like Rosanna products so this was a disappointment.	negative
title: Warning [SEP] content: This is a top recording of Verdi's Aida - it is BBC Radio 3's "Building a Library" top recommendation.Hovever, do NOT purchase it unless you have special equipment for decoding the DTS digital surround encoding of this recording.IT WILL NOT PLAY IN A STANDARD CD PLAYER.	negative
title: Avoid [SEP] content: As others have said about Broil King it came like it had sand under the nonstick coating. The temp is so uneven that I would never try and cook with it. When it said it was at 350F my infrared temp read 468F on the hot side and 279F on the other. I can't believe all the positive reviews I found by so called testing groups . I'm glad I ordered it from Amazon, They take great care of there customers.	negative
title: Not Designed for Heavy Chewers As Described [SEP] content: I purchase this toy for my Weimaraner, who is a heavy chewer. It is hard to find toys that hold up to her chewing. I gave this to here and she had it is little tiny pieces in less than 20 min. If you dog is even a medium chewer I would say not the toy for them.	negative
title: comfort, design, performance all disappointing [SEP] content: Comfort: the ear cups are a little too small for my ears and end up squishing instead of surrounding - not tolerable for long-term listening given the bulk of these cans. Design: it's a big headset so the aesthetic isn't awesome to begin with, but the arch of the headband is more triangular/cone-headed than the pics suggest. Performance: quality seems decent paired w/ an iPhone 3G (3.0 firmware), but the range is ghastly even by BT standards - signal cuts out completely ~15 ft from the phone (I have another A2DP headset that almost doubles that and degrades quality more gracefully on the way out instead of cutting out completely). Thought I'd give these a shot since they're less than half the price of other over-the-ear options, but it's not worth saving the money if you never use the things. Back they go.	negative
title: funny, but no.2 is better! [SEP] content: Ill sum it up in a couple of words. Excelleny movie, but where the hell is oz and every1 else?????????	positive
title: 14" Cuisinart Stainless skillet /still good to go [SEP] content: I have bought 4 of these and it is the largest pan I have seen to-date. Quality is first rate and no issues of any kind. At this price I wonder if they are going to stop making them??????????????????Can't find anything to report that is bad about this pan! These were gifts to my family and one for myself.Best use is a all in one meal for the family cooked on the stove top.	positive
title: You Wanna Know Joe! [SEP] content: Joe's third album may be his most succesful and I might be going a bit overboard, but I think it's his best. I Wanna Know, the song currently heating up the charts has brought a lot of attention to this man. It is well deserved and if you love that song like I do then you will probally love this cd.Even though I have liked him for a while I think R. Kelly overshadowed him a bit(just an observation). But this cd seperates them by far now. Joe even colleberates with N'Sync, and not being a big fan of them, I kinda like this song.The standout's are: I wanna Know, Treat Her Like A Lady, One Life Stand, and the Remix to Thank God I Found You.I think Joe has another classic on his hands and I am happy to see him having even more success. If you like R&B and Keith Swaet and R. Kelly then you'll like this work, maybe even better. To all you current Joe fans go ahead and pick this cd up, it is another steller piece of work.	positive
title: Kampy, Klever, sooooo Kool [SEP] content: After the first viewing you will say wow! that film was interesting but could have been so much more. This really doesn't matter. After the second viewing you will understand what the filmmakers were going for and how they succeded on every level. It could be remade, but it would probably lose much of its low budget charm and freshness. The cast is only marginally good but it's not a variable. The film plays like a nightmare and is a perfect addition to MGM's Midnite Movie collection because it is best viewed in the later kult hours. You might just walk away unsure about clowns and their motives. What a fresh concept. Thank you Chiodo Brothers!	positive
title: Very good travel brush [SEP] content: This is a very nice badger brush. It is even better because of the portability. It packs very well and seems to dry nicely even if it is put into my toiletry bag just after use.	positive
title: saucepan [SEP] content: Product is very good. However the handle does get a little hot when boiling water. But otherwise good. Prompt delivery.	positive
title: Great for stainless steel [SEP] content: This stuff is like magic. I used it on a stainless steel revolver with a dull, lifeless finish. An hour's easy work and it was gleaming and mirror-like. Encouraged by this I tried it on a set of 40 year old stainless steel flatware that had long lost its shine and had resisted any efforts to restore it with other polishes. Once again the Mothers did the trick (and without much rubbing either.) The flatware doesn't look quite new, but the Mothers definitely removed at least 30 years of staining. I am seriously impressed.	positive
title: It is a great toy [SEP] content: This is a great toy to have!I would ride it every chance I had.I think it is well priced. It is fun for 6-9 years of age.When I got the E-100 a lot of my friends saw me riding it and they got it too.This a fun toy to have and you should buy it!	positive
title: Excellent Book !!! [SEP] content: I just finished reading this book. I must say, that as a PC tech , this book is one of the best I've come across. Carey has made it easy for the casual user to understand how to take care of their own computer and fix simple problems. It's written in simple to understand language that anyone can follow. This book is also a valuable reference for even experienced technicians.I will be recommending this book as a must have for all of my customers. Thanks to Carey for bringing a book like this to the masses.	positive
title: The man is truly human... [SEP] content: I think we all grow up hearing, reading and being told about the founding fathers but rarely do any of us really read about them as individuals. Every time I do I'm amazed at what I read and how far ahead of their time they really were. Benjamin Franklin epitomizes this; printer, scientist, inventor, diplomat, politician and above it all human. This book gets into some of that nitty-gritty; the women, the ruthless businessman, more women, questionable husband and father.The author does an amazing job walking us through Franklin's life and showing us the brilliance of the man and the fallibility at the same time.Wonderful read and would recommend it to everyone - just be prepared to devote some time to it.	positive
title: Praise for International Marionettes [SEP] content: I liked the fact the book was written by an ex employee of a major corporation in a manner that related the true feelings that many management employees experience, but do not have the courage to talk about, much less write about. It brings home the job pressures and the need to continually perform and improve. It also clearly outlines what lengths the corporate world will go to to maintain control.The author is to be saluted for having the backbone to fight back and to stand for principle. Most of all it is a story of his tenacity and need to persist and to get answers. Several of the chapters deal with the author's dark side and indiscretions which add flavor, but cause one to say "why did he do that?"	positive
title: Grey's Anatomy [SEP] content: I am very happy with the quality of the DVD's. However the DVD case was broken and whoever packed it for shipping had to have known. I do not believe this was a shipping accident.	positive
title: My Teeter Hanger for my ankles [SEP] content: the unit came on time and complete transction went very well. The unit does was it expected but i believe it is a bit difficult to use if your back it not well. the angles of bending required are extreme for someone with a bad back. They did allow my sore ankles from the cross bar to heal. There are too many moving parts to complete the closure.For folks in good shape just doing maintance then you should be handle it with no issue. Very safe and secure with no issues.	positive
title: GREAT album [SEP] content: This band is SO under appreciated. They should've sold a TON of CDs. ALL of their releases are excellent. Don't just listen to "If You Could Only See". Listen to all of the songs. Great albums, all of them. This one and Sugar are my favorites. Head on Straight is also good.	positive
title: Best Travel Mug I've owned [SEP] content: I've had quite a few travel mug. So far, this is the best that I've ever had. FIrst of all, it keeps the coffee hot for quite a while. I would say, it stays warm enough to be pleasant around 5 hours. Also, how hot it stays depends on how often you open it. The second reason I love this mug is it is super simple to clean. There is nowhere for the coffee to get trapped and fester. It's also really simple to put together. Lastly, it's really easy to tell if it's open or not. I love this thing.	positive
title: Highly recommended reading for students of Buddhism. [SEP] content: Gay Watson, et.al. edit The Psychology Of Awakening, which provides an important survey of Buddhism and science in daily lives. Essays consider Buddhist influences in psychology and social settings alike.	positive
title: The Table [SEP] content: We have this table and its been great! We have it in the dinningroom beside our table...on carpet.She loves to eat at it - if shes ready to eat she goes and sits at the table...the chairs are really light wieght so she has no trouble pulling them out to sit in.The chairs are pretty sturdy to, she has me sit in them all the time and her daddy..lol - I would recommend trying it out -	positive
title: So happy to find [SEP] content: I had a thermometer like this several years ago and it broke. I have been looking for one all over my small town and also several stores in Indianapolis and couldn't find one. I have had to use several cheap tube like thermometers. (They break so easily.) I was so thrilled to find one and I ordered it. It came so quickly and was packed so well. I was extrememly satisfied.	positive
title: LOVE THIS!!!! [SEP] content: I Love, love, love this show. I really hope ABC brings them back for another season, it's a great show, but not for younger kids. If you liked Desperate Housewives you'll love this show, (i never really watched D.H.) it also has LOTS of stars you know from some great shows. I don't think i saw a single episode that didn't make me laugh! Not just me either, my father who is a Walker, Texas Ranger fan though and though LOVED this show. You don't have to take my word for it, see for yourself. I give this show 5 STARS if i could it would be 10!!	positive
title: Wasn't sure at first.... [SEP] content: Like I said, I wasn't sure about this one at first. But once I started it, I couldn't (or didn't want to) put it down. Can't wait for the next one.	positive
title: Wouldn't it be nice to know what people are using against you? [SEP] content: That's what this course offers....real world examples of negotiating tactics. I've been in sales for 10 years...after listening to this material from Roger Dawson I realized that I wasn't a good negotiator, I was a serial caver...I would give in on just about everything. This course teaches you the skills to get to a win win situation without having to cave on every point. It also helps you understand what people are trying to do to you during the negotiation and helps you overcome these points. Great material.	positive
title: Good for Starting a Collection [SEP] content: I have liked almost every recipe that I have tried from this book. I have purchased it twice. Once for myself and once as a gift for a friend. I would recommend it for anyone starting out a vegan kitchen. If you already have loads of vegan cookbooks, you might want to just skip this one and get a specialty cookbook like "The Mediterrean Vegan Kitchen".	positive
title: Eldoncard Great Product [SEP] content: I bought the Eldoncard Blood Typing Kit because I was not able to get in touch with my children's pediatrician, being that he retired and is no longer practicing. I could not find any blood type in my childrens medical records. Therefore I bought the Eldoncard Blood Typing Kit. The product was everything it said it would be. I was able to tell the blood types of my children in a matter of minutes, plus I was able to laminate the cards and keep them in a file. Great Product.	positive
title: Fabulous [SEP] content: I read this book for the first time in sixth grade for a book report. It soon became one of the few books that would burn in my memory for a long time. It took two hours of reading a day to finish in time for the book report, but it was well worth it.	positive
title: Country as well as folk. [SEP] content: I am glad to see that certain folksingers such as WoodyGuthrie are now also considered country singers. After all,some folk music is traditional nonpopular country music, andsome folk music is not country music.	positive
title: The source of Timeline [SEP] content: Some people might rate it low. However, Michael Crichton read it, used it, and hit the jackpot again with Timeline. In the References of his bestseller book he praised it.	positive
title: If Only... [SEP] content: all our busy families occasionally took time to JUST enjoy each other's company. This simple, yet inspiring, read aloud will make children yearn for days just like that and, hopefully prompt harried moms and dads to take time to savor the families they've created. The delightful verse of the story comes joyfully to life with bright, fun, water-colored illustrations. This is a book to read over and over.	positive
title: great book [SEP] content: I am a fan of Jan Brett books. I think her artwork is superb. This is a sweet story and the illustrations are wonderful. My grandchildren love her books. Amazon had a better price than Barnes and Noble, and that includes my member discount.	positive
title: Great curling iron ! [SEP] content: Doesn't tangle in your hair. great for fine hair. makes frizzies into soft curls. Soft tips keep it from hurting your scalp. I've used this type for many years & wouldn't use any other kind. I use them until the bristles break off from daily use. please keep making them !	positive
title: How fat creates oppression and stereotypes [SEP] content: Fat people are widely represented in popular culture as being revolting: as agents of disgust yet Kathleen LeBesco argues in Revolting Bodies?: The Struggle To Redefine Fat Identity that fatness is more than a health or aesthetic issue: it is also a political issue. Revolting Bodies? informatively and thoughtfully considers sites of struggle over the cultural meaning of fatness and will have a special appeal to college-level health students as well as the health and fitness community with respect to its analysis of how fat creates oppression and stereotypes.	positive
title: Greene's Greatest? [SEP] content: To start with, I am a Greene fanatic, so you might take my opinion with a grain of salt. I didn't read The End of the Affair for many years after I'd read virtually all of Greene's other novels. I love his thrillers, his adventures, his "serious" works. But I didn't think I'd love a book about an adulterous affair, particularly one with God and Catholicism at its center. I finally got around to it. How wrong, wrong, wrong I was.Having read it twice, I now have to ask whether it's Greene's best book. Every aspect of the book is unexpected: the reason their affair ends, why she leaves, who the man she's seeing is, Bendrix's response, all the way to the end where Bendrix befriends her husband.What in other hands would have been a simple morality play, is so much more thrilling. An absolute masterpiece, unlike anything else written by GG (or anyone else).	positive
title: Loved It! Loved It! Loved It! [SEP] content: This book was incredible. I am a very picky reader and usually buy books written by a select few, eg., Walter Mosley, Omar Tyree or Dianne McKinney-Whetstone. However, I am always on the look-out for new authors to add to my collection. Nina Corbett hit the nail on the head with this book. I really enjoyed the story because it felt like I was sharing and listening with two of my good friends. Ms. Corbett's unique way of telling a story allowed me to express some sort of emotion at each chapter--whether it was laughter, sadness or utter "hands on my hips" disbelief.I also enjoyed the way the title and the chapters related to well known songs. Ms. Corbett also impressed me with the list of questions at the back of the book. It made me want to start my own book club just so that I could share this book with others!!!"Standing In The Shadows Of Love" is a real page turner and has a story that every woman can relate to. I look forward to Ms. Corbett's next novel.	positive
title: Insightful look at today's politics [SEP] content: I've always been a fan of Sean Hannity from listening to him on the radio, and his book, "Let Freedom Ring," just enforces my good thoughts on the guy. He speaks sensibly and is sure not to sound too arrogant, while at the same time, powerfully asserting his political beliefs. I don't know how he does it.Thanks, Sean!	positive
title: All the right moves! [SEP] content: John Argue's movement program for reduction of degenerative Parkinson's Disease symptoms is relatable and accessible, allowing almost any general reader to put it into action. Tangible images for movement like the "horse" posture and "picking up a baby" give readers something to latch onto that will help them mentally and physically integrate the movement. The disease in question, elements that can cure it, and the dynamics of how patients cope with it are incredibly complex - yet Argue manages to deliver beneficial commentary on all three consisely, compellingly, and even joyfully. In addition, the hope in his tone is just as important for patients in healing as the exercises he delivers. For all of these reasons I highly recommend this text for any Parkinson's Disease patient or carer seeking alternative, yet conclusively effective, methods for stemming the progression of this disease.	positive
title: This is true music by a group of super talented musicians under the leadership of a true monster of his generation, Mr. Peter G [SEP] content: You can dance, sing, meditate, have fun while watching this masterpiece! Mr. Gabriel, is a true gentleman I don't know too many of his kind these days.	positive
title: Amazing but different [SEP] content: its not a perfect radiohead album but its brillant still listening to it a lot after 6 months i love radioheads rock and mellow songs and aint big on electronic crap thats why its not perfect but when radiohead get it right they are untouchable	positive
title: Excellent Toy!!! [SEP] content: At 4 months, my daughter would not bear much weight on her legs. After purchasing this product, that has all changed!!! She bounces in it all the time, plus has greater strength in her torso. She absolutely loves being in her exersaucer. It is amazing all that she has learned to do, from turning the pages of the electonic book to pulling on the toys from the bar. This is the best money I have spent on a toy for my daughter because not only has it helped her in reaching developmental milestones, but she smiles the entire time she is in it. I would highly recommend the SmartSteps Exersaucer to any parent.	positive
title: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know ABout Vegetables....... [SEP] content: James Peterson has put together a veritable encyclopedia about vegetables in this great book. It covers all the most common everyday vegetables, plus a large number of not so common vegetables. Recipes range from the very basic to the more complex, but there is certainly something for eveyone to be found in this book. One of my favorite recipes made from this book was Tomato Gratin With Bread, Cream And Bacon. As the host of my own culinary website Italian Food Forever, and someone who collects cookbooks, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in vegetables.	positive
title: Good product and great Amazon service [SEP] content: I had been looking for a decent 2nd. carving set for a while when this one came up on special. Excellent quality for the price. Cannot fault Amazon's service for quickly sending me a replacement set when the 1st. one got lost somewhere in the wilds of Australia.	positive
title: Good but also consider [SEP] content: I'm not saying I'm not buying this book... I'm thinking it over... but I just bought Movie Outline (software) that does this too... instead of sequences , it calls them steps... so you can organize your screenplay, reorder steps quickly, see things in script mode, index card mode, scene list, step list etc. I think this book may go well together with this software for new , brand new screenwriters. And no, nobody is paying me for saying nice things about the software, though I wish they would... maybe once I sell a screenplay!	positive
title: interesting & usefull [SEP] content: small & quite handy book. Usefull when one's in doubt about the color range. I can recommand it to anyone.	positive
title: Coffee maker [SEP] content: I perched a Bunn Coffee maker through Amazon from Wet Beans. It was a used unit and had been cleaned and in good shape. It came with two pots and a plastic pitcher for filling it and complete documentation. I am happy with it and it works well but they should have included the spring that is used for cleaning it. The spring cost so little but I had to order it from another source. Ron	positive
title: Lightweight cord reel [SEP] content: This is a lightweight, inexpensive cord reel that actually holds 150 feet of 14-gauge extension cord. The only thing I would have liked would be if there was a way to have the plug extend from the reel so that you could plug it in without having to completely unwind it from the reel. Otherwise, it works as advertised.	positive
title: I hate Paladin's but I love this Book! [SEP] content: This book was so wonderful I almost had a heart attack after I read it. I mean I hate paladin's but the book was so well written It helped me get the few arrogent players who played them into line quick by helping me tighten the reins a little on exactly what Paladin's should and should not be doing.	positive
title: Texmark Rechargeable portable pump [SEP] content: This pump is a great size and powerfull. It blew up a hi-rise twin bed in a couple of minutes.The only negative is the attachment nozzles do not lock on so I found they fell off easily.	positive
title: A good movie [SEP] content: I think this is a good movie. You might have to watch it twice before you understand it. The story has been compressed very tightly, transitions are short, characters develop suddenly, and nearly every line of dialogue is essential. This doesn't prevent it from being an enjoyable movie; it just requires the viewer to pay close attention.	positive
title: Quirky, off-beat material that any Denver fan will love [SEP] content: I have listented to this album hundreds of times. My father used to take the tape along when we went fishing in Wisconsin and we would listen to it over and over together. The material is a real departure from what John Denver usually records. There is a John Prine song in there, a Christmans song, a song about the Canadian Rockies, and it all fits together to form a relaxing, interesting record. I highly recommend Farwell Andromeda to any John Dever fan. It's different, but I bet you'll be playing it over and over just as I have.mike grabowski	positive
title: More O'Malley Excitement [SEP] content: Stephen O'Malley is a paramedic who has had enough of being a big city EMT. In a promise to his dying sister, Jennifer, he says he will leave the big city to take care of heart attacks and sprains in the slower pace of the country. On his way out of Chicago, he receives a call from Meghan, a childhood friend, who is looking for a little comfort from the rainstorm and a ride to her parents' house.The story of Stephen and Meghan's early relationship is told brilliantly in flashbacks. When the story catches up to present day, the plot twists and turns like a scenic mountain road, blending Stephen and Meghan's lives with a series of jewel thefts. This is by far the most tantalizing O'Malley mystery. Stephen's struggle with the concept of having a relationship with God adds spiritual depth to the novel.The other O'Malley novels are: The Negotiator, The Guardian, The Truth Seeker, The Protector, The Healer, The Rescuer. Each is a wonderful read!	positive
title: Great recording [SEP] content: I must admit, Dave Grusin is one of my favourite musicians. I alway liked the "original" two-channel recording. But this DTS recording gives you even more excitement! Once you are addicted to multi-channel music you will hardly accept/like conventional recordings anymore.With this album high quality music goes together with high quality recording...	positive
title: Real CSI show! [SEP] content: It's just like the real program on TV! I felt like I'm part of the team! It's no graphic play, but definitely entertaining! I bought the 2nd edition, too!	positive
title: The Best! [SEP] content: The finest compilation of music I've ever experienced, Christmas music or otherwise.Own 2 copies, & bought one each for Mom & sister for Xmas. I have been to their Xmas concert every year since '04, sometimes twice!	positive
title: Very good product [SEP] content: This Breadmaker was purchased to replace an old one which had simply worn out over several years of use. My wife has found it to be easy to use and very efficient in baking bread. Although it took several attempts to get use to the new model, because the instructions were different from the old maker, once she became used to the new one it was as easy or easier to use than the previous model. While we could not say it is an improvement over the other brand name it most certainly is as good and easy to use. One good feature is that it bakes the bread much quicker than the previous breadmaker. It runs very quietly, much quieter than the other unit,and you hardly know it is working.The cost of this new unit was very reasonable for the work it does and we consider it a good purchase.While not having it long enough to attest to the Sunbeam's longivity, so far it is operating as advertised and we are very pleased with the product.	positive
title: Sensationally wicked masterpiece! [SEP] content: A best-seller in its day, Quaker City is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Anyone who likes Edgar Allen Poe or the Marquis de Sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important American novels. I'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and I look forward to more of Lippard's novels coming back to print. Devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to Jarry's Pere Ubu, Faulkner's Popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century.	positive
title: Its not what you think..... [SEP] content: Your supposed to think chain letter is about some evil curseor a demon out to kill.....but its not. I really suggest this book for more people who enjoy a more of a fictious plot, but not some monster risen from the dead plot. everything in this book could of happened.	positive
title: The Best, better than the 1959 Remake!! [SEP] content: I saw this movie on TV many times as a child, and everytime I saw it I would cry at the end. I have read other reviews about how the movie is dated and "politically incorrect", c'mon people this movie was made decades ago, and for it's time, it was and is dynamite, I will always remember the scene at the end where, the maid has literally died of a broken heart,'cause her daughter has rejected her. There is a funeral procession led by beautiful white horses, and Mahalia Jackson is singing at the Funeral , and the Maid's daughter running behind the funeral procession, screaming "Mama, I'm sorry!". This movie is my absolute all time favorite.	positive
title: As good as my Power Flow class! [SEP] content: After my employer canceled our power flow yoga class (because of budget cuts), I've been at loose ends, wishing for a comparable workout. I've tried our local yoga studio, and none of their classes gave me the same kind of fast-paced, heat-generating session that I enjoyed previously. The good news is that I found it in this video! I'm very pleased with the purchase, and would recommend this video to anyone who wants to build strength and flexibility.To anyone wishing for a laid-back, meditation-type yoga, this is not the one for you.	positive
title: Westerns [SEP] content: This was a very good movie showing descrimination against Indians. Audie Murphy as Cash was a perfect example of hatred for Indians, even though she had been raised his adopted sister,during the time depicted. Burt was Burt (great) as well as Hepburn (awsome).	positive
title: A departure for Mason that remains intriguing [SEP] content: The first time I listened to this record I was baffled over Mason's choice of subjects and use of loose, reggae- and jazz-flavored rhythms. But after a while, the heartfelt nature with which he paid tribute to Dr. King, the barely-boiling-over anger of Global Empire, the ode to true love in Ballad for My One True Love and the sighing loss of Train Leaving Gray seemed to pinpoint not only the struggles that Mason seemed to be facing as a songwriter but the same struggles that most of humanity faces in one form or another.	positive
title: Works great with ATTBI in Fort Collins, CO [SEP] content: The pain of getting it set up is well worth the price. After 4 phone calls to ATTBI's tech support, it works great! 3 of 4 tech support peeps kept telling me I needed to pay [the money] to have someone come out and install it. THIS IS [NONSENSE]! Finally one of the tech supporters knew what to do: Simply register the cable modem at their online site...Make sure you register your computer with your current modem, then register your 3com modem. If you don't reg your 3com modem at that site, you'll get slow speeds (~100k instead of 1.5M). Like I said, the only trouble I had getting this modem set up was with attbi's tech support. Once I found someone who know what they were talking about, it went smoothly. Plus [buying] the modem sure beats [the] lease fee!! :)	positive
title: For Those who have a devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus [SEP] content: This little book is a treasure of inspiring quotes, lessons and teachings for those who wish to grow in love and devotion to the Sacred Heart. St. Gertrude is taught by the great Teacher and shares what she has learned from Him. I have learned much and been unable to put it down. It is beautiful. I recommend it to any Christian who loves Jesus and wants to grow in that love and devotion.	positive
title: Fascianting...and so different to what I expected [SEP] content: A fascinating book, wonderfully written, that was completely different to anything I expected. Hard and harsh, yet at the same time full of hope and joy, however hidden these may be by the struggles the plague brings to an English village.	positive
title: Kodak EasyShare C533 [SEP] content: I was so scared to buy my first digital camera and probably did more than anyone's share of "research" before I bought this, but It has been nothing but wonderful and so easy to use..Amazon helped with any questions I had and it was shipped almost immediatley...I love IT!!!!!!!	positive
title: Requirement [SEP] content: My son got accepted to the High School of Engineering and Science. So this is a must have for the next four years. I decided on the SE version over the standard as it has a faster processor (which is not a deal breaker) but the additional memory for storage is what makes this a better buy over the standard.	positive

title: kickboxing bag [SEP] content: My son does karate and this is great for him to practice his kicks. It is adjustable for his height.	positive
title: Fast, good brew, [SEP] content: Tasty brew in a coffee maker with design that takes less 'visual' space on the counter--especially if used in a corner. Use your own thermos caraf or 'construction-worker' type thermos if you wish to savor your coffee throughout the day.In addition, the plastic parts' snug fit, well-balanced glass caraf, and 'sleek' design make this the perfect drip coffee maker--especially at this price.	positive
title: Good for what we needed! [SEP] content: We placed game show board games out as center pieces at our company meeting and this was a fun one to display. The game came on time and in great condition!	positive
title: Absolutely incredible! [SEP] content: If you love Blues guitar, or any guitar for that matter, you must own this album.If you play guitar, and you think you're getting pretty hot, take a lesson in humility and study this man's technique.	positive
title: belle and sebastian at their best [SEP] content: i didnt think they could top push barman to open wounds, but they did it, and in empahtic fashion. Catchy melodies, great guitar riffs, and beautiful singing make this album best of 06 so far.	positive
title: Fabulous [SEP] content: This is my favorite show and without a doubt the most interesting one I've ever seen. I loved the chemistry between Michael and Nikita and so incredibly dissapointed when it was taken off the air. I wish people wouldn't compare it to Alias because Alias is nothing more than silly knock-off. Watch the real thing!	positive

Omg this cd is soo good i just cant stop listening to it. as soon as i heard this i thought wow this stuff is really awesome. I think the best part of this album is the rapping mos def.

title: The Greatest American Slacker Satire [SEP] content: Simply put, this piece-de-resistance of cinematic masterpieces has earned its reputation. There is no other movie that creates the same aura of brilliance Kevin Smith manages. Its perfect. Its acting is great, the direction is superfluous, and the screenplay is magnanimously pulchritudinous."That's a beautiful ring sir" "Yes, its my college ring, Graduated Cum Laude in 1969" "That's interesting I hope to Cum Loud in a 69 myself"	positive
title: Wolf and Iron [SEP] content: Apparently written for adolescents, this book still has relevance for the adult population since it deals with the effects of economic melt down and survival as well as the interaction between man and beast.	positive
title: good quality, but high shipping charge [SEP] content: the scratch resistant screen guard protector is fit perfectly on the screen of HTC cingular 8125. Quality of the screen guard protector is very good. only negative point is high shipping charge. it cost me $4.99 as shipping for buying this item which cost $ 3.49 amazon has to reduce the shipping charge, or reduce the shipping charge for combined items. any way best buy.	positive
title: totally a read-again! [SEP] content: Wow! This was one of the best books I've ever read. It's just sort of sad that it was a little short, it ended before I wanted it to! To me that is a sign of a really great book. It's inspired me to begin writing a book about vamps, it's just so hard to pry myself away from her wonderful ideas and use my own! Great for someone who is looking for a world to escape to, characters to relate to, and senarios to base dreams on (seriously, I mean dreams, not like how you want to live!).Over all, an awesome book, the characters appear in my mind so vividly that It's like I know them myself.Fellow teens, watch out! Get ready to be blown away!Oh, yeah. and one more thing, she's completely an inspiration to the writing tallent I've always had, inspiring me to write serious novels! Looking for motivation to keep writing? Read this and her other works!	positive
title: Love their books, Audio is not bad. [SEP] content: Using Examkrackers books and Audio Osmosis study guide, my MCAT score jumped 4 points from a 32 to a 36.Good to listen to while doing mind-numbing work, or running, or sleeping.	positive
title: Nice trunk [SEP] content: I was very impressed on how fast it was delivered, in less than a week - product was well packed.It doesn't look excatly like the picture, there are some visible "bolts" and the finish is alright, the bolts look ok with the style - the greatest feature is the fact it doesn't close automatically so it is safe for children, which is what I need.It's good for a kid room but I would not put this in a living room as again the finish is not great but for the price, I can't complain - overall I would recommend it for a kid room.	positive
title: It's the best song ever ... [SEP] content: I love this cd! It includes I'll Never Break Your Heart it's beautiful and I thinks everybody knows it; Nunca Te Haré Llorar(Spanish Version of I'll Never Break Your Break)I speak spanish and it really touches my heart and last but definetly not least Quit Playin' Games With My Heart Live Version. I think everyone will love it!	positive
title: Great gameplay, poor documentation [SEP] content: This game really deserves a 5 but lack of documentation and some clunky user interfaces makes it fall short. The gameplay and graphics are quite well done and make this a great addition to any naval gamers collection. You will be left having to figure some things out for yourself as the documentation merely hints at some fo the features in the game but after a little bit of playing around you will discover these. Most are in the "on base" portion of the game and therefore don't distract from the actual gameplay itself.I wish I would have purchased this sooner - it's a lot of fun to play.	positive
title: Some of the most beautiful music you will ever hear. [SEP] content: I grew up in the Moravian church and the treatment of these dear and familiar tunes blesses me each time I listen to this album.	positive
title: vista operating system [SEP] content: Fairly good book. Covers the obvious but ignores many of problems of Vista. I went to Google, mentioned the problem and found out it was a common problem. Someone had the solution which worked. More emphasis should have been given to the differences between XP and Vista	positive
title: Sturdy, Comfortable, Good Sound [SEP] content: I needed headphones to use in a workshop situation where I have 10-20 people listening to a single sound source. When I saw these headphones with the extra long cords and volume control, I was instantly sold.The straight style cord is good for bundling, storage and moving. I have another pair of headphones with a curly cord that is a pain to untangle after they have been in a bag.The over the ear cup design is perfect to insulate people from outside sounds. They are adjustable for different head shapes and sizes. The sound quality is good (not excellent), but adequate for my needs. They are sturdy, so I don't worry about them getting broken during transport.If you are buying many headphones for public use, I really think these can't be beat.	positive
title: Excellent Experience [SEP] content: This vendor shipped the product out when promised. They had excellent follow-up by sending me an email to let me know shipping information. I would definitely use this vendor again , as well as recommend to my family members and friends.	positive
title: half bottle decanter perfect size [SEP] content: This decanter was well packaged and arrived quickly. I gave it as a gift to some wine loving friends. They had admired ours previously and we new that this would be good gift. Most decanters are too big for the table, too big for two people who may not drink a whole bottle in one night. This small size airs half bottle elegantly. It cleans easier than a big decanter and take far less space to store due to its smaller base. A practical wine gift.	positive
title: Great with Medifast Diet [SEP] content: I am currently on the medifast diet and have had trouble with constipation. This has helped tremendously. I even have my Husband on the tea to help with the liver claims. Taste is not bad, not good just bland. Try a small box and then you'll buy the larger size like I did!	positive
title: easy to wear all day [SEP] content: I wear knee pads aleast eight hours a day doing metal stud framing.very good pad but...the only thing that bother me, is sometmes the metal rivit will dig in to the side if I'm at a akwared angle and the strap can dig in abit but it's not painful more... anoying.If they last me six month I'll keep useing them	positive
title: Awesome book with great detail!!!! [SEP] content: It was a very exciting and was very insane at times like flying through a Mcdonalds as a falcon or something like that. It made me feel like I was right into the action sort of. If you havent read it I really recomend it to be read by you peoples out there. I never Cassie could do all of that by herself because I thought that she might lose it or something. It's also very neat that she saved ax because she never was familiar with the brain surgery that she had done on ax. I hope that everyone gets the chance to do that by them selves just like Cass did. I also repeat it is an awesome book and got very insane sometimes.	positive
title: Just ordered more.... [SEP] content: Just ordered more....Sprayway Glass Cleaner - 6 Cans....I Love this stuff the best class and mirror cleaner...and I Love the smell!~ Will always buy this as long as it's available!~	positive
title: A "must see" [SEP] content: I strongly recommend you to buy this product.It has a very good sound and video quality considering the age of the footage.Also it features some comments made by Roger Taylor and Brian May.This is one of those concerts you don't wanna miss.R.I.P Freddie Mercury	positive
title: Ultravox Mon Amour! [SEP] content: Like the other reviewers here, I too, counted THREE INTO ONE as one of the best anthologies by the pre-Ure Ultravox. That is, until this set came along. This generous anthology serves up all the key tracks - from the Eno-produced "The Wild, The Beautiful And The Damned" to "My Sex" and "Hiroshima Mon Amour", this version of Ultravox was the missing link between Roxy Music and Adam Ant, punk and new wave, glam and art-rock. Its influence on everything that came out of the U.K. in the eighties can't be measured. You certainly don't need all three Island albums; this set is absolutely all you require and you should do so without guilt or remorse. Recommended.	positive
title: I Love The Wilkinsons [SEP] content: I've heard parts of there new songs. I'm going to get the cd after school. I can't wait to get the cd. I hope they come to Halifax again soon! THE WILKINSONS ARE AWESOME!	positive
title: Not Better Than Game [SEP] content: Seeing as I loved Ender's Game, I bought Speaker for the Dead its sequel. Let's just say I was confused to high heavens in the first few chapters. First off, all these new characters came and I must have reread chapters one and two about five times before moving onward. Another thing was the major changes between this book and Ender's Game.However I took my time and reread each chapter and finally got a firm grip on the story and continued reading. I found the beginning somewhat boring but in the middle and end were great. I found once Ender got to Lusitania the story picked up greatly. Good read and I recommend it, four starts.	positive
title: It works for me! [SEP] content: My dentist recco'd getting a nightguard and said try the ones at pharmacy before speind $$$ on a custom one. I tried this and it took 2-3 nights to get used to but it seems to work now. Keep in mind you have to adjust it to fit and then wear it to make sure you have adjusted it correctly...so it may take a few days to get it right. For me, Its comfortable and it is working - my jaw is not sore when I wake up...a good product. It was onsale for about $30 but I know the reg price is about $40. That is a good deal.	positive
title: Still working fine after 7+ years!!! [SEP] content: I've had this TV since August 2003 for $3100 CDN. I am writing this now in June 2011. I have never had to replace the lamp and it's still working fine. It is my main TV and I would guess that I watch on average 2 hours a day (conservative estimate). that's over 5600 hours.I've noticed over the past few months the warm-up period of it turning on is getting longer; probably signs that I will need to buy a new lamp. Buying a new lamp off of ebay for $125 Canadian.I know there are a lot of reviews giving it a bad rating, but I really can't complain. I got my moneys worth and the picture is still really good. I have a blu-ray player with DVI connected to it and looks great. I really wonder how long I'll keep the TV since the technology is getting old. Maybe I'll move it to the bedroom when I can't resist buying a new slimmer LED TV.	positive
title: Excellent quality of sound. [SEP] content: Headphones performed as advertised. Quality of sound is excellent, in fact, I find myself hearing background sounds I never heard before. It is a great product for husband and wife that have differing hearing levels.	positive
title: Spellbinding But Deceptive [SEP] content: Perhaps I have become desensitized, but I found the novel to be misleading; Cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; I expected something far more sinister. The preview outshines the work itself. I did enjoy reading it, however; Cook's style is soft, understated, and utterly mesmerizing, perfect for late night reading. His style flows and drifts into the subconscious; it's alluring prose, even if it leads to a less than riveting conclusion.	positive
title: Romantic [SEP] content: This is a wonderful collection of romantic music. The Harp is absolutely exquisite in this collection.	positive
title: Gift from Across the Miles [SEP] content: This gift was for my Nephew's 1st birthday. Having no kids of my own and living about 5 states away, I had NO IDEA what to get him. I remembered playing with Fisher Price when I was a kid and thought this was very cute ( I love animals!). I read some of the other reviews about this product and found them to be very positive and decided on this for his gift. I'm so glad I did! My sister said "He LOVES it!". He takes the animals with him on car trips and loves to take apart and put back together the ark. I would recommend this product to anyone with small kids, and perhaps anyone not sure of what to get small kids as gifts.	positive
title: Fantastic Sci-Fi [SEP] content: This has a decent storyline and plot development. Though most of the characters are static, some do grow into an anchor for the show and its life.	positive
title: Excellent product [SEP] content: After reading a number of reviews, I decided to give this shaver a try. I use an electric shaver as a touch-up for evenings out when I don't want to show the 5:00 shadow but don't want to pull out the razor.I shave in the shower -- and frankly, nothing is better. I tried to go all electric when this unit arrived -- but I just can't get the shave I'm used to. I'm sure I did not give my face enough time to adjust.I wasn't sure how I would like the pivot head -- but it's great. All in all, this is an excellent shaver for my use.Of course, it goes without saying -- Amazon is a delight to do business with.	positive
title: Can't stop listening to it! [SEP] content: This album really truely rocks. It is something that I have wanted to hear on the radio for a long time. It is a refreshing break from the sameness of alternative music lately. Other rock bands should try to learn something from The Donnas.	positive
title: A Must Read [SEP] content: this was a very good book. its about friendship,love,and struggles. u learn that when u think its ova..its not! Read it!	positive
title: Compare [SEP] content: This book is an eloquently written, serious, and original set of lectures. The book will interest political scientists as much as historians or just simple readers ( as myself) because of its explicit orientation to " International history" . There is a highlight of very deep manipulation of the concepts of power, economy, and culture in order to explain why his three eras-late Meiji, interwar, and postwar differ from each other.Well, is not a simple analysis, and is without spelling errors , not as some reviews about it.	positive
title: Invaluable Guide [SEP] content: My daughter and I used the 9th Edition of Frommer's Tokyo on our recent trip to Japan. We found it to be well written, easy to use with very down to earth suggestions. Since neither of us had any prior knowledge of Tokyo, it was invaluable. We had a most enjoyable week, but we wouldn't have had so many wonderful experiences without this guide.	positive
title: One of the best cognitive books I've ever read [SEP] content: A must for those who are familiar with Luria's works, Assessment of Cognitive Processes is a wonderful book, explaining the best intelligence theory to date: the PASS theory of intelligence. Focusing more on abilities and not in capacities or mere base of knowledge, the PASS stands for Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive processes. I use a lot this theory in conceptualizing my cognitive and neurocognitive cases. The PASS Remedial Pogram (PREP) who stand for PASS Reading Enhancement Program is very useful for children with reading disorders, training them to develop Succesive and Simultaneous strategies. A wonderful addition to the field. If you are a cognitive psychologist or a school psychologist and do a lot of work with children this is the right book for and introduction to remedial instruction	positive
title: Endless Fun by Land or Water [SEP] content: Pros: This is a great toy. Our golden retriever could chase it forever. It's great in a lake, pond, beach (be careful of waves) or also in a field. It never had a problem floating. The rope allows you to throw it a good distance.Cons: Our dog chews through the rope if unsupervised. It doesn't last long if she gets to it and chews it. So...we put it away when we're not using it. Problem solved.Beat dog toy ever! This is her favorite toy by far!	positive
title: Been there, Done that [SEP] content: I was in the 1/9th Blues at the time of which this was written. I was in the "Horseshoe LZ", wounded and medivaced. This book is real, like I wish I didn't remember it. We didn't know each other but we were in the same place at the same time. Belive me this guy was there and does a very good job of describing the situation. I sometimes give lectures to classrooms about Vietnam and I always recommend this book, so I recommend it to you readers as well.	positive
title: Good Introduction to Parallel Programming with MPI [SEP] content: This book is a great introduction to the theory of parallel programming. It is important to note that it is not a great reference for MPI, but it does a good job introducing the basic MPI functions and how to implement parallel programs using them.If you are looking for a good parallel programming primer, this book is a good start. If you are looking for an MPI reference guide, or a detailed discussion of more advanced MPI use, look elsewhere.	positive
title: Best deal for the price! [SEP] content: The Gleim CPA audio cd's are the best deal for the price you pay. I just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam and all I did was listen to the cd's on my way to work in the morning. I didn't use any other study materials. I highly recommend this product.	positive
title: recorder book [SEP] content: Granddaughter is not very good at reading music so I hope this book will help guide her when she needs it.	positive
title: Recon Scout: Great WWII Account of front line warfare [SEP] content: Recon Scout by Fred Salter is an excellent read! This is a first hand account by an individual that is a self-proclaimed "maverick" in his approach to life. He served in WWII as a scout for invasion forces in North Africa and Europe. His first-hand experiences are captured here from the perspective of the guy in the trenches, not from the perspective of a professional novel writer. He shares both the experiences, and emotions, of battle and the hardships associated with living on the battlefield in a life and death situation for extended times. A 'must read' for anyone interested in the history of warfare in general, and WWII in particular.	positive
title: Amazon exclusive [SEP] content: This is an Amazon exclusive and won't be sold in stores. Amazon worked out a deal with nickelodeon to "Burn on demand" meaning upon receiving an order that Amazon will create the dvd and insert then ship it to the buyer...I've been waiting a long time for hey Arnold episodes on dvd, so heres another reason to luv Amazon!	positive
title: Works very well [SEP] content: We used this vacuum to pick up drywall dust from our subfloor. It is a great vacuum and does an excellent job. However we had to get a replacement after about a month because1. The hose broke - not due to anyone stepping on it, but it separated from the edge connector.2. The electric On/Off switch gave a shock during heavy loads.3. One of the wheels came off during handling. Had to rescrew it back in.We got a replacement as it cleans very well. Also apart from the above problems, the construction is solid, easy to clean and replace the bags. You definitely need the Love-Less 131-41 Vacuum Bags with this.	positive
title: This book has changed my life! [SEP] content: I am a woman living in Manhattan and for something I can do on the road or in my house, this book is amazing. For 40-something, I look and feel better than I did twenty years ago! Highly recommended.	positive
title: Kept my attention! [SEP] content: I started reading this book while walking on the treadmill.. I normally hate doing cardio because i get so bored and cant seem to get in the grove. I enjoyed this book so much that i looked forward to doing cardio, just so i could simply read. It kept my attention, and kept me wanting more.. Its very different from Nicholas Sparks other books in that it does have mystery and intense parts!	positive
title: A high-quality piece of software [SEP] content: Photoshop is excellent for what it is: a high end, professional piece of software. That is to say, it has a good range of features and is very flexible, capable of producing anything to which you set your mind.However... because of the depth of features, it can be INCREDIBLY difficult to use at first, and even the simplest tasks can take an age to perform if you aren't fluent with the software!! In that respect, it scores low for ease of use, but since it is probably not intended for the amateur user, it would be unfair to let this count against it.Don't be intimidated by this -it'll become easy once you've done a few tutorials, and once you've mastered it the world is your oyster- but be prepared to have learn first!	positive
title: Wow [SEP] content: That is some pretty interesting/amazing stuff. A lot of the knowledge and concepts in this book already resonates with my own experiences; but a lot of this stuff is new as well. The possibilites expressed are uplifting... If you have the time, I definitely recommend it as a good read.	positive
title: ZuPreem Fruit Blend Bird Diet [SEP] content: My birds love these pellets and they provide a nutritional diet for them! Excellent transaction with Amazon. Thank you, very much!	positive
title: Good, could have been great [SEP] content: I have to agree with mis_led from Mich. - see if you can pick it up on discount. I loved seeing the show again, but the price was high for only 8 eps. Works out to about almost $6.00 (U.S.) per episode. I was not able to find the "Hidden Messages to Leapers" promised on the box. Also, there is a pocket for a booklet, much like the box sets of Babylon 5, but there is no booklet.The episodes them selves were fun to watch. You can see how things changed between season 1 and 2. It was funny to hear Ziggy refered to as "he" when in later seasons Ziggy has a female voice.The box is nice, loved the vortex look. Hope the keep that for future season.Over all, while I found it a bit lacking in the bonus', and expensive on a per ep cost, am glad I picked it up and look forward to the next set.	positive
title: Solid product [SEP] content: A solid product that works just as advertised. What goes in is what comes out -- that is, no signal deterioration or no interference between the channels. I am a very satisfied customer.	positive
title: Back to My Future [SEP] content: This was a favorite album for me in high school. Listening to it again now, it holds up for me musically and reminds me that I have been anti-war for most of my life. It's sad that many of these songs' lyrics don't need any changes to be totally up to date.	positive
title: Ahhhhhhhhh....... [SEP] content: The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place. I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there. And sound quality is perfect.	positive
title: Deserves to be better-known [SEP] content: This, the second in Bergman's "Faith" trilogy, is a dark, brooding tale of a clergyman who has lost his faith in God. Indeed, it is doubtful at all if he ever had it, for his vision of God is quite selfish. The action takes place on a single Sunday in November, where the town pastor (Gunnar Bjornstrand in an excellent performance) is finishing a service in front of a tiny congregation. During this day, the pastor will be forced to examine himself and to try to reach out for some human contact to replace the spiritual depletion within him. Also starring Max von Sydow, Gunnel Lindblom, and Ingrid Thulin as the schoolteacher who unselfishly offers herself to the pastor but is rejected in favor of the memory of his dead wife. This film has a subtle, deeply wrought poetry to it and should be seen by all lovers of intelligent cinema.	positive
title: It is so cool! [SEP] content: He has got a unique sound, that makes you feel like you are on cloud 9. Makes you wanna tap your toe. So go out and buy "The Ego Has Landed", it will be a great addition to your CD collection!	positive
title: Castles and cold white legs [SEP] content: Trying to vididly recall late childhood is a nearyl impossisble task - let alone getting the mood and emotions down in print. Royal Blue does it wonderfully.The main charatcter is in turns the wandering, homeless waif and then, convincingly, the object of desire.A must read for anyone who enjoys an honest, sharply observing voice.	positive
title: It Worked for Me [SEP] content: This is a book that helped me direct my life. After recovering from prostate surgery, I was looking for answers. I found some in this book.Although many readers may not consider their guidelines profound, I have tried to adopt their advice about exercising much more and eating better. Exercising six days may be a little much, and not ever eating crap is not quite my style. However, I did run two one-half marathons this summer, and my previous longest was 10 miles - back in 1980.I am younger this year than last.I also recommend its bibliography.	positive
