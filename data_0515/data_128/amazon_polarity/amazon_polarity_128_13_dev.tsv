title: a path of shadows [SEP] content: I'm glad a previous reviewer enjoyed this book and the previous one, but I did not. I too am a great fan of this series, but the last two books seemed flat to me--not very engaging. I certainly will continue to read Haney's books about Lieutenant Bak because when they are good(which they usually are) they are very very good.	negative
title: WAY WAY WAY too much sex [SEP] content: I'm no prude, but when a book needs to rely on sex every page or 2 it gets really tedious. Please. It isn't necessary for the plot. The participants were married for heaven's sake.	negative
title: Mind Game [SEP] content: I kept waiting for something to happen, the main character was anoying, things like this "she was so small she looked like a child" I ask just how sexy is that supposed to be and the guy was big etc etc. Nobe that this story gets a star is very generous of me.As I was reading this I kept thinking, is this over, somthing anything to bring this book around. (sigh) but we can't like them all.	negative
title: I didn't know music could suck this much. [SEP] content: Forget all the comparisons to faith no more, mudvayne, and slipknot. There is a difference with Mushroomhead. You see, Faith no More, Mudvayne, and Slipknot all sound great and have some real musical talent. Mushroomhead [reeks]. Really bad. I have never heard a CD, until this one, that sounds like all the instruments are fighting to have the loudest part. The keyboard pieces don't even fit in with the rest of the music. I have heard quite a few black metal artists succesfully combine keyboards with rock but Mushroom head sounds like they have a keyboarder just so their buddy who plays keyboard can be in the band. What a waste of my twelve dollars. Don't waste your time on this overhyped piece of [junk]. I sold mine at a local used cd store two hours after I bought it. The funny thing is, on the rack there were already two used copies. Seems I'm not the only one with this opinion. Save your money and buy the new system of a down when it comes out.	negative
title: Moss will live! [SEP] content: Mittens is living, and Bob Marley will survive, and MOSS INc will take over the world!	negative
title: Send Us Something Decent [SEP] content: I've been a fan of the bands for a couple of years but was very diappointed in this effort. A bit more produced than the earlier stuff but none of the songs rise to the level of previous standouts - really B tracks throughout. If your exploring the band some of the best work is; Shannon Said, Holly Park and Leaving Ohio.	negative
title: ....Ehhh... [SEP] content: ....OK For The 6th. Grade Comic Book Reader..(Do Kids Still Read Comics?)..For Adults, It's Insulting & Moronic..!...A REEL STINKER..!	negative
title: marketing at it's worst [SEP] content: it is fairly well known that many fans of the show are not little kids. As such how can this outrage continue what is the point of releasing a dvd without a widescreen format? I won't even buy this mockery of a release. They release B-horror movies in widescreen so why not the Powerpuff Girls movie?	negative
title: Junk [SEP] content: I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star.	negative
title: THANKS FOR SAVING ME THE TROUBLE!! [SEP] content: Thank you AMAZON for having this review feature. Thank you to all who bought this coffee maker and took the time to review it. I feel you have all saved me from spending alot of time and trouble and heartache regarding this coffee pot. I saw it in a JC Penney catalog and started researching where else I could buy it. Love the concept, but after reading the reviews here I'm going to pass on it. Will wait for something better to come along.	negative
title: Less than mediocre. [SEP] content: I once heard a teenage box office salesman describe Chekov's Three Sisters as "three hours about not going to Moscow." That's pretty much how I feel about this crap novel. Maguire creates setup after setup that have no payoff. The characters are static and thin, the weak drama makes daytime TV seem edgy...I just can't overstate my distaste for this novel. Maguire seems to have tried something that's way beyond his reach. I can't believe he's built a career exploiting L. Frank Baum's fictional universe. Carpet baggery.	negative
title: I'll stick with House [SEP] content: Although Laurie did grab me from the beginning and take a wild ride, I soon lost interest in the book. I don't know if it was the cast of characters showing up after a 100 page hiatus or if it was just way the story was being told. Eventually, I sent down the book and never finished it.	negative
title: WHAT'S UP????? [SEP] content: Ok we all know that Sealab 2020 is a CLASSIC 1972 cartoon. So where in the HELL is the DVD for the complete series? A CLASSIC like Sealab has NO DVD? COME ON PEOPLE!!! Give us the DVD, PLEASE!!!	negative
title: Didn't fulfill its promise, but I'm glad I read it. [SEP] content: One of the other reviewers perhaps said it best: I really wanted to like this book. As a mid-life motorcyclist (Harley) and pilot, with a penchant for old airplanes and motorcycles, I have long harbored the dream of restoring something really classic; a Harley J, a '32 Ford, a Stearman biplane, etc. So I grabbed the book without a second thought, anticipating a real restoration chronicle. What I got was part soap opera and part Pirsig, with a too-large serving of jobbing out a restoration to various subcontractors, and not enough nuts and bolts. Wish it had been edited bt Tom and Ray Magliozzi (The Tappet Brothers).	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: We were given this as a gift when my daughter was born and thought it would be lots of fun for her at some point. However, she's 9 months now and it has never interested her much. She can't make the squeak in the mouth work by herself, and it's awkward to shake the rattle in the middle and in the tail. I saw a cute picture in a magazine with a baby rolling around with it, but my baby hasn't found anything that exciting about it.	negative
title: GT Interactive, too OLD for windows XP [SEP] content: doesn't play on newer computer. Made the changes to the compability as instructed by others. have many of the older Living Books CD games and after making the changes they are fine. NOT the GT Interactive CDs "Just Me & My Dad" and "Just Me & My Grandpa". they just won't play. bummer. They played on the old computer ... Looking for an old computer so they can be played.	negative
title: Blu-Ray Review [SEP] content: What garbage of a movie. The Soundtrack is nice but that's about all. The rest is a total waste of time.	negative
title: WOW [SEP] content: I have thrown out several deep-fryers but this one is a keeper. It heats fast and reheats fast and I love the fact that in drains and filters the oil after each use. I also love the ease of clean up!!! Best by far of all the units I have used.	negative
title: Returned Stroller [SEP] content: I originally had my heart set on the BOB but couldn't justify spending the money. After reading the reviews on this stroller, I decided to go with it because all of the reviews seemed positive. The first time I tried the stroller, the left side wobbled a lot and the front tire shook. After having several people look at it, they decided it was put together correctly and it shouldn't have that problem. Long story short, I ended up returning the stroller and got the BOB. The BOB is the best stroller I have ever owned and it is definitely worth the money!	negative
title: Performance enhancement [SEP] content: I added some of this to my protein shake to give me MOAR power. I haven't seen any benefits yet, unless you count growing a tail. I mean, don't get me wrong, the tail gives me better balance...but baby, I need power.	negative
title: Really crappy rip-off of Robert Rodriguez' classic Planet Terror. [SEP] content: Do yourself a huge favor. See Planet Terror, with great cast (Bruce Wllis, Josh Brolin, Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowan) and by legendary director.	negative
title: flag [SEP] content: Flag looks oknot sure were it was madeCould buy same type of flag at any store for same amount and be sure it was made in U.S.A	negative
title: Stephen King Fan, Greatly disappointed. [SEP] content: Imagine my suprise when I found "The Mist" on Amazon.com, I have been looking for this recording for years. I ordered it immediately. I got it today and couldn't wait to sit down and listen to it. Though the 3-D sound was incredible the story lacked substance and seemed to jump all over the place. In one part a man is trapped in a store with his son, his wife is at home miles away and probably dead, so he decides to sleep with another woman. What this had to do with the story or the plot is beyond me.Don't get me wrong, I've been a Stephen King fan since I first started reading thrillers, you could even say that he is my favorite writer. But, "The Mist" is nothing like anything by Mr. King that I have ever heard before. I was disappointed.Maybe it was the medium used to deliver the story that disappointed me? If it were in book form I might have been able to "crawl into" or "become part" of the story and then I may h! ave enjoyed it.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: After reading the first Lash Book about Eleanor & Franklin, I found The Years Alone to be a bit tedious with a lot of minutae about minor figures of the time. Most interesting parts were about her distrust of Kennedy because of his father & his Catholicism Although Eleanor was very liberal she had a distrust of the hidden designs of the Catholic Church based on life long encounters with it. Cardinal Spellman maintained a personal vendetta against her for being against giving public aid to Catholic schools & the long standing arch conservatism of the Catholic Church in civil rights & personal freedom. The Years Alone only touches on her achievements in welfare, refugee rights & disillusion with the Eisenhower administration & how her many talents were passed over by the Republicans.	negative
title: misleading info [SEP] content: misleading info on the product, price quoted for 5 lbs, however when follow the link it is for 1lb bag	negative
title: Southern Cross [SEP] content: Patricia Cornwell has been a favorite of mine over the years but this book is trash. I read 50 pages and threw it in the trash. It has no redeeming qualities.	negative
title: Awful! [SEP] content: It says this is dishwasher safe - it's NOT! The clear bowl deformed horribly the first time through the dishwasher even on the top rack. Lid never did fit properly, now it doesn't at all, one use and into the trash! Save your money!	negative
title: Terribly disappointed [SEP] content: I saw this selection of men's cologne from Lalique and thought they would make a nice gift for my nephew. I admit to a certain innocence regarding the brand as I thought that the bottles would be Lalique (I should have realized from the price that it would be unlikely). When they arrived, I could smell the cologne through the packaging, so I opened it up to see if a bottle broke. Indeed, one bottle had leaked. Even more disconcerting, though, were the bottles themselves. The decorative tops are a cheap, molded plastic. The leaking, cheap bottles simply could not be used as a gift. I have to say, though, that Amazon was wonderful when I contacted them about my disappointment.	negative
title: Flimsy - you get what you pay for [SEP] content: This is a flimsy little cutter. The ruler is in the wrong direction- instead of being across the top it goes down the side, parallel to the cut. So say if you want to trim a picture to 8"x 10" you have to measure it and mark it first, then trim it. You don't really see exactly where the cut is going to be once you lower the arm, and since the cutter is so flimsy the pictures tend to move or slide out of the way once you lower the arm. It takes 2 people to be able to use it semi-smoothly. I will probably move to a different type of cutter. For small infrequent jobs it will do ok, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants it for higher volume. Bottom line, the old adage holds true: You get what you pay for: You don't pay much = You don't get much!	negative
title: waste of money [SEP] content: As with many things Targus, this is overpriced cheap plastic and it may keep your lap cooler, but doesn't do a thing for cooling your notebook in any possible way. It also in the Unfolded position, 1. doesn't fit widescreen laptops well as there is no room for a mouse and 2. probably will break if I lifted it onto my lap. I use the folded position to use the tilt function. It's still overpriced for what you get. I'd say it's worth $10 but probably made for about $2. I've owned this for 2 months now and the rubber standoffs don't work very well anymore and the notebook doesn't stay put in tilt anymore. (that and it will eventually rip my COA's off the bottom of the Notebook.)	negative
title: When A Killer Calls [SEP] content: Absolutely sad, sad movie. Totally unworthy of even trying to attatch itself to When A Stranger Calls. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY RENTING/BUYING or YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS HORRIBLE WASTE OF TAPE. Cheap, predictable, unimaginative, infantile,...simply a complete disappointment.	negative
title: Broke Within 10 Minutes [SEP] content: I love the idea of a cookie scoop (and I replaced this one with one from Crate and Barrel for only $2 more that works perfectly), but within minutes of using this one the piece that attaches the handles broke off of the groove and will now the scoop will not stay together. It was extremely difficult to get the metal back on the spokes so it could continue to scoop, and then it would just pop right back out. I tried to use flower wire, tape, etc and nothing would hold it together. It is extremely poorly designed. Spend the extra $2 and get one that is durable and will actually work.	negative
title: Dont waste your $$$$ [SEP] content: This was the second RoadPro unit that I tried, as the first one came to me as a previous return from another customer. Now I know why it was returned....don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk! Although the temperature part of this unit seemed to work fine, I was never able to get a calibration on the compass. tried several times, tried replacement battery, tried different mount positions, IT WOULD NOT WORK! I ended up going "old school" with a mechanical "bubble type" compass.	negative
title: Nash Bridges - The First Season [SEP] content: Both discs are damaged, possibly during the actual manufacturing or burning of the discs. There are large swirl-type patterns around the read faces of both discs that will not polish out with a micro fiber cloth. Therefore, parts of some of the episodes freeze up, and the discs skip to the next undamaged chapter, which is usually multiple chapters. Amazon does not replace these discs and they won't exchange the season for another title, because they are opened. I may try a buffing wheel, but I'm not sure it will help, as the marks don't appear to be scratches, but a defect in the discs themselves. I also bought Season 2 and 3 which are not damaged and play without incident.	negative
title: TRY THIS [SEP] content: Put this DVD on, do NOT smoke any pot, snort anything, drink anything, etc. Then tell me what you think.	negative
title: an unsatisfactory purchase [SEP] content: This tension rod is thin and very weak. It could not hold itself up. Sadly, I will be returning it.	negative
title: Makes my iPOD sound like a cheap AM radio [SEP] content: My parrot chewed thru my standard iPOD headphones so I thought I would purchase this "in-ear" phones as replacement. When I plugged them in I could not believe how poor they sounded. There is no bass, very limited dynamic range (like an AM radio) and they don't fit well (even with different size ear plugs). WARNING!!! DON'T BUY THESES. If you need to replace your ear phones just get the regular ones that come with the iPOD. Also, I contacted apple about this and I can only say that they were very uncooperative. I love Apple (I own a G5 dual 2mhz) but Apple bombed on this one - big time. A message to apple - this is not a product up to your high standards. Don't rune the iPOD's great reputation by risking the possibility of someone hearing an iPOD with these headphones and comming to the wrong conclusion about the iPOD's quality. You need to pull this product or improve it ASAP.	negative
title: Yawn [SEP] content: I fell asleep during this. It may have been very good, but I would not rent again just to find out.	negative
title: Very misleading [SEP] content: DVD had several deep scratches causing itto freeze throughout the film. This DVD didnot advertise it having any scratches. Extremely annoyed and will not be ordering from this person again	negative
title: Turbo-Driven brush -- what a joke! [SEP] content: I used this model twice and promptly returned it. The "turbo-driven" brush works only by the suction of the vacuum; it has no additional motor. This means that if the suction is ever less than perfect, the brush stops turning and is useless. Actually it's worse than useless because the non-turning brush then blocks the airflow and hampers suction. So I would not recommend this model.	negative
title: Broke Already [SEP] content: Our previous last cork screw lasted years. This one did not last three months. The side of the corkscrew cracked opening a bottle, I bet it did not open 25 bottles before it broke. Another inferior China product.	negative
title: Truly powerful endorsement [SEP] content: A recent review noted the "powerful" endorsement of Dr. Herbert Ley.His "endorsement" appears on the back of Trudeau's book.It certainly was powerful because poor Dr. Ley died three years before this book was written.Could it be? Has Kevin found a natural cure for death?	negative
title: Not as good as #1 [SEP] content: I sorta liked the Eye but when I read this book I was sorely dissapointed. Sure it was a great plot but with nothing happening it just plain bored me. The ending was OK but nothing exceptional.	negative
title: Mine doesn't work [SEP] content: I bought the Pixma Pro 9000 about a year & a half ago and it worked great for about 6 months and then the feed quit working.Prints looked great when it was working and I used Canon & Ilford Gloss & Semi-gloss (pearl) paper.Wish it was still working and I am too busy to haul it in to get looked at, so it sits unused and non-functional.Bummer,Carlton	negative
title: Yoga is to quiet the mind,Lilias talks throughout the tape. [SEP] content: I want quiet direction in a Yoga session, whether live or on tape. Lilias talks/chatters during the exercises and I lose the principle of Yoga - to quiet your mind and listen to your body. I have to listen to her. It is not a helpful Yoga tape and I would not recommend it.	negative
title: Good placebo [SEP] content: If you need a placebo for your researches, this is it. It does nothing at any dose and I tried many doses. The good news is that it has no side effects either.	negative
title: Not as described [SEP] content: I tried this on Dr. Brown, Playtex & Avent. It doesn't fit it any of these 3 brands. Not recommended.	negative
title: A Great B Movie Correlates to an Average Movie [SEP] content: Apart from the great cinematography, superb soundtrack, and thoroughly entertaining, beautifully romanticisized violence, this movie is just a B movie with a finely polished veneer. To say that the plot is lacking would be rather kind. Not only is it lacking, I have seen hundreds of martial arts/animes that have the same premise, and this movie didn't really stick out to me. Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie. I hate to say it, but Terantino's best movie is, and always will be, Pulp Fiction. I wish it wasn't so, he is so damn likeable and stylish, but it's the sad truth.	negative
title: Read the Christ Conspiracy or The Suns of God [SEP] content: This story is getting a little tired and drawn out. A book you might find more exciting is The Christ Conspiracy by Acharya. The Suns of God is also very enlightening.	negative
title: Pessimism Abounds Here!!! [SEP] content: If you want a sarcastic, (read: mean spirited) look behind the scenes of a jaded military wife that seems to dislike the military, then look no further, for you have found the motherlode.The pessimistic tone of this book is very demoralizing, and I can only hope it isn't being sold in your PX, for surely it would send even the toughest of military wives running for the nearest divorce lawyer.Hilary Martin does the impossible with this book, with her sad attempts at humor dragging the tone of the book even further down into the depths of cranky regret.I am ashamed of this book, and only hope that the outlooks of other mil. wives are more upbeat.Don't buy it. I promise you will regret it.Refunds should be offered on this to every unsuspecting customer that had the utter misfortune to actually pay for it.(note: I only gave it one star because the Amazon system demands a rating and doesn't have a "negative star rating")	negative
title: Shes not angry anymore...but still can't sing [SEP] content: Bought this cd for my wife. Who admits that she fell in love with alanis after Jagged little pill (mainly due to the 'you oughta know' song).Alanis is a mediocre singer at best, nowhere near the voice of talented canadian singers like Diana Krall or Celine Dion. There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music. At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men. And those women are loyal and do not care if they can not sing along without a thesaurus. Therefore it is irrelevant what I write about this cd....	negative
title: ummmm [SEP] content: Does this women have any friends???? I think that it's sad how she's puts herself in the position of angry attack dog for the crazy people who live on the outskirts of reality.	negative
title: A Sell Out Album?! The humanity! [SEP] content: First, Amazon is wrong go back to the Death Metal list because this NOT death metal. If you want a great album from Fear Factory get "Soul of a New Machine" or "Demanufacture". I'm a Fear Factory fan. I have their albums up until now. I couldn't believe this album when I heard it! It's like Backstreet Boys going into Metal. Yeah, that's how horrible this album is! It has the sound of the old Fear Factory singing but, it has a sound of being slower and more whiny, which is how 90% of bands are sounding than they did back in the 80s (not 80s music, 80s metal). If anyone is a Metal fan knows that Metal is not whiny it's like "I'll kill you" then apologizes about it later. Anyway, the bottom line: skip over this album do not support sell outs in any form (Metallica). Buy later albums like "Soul of a New Machine" or "Demanufacture" but not his one.	negative
title: overrated [SEP] content: I don't understand the hype about this book. He states very obvious facts clothing them in fancy buzz words. Also, it is annoying that he repeats the same (not very good) examples over and over to prove his point e.g. the hush puppies, paul revere etc. enough already, we got the point the first time you stated it, and it was not a very good point to begin with!I gave it two stars, since it was good in parts, some concepts like the connectors, external factors affecting trends and events etc. were interesting. but one gets the feeling that none of his ideas are his own, just culled together from various articles and research studies into a shiny marketing package and a catchy title to fool readers into thinking a brand new concept has been created.	negative
title: Difficult to use [SEP] content: While I enjoy the benefits of having a diffuser-type of blow dryer, I was disappointed in the ease of operation of the straightening/anti-frizz attachment. It's pretty cumbersome and I'm not sure it is any better than just using a round, alumnimum-based brush. In fact, if you are already using a round brush to take the frizz out of your hair I would recommend that you stick to that method. This type of attachment was just too difficult and ineffective for me to use.I still enjoy the quality of Conair's products but I am sorry I spent the extra bucks for this one. I could have purchased a much-cheaper Conair dryer with a simple diffuser.	negative
title: Poor Cole [SEP] content: While the others in the Cole series are excellent reads, this one isn't even so-so. Run of the mill, boring political statement. Hard to believe it was written by the same man.	negative
title: Littermaid cat privacy tent [SEP] content: The nylon zipper pulls apart. The controls are difficult to see without taking the whole item apart. I am not happy with the product and would not recommend it.	negative
title: Robert Donat collection [SEP] content: The story is good but the dvd is very poor quality. It looks like all they did was get an old vhs tape and transfer it to a dvd without cleaning it up. The picture is full of lines and at times the sound does not march the picture.It is a shame because they were good movies.	negative
title: Don't waste your money! [SEP] content: Although the strap is made of sturdy enough fabric, I don't trust the closing mechanism. It's a loop through sliding closure and it only stays tight if there's weight pulling on it. When I lift my camera up to take a picture and then let it back down, it slides further and further down the strap. If you don't watch carefully, you camera will end up lying on the ground. I would never trust this strap for my camera! Thoroughly dissapointed!!!	negative
title: Complete distortion of the bible [SEP] content: How can people simply ignore the dozens of evidences, and facts, for an old Earth? Driven by his hatred of evolution, Morris has created his own science and distorted the bible. Instead of inventing theories, he should read the bible. And I thought Morris and friends hated general revelation, so why is science only right when then talk about it?	negative
title: Why so long??????? [SEP] content: First, the book was so long, and he never stops describing the characters, towns, villages and other various items untill it's been blown way out of perportion. And next, too many twisting subplots to follow. He writes on one untill some actuall action happens(about 300 pages later), then in the middle of the action, he starts on one that no one can even remember. Ironic, isn't it. At the rate he's writing, hell be dead before the series is finished, and if he isn't, who will care about the climactic finish of him against the Dark One. I certainly won't. The story seams to be getting more and more subplots, without tying any of them off. The first few books were colorful, but then the passion is suddenly gone, with olny one book.	negative
title: The book tries to be too difinitive. [SEP] content: The book is a broad and detailed manual covering the entire list of restoration steps and processes, but what the book fails to account for are manufacturing differences created by the various GM assembly plants. An example is that a 65 Chevelle model from the Kansas City plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the Fremont, California plant. The book tends to state "the part appears this way and this way only" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference. I certainly hope this book is never used to judge concours Chevelle restorations.For the restorer wishing to learn great deals of general information about restoring a Chevelle, this can be a good reference tool, it just needs to be taken with a grain of salt not not used as the sole source of restoration information.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: My husband has been wearing Munsingwear for many, many years. He has noted that each time we purchase them the quality and consistency of fit deteriorates. This last purchase was the final proverbial straw. The leg openings, fly opening and placement, and waist band varied greatly with each pair, so much so that there were some he just couldn't wear at all; they were so uncomfortable. We will not be purchasing Mun singwear again. Ever.	negative
title: A little too geasy and the pump got to be improved [SEP] content: My husband is able to find a suitable moisturizing cream for his eczema condition from Aveeno, so it leads me wanting to find a facial moisturizer for myself.After reading a few Aveeno product review, I picked Clear Complexion, hoping it is non-oily and will improve my occassional acne problems as well.This is my review after 1 week of trial. I have combination skin (mainly oily around the T-zone area) staying in a topical country. It is a little too oily for me, and the pump size is a little too big, each pump is way too much for my face and I practically have to apply the excess onto my husband.I haven't yet to see obvious improvement on my complexion yet, but I'm still hoping it will show me some results. It is a little too oily for day use, perhaps I will continue to use it as night cream. I think I have to keep my product search going again.	negative
title: Wasted Inheritance [SEP] content: This is the memoir of two brothers who gamble away their inheritance at Gulf Coast casinos. Their descent into addiction is both unfortunate and pathetic. Their lives unraveld with the roll of a dice. Often repititious, sometimes sluggish, and certainly not the kind of flowing prose one would expect from two men now employed as college writing instructors.	negative
title: Blugh.... [SEP] content: Oh where have you strayed, BEP? This is an utter sell-out. Really, really corny lyrics throughout, made only worse by the excessive and unoriginal brand of funk they try to jam down your throat on every track. This album is reserved for the suburban kids who live and die by the TRL top ten and would never dabble into real hip hop. Blugh...	negative
title: short-lived [SEP] content: I've purchased numerous of these timers. They performed very well for one full season. This season, however, most (but not all) of them are either completely dead or the LCD display is malfunctioning or not responding to button pushes (yes, this is with fresh batteries installed). Speaking of batteries... the battery compartment lacks a proper seal to keep moisture out, which is a glaring oversight by the manufacturer. The angle of the design can be a bit awkward depending on the angle of the hose bib to which you connect the timer -- and can also create more vulnerability for the seal-less battery compartment should a connection leak. The ability to adjust the angle and a sealed compartment would be great improvements. And, of course, these little timers are way too expensive to last only one season.	negative
title: Almost worst jerky I've ever had! [SEP] content: This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all. I repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. If you think this will be ANYTHING like Jack Link's peppered jerky, or ANY peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed.	negative
title: blue light special [SEP] content: I had this gift on my wedding registry and we received it shortly after our wedding months after it was purchased in it's original box, etc. With the batteries all in correctly, the item doesn't work at all. It blinks but does not allow you to do anything- play it, put the time on it, etc. The only thing that works is the blue light around the mirror. Will write an update on our dealings with the manufacturer.	negative
title: bad cd not the original sound [SEP] content: these cd from Supermax is not the original recording!When you listening to Supermax great hit LOVE MACHINEyou can hear it by yourself,that he's different from theoriginal recording.	negative
title: The massacre failed [SEP] content: After good "Get Rich Or Die Or Tryin'" I was expecting better album from 50 cent. This cd is copy of all 50 cent's past songs. All what he saying is that how he got shot. Nothing new.	negative
title: A reference guide, maybe.... [SEP] content: I feel sorry for any novice picking up this book. A brewing book based on the original "Clone Brews" book, should have gone beyond the great simplicity of the first.Isn't that the goal of every follow up? The mistakes are many, and often in this book; and this is a disservice to the novice brewer--who needs recipes to be fairly complete to build their confidence and repertoire. To say that this book is a "must own" for the brewers' library, and compare it to books like "Beer Captured"; is a misrepresentation of a incomplete work--that only seasoned brewers can decipher. Stay away from this book, if your skills are at a beginner's level.Leave discussions about techniques for the magazines.....give complete recipes in a recipe book!	negative
title: Wow.. [SEP] content: I think its interesting how many white-supremacists reviewed this book. Who is it that is rating their reviews helpful??? TV Evangelists forever! Yeah! I know if I was God, I'd choose someone like Rick Warren as my messenger!	negative
title: Too much Bad Language [SEP] content: I was going to send this to a dear friend. Nice lady who owns a ranch with sheep...very upstanding person that never utters a cuss word and I was apaulled with the foul language these sheepherders spewed...beautiful scenery and educational but cover your ears!!!	negative
title: Truly sad [SEP] content: . . . that I spent my hard-earned money on this software. The interface is confusing, and unlike the free player/burners you can download off the Internet, it offers no way to access track info on music CD's from the Internet.Kevin, Plano, TX	negative
title: Don't see it [SEP] content: I can honestly say I don't see what all the hype is about in regards to this movie. I thought it was slow, dreary and had a hard time putting the pieces together. I grew up in this geographical region so maybe that is why all in the movie comes as no surprise to me. I will admit that Lawrence's performance is quite good, but the movie itself is not that appealing.	negative
title: Not even close to the previous seasons [SEP] content: Sorry folks, but this one drags on for no good reason. Having watched it once i would never do so again. I have been a big fan of the andromeda series and enjoyed many of the episodes. There are simply too few episodes of any worth in season 5 and so it came to an end. What a sad finish to what could have been a much greater series. Watch farscape if you need a long running decent sci-fi. I hate to bag something unless necessary but it is that way here. Take care.	negative
title: You'll be sorrrrry! [SEP] content: This thing, as a polite term, is cheap and poorly made. If you do not intend to sit in it but rather, use it as a visual piece for selling a house, this may be for you. Otherwise, save your hard earned money! Shortly after using it a weld cracked. I am not huge or hold elephants in my lap. This left the chair unstable and made impossible to drink coffee while seated.Regarding the weld failure, I understand that stuff from china needs help. I paid to have that repaired at a machine shop. The welder said it was just soft steel. In my opinion, this is a short term product and is produced to be sold. Repeat customers? That's a laugh. Without reservation I can say that I wouldn't buy another mac product; ever. Almost omitted this....whatever cushioning the seat provided when new soon evaporated. No kidding, it's a joke (on consumers)!	negative
title: Lifeless Anime, awesome Manga. [SEP] content: It's story is Okay, but so lifelessly acted that I actually fell asleep watching it. I don't recommend buying it, but I do recomend reading the Manga... it is much more interesting than listening and watching though half closed eyes... this Anime Video contains some of the most uninspired voice talent I have ever heard (Dubbed and Subtitled versions) and the most lackluster animation of any Robotech or Macross series. Again read the Manga, and skip the Anime.	negative
title: Not great.... [SEP] content: I purchased this for a research paper on the Bush Doctrine, and it had nothing to do with the Doctrine. I'm not sure it even mentioned it. Unless you know NOTHING about just war theory, this really skims the very basics and isn't helpful at all if you any knowledge in F.P. or I.R. It really isn't even helpful for strengthening arguments or prior research, don't waste your money.	negative
title: Well, it's big--but poorly made... [SEP] content: We were hoping for a lot from this little fellow. At 24 inches, this would have been the pooh bear of my five-year-old's dreams. But thanks to truly shoddy manufacturing, our Pooh came with his back seam completely unsewn. Not loose or unraveled, mind you, this poor doll's back was never touched by a needle and thread. So what promised to be a great Christmas gift turned out to be a bust. I can't complain about the price, but the construction was just terrible. Live and learn, I guess.	negative
title: Huh? [SEP] content: Was thrilled to see the box when this was given to me. As I read more and more about it, my happiness turned to dissapointment. This is a bare bones, barely flies gimmick with cheap stickers and cheaper electronics. It wasn't a total disaster, within 20 minutes we had this thing off the ground and crashed less than a minute later. The most fun we had with it was letting the dog chase it and chasing the dog after she took off with it. It worked for about 5 or 6 flights and provided an hour or so of fun. The 10 minute wait time between charges is a bummer and the minimal 1 to 2 minutes of fly time is a real bummer. But we did have almost 10 minutes of total time in the air and those 10 minutes were fun! The dog ran under the camper with it and was keeping it for herself. If you don't have a dog, you might want to save toward a real flying machine and save yourself the dissapointment.	negative
title: not recommended [SEP] content: These sounded like a good idea at the time we purchased them. Unfortunately, the state police trooper who installed our seat instructed us not to use them. Anything placed under the car seat can compromise the safety of the seat. The car seat will slide. Please don't buy ANY undermats.	negative
title: Avoid...save your time, save your money [SEP] content: Nearly ten years ago Jeanette Winterson wrote a brilliant book-"The Passion". Ever since, she's completely lost the plot. Is the language beautiful? Yes, but after you've read her other books it fails to dazzle as much. This one is about 3 nameless characters on a train, running away from their miserable existences and you'll probably need to read it twice to figure out what the whole thing's about. Basically i think she's trying to say : The modern world is rubbish, and art (supposedly this book counts) ought to rule. All very tiresome, a bit naive, and exceedingly pretentious. Go read something by Calvino, Kundera or Marquez instead .Whatever you do, don't buy this one. If you must, borrow it from the library.	negative
title: A sad Disappointment [SEP] content: I have used this razor for a month now, and finally went back to a rotary razor to get a good shave. I followed the directions on how to use the new razor, and all I got out of it was a nice facial massage. The razor seemed like it did not have any cutting blades in it. I pulled my skin tight and the razor just rode over facial hair like it was not there. To put it simply, the razor does not cut my beard. The razor is a sad disappointment. It looks good, fits my hand well, it just wont cut my beard.	negative
title: The Hunter [SEP] content: too creepy to keep reading. knowing there are a sackful of books about the same bad guy convinced me that the hero guy I like in crime novels was not forthcoming.	negative
title: Flavor of the Month [SEP] content: Despite its powerful, playful use of language, "The God of Small Things" was a disappointment. After evoking a certain time and place -- Southern India in the 1960's -- throughout the book, Roy crash-lands into the worst conventions of 1990's creative writing programs. Did the world really need another incest story? I certainly didn't.	negative
title: No sock in the Rock (Y) [SEP] content: Just watched this film. John Favreau Man he was AWFUL, Is this really the guy who directed "Cowboys & Aliens?" He didn't even try to study the real Mariano's speeach patterns or his mannerisims. I blame the director Winkler on this, The guy should stick to being a producer as his films as a director STINK! They tried to be Raging Bull instead it was RAGING BS!The boxing scenes were laughable. The music by Stanley Clark was over dramatic. Which is a shame as he is a terrific bass guitarist.I best stop and wash my eyes out after seeing this gold plated pile of pooh. It was the worst boxing film I'd seen in my life. Oh Boy!	negative
title: not for mechanically inclined toddlers/infants [SEP] content: My son figured out how to push the top of this gate open by the time he was 14 months old. If your toddler is not mechanically inclined it will be a great gate, it is easy to take down and put back up. However, I now have to get a new gate and I have only had this one 6 months. I have the pressure gate as well. and to this day I have never used the latch mechanism. he hasn't figured out to simply lift the gate. PLEASE think about your childs mechanical intuitiveness before choosing this gate.	negative
title: Title Doesn't Describe Content [SEP] content: "Losing Your Pounds of Pain Breaking the Link Between Abuse, Stress, and Overeating" isn't the best title for this book. In fact, the description on the back reading, "...wonderful book that will truly help you break the damaging connection between emotional pain and overeating..." isn't really accurate either. The truth is that too much of the content focuses on sexual abuse. There's paragraph after paragraph about various folks being abused. I hadn't interpreted the title in that way and thought that my stress = overeating cycle would be addressed more completely.There is one page of affirmations and a short section that correlates some common foods to their associated emotional/personality traits, which was helpful. Other than that I was thoroughly disappointed.	negative
title: Okay story.........badly told [SEP] content: Anyone who likes traditonal Fantasy, be it Lord of the Rings, Shannara, or Recluse, will find this book dull. The story is fast paced...but I couldn't get really involved in what the characters were doing. So much is put on describing magic and it's abilities...the characters are not developed as much as they should be.I bought the first two books thinking the series will be good due to other reviews. I will not be reading book two or the others to follow. I WARN you to be careful with this book. You will either enjoy it or hate it.	negative
title: blech [SEP] content: Wow how did something this badly acted, and a story with basically no plausibility get MADE?? Corny dialogue, story line full of holes, stereotypical characters, wooden delivery and a poorly botoxed actress- good only for a chuckle.	negative
title: Good, but.... [SEP] content: Even though I like a lot of the songs on here, 'Now' should change their title to 'Then.' "Hey Ya" is awesome but it is SUCH an old song-they could have put it on Now 14 or even Now 13. I hate the way Now puts songs that are like several months to a year old on their discs. I mean, don't call it 'Now' if it's not what's happening 'now'!! They should try to get their hands on the MOST recent stuff-they should have had Ashlee Simpson's "Pieces Of Me," Outkast's "Roses" (hate that song but it's more recent than "Hey Ya"), Britney Spears's "Outrageous," and songs that we were hearing on the radio when this was released. I am glad they included "Move Ya Body," "My Band," "The Reason," "Dip It Low," and a few others because those are more recent. But....NOW, next time try to get the radio hits we're hearing NOW!	negative
title: Pile of sh*t [SEP] content: That's all this band is. I wouldn't recommend this album to a dead man. If you own this CD, I will come to your home, burn it down, smoke all of your family's ashes to get a buzz, then piss on the rest.	negative
title: Hate it... Faulty! [SEP] content: I got this splitter so I can watch movies on my Xbox 360 using netflix, while I am doing my college homework on my laptop and this thing doesn't even work. Only Jack 1 worked on the splitter and Jack 2 is faulty and doesn't even work... this is a poor product and i wouldn't suggest getting this!	negative
title: one more cliched character and i think i'll scream! [SEP] content: what a disappointment. i haven't read such cliched plot/character/voice since 'uncle tom's cabin'.i'm actually embarrassed to be seen with a copy; the only reason i'm giving it one star is because i love waterford, where the author resides.	negative
title: Slow Story [SEP] content: This is the first movie that I have ever walked out on. After the second hour past I couldn't believe that the movie was still continuing with what seemed to be another subplot. The movie moved very slow and didn't fit together very well. It was a very disappointing night at the movies for me.	negative
title: a $40 waste basket [SEP] content: I bought this shredder last year and it has been a big dissapointment. The unit has a safety feature whereby it will only run if the top is pushed all the way down onto the basket and slips over a small metal piece. this metal piece is GLUED onto the interior side of the basket. it is very vulnerable to being knocked off because you can't see it when you push the top on (and they paid engineers to design this?). if that 2 cent piece falls off, the shredder is useless. the auto-on feature on my machine also didn't work, shredding continuously regardless of whether there was paper in the feed or not. and needless to say, it could not handle more than two or three sheets at a time, way below what is advertised.	negative
title: don't waste your money on this [SEP] content: I purchased this and only used it a few times. Now the darn thing won't run. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this product. When it was working, it was OK but now I feel like this was a total waste of my money and I would not recommend this to anyone.	negative
title: save your time [SEP] content: I am glad I opened this before giving as a gift. The manufacturer has quality control issues. The product that was delivered had only 3 of the 4 rails connected to the glass. The reason why the 4th rail was not connected is that there was no threading drilled in the "ball" for the screw to connect the rail to the glass. They did include the screw in the packaging but without the threads it is worthless. Very cheaply made with no quality inspection before shipping. This was an OBVIOUS defect.	negative
title: Creed's a horrible, horrible band... [SEP] content: I'm sorry, but everytime i hear Creed, I have to shudder. No, I'm not a harcore punk, and I don't listen to oldies all day. But Creed is the most unoriginal band I have ever heard. Find some music with actual emotion.	negative
title: Total mis representation Be Careful [SEP] content: I purchased this after looking carefully at the Norelco website and the Amazon pictures.1. My razor says to order the "HQ8".2. The picture on the package shows a complete head set, heads and frame.The package arrived (with picure of heads and frame), but the package only shows the heads.The heads do not fit my razer. There are two little "ears" at on the perimeter of each head, but my razor does not have indentions for the two little ears.If I could easily get a full refund, I'd do it right away, but I suspect it is too much busywork to get one.Be careful before buying!	negative
title: I am NOT the editor [SEP] content: I am not sure why my name is associated with this book, which obviously has some reporting issues. Let me be perfectly clear: I had NOTHING to do with this book. Yes, I have edited other books in Rodale's cycling series, but I HAVE NEVER LAID EYES ON THIS BOOK. I have contacted Rodale and they are working to get my name removed from this page.	negative
title: A great book, but a pretty bad movie.. [SEP] content: This Chricton classic was wonderful in it's book form, but I'm sorry to say, is horrible in it's movie form. Maybe it was too complex a subject for it's day, or maybe it got unjustly thrown into the 70's sci-fi mold... who knows.. but to be sure, this film is both boring and unbelievable (in a bad way)! I highly recommend the book (which I read in a day!) but I'd say that the DVD is not worth the time it takes to watch (which is far too much) or the money it takes to buy.	negative
title: What an overrated flick! [SEP] content: I was so bored, that's all I can say. Actually, parts were funny because they tried hard to be scary or suspenseful. In my eyes this movie is a flop.	negative
title: flower of life [SEP] content: they should really have this book in public libraries, so nobody has to spend money to read it. in it, melchizekdek proposes a geometric/mathematical model for radical abstract consciousness theories and a new age history of the world. mostly, it's rumors he's overhead, i dunno, outside a freemason cocktail party or something. it's not very well-written, which is good, since if you read it closely you can see how information can be manipulated to fit any argument. does sacred geometry exist? yes. do space aliens? maybe. portholes to other dimensions? if there were, i imagine there would be a starbucks coffeehouse at each end. walt whitman traversed more universes than this guy can shake a stick at. if you read this book, and believe everything in it, you're probably paranoid. get out more, and read better books.	negative
title: Very poor quality, low illumination [SEP] content: I bought two of the lamps from the Verilux site. One of the lamps had a mismatched screw hole, so the lamp could not stand on the base. Instead of returning the whole (heavy) lamp, I had to use my electrical drill to puncture a new hole in the metal so that it could be used as a floor lamp. The other lamp's light bulb stopped working after 3 months of less than 8 hours of use per week. It cost almost $25 per bulb! When I posted my review on their site, it was never published. It is very dishonest for them to only post the good reviews on their site. I suspect that those reviews were posted by the friends and employees of the company.	negative
title: Amy's Joy [SEP] content: Not every woman's. I am totally disapointed in this book. Shame of it, Amy's Joys aren't the same or close to mine and I consider myself normal. Honestly, how can anyone write that many pages of dribble. Save your money, if you are dying to read it, try the library! Thank God I did and can take it back tomorrow!	negative
title: LP's Latest falls short of (my) expectations [SEP] content: Linkin Park's latest album is too much of a departure from previous albums. They've gotten soft and moved to far away from what brought them to the dance. Very disapointed as this is one of my three favorite bands that up until this time have always delivered. Maybe next time.-Mark	negative
title: Do Not Buy [SEP] content: Sorry to post my very first bad review, but please do not buy this item. I have had a garden for years so I know how to grow one. Only one herb grew after planting them all. Please think about it before buying this brand.	negative
title: Unsure [SEP] content: After following Stephen King on his road to "stardom" I cannot believe that he would limit a title to 40,000 copies as he has this book. It is a slap in the face for any of the "over 40,000" fans who were unable to obtain this book. I ordered it well in advance of publication and will think long and hard about whether I will pursue purchasing this book in light of Mr King's obvious indifference to his fans (the people who took him to where he is!)	negative
title: Easily broken [SEP] content: I picked up a pack of these to replace my Aerogarden stones. 2 of the 4 broke before I even got them in their tubing - and I was very gentle. The port that sits in the stone just snaps out, and you are left with a worthless airstone. Better off running out and getting them right at the store, or finding another brand.	negative
title: First, buy a set of ear protectors and a lot of aspirin [SEP] content: This thing shrieks at a decibel level that could probably kill a small animal. Unfortunately it doesn't actually clean that much. Brushes go around pretty good but the vacuum doesn't seem to really understand its job.	negative
title: Closet Land - Let it stay in the closet [SEP] content: I'm a die hard Alan Rickman fan, BUT this movie is extremely disturbing to watch. I won't deny that the acting is good, considering the storyline. But it is VERY hard to watch. The suggestion of torture and how the interrogator plays with his *victim* just made my skin crawl. I wish I had rented it first instead of purchasing it. I watched it once and immediately sold it to someone else. Just FYI. Rent it before you purchase it.	negative
title: Another ideology whose deeds don't match the words [SEP] content: Islamic principles and beliefs-monotheism, peace, charity, compassion, interfaith tolerance, women's rights.Deeds committed in the name of Islam - mass murder, war, hatred, intolerance, treating women like property.I don't want to single out Islam here. Christianity has its own sad history. There are many ideologies religious and political that preach goodwill towards mankind but have been platforms for evil doing. For those who believe that results matter more than teaching I ask you to consider the following: What good is any set of principals and beliefs if they are used for evil purposes. We would all be better off as atheists who treat each other with respect and dignity.	negative
title: Too Delicate [SEP] content: Lovely and a great concept but FAR too fragile to be practical. This is an ICED tea glass which implies that ice is in the drink, but unless you ever-so-cautiously place each cube into the glass, the inside lining will crack. I've been afraid to take the last sip or two of a drink because if the ice slides to the top for that sip, it will also slide back to the bottom with unfortunate results. Bodum has replaced two of the four sets that I purchased, but I will not buy any more.	negative
title: Not for newbies [SEP] content: Want to know how to stop a movie from looping? Not here. How about getting transitions to run smoothly? Nah.If you haven't a clue what Director is about - walk away; this book will not help you. It assumes much too much of the reader. On the other hand, once you have some idea of the Director paradigm and have made a movie or two, then I would add this to your bookshelf.	negative
title: Didn't catch the rat [SEP] content: We meticulously followed the directions and gave the trap 3 weeks to work. We then bought a live cage trap for considerably less. The disposal is not fun, but no more rat within a couple of days. I'll be trying out the rat zapper on mice and see if it does any better.The idea behind the rat zapper is great, but I'd like to see it work.	negative
title: Cannot recommend [SEP] content: When burning an audio cd both WMP and realplayer recognize a blank cd and go through the burning process. Unfortunately, an error message pops up saying that the cd could not be burned, that there may be a problem with the cd or the drive. The process renders the disk unusable. If you've attempted to burn the cd using realplayer, you may be able to play the cd in the car just know that you won't be able to skip tracks, some of the tracks will stutter and skip like a scratched record and some tracks just won't play at all. I am currently in possession of a stack of shiny but ultimately useless drink coasters.	negative
title: What a disappointment. [SEP] content: I really think Christina is one of the most talented singers ever. Her powerful voice has conquered the hearts of millions of fans. That's why I picked up this CD without hesitation. Well, i have to admit that i am quite disappointed with this CD. I feel this album is more of a venting place for her than a musical work for the fans. Most of the songs deal with her personal issues and the music [is terrible]. what a waste of resource.	negative
title: Paramount! Still milking the franchise that they killed [SEP] content: Another Themed Trek box set and anyone who is a true Trek fan has already bought the box sets if they really wanted them. These of course at the $100.00 price tag. So what does Paramount do? They have to release the episodes Again to try and make even more money off the fans.Shame on them!	negative
title: Nothing Special [SEP] content: Fantasia sings with her heart, but the tone of her voice sounds nasal. I wouldn't recommend it.	negative
title: Fan stopped working [SEP] content: This was a great fan for the short time it worked. It is not too big and it pushes plenty of air. I used it for my desk at work, if you have a smallish work area you might want a smaller fan then this. I have had it for about 3 monthes and it has stopped working. This might be partly my fault because there have been times when I would leave work for the night and forget to turn the fan off. All and all I feel like this is not the fan for me because 3 monthes is just too short of a life span for a fan.Just wanted to update my review. This was operator error. It is working again.	negative
title: Not all it's cracked up to be! [SEP] content: I received this as a shower gift and thought is was great until I tried to empty it. The can fills up before the liner runs out. This is a good thing because you don't have to replace the liner that often. However, it is difficult to get the liner to work again after you empty the can. Also, the first time I put a really full diaper in it, one of the clips that holds the diaper as you twist the ring broke off. (...)	negative
title: I call Bull.... [SEP] content: Highly unlikely premise. No comment given in the book regarding the actual percentage of crystals sampled. Given the potential for thousands of crystals in a drop of water, how many of these were actually perfectly symmetric when some new-ager meditated over them?We don't know, because "Dr." Emoto doesn't mention it in his book.I bet the guy's having a good laugh at the gullible public... as they say, no one's ever gone broke underestimating the intelligence of the public.Dr. Emoto per his own website achived his doctorate from the Open International university, which appears to be a correspondence course.I give 2 stars (despite my high level of suspicion of charlatanism) for the pretty pictures and in a sense, I admire anyone who preys upon New-Agers.	negative
title: Completely useless in Chicago but great in LA [SEP] content: I should have paid attention to earlier reviews. I activated the subscription, set it to show any type of event and in 3 weeks driving routes around Chicago metro it has sat there. The icon says it is apparently active and yet it has not shown a single warning. It has set routes down freeways the same radio station says are stationary and NOTHING. Totally useless.Took it to LA, with the Traffic Kit as it does at least provide a good charging stand!!. Guess what it was picking up alerts and acting on them within 2 minutes although the traffic status display was identical to what I see in Chicago where it has never received anything.	negative
title: ITS CANCELLED GET OVER IT! [SEP] content: ITS TRU GTA3 FOR GBA HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. IT WAS DISCONTINUED ABOUT A MONTH AGO. IF ANYONE NEEDS PROOF GOTO IGN.COM LOOK THROGH THEIR PREVIOUS NEWLETTERS IN ONE OF THEM IT WILL SAY THAT THE COMPANY CREATING THE GAME WAS UNABLE TO FIT ALL THE INFO ON SUCH LITTLE MEMORY. SO EVN THO IT WOULD BE GREAT ITS NOT GOIN TO BE MADE AND NEVER WILL BE TIME TO GET OVER IT!	negative
title: This book is not the leading Social Psyc book. [SEP] content: Skynyrd had a great point. As an undergrad, I have never seen such unethical use of graphing in my life. I would not recommend this book. There was plenty of info, but ethics are ethics. This book violated those ethics and shame on the publisher for printing that.	negative
title: Definitely worth watching! [SEP] content: There's a lot more to this man than what is in this movie. But for a racing "idiot" such as myself I still found the movie to be very well done, informative and captivating. I knew nothing about Senna before watching the movie and now I just want to learn more. I would happily recommend this movie to others and watch it again myself. I wish I would have seen it in theaters when it was in town.	positive
title: Best self-help book EVER written on dysfunctional "loving." [SEP] content: Read 'em all - Women Who Love Too Much, Men Who Hate Women & the Women Who Love Them, Love Addictions, etc. - but Bryn Collins' book is the end-all, be-all for identifying, avoiding, and healing from emotionally devastating "relationships." Without distracting psychobabble, Collins nails emotional unavailability, in all its forms, precisely on the head. Book contains clear examples, explanations, instructions - and practical (and do-able) solutions, with Bombeck-like wit and insights. Emotional Unavailability is the advice your mother and all your friends would have given you, if only they'd been blessed with Bryn Collins' ability to spark understanding and activate your light bulb. Best book EVER for emotionally-starved lovers past and present, this book should be required reading for entering into an intimate relationship.	positive
title: Great Find! [SEP] content: I really love this book. It helps you to realize your own doll possibilities. It gives enough instruction for those of us who just want the process needed to get what we want done.	positive
title: Dissecting the Pile [SEP] content: The "pile" as is came to be known, was the rubble left behind by the collapse of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. A mess. A huge mess. The who's, what's, why's and hows are accurately discussed in this book about that mess--who took control of it, and what was done with it. A different look at Ground Zero and those who were thrust in charge of this unique operation. An insight at the interests of those who really had control of the "pile"--the firemen, the police, and Port Authority police. A fine addition to the real story of 9/11.	positive
title: excellent product - excellent price [SEP] content: These Cool Brew teas by Celestial Seasoning are wonderful . . . no need to boil water, fruit flavors are natural and delicious and not too strong, and they come in handy for traveling, too.	positive
title: The Best of Mel Brooks!!!! [SEP] content: "Oh de Camptown Ladies sing dis song..." I loooove this film. Some of the greatest comedians working with one of the Twentieth Centuries greatest directors. Mel Brooks turned what would have probably been quite a dreary script (originally called TEX X) into a work of pure comedic genius. There is something quite subversive about this film that he never quite managed before or since.Cleavon Little as Sheriff Bart is right on the button, especially in his initial reaction to the townsfolks bigotry ("Oh, Lordylord!!! He means it!!!! Do what he say!!!!!!"). Gene Wilder is at his absolute peak never missing a laugh and even getting some quite unexpected giggles from some rather mundane lines. Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens... in fact the casting is so right that this is one of the most faultless spoofs ever made!!!!!!"...do dah, do dah."	positive
title: horror [SEP] content: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST NEW SHOWS ON TV. IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU.	positive
title: Very good resource [SEP] content: I used this as text for a small group Bible study for pre-teens. The participants responded very positively to the encouraging and self-concept building message. In a culture which focuses on the "outward man" and robs youth of self-confidence, it is a blessing to have a guide which teaches today's youth that God looks inside and that each of them can be mighty, victorious, and successful! This book would also make a fine family devotional guide as well as in small groups. Though it is targeted at youth, adults will learn and grow by internalizing the concepts of overcoming "grasshopper mentality". You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: This is a great book with beautiful pictures. [SEP] content: I believe that this book was very well written. After reading the book I think it tells you so much about her. This book is filled with beautiful pictures the 2 best looking to me were on pages 14 and 84. This book tells about her,how hard she worked and about the sacrifices she had to make in her own life. All in all it's a must read for you people that have not yet done so.	positive
title: Works well, but had a crack [SEP] content: The CD itself works fine, and it's not scratched or anything, but the CD cover has two cracks on it. I ordered it new, and it even had the plastic covering but it managed to crack. But other then that, it was good. It came in really early, too!	positive
title: metal [SEP] content: cannibal corpse is metal. if you look at death metal and merely think only melodic bands from sweden make up this genre, you are dreadfully wrong. cannibal is a brilliant band. they know exactly how to piss of the mainstream and still sell more records than any other death metal band in history. by the way..my favorite band of all time is death, and of course this is not anythinglike shuldiners music. you see, to be a true fan of metal you must have ears for it all. from cannibal to iced earth, from shadows fall to nevermore, metal is metal. as chuck himself once said, there is no death metal, just metal!!!	positive
title: essential reference book [SEP] content: Unless your French is perfect, never be without this excellent reference book. Mine has lived next to my computer for the last 15 years, and I use it every day. Ian Joiner, Altiplano Training.	positive
title: a school girl crush [SEP] content: This story was so far the best of the Conveniently Yours series about the Bravo family. For years Lacey Bravo has had a secret love for Dr. Logan Severance, a man who is love with her sister. When Lacey's sister marries another man, she goes to Logan to offer some chocolate cake and a shoulder.......leads to a hot but brief affair. Nine months later Logan goes to Lacey and asks her to marry him. Lacey has taken off to her families cabin where she spends the time sketching, and missing Logan. Even though she loves Logan deeply she says "No I won't marry a man that is love with my sister." When Lacey gives birth, the baby begins to bring Lacey and Logan closer together, unwillingly, but irrevocably closer. A story that is emotional, intense and moving.	positive

title: feathered phonics the easywirds ti teach your bird [SEP] content: I do not like this some people might,I didn't know it was pirates phashes.I will sent it back for something else.	positive
title: heavy as hell. [SEP] content: I really think someone needs to set the record straight about this band. I have read many reviews for this cd, i dont thinkreviewers are even listening to the cd.THIS BAND DOES NOT SOUND LIKE KILLSWITCH ENGAGE.Many people have compared them to killswitch because of the clean vocals, Caliban has been around just as long as Killswitch and always used clean vocals. HOWERVER, Caliban does not use clean vocals nearly as much Killswitch, and also Caliban's music is much heavier and far less accessible. This is a very go for the throat style of metalcore. Check is out if you like... on broken wings,blood has been shed, unearth, etc..	positive
title: Very Good Easy Read, Lehrer Very Underated As Author [SEP] content: I have read several Lehrer novels. I believe he is a very underated author. All of his novels are very good. Others here have summarized the book. Lehrer does not high brow you, plain simple writing, easy on the reader. He usually has very good historical research interwoven into his novels. You feel good after reading one of his novels. The book is more about friendship and a description about mental hospitals in the 1920's. It is a good read.	positive
title: Listen to george w. bush and you know what this album means [SEP] content: They know then...you americans "wake up"(Rage against the machine)	positive
title: Adorable! [SEP] content: Everyone fell in love with this costume. It was nice and warm for the rain and snow we had that night. The only problem I had with it was that the huge collar never wanted to stay up, so people had to ask what he was. As soon as I held it up, they knew exactly what he was supposed to be. I tried ironing it, but it didn't help. I think it was just layed down too long the wrong way in the package. Other than that it was great. Most people loved how original it was for such a small age. My son looked majorly snazzy in it! I almost wish the cape could come off so he could just wear the suit around because he looked so cute in it!	positive
title: Great Upgrade [SEP] content: I am not sure why some people had trouble with this version. I haven't run across any bugs or problems of any kind. maybe other people hadn't applied the updater or maybe their computer wasn't up to the challenge or maybe I just don't do the same things they do but my experience has been troublefree. I use the program in conjunction with Coldfusion MX 7(also by Macromedia) and the integration work well, too. Maybe if people that talk it down could be more specific rather than just saying "it's buggy" I could test out their issues and see if I can duplicate their problems	positive
title: "Reunion" live [SEP] content: Invited by Julian Cope to play his "Cornucopea Festival", Manuel Gottsching recruited former Ash Ra Tempel member Klaus Schulze to join him. Third founding member Hartmt Enke opted not to participate, so the 2 old friends played together alone. "Gin Rose" is a 69 minute track, constanly evolving. Themes heard on "Reunion" pop up here and there, but as a whole this album struck me as more low key. As with the "Reunion" album, this sounds like what you would expect if you crossed late 90's Klaus Schulze with Manuel Gottsching. Reccomended.	positive
title: Recipes really come out right [SEP] content: This is one of the few baking books I have used that I was able to count on the recipes coming out right every time. So far I have not made a flop from this book. I checked it out from the library intending to copy one or two recipes for my personal use but now intend to buy the book as I want ALL the recipes	positive
title: Sci Fi - gotta love it [SEP] content: Why did they take this good thing, make it happen, then slow done when it comes to a close, I ain't mad - it was a good watch	positive
title: Great peaks, no troughs [SEP] content: The opening track's a gem - once heard, never forgotten, and probably danced to. Has the stamp of blues standard all over it, in a rollicking Jimmy Reed sort of way. Over Nevada is a real rarity - try finding it anywhere else - and it's fab. Like a long lost Patti Page single, and a good one. Anders Osborne's track is quite tasty, and the rest is less memorable but always at least pleasant. As a whole, it hangs together very well as a rootsier package than the movie would suggest.	positive
title: Great Magazine [SEP] content: This was a gift for a teenager, but my husband also loves reading it. It is definitely a conversation starter in our house and gets read by several.	positive
title: Much Better Than Expected!! [SEP] content: I absolutely love this stuff. I had been eye-ing a few different water sprays, but I never understood why anyone would spend money on what seemed like just water in a can. Now I get it! I am very fair skinned and extremely sensitive to temperature changes, so when the air gets dry in the winter but the heat is blasting, my skin isn't happy. When I'm overheated, my face is very red and blotchy. My skin is also extremely sensitive to chemicals, so I have to be careful about what products I use on it. I keep this spray can in my fridge and after a workout or a hot shower, I spray this mist on and it feels amazing. You can see it dew up on your skin for a few moments and it calms down my skin by about 50% immediately. It also is great for spritzing right before you moisturize -- it locks in moisture really well. I will never be without this product. Highly recommend for anyone who gets red in the face and needs a natural, refreshing way to cool down!	positive
title: Great Romance with REAL Family Values [SEP] content: There are many reasons to like this book, but my favorite aspect is that it shows a non-traditional family full of love and respect. Three orphaned boys find a little girl in a trash pile and band together to raise her as their sister. The romance element of the book is good, as well as the part where Mary Rose finds her biological father, but the relationships of Mary Rose and her four unconventional brothers are what make this book a must read.	positive
title: Pricey ~ but it delivers the goods [SEP] content: Good information on the periods, materials and types of antique boxes most frequently collected. Photography excellent and item pricing accurate. I love this book and it's helped me enormously.	positive
title: Excellent, Excellent, Excellent [SEP] content: BOOT CAMP is absolutely the best SAT preparation book I have ever seen. Mrs. Manning's style of writing in BOOT CAMP is captivating. She writes as if she were speaking in person to the student. Her style used in presenting the material is so creative that the reader can't wait to get to the next page. All sorts of useful hints are given on how to master all of the material. When you buy this book, you will not be able to put it down, and you will be learning without even realizing you are. Mrs. Manning has a gift for bringing to the reader exactly what he or she needs in order to master the material given on the SAT. If you want to inspire yourself, while perfecting your SAT score at the same time, buy BOOT CAMP now. You will be very happy that you invested in such an incredible book.	positive
title: One of the few Essential Java Books [SEP] content: This is an excellent example of an experienced programmer wanting to impart everything about a subject to the public.This book provides a great introduction and explanation of the complexities of distributed java computing, but it then goes into the deepest aspects aswell.If you have to own any book about Java programming this should be in your top 3.Also included are great examples that are worked through in the book and technology to test them with the jRun tool (which includes the Servlets API) and a Web server.	positive
title: great movie [SEP] content: this is a great movie... so much so that i want to show it to a friend... i bought it just so that she could see it... the weekend after we saw it... i found that i already owned the movie... so i guess i really like it.	positive
title: Just started taking it [SEP] content: I just started taking this yesterday. I read the review about the proper way to take it (with food and a ton of water) and am sticking to that and haven't had any negative side effects mentioned in the other reviews. I took it once in the morning and once at night and again this morning. The first 2 pills made me feel really warm almost immediately. I was expecting this a little but it was more than I was expecting. I feel ok though after taking the one this morning. I'm hopeful that it'll help rev my metabolism and help me break this plateau for additional weight loss but it's too early to tell yet.	positive
title: If you hunger for more this book will satisfy [SEP] content: I wonder if Kevin Costner even realizes the artistic and historic contribution he has made with this film. As an artist I found this book to satisfy my graphic appetite and as a romantic I have, once again, been allowed to travel back in time. Mr. Costner has shown us his artistic brilliance in so many ways and I thank him for his efforts. Enjoy the book; it is a treasure.	positive
title: Accessible and fun, the Big Six perfects the new swing sound [SEP] content: Along with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue, the Big Six deserves it's place among other new Swing bands. The all-star lineup provides jump swing with an addictive rock-n-roll Bill Haley & The Comets backbeat that'll get you out on the dance floor. A must-have. If you ain't moving during 'Lady Of Nagoya', check your pulse....	positive
title: Good naughty fun [SEP] content: This book is fantastic! I couldn't put it down and when I did put it down I couldn't stop laughing about some of the situations she "got" herself into.Great book and a totally fun read.	positive
title: How the 80's sound in the 90's [SEP] content: This artist has a magical flow about him. It could be said that MVP sounds like he came on the scene a bit to late for his type of flo, but I see it as great tribute. They way MVP can bring words together with ease, is just simply amazing.	positive
title: i would watch James Nesbitt in a Twilight film [SEP] content: I love this guy, he made a fan of me with "Jekyll", a wonderful retelling, and solidified his status with "Five Minutes of Heaven". He does great work in this piece, it may have been a bit too grim, ITV hasn't renewed it for a second season. Too bad, back to the search engines, but I did watch the six episodes back to back, so I recommend it heartily.	positive
title: Slow at start but definitely worth the read! [SEP] content: I love this book! I normally consider myself a difficult reviewer. A tale of family realtions would never win me over! I am one tough cookie! Well this ice princess has been melted! I was not only drawn into this wonderfully unique southern family but then I found I also have a wonderfully unique northern family. Thanks Rebecca Wells! I plan on purchasing this book for each woman in my family for Christmas!	positive
title: The Tipping Point Tops Them All [SEP] content: The Tipping Point is one the greatest books I have read (right up there with Stephen Covey). I loved the Tipping Point so much,I've been recommending it to family and friends since I started the Introduction. The Tipping Point will not only leave your notepad full of new ideas, but will change the way you think about work and your life.5-stars across the board!!	positive
title: Aspiring Wiccans Will Love This Book [SEP] content: This book is extremely helpful for those interested in Wicca and the Craft. It gives you tips on how to tell your parents of your interest and how to answer the questions they'll have. It also gets you started on your Book of Shadows. Telesco gives you a few sample spells and rituals to get you started and to put in your Book. She also includes information about your star sign, such as "Aromas That Accent The Positive", "Love, Family and Friendship", "Power Colors", "Body Tips", "Clothes and Jewelry" and "The Future". She also includes a chapter on "Bedroom Feng Shui". There's also information on how to create your own spells. There are spells for relieving anger, calming your nerves before a class presentation, and many other helpful spells. I, personally, loved this book, and am planning on reading Patricia Telesco's "Your Book of Shadows" next.	positive
title: Virtual Desktop Use [SEP] content: If you are considering this for a virtual desktop, this version is perfect and affordable. I ordered VMware Fusion and just followed the easy guide and after about 30-40 minutes everything was loaded, copied and finalized automatically.I gave a rating of 4 stars because I prefer the mac system over it, but for the price, and what I am using it for, it is perfect. I would only use this version over vista and others because your mac will run quicker. Eventually you may want to have at least 2gb of ram, but I am using 1gb which is recommended and it is fine.A note if you get VMware. It has a seamless "unity" option where you literally could not tell you were in xp. Once in that view mode, just click the application tab on the top and xp is at your fingertips!Enjoy!	positive
title: GET THIS ONE! [SEP] content: Great stuff! I love the Misfits and Fifties rock and it sounds like everyone is having a ball on this one! A GREAT TIME ALL THE WAY THROUGH! PICK THIS ONE UP! By the way, the reviewer who said Jerry sold the rights to a song for a Vans commercial should remember that Only had to give up the rights to older Misfits songs to Danzig in order to bring back the band so the 'sell out' in that case would not be Jerry. I think the whole 'sell out' idea is inane, but wanted to clarify that. Who cares about a Vans ad? This is a great CD! Pick up the box set to while you are at it. You can't go wrong with the Misfits stuff on this site.	positive
title: Bulky but good [SEP] content: As other reviewers have mentioned, the handles are comfortable but heavy. Then end of the spatulas are kind of big, but I can get by with them since my few nonstick pans are rather large any way. I wish the handles were of silicon as well. Unfortunately I have melted the bottom of the handles where they rest on the pan if you don't take it out. The spoons are cartoonishly large though. I have not even attempted to use them. They need to be slightly smaller and about half as thick as they are. The spatulas are soft and pliable but work very well, much better than any plastic spatula I have ever used.	positive
title: loved it [SEP] content: I loved this book and will read this author again. This is a story of women's triumphs, of celebrating who we are and of our courage to live, love, lose and love again.	positive
title: Points worth keeping in mind... [SEP] content: Fox provides refreshing advice that everyone should keep in mind. Althought the points aren't really specific to being a CEO, they're tidbits of good advice on the most important adventure of all, Life. A book that's not only worth the money, but definitely worth the time.	positive
title: Pre-Ordered [SEP] content: Not received yet, but have the first two seasons. Love the acting and the way the actors all fit together and seem like a real family. Tom Selleck is always great but really shines in this one. Really looking forward to receiving this and hope it will continue for many years.	positive
title: It&#65533;s in the Bag [SEP] content: This book is a must have for handbag connoisseurs and girlie-girls. Beginning with the super-chic, boldly colored hot pink cover featuring a Louis Vuitton Damier bag, the book is beautifully illustrated with examples of the full spectrum of 20th century handbags from vintage Hermes to Kate Spade canvas to exotic art pieces. The text is comprehensive and intelligent, highlighting the origins and evolution of the purse, yet it is entertaining as well and never too staid. The book has a sense of humor.Readers will learn the history of Gucci, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Coach, and learn about memorable bags such as the Kelly bag named for Grace Kelly. It's a handbag lover's dream book.	positive
title: Excellent brush head. [SEP] content: This is avery good Brush Head. Do not think twice before buying a Philips product in dental care.	positive
title: Excellent Movie [SEP] content: Great character interaction. Teams always storm when they are forming, and these guys end up performing at a high level. My favorite part has to be the Hulk schooling Loki. Makes me laugh every time I see it.	positive
title: Very nice, and a good value for money [SEP] content: I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra	positive
title: best idea [SEP] content: this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with. I have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all. It's so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors. The only complaint I have is that the pads are hard to get on. I have broke a few nails doing this, it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this.	positive
title: Shocking ending [SEP] content: Very good movie if you have the slightest interest or knowledge of nuclear physics. If you know nothing of this subject matter you can still watch it and enjoy it, but to really get the full magnitude of what happens at the end you have to have some knowledge of nuclear physics.	positive
title: Exceeded expectations--a great read [SEP] content: Not being a fan of the usual election campaign books, I took this up with low expectations. I just wanted to know something about Ronald Reagan's first campaign for governor. I also suspected that it would be something of a hatchet job on RR. To my pleasant surprise, Matthew Dallek has produced an engaging--even exciting--narrative that is very well balanced. Though he does tend to laud the "responsible liberalism" of Edmund "Pat" Brown, the Democratic incumbent that Reagan unseated, he also fairly portrays the new conservatism and "Creative Society" philosophy of Ronald Reagan and his supporters. I highly recommend this work as essential for understanding the beginnings of the Reagan Revolution. After this, a good read that bookends the subject is John Ehrman's 'The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan.'	positive
title: Thank you [SEP] content: The book arrived just on time. It was my pleasure to purchase book from your company. The book itself is very interesting too.	positive
title: Gift Bought for Mom [SEP] content: I just bought this for my mom for Mother's day. I don't even like Keith Urban or country. But, I know she enjoyed it.	positive
title: X5 E53 N62 Spark Plugs [SEP] content: Installed them in my X5, after 110K miles, a pain to remove the old ones..... but it is done. took about 2 hours! There were 8! Waiting to see if Bosch will give me my $32 MIR...	positive
title: Just Lovely [SEP] content: A lovely insightful album from Mr Bibb. I have had the pleasure of seeing him perform live in Australia, (at the Currumbin RSL, if you remember, Eric!!!), and have always been a fan of his wonderful presentation.Seeing him perform live in an intimate venue, (200 people max), it was just great.On this album........beautiful, sensitive songs from several genres, but all with that trademark Eric Bibb uniqueness!!! Listening to this album always mellows me out.	positive
title: Undiluted Truth, a Molotov Cocktail - [SEP] content: This book is like a Bible for dissidents. I've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought I was crazy. Gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, I'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. It's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. I'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. This book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. This man should run for president in my opinion	positive
title: Keeps you turning the page... Who is Roarke. [SEP] content: Recommended by a book reader on another site, Interesting story line and plot, set in the future with all the electronic gizmos and gadgets. Keeps you turning the page, trying to figure out who Roarke is. Tidbits of Eve Dallas coming out slowly, parts of the story slowing down to a crawl then picking up again. I wanted to read the last three pages half way through the story but didn't. Enjoyable and worth the time to read it... love Eve Dallas attitude.. not impressed with the wealthy folks she has to come into contact with. Loved her excitement over a real cup of coffee. As for Roarke... secrets to be uncovered.	positive
title: Not Better Than Game [SEP] content: Seeing as I loved Ender's Game, I bought Speaker for the Dead its sequel. Let's just say I was confused to high heavens in the first few chapters. First off, all these new characters came and I must have reread chapters one and two about five times before moving onward. Another thing was the major changes between this book and Ender's Game.However I took my time and reread each chapter and finally got a firm grip on the story and continued reading. I found the beginning somewhat boring but in the middle and end were great. I found once Ender got to Lusitania the story picked up greatly. Good read and I recommend it, four starts.	positive
title: Barry Bonds Question [SEP] content: In response to Bryan's (and many other people's) question, Barry Bonds isn't in this game because he's not a member of the MLBPA. Because EA (and every other video game publisher) is required to use the rosters from the MLPBA, it is illegal to put Bonds in this or any other video game. You'll notice that a few other lesser known players (also not in the MLBPA) are missing from the game too. IT'S NOT JUST MVP 2005; Barry Bonds won't be found in any other baseball game. About the actual game, I loved MVP 2004 and I plan on buying 2005 and expect the same great graphics, features, and overall gameplay quality. Hope I was able to help!	positive
title: If you get one Ken Boothe CD... [SEP] content: I'd say this is the one to get. "Freedom Street" is one of the most passionate rocksteady classics I've ever heard. Boothe is more famous for a kind of sappy lovers style. That stuff is OK, but nothing compared to when Ken cranks up and belts out, "Then take off these chains, from off our feet!" The rest of this CD couldn't possibly measure up, but it's mostly in a rougher style than his other albums. If you're a rocksteady fan, this is what you're looking for from Ken Boothe.	positive
title: Great price for a great movie set. [SEP] content: I purchased this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. I got it on special for $29.99 with free shipping. I was going to wait for the complete set, but 7 DVDs for that price was completely unbeatable. The movies are all excellent quality and all come in a convenient case. No complaints after watching all of the movies. For those who want the movies and aren't concerned with extras, this set is for you.	positive
title: Be careful. [SEP] content: This book seems to be a direct descendant of Edgar Smith's "Common Stocks as Long Term Investments", first published in 1924.Although the thesis are interesting, please look at my review of Smith's book and be careful. Very careful. After all, it is your hard-earned money.	positive
title: Hilarious [SEP] content: Janet Evanovich is amazing. The Stephanie Plum Novels are very entertaining and hilarious mysteries. They are my escape from reality! Its a must read!	positive
title: GREAT book [SEP] content: If your home library shelves have good old Missionary stories, than this is a MUST READ and MUST HAVE!	positive
title: Highly Recommended [SEP] content: I've had one of these exact pumps in my Drag car for 15 years and I've just now had to replace it due to normal wear and tear. I highly recommend these pumps for any application.	positive
title: It's OK, does the job [SEP] content: The Panavise Junior is a funny blend of heavy metal base with a plastic vise. The vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job OK. The ball joint is a bit annoying as it's hard to lock it down tight enought, and I would prefer a real ball joint that is not restricted to a single axis. I'm leery of reefing down on plastic parts because they like to break. I've had mine a few months and it's holding up all right, and it appears to be metal-reinforced where it counts.	positive
title: Absolutely Perfect! [SEP] content: Product arrived within estimated delivery time. Product was concealed within its own packaging but also in a padded cardboard box. Now has been installed and has improved air flow in my 2002 TF Rodeo. Satisfied Customer!	positive
title: A classic! [SEP] content: Details are to the "T". I get more out of it every time I watch it. It's (and I hate to use the term) a true "Feel Good" movie!Tom Hanks rocks!	positive
title: Maybe a little too informative. [SEP] content: Good for details, much of which I'll never use. Many shortcuts I'll probably never remember, and programs I'll never use. However easy to understand and get a feel for the various programs. Nice useful product, more informative than I needed or expected.	positive
title: Best cartoon! [SEP] content: This is the best Russian cartoon! I watched it being a small girl (I grew up in Russia) and can assure you that absolutely EVERY child loves it. My husband (also from Russia) hated cartoons in his childhood - only Nu, Pogodi was the exception. I was surprised to know that it is also sold here. I will buy this for my child, when he grows up.	positive
title: Excellent tool [SEP] content: I am a French major in college and this book with CDs are a perfect tool to supplement my studies. It brushes up my basics and helps me along with what I'm currently learning. I can carry it with me everywhere.	positive
title: A good value purchase [SEP] content: I purchased these for my wife and she loves them. When they arrived, I thought they were smaller than one carat each. I took them to my local jeweler and he confirmed they were each one carat. The black diamonds appear smaller than their one carat white counterparts. These are very attractively priced.	positive
title: Ed Emberly thumb/fingerprint books are awesome! [SEP] content: My kids love these books because they can create pretty complicated things (Santa, sleigh and 8 reindeer for example) with a few fingerprints and a few lines! They love, love love his books! So do I	positive
title: Just plain comfy! [SEP] content: I requested (and received) a pair of these last Christmas in the "Cognac" color. Wow. I found them to be so comfy that I went out and bought another pair for myself in black!I especially like to wear slip-on shoes when flying ... easy to get them off and on quickly when going through security; and then, after we're airborne I can slip them off my feet and put them back on before landing without having to reach down or lean forward! Makes for a more relaxing flight.The 'gator' finish is a nice distinction, too. Highly recommended. VERY comfy.	positive
title: When its great they take it away [SEP] content: I absolutely love this product, never had long fingernailsand using this I do. Of course now it can't be found.My sister is having the same luck with the product. Whyoh why is it gone.Unhappy in Kansas	positive
title: For true NOMEANSNO fans [SEP] content: The cover art is disturbing as usual, but par for the course to any true NOMEANSNO afficionado.The first two tracks are the best--great riffs and songs that build in intensity and max out at the end--kind of like sex.The last track was annoying at first, but its true value becomes more apparent through repetitive listening. The two drum set combination is something you'll never hear anywhere else.Its great to have a band that deals w/ real existentialist dilemmas in a manner that's inspiring--not depressing.	positive
title: Court this book cause it is the best [SEP] content: I LOVED IT I LOVED IT I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!! By far this book was the best of them all. Full of action romance and fun it was a book couldnt put down. It gave me new faith in Star Wars Books after reading The Truce at Bakura.	positive
title: I loved this cookbook [SEP] content: I must cordially disagree with the previous 2 reviewers who thought the recipes too rich. I made polenta with leeks and loved it! Good recipes for quinoa. A lot to choose from and not all of them had cream in the ingredients.I did my usual drill of borrowing from library, trying a few recipes and then deciding whether to buy. I bought!	positive
title: Thrilling Storyline! [SEP] content: I thought this book was great! Great characters, exciting dialogue, and a plot that had me begging for more!	positive
title: A Bistro at Its Best [SEP] content: Having first gotten to know The White Dog Cafe in my frequent meals there during college, I was delighted (understatement) to find that the restaurant had its own cookbook. The book, which is a solid thickness with plenty of recipe options, is one of my very favorites. There are items that are more complicated and others that are perfect for a backyard BBQ. Variety being key and inside bits of information adding to the richness of this book. For instance, in a recipe calling for fresh artichokes, the page would give you a little information on cleaning fresh artichokes. The kind of background many cooks need and most cookbooks neglect to offer. I would give this cookbook a five-star rating, but I am allergic to about 25% of its recipes so I can't say how great those are. Those I've tried, however, are yummy (never any leftovers) and popular with kids and adults alike.	positive
title: LOTS OF QUESTIONS! [SEP] content: This review book for high school Biology is a great review resource filled with hundreds of practice questions. There are also loads of diagrams and charts that make studying the material much easier and less time consuming.	positive
title: An album with all guts [SEP] content: This set of songs by MR. Jeffreys has been on my musical playlist since I first heard it. To me it's the best selection of material he has produced. Each song has it's own magic of rock,soul and roots. Here it is reissued on cd. The Lp I own sounds great, Now I can have the digital version as well.This is a must have for Garland Jeffreys fans."Guts for love" Is a soulful ballad that asks the ultimate question about love and commitment.Rebel love and El salvdore are top notch selections that will have you playing this cd over and over again.	positive

title: Above grade [SEP] content: Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded.	positive
title: possibly the best metallica album [SEP] content: i own all of the metallica albums, and AJFA is my favorite one. all of the songs are good i can listen to the whole thing withour touching the skip button. It also has a variety of songs; you have "blackened," and "dyers eve," which are extremely fast songs then you have "one" which starts off slow and gets fast, and all the others are good too. the insturmental "to live is to die" is amazing, from the guitar work to the drumming i think it is metallicas best instrumental. It is not a cd you get tired of after listening it a few times either. go out and buy this cd, you wont be sorry.	positive
title: Its An Estimator [SEP] content: And a great one at that. I use this handy device when I am out surveying sites which calls for room measurement. Many times our clients time is limited and the IntelliMeasure provides a quick and easy way to get the information I need. I have used a couple of ultrasonics in the past that have ended up in the trash, no accuracy or reliability. This one will be a keeper. It is definitely not a replacement for a tape measure but provides great accuracy at +/-.5% for estimating and that is what it is designed for.	positive
title: nearly perfect. [SEP] content: This mug keeps my coffee or cocoa nice and hot for a long time,and the cap functions wonderfully as far as spill stopping but at the cost of being a complete pain to clean/get the coffee smell out of.	positive
title: brilliant [SEP] content: Electrelane's Axes finally arrived. It's been out for a week, I can't figure out what the hold up was but I am so happy with it. It is noticably not as catchy as The Power Out, which, probably I will be the only person that misses that. I like catchy. Especially the way that one was catchy. With hooks so smart, if I were a fish I wouldn't mind losing my life to hooks like that. I would snap on. I would take the bait. They could reel me in.Axes is starker, and more Stockhausen, which is always popular with modern minds, not always mine. It's what John Cale's Paris 1919 should have sounded like, and was so disapointing and boring because it didn't. And it's a lot like that final, two-album leap that Talk Talk made when they transcended everything, when they abandoned pop for good and went free. I hope Electrelane stick around though.	positive
title: fantastic album... I WANT MORE!!! [SEP] content: This is a great album i was recently introduced to. After doing a bit of searching i found that Baxter has put out several albums since this one in 1998. Anyone know where one might buy these other albums? Id appreciate any help. Thanks	positive
title: The Tale of Religious Grandeaur Told Marvelously! [SEP] content: This film is, what I consider, the best religious epic ever made. There is only one way to describe it: Jennifer Jones. This Oklahoma girl shared her first major cinematic efforts and won the Oscar for Best Actress of 1943. I cry every time I watch Bernadette of Lourdes' efforts to show her French town that she did envision the Virgin Mary. Her performance is so rivetting that I was even saying to myself "I believe you, Jen. I do believe you!" Every Thanksgiving I watch this film, I don't know why, it's just the perfect time for it. This tale is told through the very sensitive direction of Henry King with simplicity, hope, and moral. This is a film for all ages, and really brings the true message of faith home.	positive
title: More songwriting and singing genius [SEP] content: Once again Heather Myles proves herself beyond the shadow of a doubt. Bravo.	positive
title: Amazingly Powerful Flash at a Great Price! [SEP] content: I own two of these, and frequently use them for portraits and product shots (on and off camera). They have a good, solid construction and a very easy-to-use design. The metal hot shoe and locking clip provide security during use. The power of these flashes, coupled with the flexibility of the swiveling head will give you more creative room to work. The use of standard AA-size batteries (NiMh recommended) keeps costs down and eliminates the complications of trying to hunt down odd-ball batteries. I would also recommend the Sto-Fen omni diffuser for an added touch of softness when using this flash direct.Sto-Fen OMEW Omni-Bounce Diffuser	positive
title: Professional Cutting Mat [SEP] content: This cutting mat was exactly what I wanted, and it works perfectly for cutting quilting pieces, blocks, etc. It was exactly as described, and arrived very quickly. Thank you!!	positive
title: REMASTER 2012 ! GOTTA HAVE IT! [SEP] content: So, I've been waiting for the mono issue of this album for a long time. If nothing else, you gotta hear "We'll Run Away" in Mono with its much fuller sound. Mono is what Brian heard and the stereo was done by engineers. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music.	positive
title: Emotional and gripping [SEP] content: This movie held my attention from beginning to end -- it is so beautifully photographed, quite dreamlike, and the two main actors (Huppert and Greggory) give some of their finest work to date. The pair seem like the most perfect married couple, who live in a beautiful home, decorated with amazing art, and who love to entertain lavishly on a regular basis. That dream comes crashing down to reality when Greggory finds a letter from his wife, stating she has left him for another man. All that being said, the film is far too short. One would think that there is much more of a story to tell, and so the ending is not very satisfying. I think of this more as a snapshot into the world of a very troubled relationship. Despite my criticism, it is a gripping film and definitely worth seeing.	positive
title: Pool [SEP] content: This is a great book!!!!!!!!! If you like pool you will learn and enjoy the witty narrative at the same time	positive
title: Fat, Lazy, and Proud of it! [SEP] content: This third installment of "Garfield" features the introduction of Nermal, the introduction of Jon's family ("Eat! Eat! Eat!"), Garfield's National Fat Week, and the more "truthful" side of Irma. Lyman also appears, but he becomes less prevalent as the days go by. A certain must-read for all Garfield fans.	positive
title: External Hard Drive [SEP] content: I have used this on a Macintosh for 2 years. It is plugged into my computer, via USB cable, and I have scheduled weekly backups using Apple's "Backup" software, without any problems. I sent one to my Son, who is in Iraq and on a PC, to back up his laptop. The one downside for a laptop is it could drain power since it does not have its own power source. This hard drive lasted 3 months. After 3 months he got an error message. When he came home on leave, he took it to a computer tech who could not recover his pictures and music. Amazon took it back and only refunded me 80% of purchase price and charged me with shipping. I was not pleased, and needless to say my Son was very disappointed that he lost his files.	positive
title: Untouchables [SEP] content: I had been waiting for this record an eternity and I rushed to buy it the very morning it was published. The first time I listened to it, I was very disappointed. All of the songs seemed to sound the same as the previous ones. But as I listened to it more and more I noticed how good it really is. You have to give it a few listens before you can get into it. This certainly isn't anything like issues or follow the leader, it's more like their first album (except this time around they know what they're doing). There are many hard, heavy and melodic songs like Embrace and Bottled Up Inside, and almost every track has beautiful melody over the chorus. There are still a couple of tracks that I do not like (Make Believe, Beat It Upright & Wake Up Hate), for they lack the melody that makes this cd good. I just think this is by far the best album KoRn has made, but the most hard to get into.	positive
title: i love motown music and artists. [SEP] content: I enjoyed the music and quality was fine. it was in great condition and the explanation at bottom when ordered was great. I got what I pd. for . pat	positive
title: Pretty Good, So Far [SEP] content: As someone who has always admired the Mormons' history, I always felt the average person would be incredulous if the beliefs were actually revealed in detail. This book does a good job of cutting through the fog for those who think LDS is just another branch of Christianity.	positive
title: Love It [SEP] content: I am really glad I bought this. It is so handy and works great. I don't have a dishwasher, so it has never been in one, but it has been in a sink full of water for extended periods of time. I haven't had a problem with water in the handle or rusting. It's just a great stainless steel flat whisk that works great for scrambled eggs and sauces/gravies in a large skillet.	positive
title: Finally a memoir that I actually WANT to read! [SEP] content: I fell in love with Chelsea when I first saw her show. She has this type of dry, sarcastic humor that I find completely hilarious. This is the first of the books that she wrote even though it's not my favorite.Each chapter is about a new man that entered Chelsea's like (and more often than not, exited just as quickly). With wit and humor Chelsea revisits several one night stands that stood out in her life. Accompanied by her saucy group of gal pals, Handler takes on every city with the same attitude: find a glass of vodka and a hot man, STAT!It's completely irreverent and full of language that will disgust the average prude, this is a memoir for anyone who enjoys Chelsea's naughty sense of humor.	positive

title: love it [SEP] content: love the cd last man to fly if you love music then this is it easy fast and perfict mustown a copy for your libary	positive
title: Touching and heartfelt [SEP] content: I rated this movie 4 out of 5 stars based mostly on the heart-touching quality of it. It doesn't much matter if the ending is confusing and questionable. The ending just denotes that we all have spirits who need to fly, not be immobilized by an uncurable disease. If you watch the movie closely, there are some very artistic qualities about it, such as when Elijah Wood is bouncing the ball against the wall and there is a star of light shining between him and the wall. I enjoyed the acting, except (slightly)for Jeanene Garofolo.	positive
title: TTTT Changed my life! [SEP] content: before TTTT my life was an empty pool of mysery. Post tttt It's been roses and sunshine. I can't even describe the joy in my life now. Thank you tttt!	positive
title: INTERESTING [SEP] content: THIS BOOK READS AS IF IT'S TRUE. IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND SET IN THE MEKONG DELTA AREA. SEAL TEAMS DID MULTIPLE MISSIONS IIN THAT AREA DURING THAT TIMEFRAME. THE BOOK IS VERY MUCH LIKE ANOTHER SEAL'S BOOK SOLD BY AMAZON. I BOUGHT BOTH WHICH IS NOT NECESSARY. IF YOU BUY ONE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THE OTHER. MANY OF THE MISSIONS ARE TOO SIMILAR. GOOD BOOK.	positive
title: Eastbay [SEP] content: My son has a very hard time finding size 18 shoes that look nice and feel good for a 15 year old. Eastbay makes shoes he likes and at very reasonable prices.	positive
title: A decent phrase book, but no more. [SEP] content: I spoke Azeri relatively well once and decided to pick up this little book to revisit the language. Out of the limited amount of literature on the subject I chose this one on a hunch and it's nothing more than a phrase book for a tourist to get around. It does a good job of indroducing the most common expressions to an English speaker. Expect to find exact pronounciation of singlular words and 2-3 word phrases and expressions. Do not expect a textbook on the language :)	positive
title: Put on the tea and enjoy [SEP] content: The Man From Texasby Rebecca Yorkreviewed by: Pamela Ackerson (author Home of the Braves trilogy)I have read this book before. It was excellent the first time and it was just as great the second time around. It is rare that I read a book again. What is even more odd is that it is a contemporary romance and I rarely read those types of books either. Which goes to tell you that The Man From Texas is an awesome read. I loved it. I finished it in one day, temporarily being interrupted by the need to cook dinner and feed my family and then went back to reading the book. This is a book you will not want to put down. Put on the tea and enjoy.	positive
title: Great product, great price! [SEP] content: I have a rental apartment and needed a new hot plate as this is a small studio, fully furnished. The one I bought just 1 year ago turned out to be a piece of junk. Went on line not wanting to pay a lot of money for this item and found this one on Amazon. I really got lucky as there were only 5 left, thus the great price. I am AMAZONED at the quality of this product. Heavy duty, good looking, easy to clean, longer cord, beautiful, GREAT PRICE. Hope my new tenant likes it as much as I do. THANKS AMAZON!!	positive
title: A fascinating perspective of history !! [SEP] content: Quigley has done an immense job writing the history of the world from the elitist point of view. The winner, the powerful, and the wealthy usually write the history. Biased or not, based on evidence or not, they write the history or pay someone to do it for them, either way, they make it reality and a basis for the future of the world. As a reader, you must understand the history and the context in which it was written, in order for you to comprehend the dangers of the present and to predict the urgency of the future.The tragedy in this book is in the Narcissism of Quigley and his oligarchy, and the vanishing hope is in the faith and the hands of the determined and decent people............	positive
title: 1st Season coming [SEP] content: Word from TvshowsonDVD.com is that the first season of Cheyenne will be coming out sometime in 06.	positive
title: Lost and Found [SEP] content: For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did.	positive
title: I love this blender! [SEP] content: After reading some of the reviews on the Magic Bullet blender and the problems that people were having with it, I decided to go with the Tribest Blender and I am glad I did. This is a phenomenal blender. It is compact, travels well and works perfectly. I love it for my pre-workout shake and also for my post workout shakes. It is fast and efficient and cleans up quickly. Great quality product that is redefining the blender world for people who are on the go and busy.	positive
title: Absolutely beautiful! [SEP] content: Susan McKeown is my step-cousin's husband's sister and I have been enjoying "Bones" since before it was available in America. What can I say? I was amazed and moved by the entire CD. My particular favorites are "Albatross" and "Snakes". This is great music to listen to after a hard day or when you simply need to relax. Don't miss it! Note to Stephen: Thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me this music so long ago. I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed it!	positive
title: Not that Bad [SEP] content: OK, I went into this movie ready to hate it. BUT I was actually quite happy with the remake. YES it was very much similar to the original, but that appeared to be the idea, just to modernize (in terms of technology) the orginial. Further, Mia Farrow as Mrs. Balock was fabulous. In the end, it IS the same as the orginal and nothing is wrong with that. If anything, the remake brings it closer to home. AND FOR THE HATER WHO WROTE EARLIER...the films itself never quotes the year of Damien's birth just a month, day and time...try watching before you write a review.	positive
title: Slumberjack Kodiak Sleeping Bag [SEP] content: This sleeping bag is the best one I have ever used. It only got to about 20 deg but it was no problem for this bag.Its pretty heavy but thats why its so warm. Many configurations to choose from. Large zippers prevent jamming.I REALLY find it hard to believe they quit making this bag. I would buy another as a spare if I could find one.Not for backpacking and and best camping bag you will ever use.[...]	positive
title: perfect in its own little nifty way [SEP] content: Shanghai Knights is an interesting movie. Of course it could have been better....but come on, it could have been worse. I personally thought it was a great movie! It had humor, sword fights, fist fights, and great actors. Now, this movie made me a HUGE fan of Aidan Gillen-he's great as Lord Rathbone. Of course Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are spectacular too- as are the secondary characters. See this movie. It's a great movie!!(((the DVD extras are amazing: deleted scenes, audio commentary from the director and screen writers, a music video entitled "action overload" featuring all the fight scenes, and a "fight manual" with Jackie Chan and the director(David Dobkin)...all in all...the DVD is a great buy)))	positive
title: Song with Hewitt [SEP] content: When she walks in the party, the song playing is Six Underground by the Sneaker Pimps.	positive
title: Simply so e of the best reading I have come across [SEP] content: Fantastic! I read many books but few are as good as this entire series has been. I have read the series 4 times over and love it every time I read it	positive
title: Where You Find It entertaing [SEP] content: I did read other reviews but found I had to check it out for myself. Yes the heroine Jennifer was a little controlling...I am woman I can do it all on my own, and part of me admired her for it. However Mick was the man. He didn't let her dictate the movement of the relationship. Okay she broke it off but I somehow had faith my Mick would wear her down, boy did he. The other charcters were wonderful support in the story. Her little girl who drew them together and her best friend telling GF how it is. Love when a GF honestly tells the other one they are stuck on stupid, it just tickles me. Well the book satifised this romantic reader, and I'm very pleased I purchased this book.	positive
title: Hypnotic [SEP] content: This tornado documentary is a work of art. The power and destruction of tornadoes is backed by a soundtrack of electronic music that is haunting and beautiful. It is mood-altering. The documentary side of it features facts (and a little bit of poetry) from a few narrators, including Neil Armstrong. I'm no expert on tornadoes, so I can't judge the accuracy of the facts. The footage of tornadoes dates back all the way to 1928.The most captivating thing about it, though, is that for long stretches of the program, the narrator is silent, with only the ambient music and occasionally sounds from the tornadoes creating the atmosphere to match these stunning images. Like listening to Tangerine Dream, this film is spellbinding enough to put me in a trance.	positive
title: GREAT DISKS… EASY TO WRITE ON WHITE SURFACE [SEP] content: My supply of CDs, used mostly for storing data, was diminished. I spotted these on Amazon. Verbatim has a good reputation. The price was right, so I bought them.I especially like their white surface on which to write, using a Sharpie pen.Have used a several of them; all seem to work well.	positive
