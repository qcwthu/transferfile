title: *SWEET* [SEP] content: This book is a must have for BSB and Kevin fans!! It is so good! My friends mom even found it very interesting!!!!!	positive
title: Great Book about Civil Affairs [SEP] content: This is as good a Civil Affairs book as is available out there. It covers a Reserve CA unit in Iraq in 2004 and provides good insight to what Civil Affairs does, but has some grammatical errors and editing issues. Good book, overall, but I'd like to see an active unit chronicled both in and out of the Global War on Terror.	positive
title: Smart and gorgeous [SEP] content: This is really a gorgeous watch.The numbers are clear on the white base, and the stain less steel band is dual shaded, which adds to its beauty.Received in very good condition.I bought it for 34 bucks from Amazon.It could be worn on all kinds of occasions and officially as well, displays date too.I bought it as a gift for some one, the price is also good.	positive
title: Better than some reviews give it credit for [SEP] content: I have the seond edition of Learning Perl and find that this book is not only far more accessible, but covers things that are useful for beginners that Learning Perl does not. The DBI for instance.At the price this title is going for used it is a bargain.	positive
title: Umlaut Heaven [SEP] content: This DVD blew my head off. Could someone help me find it so I can listen to Blue Oyster Cult again?	positive
title: SEXY IS BACK!!! [SEP] content: LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR JUSTIN'S SOPHMORE ALBUM. MY FAVES ARE #7 AND #12.	positive
title: music for the millenium [SEP] content: As the millenium approaches, music must prepare itself for the inevitable change of the ages. And with those changes there must be a new force to spearhead the change. This force has a name and it's Tommy Henriksen. From the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track "If I Could", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender "Heaven Only Knows" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. But all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. Quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. Where has this guy been? Suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful "Beyond Life" [with cameo by avant-rocker Nina Hagen], "Dreaming in Colors", and the African chant-anthem "Uneasy Street". Then for an upbeat flavor is the celtic-fueled "One Voice", and the seductive stirrings of "When She Comes". This is an absolute must!	positive
title: Amazingly good for the price [SEP] content: Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.	positive
title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Christian Castro Vol. 2 - Karaoke CDG Songlist: [SEP] content: Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. Cuando Me Miras Asi2. Con Ella3. Despues De Ti Que4. Lloran Las Rosas5. Lloviendo Estrellas6. Lo Mejor De Mi7. Manana Manana8. Si Tu Me Amaras	positive
title: A gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story [SEP] content: Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the "commercial" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed.	positive
title: a 40 watt light bulb works [SEP] content: I don't own a Zeno, but I read about the idea of heat treating cystic acne thanks to Zeno. It does work, but there's no need to spend $185. A 40 or 60 Watt light bulb in a lamp does the trick. Turn the lamp on, take the lampshade off, and hold the bulb against the zit for a couple minutes. Briefly switch the lamp off if it gets too hot.	positive
title: Great house for any insect [SEP] content: This is the habitat only, (as stated, you must send in the coupon for the insect(s) plus shipping. If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures. This can be used over and over again for other purposes as well.	positive
title: THE Best made american horror film [SEP] content: In the first 5 minutes of this film you see a man cut open this chicks stomach, fill it with acid, and slit his own throat. Great Beginning, Great Ending. Fans of Dario Argento, George A. Romero, And Lamberto Bava will not be dissapointed!	positive
title: 12 mm x 1.5 pipe plug [SEP] content: Fits cylinder head on GM 3.5 water crossover manifold to block off unused hole in clyinder head that causes leak. Use with AC-Delco 251-2058	positive
title: Great information and available for FREE [SEP] content: This film has great information and is now available to view in its entirety at the future of food website.	positive
title: Works Great [SEP] content: This is a much better alternative to the suction cup mount that came with my GPS. Just place it on your dash and it stays in place perfectly.	positive
title: So Funny [SEP] content: Chris Tucker at his best, no question. One of my favorite movies of all time. Recomend to anyone who has a sense of humor	positive
title: mind blowing! [SEP] content: I love the way Ellen Hopkins portrays the story through prose form. I caught myself reading "Crank" at lightning fast speeds because of how capturing her writing is. With writing in prose forms it offered me a new way of reading a book and having to learn how to read a book written this way. It was refreshing and daring. "Crank" is a detailed book about life, love, friends, family and drugs. You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: Fantastic Textbook [SEP] content: I used this book to teach myself Scheme. It used to be offered at MIT as 6.001 but unfortunately they removed it in favor of 6.01 Python. Scheme is very much the "Latin" of programming languages: it's not extremely useful but it teaches you how to approach programming and how to think about it. Highly encouraged.	positive
title: Love this DVD [SEP] content: This is an excellent DVD. I love it because it teaches while girls can be little princesses, they can still do things for themselves. My little girl loves it and I highly recommend it!	positive
title: foldable table [SEP] content: It's just the item I was looking for. I used the table for art shows to display my wares.	positive
title: ok [SEP] content: These were quite heavy. My son said his feet sweat when he wore them with his boots. So he wears them around the house instead of slippers. They have held up to many washings. I would recommend them.	positive
title: Ramshackled Still Sounds GREAT [SEP] content: I bought this LP back in '77 and was blown away by the versatile drumming of Alan White. Every track has a different feel. I had to add this CD to my collection of growing YES CDs to replace old LPs. This is one of my favorits...	positive
title: This guy can sing! [SEP] content: Long Time Coming is a stylistic change for Jonny as he has moved away from the blues. Instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!	positive
title: 3-6 is cool [SEP] content: Hey man, I read your review and I would have to agree with you on the wicked part. It seems that they don't know what to come up with now. For example, Choices 2, it was good but not as good as thier other stuff like Choices 1. It feels like they lost the feeling for music that they had before like "When the Smoke Clears," that was a cool CD. Hey, you know what happend to La Chat, Murder She Spoke was a kick @ss CD.	positive
title: Pre-Ordered [SEP] content: Not received yet, but have the first two seasons. Love the acting and the way the actors all fit together and seem like a real family. Tom Selleck is always great but really shines in this one. Really looking forward to receiving this and hope it will continue for many years.	positive
title: Lots of action [SEP] content: Great book if you like action stories. Complex, well-developed characters. Intriguing plot. Four sets of villains, sometimes hard to keep track of who's who, especially everybody is not what the seem. Long discourses on Bible history sometimes interrupts action at inappropriate times. Cotton Malone is a wonderfully developed character and I will read additional Steven Berry books with this character.	positive
title: Fabulous shoes [SEP] content: I wore these as a bridesmaid in a wedding and was prepared to change early in the reception, but they were much more comfortable than I expected. I bought a half size larger than I normally wear. I got tons of compliments.	positive
title: Alla Rakha was peerless and still is [SEP] content: What a slice of nirvana from 1968 [recorded in 1967, I believe]! For fans of Rich, I am not sure what the appeal would be, but for Alla Rakha devotees, this is one CD you cannot live without.The packaging is simple, but faithful to the original LP's artwork. All the quality in this one went into the superb mastering work. You feel like the musicians are in the room-and I don't have thousand dollar speakers, folks. Five Stars on this one.	positive
title: A very strong record [SEP] content: I really can't help but dismiss the coldness spread out by some critics when this album came out. While this isn't her best-of-all album, it's still at least a four-outta-five stars one. I really love her version of Springsteen's Tougher Than The Rest and if it wasn't for any other song, this would still earn a four. Who cares if it's a bit soundlarge every now and then! Who cares about the "formula". It's a hell of an album. One simpl<y can't judge Emmylou's albums by any formula or anything but her singing. Just listen to it!!!	positive
title: Excellent Book !!! [SEP] content: I just finished reading this book. I must say, that as a PC tech , this book is one of the best I've come across. Carey has made it easy for the casual user to understand how to take care of their own computer and fix simple problems. It's written in simple to understand language that anyone can follow. This book is also a valuable reference for even experienced technicians.I will be recommending this book as a must have for all of my customers. Thanks to Carey for bringing a book like this to the masses.	positive
title: good brother, Bad brother [SEP] content: this was a very interesting read . I learned many things reading this book. I have suggested others should read it.	positive
title: ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! [SEP] content: This is not only one of the best punk songs ever recorded, it's one of the best songs period. This song is as close to perfection as you can get, both lyrically and musically. You would think that an 18 minute song would be boring at times, but not this one. The changes in tempo and the scathing political commentary keep your interest the entire time. This is a masterpiece.	positive
title: Very useful book [SEP] content: Book was recommended for use by Interpreter Training program teacher as an additional tool. I have gotten considerable use out of it over the past year in my transliterating and asl classes. Only one drawback just recently noted. The DVD is not supported by the newer MAC OS Lion systems so I'm forced to use it on a Windows based computer. Other than that, very satisfied with this book.	positive
title: Trims well [SEP] content: This product works very well. The 3 cutting guides allow you to pick the correct length. There is an adjustable cutting guide that was of no use. The charger has to be plugged into the trimmer instead of just putting the trimmer into a charging cradle. This is inconvenient.	positive
title: Love and Trust [SEP] content: She suffered a terrible loss. But she found the love and trust she needed to go forward. You will cry.	positive
title: Phantom of the Opera original novel [SEP] content: Fantastic condition, NEW. Halfway through the book, enjoying it immensely.Perfect purchase, great seller.	positive
title: Fantastic Voyage [SEP] content: I first heard the Waybacks driving to the airport. Told my wife, "Hey this is really good stuff!" I'm pretty critical of what I listen to. I listen a lot, but not everything catches my ear. First heard them do I Wanna Be Like You and loved every minute. Then we saw the guys in person in Rutherfordton, NC. What at great night in a saloon! There is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. There is creativity which crosses many lines of music including Jazz, Bluegrass, Rock, etc. The musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to Bright Place and Last Date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys. I hope they stay together and continue to produce this kind of stuff forever. If you don't like what you hear, move south and thaw out.	positive
title: It's OK, does the job [SEP] content: The Panavise Junior is a funny blend of heavy metal base with a plastic vise. The vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job OK. The ball joint is a bit annoying as it's hard to lock it down tight enought, and I would prefer a real ball joint that is not restricted to a single axis. I'm leery of reefing down on plastic parts because they like to break. I've had mine a few months and it's holding up all right, and it appears to be metal-reinforced where it counts.	positive
title: What a GREAT STORIE! [SEP] content: From the first page you are sucked into this adventure! When Maddie bursts into John Danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there. She then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife. From that point on you can't put the book down. It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone. I would have given this more than 5 stars. It is a keeper on my shelf. I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed.	positive
title: An excellent book and analysis [SEP] content: This book is a very impressive piece of work. Shattan is very fair when he writes about each and every person, no matter what their political stripe. From Churchill's prescient knowledge of what must be done to Truman's acknowledgement of the danger that Communism posed to Adenauer's firm and unwavering alignment with the West to Solzihentisyn(sp?) showing how the Cold War was really a moral struggle to Pope John Paul II's unwavering determination to free Poland to Ronald Reagan who ultimately caused the end of the Cold War; even though it came under Bush's administration; Shattan demonstrates a keen eye for details and an excellent sense of analysis. This is well worth reading for anyone interested in the Cold War.	positive
title: Absolutely Addictive [SEP] content: I was totally enthralled and can't wait for season Four. It was historically accurate and I loved the fashions. They were so elegant. Very interesting saga. Well developed interesting characters.	positive
title: this is the BEST toy ! [SEP] content: I raise Lab puppies for Canine Companions...so I almost always have a lab puppy around.....this toy has NEVER been destroyed ( little feet chewed off though) The squeaker has always remained intact. It is a perfect dog toy for land or water play. My current pup LOVES making it squeak so much so that my parrot can now imitate the squeak!	positive
title: Texas Holdem Table Top [SEP] content: This product will do exactly the job it was designed for. I am pleased with with the quality, and feel that it is a good value I recommend it to all who enjoy poker.	positive
title: Beautiful game with lots of options! [SEP] content: Now, bear in mind -- I'm not an avid gamer - in fact I rarely play computer games altogether nowadays. My favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.I purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via Freeverse's website. This game is very similar to Activision's 80's version of Shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of FUN!I prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. This review would be 5 stars, but I took down one star because under MacOSX 10.3, I can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. Freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.Highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then. Perfect for kids and adults alike!	positive
title: Thanks! [SEP] content: Thanks for the speedy delivery. As a customer ordering from Germany I didn't expect to receive it so soon. Thanks!	positive
title: Loved it [SEP] content: Loved this cd. If you have heard CJ's first few albums and enjoyed them you will definately enjoy this. I recommend this for any CJ fan.	positive
title: a collect call from the sacremento county jail. [SEP] content: a dope album from another gardenblocc gangster. In his own words, "I wrote from the perspective of crack rock." Believe it. A shame we must lose another bomb MC to the prison system. Believe it.	positive
title: rage rocks [SEP] content: I have only had this cd for about a week. One of my friends told me about them so I bought it. At first I was unimpressed; but the more I listened the better it got. Rage is now my most likly favorite band and would recomend this CD to any one.	positive
title: Courtship of the Vicars Daughter [SEP] content: Loved this story,could hardly put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting story.	positive
title: Great stool for the price [SEP] content: This is a great looking stool for the price--Yes, assembly is a bit of a pain, but it took me about 25 minutes to put together (not too bad in my opinion)...just looks a little daunting at first seeing all the pieces it requires. The instructions and pictures are very easy to understand and follow.We haven't gotten too much use out of it yet, since both my kids are a little young yet, but I imagine a non-slip stick-on of some sort would be a good extra safety precaution to add to the stool.	positive
title: Great Support [SEP] content: Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.	positive
title: My favorite, wish was was in kindle [SEP] content: This was a good purchase, fast shipper and am glad that I purchased, but should not have to write so many words	positive
title: Works just like it's suppose to [SEP] content: The house we rent has a small washer/dryer and the vent runs up and out through the ceiling. The dryer motor isn't strong enough to push all the lint up and out so we ran the ProFlex down to the floor and now the dryer works much better.The only issue is that on a warm day, the heat from the dryer stays in the house and can make it even warmer inside. On the upside, on a cold day we don't have to run the heat so much.	positive
title: Fair fairy drawing [SEP] content: This book is easy to use and to read with some amusing and interesting fairy facts the sketched and line drawings are worth a good look at and the part about the different types of wings is acurate and interesting.I love the book and the ideas for changing the types of fairy's eg attitude and style.	positive
title: Family Favorite [SEP] content: If you love the Muppets you will love The Muppet Christmas Carol! This is one of the best versions of The Christmas Carol because it pretty much stays true to the original storyline, but it will not bore you out of you mind. This is a film for young and old. Great music, great humor, great characters, Great Muppetry!!! This is my families all-time favorite Christmas movies.	positive
title: Pleased [SEP] content: I have this and the 2000 Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas cut. Both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, I'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound... the old style.	positive
title: Pretty Good!! [SEP] content: This album is actually really good. Although short, it's definitely showsMonica has matured. Although the first track that was released was not that great, tracks like dozen roses and gotta move on makes us remember why fans will continue to support Monica. Hell No is definitely one of the best tracks on the album but what i didn't like is the fact that she tries the rapping too much. I prefer to hear her voice and think that she should stay true to the talented R&B; Singer that she is.	positive
title: VERY good reading! [SEP] content: Everything is well explained. I recommend it very strongly to anyone interested in Judaism. Starts simple but by Chapter 2 its heavily into Orthodox with hardly a mention of Conservatism!	positive
title: Genuine is almost always the best way to go! [SEP] content: Pretty straight forward, works like a champ. Genuine Canon, heavier cable (wish it was a tad bit longer).Love it.	positive
title: Pretty, well fitting belt. [SEP] content: Bought this as a gift for a friend who always had to borrow a brown belt from me. It is simple and cute. Great addition to any outfit, and it is well made.	positive
title: Fun to be "Sloppy" [SEP] content: A year in the life of a teenage girl named Jessica Darling. Told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book runs from January to December, following Jessica's life after her best friend Hope moves away. Now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next. This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it. If you like a light comedy, if you liked The Princess Diaries or Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, you'll enjoy Sloppy Firsts.	positive
title: Very moisturizing, love it! [SEP] content: I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good.	positive
title: If Your Looking For A Good Crue Album... [SEP] content: Greatest Hits is the most suitable title for this album. Released in 1998, Motley Crue's greatest hits is a great compilation album for any die-hard Crue fan. On the album you'll find hits such as: Kickstart My Heart, Dr. Feelgood, and Smokin' In The Boys Room. If your into the heavier Crue stuff, you'll find hits such as Too Fast For Love, Looks That Kill, and Shout At The Devil! If your looking for a good variety of Motley Crue songs on a single album, then Motley Crue: Greatest Hits is the album for you.	positive
title: LOVE IT! [SEP] content: Are you pondering what I'm pondering? Sure, but horizontal stripes make me look hippy.A must for any fan. The best part (really!) is the extra material with Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen -- they are as intelligent, witty and friendly with each other as you'd ever hope. Restores your faith in humanity.	positive
title: TAILOR MADE ROLE FOR BLACK! TOUGH TO DISLIKE! [SEP] content: Black is his usual over the top self in this very funny crowd pleaser. The supporting cast of kids and adults in the film are great. Throw in some catchy rock tunes and a whole lot of zany situations and you've got one of the best comedies of the year. The original release on DVD has a very good transfer and some very cool extras including excellent commentaries which make for some interesting repeated viewings of the film.	positive
title: An extraordinary piece of work! [SEP] content: Lois Gladys Leppard is a very talented author. She knows exactly how to draw the attenion of any 8-12 year old to her fantastic books. In the first chapter, Mandie's father dies and her stepmother is cruel to her. So, her dear indian friend, Uncle Ned leads her to her uncle John's mansion where she discovers a tunnel built by her great-grandfather in order to hide the Cherokees when they were being driven out of their land by the whites. Also she is reunited with her real mother, who marries Mandie's uncle John.This great story will keep you on the edge of your seat and not want to put it down. Keep writing those Mandie books, Mrs. Leppard!	positive
title: Good Customer Service - OK Quality Control [SEP] content: We bought this game for Christmas. I wanted the wooden balls and a sturdy cage. The first unit that was shipped to us had a defective cage. I called the maker of the game instead of returning to amazon, because I wanted them to know about the quality error for such a high priced set. They shipped out a new cage very quickly at no charge. Our balls were well marked (two of the markings my 8 yr old had to look at twice, but were still readable). We would have liked a few mor cards in the set. I would say they are the weakest part of the set. The sliders do not easily move and there is no way to order additional cards and be sure there will not be a duplicate.Overall, we are happy with the set.	positive
title: Not a better bluegrass album exists [SEP] content: I was truly amazed at the reality of this DVD audio disk. And my DVD player isn't a DVD Audio player. I have never heard better bluegrass on any album and I used to play bluegrass on stage.	positive
title: Good for what we needed! [SEP] content: We placed game show board games out as center pieces at our company meeting and this was a fun one to display. The game came on time and in great condition!	positive
title: Great product! [SEP] content: At first glance, the sound machine looks very outdated and old, but it really does a great job of masking noise. Our son had gotten used to sleeping with a humidifier, but I was tired of filling it, so thought I'd try this instead and it is awesome! They could work on updating the look, though!	positive
title: Dax, Bashir, O'Brian On A Fantastic Voyage [SEP] content: It's the Adventures through Innerspace, Star Trek style. The makers of the series give us a new twist on a classic science fiction story. I dug it, and thought it was well done. If you remotely like Star Trek, you'll appreciate this. 4.5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'	positive
title: AMAZING............. [SEP] content: Ok for all of you R&B love song people ( i am one if them)I know u all of u look for the words. All the slow "love songs" are written by the man himself, there are also some uptempos ongs he had some help on. One thing youll hear on this CD is the meaningful words, but the chords, vocals, instruments, EVRYTHING. It will capture your mind, when u hear Brians Vocals on "6,8,12" u know that it cant get any better, then you hear the breakdown on "Shall We Begin" smooth....as silk. But dont leave out the 5 uptempo songs where it can get no better, in my opion way better than "You should be Mine". Overall this album is much better than his "Anytime" album which had a bit more hip-hop/pop sound to it. The only reson it does get only 4 stars is becuse i dont know what Mr. McKnight will deliver next...can it get better? Im just not sure - Ray Roa	positive
title: Smitten, still... [SEP] content: Like many, I remain smitten by the story, the movie and the original soundtrack. This "differnt" rendition fills that gap wanting an extension to the instrumental portions of the original.	positive
title: Regina is the best!!! [SEP] content: Think..a happy Tori Amos. Think..Fiona Apple at her proper weight level.This is great music. And Regina Spektor should be a star. I can't wait to see what's next.	positive
title: granddaughter pleaser [SEP] content: this Christmas was extra special when the pogo stick was the first to arrive. My granddaughter, who knows a whole lot more about computers than I, just thought I was the greatest because I shopped on line. Thanks, amazon for making this a terrific help when time is of the essence.	positive
title: The Table [SEP] content: We have this table and its been great! We have it in the dinningroom beside our table...on carpet.She loves to eat at it - if shes ready to eat she goes and sits at the table...the chairs are really light wieght so she has no trouble pulling them out to sit in.The chairs are pretty sturdy to, she has me sit in them all the time and her daddy..lol - I would recommend trying it out -	positive
title: interesting & usefull [SEP] content: small & quite handy book. Usefull when one's in doubt about the color range. I can recommand it to anyone.	positive
title: Works fine [SEP] content: I used it couple of times for flour, sugar, even for coffee creamer... no problems at all. I hand washed it and dried it and it looks good. The metal could be a bit thicker, but it's not too bad. It might be a bit too small for people who bake in large amounts, but it works just fine if you need something for every day use that won't take too much space.	positive
title: Marty Done Well [SEP] content: Got everything you'd want here, no complaints. Early at his prime and pleanty of him. Only critique is this version of "El Paso" is the shorter one, missing the stanza between shooting the wild young cowboy and heading for Rosa'a back door. I dunno why, maybe timing for radio which was a serious consideration back in the day. Might have liked the "El Paso" spinoffs that he wrote later, but this is a nice compilation for Marty fans, especially on a long trip.	positive
title: Why didn't I order this sooner? [SEP] content: This was much better than I expected. Went together in minutes without any tools. Mine is in the garage, and so far I don't feel I need to attach it to the wall. I dropped one of the arms during installation and the flat piece that goes against the main bar got a little bent, but it's still functional. I'm really impressed with this stand, it's sturdy and yet light and needs no tools, and I was able to put two types of women's bikes on there adjusting the arms as needed. No need to add a straight bar to ladies bikes!Very, very happy with this.	positive
title: This book got me through basic military training. :] [SEP] content: I bought this book on a Sunday while I was in basic training for the USAF. I really got me through some of the tougher days, and I treasure this book to this day- I have pages marked and certain sections highlighted. I love this book!	positive
title: HP Photosmart 8MP Camera [SEP] content: This camera is neat and easy to use. I love the large 2.5" display screen. To change settings is quick and easy.Can't beat the Price. The Picture Quality is good. It takes excellent daytime shots......really clean.The Video Quality is alright. A good buy for my part.	positive
title: Good value pack for 3 films [SEP] content: The video looks slightly better than an upscaled DVD. If you already have the original DVDs, it may not be worth upgrading unless you find it on sale. But if the films are new to you, then the gift set is a good value.	positive
title: Good for pesky rashes [SEP] content: This is one of the most useful products for a light rash or that uncomfortable itch. Price was superior to stores.	positive
title: Works as advertised. Easy to install. Couldn't be simpler. [SEP] content: Works as advertised. Easy to install. Couldn't be simpler. We have the bell receiver located in an addition about 50 feet from the transmitter. The signal has to go through two outside walls covered with aluminum siding (or it's bouncing through the house?). Works fine and solve our problem of not hearing the doorbell when working in that part of the house.Later: It's now been installed more than 3 years. Still works fine.	positive
title: great product [SEP] content: this was a gift for my brother and he was so soprised when he opened it, now he uses it all the time and it works so fine nice audio quality and it was a very good price and shipping time.	positive
title: Closer by Josh Groban [SEP] content: I received this item very quickly and it was in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again.	positive
title: One of the Best Soccer Coaching books, unique in presentation [SEP] content: This book is just great. I knew as soon as I picked it up, it was easy and fun to read and had the kind of info I needed. I coach two kids soccer teams and I got many great ideas to help my practices. Lots of books are just pages and pages of drills, and others are just theory. The nit-pickers who picked on one page out of this book they did not agree with are missing all the other great stuff here. No book is perfect, but I got more usuable ideas from this book than I have from any other, and I've read scores of them.	positive

title: AMAZING [SEP] content: I love this game! It is very good becuase of the great gameplay and graphics. I think this is going to be ten times better than blitz. It will have more players, plays, and tricks along with the same great gameplay. I can't wait till this game comes out and your crazy if don't think this is going to be a good game. I have always been a madden fan but NFL street will blow it away. I also heard that a secret players like LT and Barry Sanders. GO out and get this game NOW!	positive
title: Good lens for what I want (not change the lens) [SEP] content: as you can read in other reviews, it does suffer from pincushion and vignetting so did my old 18-55mm so nothing changed there. I like this lens because of the nice range 18 to 135mm, I was considering the 55-200mm but I don't see myself changing lenses most of the time. I recommend it.	positive
title: It's a very good reference. [SEP] content: I'm a dental student studying gross anatomy. Usually, students don't have enough skill in disecting the cavador to all stuctures (arteries, muscles, vein, nerves) they've studied. This reference help me improving and completing my lab skill. Its pictures are all color. They're all real picture. All structure are all clear. (clean fascia very clearly) Some sturctures are dyed so they help you identify and understand it easier.It's the best lab reference book I've ever had.	positive
title: I am a changed man [SEP] content: OK, OK, OK. I originally gave this a 1-star review, because I originally hated it. Let me tell you...I gave this CD a couple hundred 2nd chances, and I have loved it more and more every time I listen to it. WOW. Absolutely amazing. Every song on here is astounding with its ability to instantly put the listener in a trance. Almost as amazing as Kid A(their best by far). Personal favorite song; "Like Spinning Plates".	positive
title: What a voice! [SEP] content: This is probably my favorite album by Randy Travis, and definately a must-have for anyone who enjoys Randy's music. He gets you with EVERY song -- with warmth, humor and that gorgeous deep voice! It's like he's right there, singing to you, telling you his story. The fun "If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another" probably describes your life perfectly! The beautiful "Long On Lonely, Short On Pride", "I Wish It Would Rain" ("so she won't see what she's doin' to me") and "Future Mister Me" and "Price to Pay" are rich with emotion, humility, and honesty, -- they are all soooooo good! Need upbeat and twangy Randy? -- check out "Would I" (he had to be dancing when he recorded this one!) You will not be disappointed!	positive
title: Fun! [SEP] content: My 5 year old has these in white and loves them. We like that they are a little bit big - it makes it easier for him to put them on. Its fun for roll playing.	positive
title: Excelente Reloj [SEP] content: Excelente reloj, tiene numeros claros y faciles de ver. Es muy facil de configurar. Es un muy buen reloj por este precio.	positive
title: Masters of the Accordion [SEP] content: My husband was extremely pleased. He is seeking more accordion music of this type.	positive
title: Not quite as good.... [SEP] content: This is a great CD by a great band, don't get me wrong. It's just after listening to the excellent "Introduction to Mayhem" I expected a little more out of Primer 55. Still a great buy, and it only cost me $... on the day it came out at Best Buy! Any Primer 55 fan should own it, and definitely check out their older one. It kicks ....	positive
title: Great little grill!! [SEP] content: This is the best little grill. I had to replace my old George Foreman and this was a perfect replacement. I especially love the removable plates, it makes cleaning such a breeze. I definitely recommend this product	positive
title: Lovely Book! [SEP] content: I am a big Tudor fan & love the artwork in this lovely book! I've also tried two of the recipes, so far, & thought they were terrific!	positive
title: Yummy! [SEP] content: These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!	positive
title: Wild Seed [SEP] content: I have read three of Butler's books, the Parable of the Sower, Clay's Ark and Wild Seed. This is my third favorite. Butler is an imaginative and masterful writer. I continue to be impressed by her.	positive
title: Adorable, well made train [SEP] content: For those with the wooden railway set, this sweet train is a great addition. These are high quality toys and the magnets are solid.	positive
title: Good plot [SEP] content: I had to come back and edit this review. Previously (years ago) I had given the movie a bad review because Amazon had ripped me off and I couldn't download the movie. Since then, Amazon has fixed their glitches, and I have finally been able to see the movie. It was well acted, and I like how they went back to the art over film style (as was done with a movie back in the 80's....I think it was Lord of the Rings, or The Hobbit, or something like that). The cast worked well for the movie, and the plot, while slow, kept me watching. I apologize for the bad review that I left before because of Amazon's flaw.	positive
title: It's a Keeper [SEP] content: I would recommend this game to anyone... but I have to say that there's a couple of disappointments i've run into in comparison to previous FIFA Soccer Versions.. in FIFA 2003 I learned that there isn't a Create-A-Player mode in the game which I find disappointing another is gameplay might be too hard for beginners although I'm trying not to be negative this is an awesome game certaintly one of EA Sports best. just those two things disappoint me for some reason but I won't be returning it I'll defenitly enjoy this awesome title !	positive
title: Organic bar with good taste and texture [SEP] content: This is one of the better tasting bars I've tried, but as always, your mileage may vary. For the most part, I'm not a huge fan of "nutty" bars, but this is an exception. While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other "energy" bars on the market that are packed with sugars. I think these would be great to carry along on a hike or other day outing where you want something quick. I'll be purchasing more of these.	positive
title: Fun game true to the anime [SEP] content: I played this game years ago on the Sega Saturn with my cousin's two kids. They were both as in love with the characters and game play as I was. It wasn't the most challenging of games but the humor and cut scenes made it well worth it.We ended up getting into both the anime and manga because of how much we enjoyed the story. Its a shame you can't get this game for less money but if you can find it for less definitely get it. It was a great ending for a beloved console. Wish I still had this game and my Sega Saturn.	positive
title: Finally found Sugar Daddys [SEP] content: My sister has Celiac Disease and can only eat certain gluten-free foods...luckily, Sugar Daddys are perfect & Hershey's Milk Chocolae bars are just a couple of the only candy bars she can have. She was so thrilled to get a box of Sugar Daddys for Christmas she said that's all she wants for her birthday. Sooo, that's what she's getting!!! She likes the smaller ones..Daddy pops!	positive
title: great lens and great photos [SEP] content: Update on 06/05: If the exposure is correct, the image is sharp at ANY focal length. Greatest lens for landscape and portrait. There is no dark corner and no distortion.Having the lens for 5 days, I am very happy with this lens. This is my first L lens and it is much better than any of other lenses. The lens was put on my XTI camera. I ignored all the comments that this lens does not match this camera. What I wanted to do is to get nice pictures on the camera on hand. Widness is not the only issue to measure the quality of the lens. I uploaded one picture and definitely that is not the best picture because I am still improving my photographic skills.Bought $1350 at Buydig with a $150 Heleopan UV filter.	positive
title: Garmin Case does its job [SEP] content: Purchased a leather case to go with my new Garmin 760. Works well to protect the unit. Highly recommend getting one of these so the screen doesn't get damaged every time you tske it off or install it in the car.	positive
title: Mother Goose: A Fragmented Tale [SEP] content: Hardly is one character or situation introduced until the author skips to another. Even given the brief attention span of a reader of modern fiction, the lack of continuity, excessive use of jump-cuts, and economy of presentation leave the reader searching in vain for the central theme. Still, the basic rawness of its poetic passages has a visceral attraction and a primitive strength. I anxiously await its rendering in the media of film, to see how the director will tie together the diverse range of metaphorical, even alegorical, passages into a cohesive whole.	positive
title: Liar's Poker [SEP] content: If you've been following the events on Wall Street for the past 3 years or so, you'd think you'd heard it all. Well, if you'd purchased Liar's Poker when it was published, you'd have heard it all then. Michael Lewis was there in the waning hours of Salomon Brothers and he captured the psyche of traders and investment firms in this revealing and hilarious expose'. Liar's Poker should be required reading for anyone involved in financial services.	positive
title: Worked and it retested to exceed spec [SEP] content: Solid well made patch cable using commercial grade stranded CAT5e with Green outer jacket. It was Made in China. Non-plenum	positive
title: Excellent knife that feels "right" in your hands! [SEP] content: I picked-up a 10" Wushtof Chef (the one on this page) and a 6" Chef when I was in Germany and I love them. The 10" is large enough that you can cut large items and also has a wider blade that helps with "proper" chopping technique for those of us who are not "professionals". Of course, the wider blade also allows you to scoop-up a good amount of ingredients for transfer to where-ever you need them.Even for being such a large blade, the knife is light, balanced and easy to handle. I anticipate that these knives will last me a lifetime if properly cared for (for example, I always use the honing rod before use which will help prevent the need for sharpening). I recommend these knives to everyone I know who enjoys cooking even the least bit and I feel it's better to have a few well-selected quality knives than one of those "sets" of cheapies (most of which are filled with blade styles you'll never use anyway).	positive
title: Great comedian [SEP] content: The package arrived on time and great condition. The dvd itself was amazing. I was laughing the entire hour the show was going for. Dimitri Martin is probably my favorite comedian.	positive
title: Great style and craftsmanship. [SEP] content: This watch looks very classy yet rugged, and it feels very solid. The face changes color depending on how the light hits it. It goes from a shiny bright blue (bright sunlight) to a deep rich blue (little light) to almost black (little light). Setup is a little confusing but not too bad. I found a simplified version of the setup manual on Citizen's web site. I suggest you do the same. I'm very happy with the purchase and the price on Amazon was very good.	positive
title: Good but way too much hype [SEP] content: When I heard everyone raving about the MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR I had to check it out for myself. I've seen her BLONDE AMBITION and GIRLIE SHOW tours (on video) before so I was ready for this one. I have to say that much of it is hype. It was a good concert but it was sort of dull at times. The costume changes were'nt as great and there wasn't a lot of dancing. Madonna played the guitar here and there... that was new. The bull ride that she did in "don't tell me/human nature" was way too short. It wasn't even worth mentioning. Some people described the geisha themed segment as "awesome" and "magical" but I found it to be OK at best. She flew across the stage.. BIG DEAL. She did an air spin like a scene out of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... cool. I thought it looked cool but it didn't live up to the hype. And what the heck was up with that anime video thing? It was weird. So, I was a bit disappointed at times. MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR ends with her hit "music."	positive
title: A Girls Survival Through Disaster [SEP] content: As you are lead through the book, you may see what you don't want to see. It is as if you were there, engaged in this struggle to live through the dustbowl. As this little girl has to deal with disaster at such a young age, so did many, and most of them got through it the same, by hope. You might think the real struggle would be her with her environment, but what she finds out is that the struggle is really between her and her heart and mind. After the "accident," all she has left is her father, not even her piano, which deserted her along with everything else. Does she escape? Will she survive? Find out by reading "Out of the Dust," by Karen Hesse.	positive

title: REAL rock n roll mayhem!!! [SEP] content: This is a pretty boss platter from one of the truly great rock n roll (garage if you will) bands that the world has seen. The first side of this album is specataular, the second is solid too, although not quite as overwhelming as side 1. Contains a number of true classics, incl. "Don't Give it up now, which was good enough that the mighty ? and the Mysterians actually covered it on a recent album!!!!	positive
title: This was one book I couldn't put down [SEP] content: I loved the book it was really good. I couldn't put it down. Ms. Braun has really done a wonderful job and I have read all her books and I think this one wasn't as well written as the others but it was still very good reading and I would recommend it to anyone.	positive
title: Great [SEP] content: Great product. I've never been cut/otherwise harmed by it, it's fast and efficient, does its job. I don't really see a point for the light, but whatever.	positive
title: Words cannot describe it [SEP] content: I type this review for those surfing Amazon looking for new music.I sit here at my computer with headphones on, Olsen Olsen playing for the 9th time tonight, feeling rather fortunate that I stumbled on to Sigur Ros while surfing Amazon.com for new music.Words cannot describe the music on this album. Sounds so beautiful it will make you weep. Get the CD. Put the kids to bed. Plug in the headphones. Close your eyes. Play the CD. See the angels coming down to earth, singing the most heavenly music you have ever heard.For those who just don't get it, I truly feel sorry for you. You are really missing out on one of the most unbelievable musical experiences of our time.	positive
title: Satisfied buyer [SEP] content: I purchased this textbook new at a good price. I received free shipping and the book arrived sooner than I expected. This is a great book for anyone who is currently in, or entering the education field. It has lots of helpful information. I am very pleased with the way the information is presented.	positive
title: For the right audience, a good book [SEP] content: There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.	positive
title: Sean William Scott & Jason Biggs produced a winner ! [SEP] content: Absolutely As good or better than the first.It Hit's all the marks in writing,direction,acting ect..Sean William Scott & Jason Biggs produced a winner! and may have revived the franchise of American Pie. The ends credit scene with Stiffler's Mother in the Movie Theatre was funny as hell!.	positive
title: One of the worst books I ever read [SEP] content: I didn't like the plot because it seemed very unrealistic. There was way too much graphic sex that didn't add to the character development. It wasn't engaging to me at all. Maybe I just didn't like any of the characters in the book.	negative
title: Theif Lord...I was rather Bored... by artemis11 [SEP] content: It was an OK book, if you like books where 5 years olds become aspiring thieves =(. Well anyway I better review it:The book starts when a wealthy lady come to Victor a Private Investigatior with a request to find her nephews. He accepts and eventally finds them, and begins to like them yada yada yada....You know what happens...They escape with the help of their friends...Everything turns out for the better...Typical Pre-Teen book...A review by artemis11	negative
title: Save your money [SEP] content: Transmitter is too weak. Transmission can be easily overcome by transmitters in vehicles passing by.Ugly long antenna line.Went out and bought a Griffin transmitter which has much more power.	negative
title: Not great [SEP] content: This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead.	negative
title: Wouldn't recommend it [SEP] content: Bought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the 2nd one. I charged it twice without any problems with myXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitand on the third time I noticed the lights on the charging Kit wouldn't turn on, as in there wasn't any battery in it. Left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as I suspected it didn't charge one bit. I've googled a lot trying to find a solution but haven't found one. What I did find was that other customers have the same charging problem. Very dissapointed.EDIT: Forgot to mention, I also experienced what other reviewers have written. This battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller. I didn't pay much attention to this the two times I used it because I was happy that it was working properly. Have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this product.	negative
title: Worked for 30 minutes [SEP] content: Worked for about the first 30 minutes, and then stopped working. At first I thought it was my laptop or my TV but after testing this cable with several TV's it's definately the cable.	negative
title: Carman: Beyond 1st Amendment Protection [SEP] content: Freedom of speech is an idea very dear to my heart. However, I find Carman's facist messages alarming, to say the least. I believe that Carman's message is so dangerous that it is not protected by the First Amendment. In fact, in postulating this message of a violent overthrow of the government by Christian Marxists, Carman is guilty of not only poor judgement, but treason. For this act of sedition he should be tried and subsequently hanged.	negative
title: It is ok but [SEP] content: I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with. It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that. I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model. This one is just not nearly as easy to use. I really liked that other one. I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc.	negative
title: No new information and poorly compiled [SEP] content: This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading. As another reviewer stated, this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of the book. A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other news magazine reports and other books about the subject.	negative
title: GT Interactive, too OLD for windows XP [SEP] content: doesn't play on newer computer. Made the changes to the compability as instructed by others. have many of the older Living Books CD games and after making the changes they are fine. NOT the GT Interactive CDs "Just Me & My Dad" and "Just Me & My Grandpa". they just won't play. bummer. They played on the old computer ... Looking for an old computer so they can be played.	negative
title: Great series but surprises ruined [SEP] content: The order in which everyone gets voted out is on each disc you pull out. How dumb is that?Otherwise it's a fun season which is why I bought it. I will probably never find the time to watch the commentaries.	negative
title: Great... until it died [SEP] content: I liked the toaster up until it gasped its last breath. It had great features like "keep warm". But it dies after only a year and a half of use. Too expensive (and big) to be disposable!	negative
title: Cable doesn't work at all [SEP] content: Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.	negative
title: Way Out Of Date [SEP] content: This little book needs to go away. The version of GIMP that it describes is long gone and not missed. The contents is nearly all useless, and there are so many better books on GIMP available.	negative
title: Terrible [SEP] content: This DVD just copied different pieces from many different sources on TV or Movies. They hired someone to talk about all those gossips. I wish I could get refund for this kind of DVD.If you have nothing to do and have too much money, buy it to kill some time and money.	negative
title: Save your Money [SEP] content: This pump could NOT pump warm cooking oil out of the pan. I gave up and went to the hardware store and purchased a large funnel with a filter. In my opinion, it is a piece of junk.	negative
title: Not true to size [SEP] content: I had to return the item because it was not true to size. There was no way, that this item was the size it was marked. I ordered an extra wide shoe, and my friend with very narrow feet could fit them, without them being loose on her. I wasnt happy at all.	negative
title: Christmas Nightmare with Vince Vaughn [SEP] content: My Title says it all. My Wife and I sat down to watch a Christmas movie together and decided to rent this.I wish I could get my 1hr and 29 mins back. This movie is bad, only reason I gave it 2 stars was Reese Witherspoon.Vaughn still can't act his way out of a paper bag and the rest of the cast was painful to watch. If you want a funnyChristmas movie to rent on Amazon check out Surviving Christmas with Ben Affleck.	negative
title: Avoid this brand! [SEP] content: I have a 20 pack of these, and niether of my recordable drives will accept them. I got one to burn, but all of the rest have been rejected at every attempt. Save yourself the trouble and look for another brand.	negative
title: Proves the theory... [SEP] content: Great sidemen don't always make great composers. Jan Garbarek is a brilliant contemporary saxophonist. His body of work playing with the likes of Keith Jarrett, Charlie Haden, Ralph Towner, Art Lande and other ECM artists is simply stunning.But "Visible World" can only be described as a collection of banal Kenny G. new-age cliches. What happened? Perhaps Jan wanted to go after some of that big Kenny G. cash? Or maybe, absent the collaboration of other great musicians, Garbarek's creativity left him? Either way, this CD is beneath him, certainly not a reflection of his prodigious talent. Skip this, and instead savor some of his most amazing work on Keith Jarrett's "Personal Mountains".	negative
title: Good looks ain`t everything [SEP] content: It's a very nice looking coffee machine, but it always leaves a mess. The filter pops open while the coffee is still brewing, it over floats quite often and you end up with a lot of coffee grinds in your coffee	negative
title: Ja-Blah! [SEP] content: When i first bought into bluetooth fone technology i was sold but beware there are drawbacks! First the Ja-Blah errr Jabra Bt350 is a good headset if you do not know much about bluetooth. Connectivity! it is there. it seems to do the basic stuff ok....but when you demand more from it like crystal clear calls or reception away from phone...look for another earpeice! this device gets static @ 5 or more ft...the echoes you get are nothing short of what past reviewers say about it..when u buy a product you want it to work @ least 90% of time not 70%..Always remember to do you homework when buying these devices b/c they are expensive(cost as much as many cell phones!)...buy earpices from companies who actually make cell phones(motorola for example)..they tend to understand the "reception game" a little better....happy hunting!	negative
title: DISLIKE THIS UNIT [SEP] content: TIE THIS THING DOWN. IT VIBRATES THE WHOLE COUNTER,MAKES NOISE WHILE MIXING, NEEDS LIGHT IN DISPLAY WINDOW.IN MY OPINION NOT A GOOD BUY AT ALL	negative
title: Stopped working in a year [SEP] content: This router was good for a year but stopped working after that. Not worth it for the money I spent.	negative
title: HORRIBLE! [SEP] content: Don't waste your time. It is a waste of paper. The only thing the book has going for it is that the "action" never stops. The "action" is also unbelievable. A fair plot ruined and gone terribly bad.	negative
title: Enough already [SEP] content: Haven't we overdosed on semiotics taken to its idiotic extreme? Do throw rugs and hardwood floors really "say" that much about us? Can you tell how daring we are simply by the number of knick-knacks we own? This book is forensic jive from self-appointed experts whose only real concern is whether or not their tastes conform to the latest Interview fad.	negative
title: THIS IS SO[ Awful]!!! [SEP] content: This is an awful movie. There is only one good jolt in the whole thing, but other than that this isn't scary at all. Just a long boring piece of cinema. The re-make was better, and the re-make was awful as well. Don't see it alone in the dark, because you'll need someone to wake you up!	negative
title: was not pleased [SEP] content: Had to redrill holes wood cracked just was not pleased with it but already put it together i will go ahead and keep it is not worth the price i payed for it.	negative
title: Please enter a title for your review [SEP] content: although i like bill maher's talk show i've always found his opening monologues painfully amateurish and unfunny so i don't know what possessed me to check out this one hour stand-up set but it's firmly set him in my mind as the worst stand-up comedian i've ever endured. his Bush bashing and otherwise cliched sentiments have never been less cleverly expressed.	negative
title: Lots of unrealized potential [SEP] content: I bought this thinking I'd like it a lot. Every review I read made it sound like the type of music I'd like to own, esp. the idea that this was groundbreaking genre bending man-machine melding music. The clips sounded good too. Unfortunately, the clips pretty much summed up the album, and when I stuck it into my stereo expecting more content than a few 30 second real audio samples could provide (which I usually get, even from albums I don't like) I was disapointed. Moby takes some good ideas and goes nowhere with them.	negative
title: So so aweful [SEP] content: This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom.	negative
title: An okay gift... [SEP] content: I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose...	negative
title: I'm being generous with the two stars [SEP] content: This book was awful - I knew who the killer was by the time Igot through a quarter of the book. It was choppy writing andelementary at best. I couldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end. Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off. ew yuck, don't bother.And I'm actually a fan of MHC.	negative
title: Very Cheap - Low Quality [SEP] content: I was excited to see the great price, and was hoping to see a halfway descent product. Unfortunately the padding around the handles is paper thin and the handles themselves are rectangular, not round. Thus creating a very non-ergonomic, awkward, and painful grip. Additionally, they provide virtually no height benefit as they barely raise you above the floor. The base is very narrow, prohibiting you from safely doing a wide stance push-up. I regret this purchase and will be returning for a refund.	negative
title: Do not purchase for eReaders [SEP] content: This book is so poor in format for an eReader that I am recommending you not purchase it in this format at all. The pages don't line up properly. Some pages have black backgrounds, some white, and several don't even wrap properly. The content is ok, but hard to follow because of previous issues noted.	negative
title: Not worth the price [SEP] content: Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.	negative
title: defective [SEP] content: I'v just received the sheet set today. The sheet itself is soft and the color is beautiful as advertised. However,I 've found the defective. It was cut (about 3 inches)and the fabric is torn aprt. I have to return the stuff...very disappointed.	negative
title: Double boiler is only half [SEP] content: What??? A double boiler without the bottom part that holds the water isn't functional. It should be made CLEAR that it comes as only the top part with a curved bottom that won't stand on it's own. Thusly, unless the other part, which is another saucepan w/ lid is purchased, you're out of luck. Btw, the other half costs as much as the double boiler.	negative
title: CONFUSING [SEP] content: I thought that this book would teach me the basics of MySQL in a relatively short time. While I did learn some things, I spent most of my time figuring out how the author got from one step to the next. There were numerous typos in the code that left me, as a beginner, scratching my head. Most SAMS books are great, but not this one.	negative
title: A Work of an ignorant conductor - Bad continuo choice [SEP] content: Harpsichord should be replaced with a organ and one or more theorbo. It is highly in doubt that Henry Purcell ever used 8'/4' choired type harpsichord to support continuo part for his trumpet composition. There are indeed Virginal (small & relatively inexpensive version of harpsichord) but these loud type harpsichords here were non existent throughout the époque of Sir William Byrd, Sir John Dowland, Sir John Blow, Sir Edward Stafford, Henry Purcell and his two brothers Sir.Thomas and Sir.Daniel Purcell, all held a royal positions in France, Denmark and England one or more times in their lives. I Suggest that the conductor resign from his post and should give up all harpsichord parts and get advises from Sir John Elliott Gardiner, William Christie, David Taylor, Konrad Junghanell and like to redo the work of Purcell. Those true gentlemen have great deal of knowledgeabout Purcell's work.	negative
title: impossible to clean [SEP] content: I bought this pan as a trial -- thinking that if I liked it I would buy a set of Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware. I won't be buying more. I've only used it three times, and as far its preformance is concerned it seems fine -- the heat distribution is good, and the food came out well. However, after only three uses, it has developed an ugly hazy stain that is impossible to remove. I've followed all the cleaning instructions that came with the pan, but to no avail. The "hard-anodized" aluminum doesn't seem so hard after all.	negative
title: Only has a couple of good cartoons [SEP] content: I didn't like this DVD ... I enjoy the black and white Popeye and there wasn't too many of them on this disc. I never did care for the color Popeye, and this is mostly what is on this DVD. I gave my copy away to the Library and bought the black and white Popeye that is from 1933-40. Must better DVD.	negative
title: WARNING:THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!!!!!! [SEP] content: My friends first and foremost I would want everyone to ignore the previous reviewer(An alias of Whirligig) and avoid this lousy Green Day cd.Green day are legends only in the previous reviewer"s mind.Their only listenable cd is Dookie which only deserves a two star rating.Forget Green day,listen to Led Zeppelin's debut album instead.that rocks!,not this.	negative
title: Roller Hardness Problem [SEP] content: I was originally delighted with this opener. I like safety openers and my last one, a Swiss-made one, lasted a dozen years. This opener worked very well for the first several weeks, but the cutting edge wore down to the point of uselessness after only 3 months. The cutting wheel is made of a softer steel than is needed for long-term use. Older versions may not have had this problem. This opener is now made in China.	negative
title: Good phone UNTIL the screen dies on you! [SEP] content: Overall I liked this phone - until a weeks after the warranty expired the screen DIED! Yes, folks - the internal screen on these phones have a 1 yr lifespan...Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use it for less then 1 yr!I am not kidding.	negative
title: worst shoe polish ever used. [SEP] content: i don't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating. it gives the shoes a nasty, rusty, ashy look with very minimum shine. it may be ok to use for primary coating, but not for top coating. i foolishly bought 3 of them, based on the positive feedback, and obviously i'm stuck with it because i don't use them.	negative
title: My days ruined! [SEP] content: I was all excited about recieving this blender for a birthday present & when after buying all these ingredients to make hummus, I started mixing it in the blender & in 10 minutes I smelled the smell of a burnt out motor & sure enough it died then & there.I don't know if I'll even bother getting another blender cause I had another slightly cheaper one recently made by Proctor Silex that I got 2 full uses out of it before that one died so that assures me that today's quality is crap compared to old school.The Kitchen my partents had lasted for decades!Don't throw away reciept & packing box if you buy this blender!!!	negative
title: A BIG disappointment [SEP] content: I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might "come back to life". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the "living dead" have about as much personality as a zombie from a "B" movie.	negative
title: frustrated to the MAX [SEP] content: I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much. As soon as I installed it, it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3. Neither would work again. I was getting 'bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails. It is trash.	negative
title: o god give it up [SEP] content: ok people. lets get this straight. GOOD CHARLOTTE ARE FAKE, WANNABE, RADIO-FRIENDLY, POP. they are not punk. if u want real punk buy M.I.A. The Complete Anthology by the germs. i am sick of all these people who do nothing but shop at hot topic and pretend they are punk. REAL PUNK IS ANGER. THIS PUNK IS FASHION.DESTROY EVERYTHING!	negative
title: YHE WORST OF ALL [SEP] content: IT LAST me like 1month of use, it sucks.. really really sucks.. i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces.. IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT.. NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL	negative
title: What's So Funny? [SEP] content: I found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel. I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. This has none of the layers and provocative questions of "Lord of the Flies." It was, to me, pointless. Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder.	negative
title: Dovetail rings [SEP] content: These will NOT fit a standard weaver or picatinny rail.....they are for 3/8" dovetail mounts and I just wasted my money. Be foreworned-apparently I missed the 22 part but the description talks about weaver mounts so idk.	negative
title: A Weak Attempt at Espresso [SEP] content: I had an ancient Krups espresso machine and decided I wanted an upgrade. Researched and chose the Cuisinart EM-100 as a reasonably priced entry level machine. My first unit had to be returned as the power button would not stay on. My second unit operates properly but there are multiple quality issues. The espresso is weak despite multiple attempts and variations of grind and tamping pressure. The unit advertises that it heats water for making tea - but it only heats to 165-180 degrees - not hot enough for tea. I have contacted Cuisinart by phone and email to see if they have any suggestions and have received no responses. All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I have had good experiences with Cuisinart products in the past but will probably never buy another.	negative
title: Very disappointing [SEP] content: My son was very disappointed when he received this item. It looks nothing like the picture. The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture. I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this. I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available.	negative
title: Not adequate for most home cleaning [SEP] content: I bought this steamer at a local store, and returned it after trying once. It is small, well-built and convenient to carry around. However, I found it to be inadequate for most household cleaning jobs. The heat was not enough and the pressure was not enough for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. We are just 2 adults in our home and the house is fairly clean. Yet this tool doesn't have enough power to scrub and clean tiles or greasy spots that arise from everyday use.I ended up buying a canister steamer (1500 Watts) for around 100 dollars, and that works for us. I'm waiting for a powerful hand held steamer.	negative
title: It you buy this item, cross your fingers [SEP] content: I ordered this spice rack and one of the arms was broken when I recieved it. I returned it to Amazon and they shipped me another one right away. It was broken in the exact same way. The other reviews say the same thing. If you order this, cross your fingers that it doesn't come broken.	negative
title: Not good [SEP] content: This product does not work as advertised. With sensitive skin in leaves red markswhere hair is removed. On legs it does not remove hair. Only makes it shorter.Save your money. I would send it back if it wasn't too late. My face is a mess.	negative
title: To ride a carousel is fun for a while !! [SEP] content: Listening to this music is like riding a carousel; its great fun, but in the end you're back where you started and then it all starts over again.I mean I loved Genesis and the art rock scene when I first heard their tunes in the middle of the 70:s. But this , whats the point? It's flawless in it's execution but its like those popular Fantasy Books that never ends you like reading them in the beginning but in book 15 of 37 you start becoming a bit bored of the swords and sorcery and the same goes for the guitar solos and synthesizer soundwalls and the quasi poetry.I'm from sweden and I'm rather proud of what our little country creates in form of popular music, but this is just to much!Sorry boys Steve hacket did this 25 years ago, and better at that without digital guitar processors I'm sorry to say.Per-ke	negative
title: waste of money [SEP] content: only worked twice, then stopped. not worth it. i would not recommend this product there are other more expensive which will work better	negative
title: still waiting for a response [SEP] content: it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar...	negative
title: Just don't buy it....trust me [SEP] content: It just doesn't work up to even a quarter of what you think it will do.When it does work, it takes to to the "pinnacle" of a project, then either crashes, won't burn, or will burn with very messy results and will make you very sorry you spent money and time on this piece of garbage.	negative
title: WHAT??? [SEP] content: When I recieved this game, it had two HUGE scratches on it, and I tried using a disk saver, but that didn't work. So now I have a game that doesn't work. :(	negative
title: Will have adverse effects on your Xbox! [SEP] content: Seemed to work fine at first, just made the whole thing louder. A couple months later though, I started receiving an error relatively frequently on startup. It wasn't the Red Ring of Death, but an error nonetheless, along with a wierd moaning whirring coming from the Xbox. I thought the Xbox was going bad. I started looking for another one of these for my new Elite, and came across all the other reviews about this bad product. I took it off my old Xbox, and it worked great again. Luckily as far as I can tell it didn't do any noticeable long lasting damage. Hopefully it will still last awhile when I give it to my brother. It's definitely not worth the risk!	negative
title: Best bottles I have found [SEP] content: I have three children. For the first one, I bought all those curved Healthflow bottles to keep the air out of my daughter's system. Big Pain!!. They were hard to clean. I used the Playtex bottles for my two younger children. They are much easier to clean. I could even put the rings and caps in my dishwasher. I would recommend these bottles to any mother. There are a variety of nipple shapes available to experiment with. My daughter liked the natural brown ones and my son liked the rounded top in the brown and silicone varieties.	negative
title: If i could rate this -5 stars i would [SEP] content: This thing is crap not powerful and hard to set up. I have a background in electric and it was still a pain for me. YOu will have to solder some connections in order to set up the ground properly. The instructions arent very good either. Also the lights die when you come to a stop unless you wire a battery into the circuit.	negative
title: Winning Eleven 7 wannabe [SEP] content: This game tries to come close to the gameplay of Winning Eleven 7, but it doesn't even come close.Get Winning Eleven 7 if you want to play a true 'FOOTBALL' (and not, its not soccer) game.	negative
title: Shallow - why buy this book at all? [SEP] content: There are quite a few other books on sniping that you need to buy before this one. I do not know about the background of the other reviewers but to call this a good book on sniping is BS. A very, very light introduction, maybe, but the book does not cover ANYTHING in detail. It is at best useful for a wanna-be sniper and maybe not even so: If you include so little details, but still manage to explain where to shoot a man in the head it is at best missguiding.I am sure that mr. Lonesdale knows his stuff, but this book is lightweight.	negative
title: Didn't catch the rat [SEP] content: We meticulously followed the directions and gave the trap 3 weeks to work. We then bought a live cage trap for considerably less. The disposal is not fun, but no more rat within a couple of days. I'll be trying out the rat zapper on mice and see if it does any better.The idea behind the rat zapper is great, but I'd like to see it work.	negative
title: Anticlimactic [SEP] content: This novel started off just fine. I was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.The characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. In his usual style, Dean Koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.However, the ending was so disappointing. I felt robbed of my time and energy. Maybe I have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.Definitely not one of Koontz's better novels. He does have many more satisfying works.	negative
title: Shape-shifters are a dog of a disappointment. [SEP] content: Should have been called "Dark Menagerie." I loved Holly's "Beyond Seduction" and "Beyond Innocence," so why did I find this eagerly anticipated book so...boring? Simply, it's missing the humanity that made the previous novels both plausible and sexy. If you can't get enough of shape-shifting, blood-drinking, angst-filled immortals in search of life mates to convert, this is for you. Personally, I hope Holly just dipped into the fantasy genre for a lark, and will give us a few more of the sizzling erotic historical romances that I enjoyed so much before.	negative
title: Get a Lexmark Toner for a Lexmark Printer [SEP] content: I bought the Radian toner cartridge to replace my aging Lexmark toner cartridge. The Radian cartridge has lasted a measly three months - keep in mind that a laser printer toner should be good for six thousand copies - and did a tour of duty of about five hundred prints. Now, the cartridge has littered my printer with dust residue and has caused only entirly black pages to print. This cartridge is a horrible piece of crap! Avoid it at all costs, especially since it costs almost $100.	negative
title: Dated, unclear material [SEP] content: The material in this book is dated (2000). The writing style is highly superficial with little depth not already available for free via java.sun.com. The content is too wordy, not enough pictures/diagrams. The code examples are superficial.There are much better books out there, if you need a book. Check out Core J2EE Patterns, online J2EE tutorial, Java Enterprise in a nutshell.	negative
title: Predictable [SEP] content: I really like these kinds of romance novels. Particularly novels set in Scottland, which was why I bought this book. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations at all. It was incredibly predictable and I felt, written poorly. So much so, that I stopped reading it mid-way through the book. I almost never, ever do that as most times I want to finish the book to see if it either gets better, or see how it ends. This book also seemed insulting to women in general as it goes on and on about how much the young woman in the story talks; as if women can't help but "blather on about things." I probably won't buy another Kinley MacGregor novel after this. I hate to spend the money and be totally dissatisfied.	negative
title: A little too geasy and the pump got to be improved [SEP] content: My husband is able to find a suitable moisturizing cream for his eczema condition from Aveeno, so it leads me wanting to find a facial moisturizer for myself.After reading a few Aveeno product review, I picked Clear Complexion, hoping it is non-oily and will improve my occassional acne problems as well.This is my review after 1 week of trial. I have combination skin (mainly oily around the T-zone area) staying in a topical country. It is a little too oily for me, and the pump size is a little too big, each pump is way too much for my face and I practically have to apply the excess onto my husband.I haven't yet to see obvious improvement on my complexion yet, but I'm still hoping it will show me some results. It is a little too oily for day use, perhaps I will continue to use it as night cream. I think I have to keep my product search going again.	negative
title: Cute but poor quality [SEP] content: Like other people who bought this outfit, we had the same problem where the pants ripped on the inseam. I had bought 2 of these costumes for 2 my nephews since they love playing soldiers. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing it, the inseam ripped on one of the pants and all he did was walk around the house in it. The second pair lasted a day before the same thing happened. My mom had stitched the pants back up for the boys and so far everything still seems intact. They really love the outfits so I hope it last a little longer.	negative
title: Hopelessly Outdated [SEP] content: Yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not "somewhat" outdated - - it is completely outdated. Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted "modern" spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a "hero," this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a "hero."	negative
title: disappointing [SEP] content: The Eddings have always been likeable for their commentry on the human condition via the use of archetypal characters that represent one type of person (ie, Tolnedrans are materialistic, Angaraks are religiously fanatic etc) What this book fails to do is to come up with characters that are original to Eddings' work! For example, Longbow is strongly reminisent of Hettar, Rabbit of Silk, Eleria of Flute, etc etc etc.Coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. The story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase I kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.This book offers nothing that earlier Eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. The style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.Save yourself some time and money: avoid this book.	negative
title: this album blows [SEP] content: If you want to blow chucks for over 60 minutes, get this album. Crappy modern-rock with a cocky lead singer who can't sing if he had to save his life. This is an insult to rock music. I shudder at the thought that this is not their first album ... ugh, and we all though Creed was bad...this is by far the worst rock band ever. Save your money and buy a CD worth while like Pearl Jam's 'Ten' or Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' because this is garbage.	negative
title: Beautiful but useless [SEP] content: I love the quality of these tongs..wonderfully built, BUT alas USELESS in the real world. Engineers were asleep on this one.Not near enough grip for any practical purposess.Let me know if want mine I will sell them CHEAP!	negative
title: Only for those with an odd mind [SEP] content: This is like the muppets on acid. I think the average person would not enjoy this movie. I found it odd and did not enjoy it.I am a fan of peter jackson and I did like dead alive.The puppets are well done and the music is appropriate. Maybe this is much funnier if you are under the influence of something...	negative
title: boring movie [SEP] content: this movie in not good and is boring I don't recommend this movie no for the they want to watch the real creature	negative
title: waste of money! go to walmart! [SEP] content: They fell part in less then a week there crap made for a dime sold way over what they should be I might as well have whiped my a** with the ten I spent on this crap go to walmart get real ones for same price these suck!	negative
title: Good for a disposable printer, it just doesn't last long [SEP] content: After owning a seperate scanner and printer for awhile, I bought this combined unit to save some desk space. The price seemed right, and I didn't need the extra fancy features of the more expensive units, such as the LCD screen etc.To me, HP should have removed the memory card slots and put more engineering into the paper feed tray. My unit has worked flawlessly for about a year (or maybe less). I was very excited about the copy feature and scanner as it worked so well.But now as I sit, the paper tray will not feed paper. One sheet, multiple sheets, the tray will not grab the paper. I suspect to fix this unit, it will cost more than what I paid for it originally. The scanner still works wonderfully.If you search online, there are some other people that have experienced this same thing. I haven't even burned thru the original ink cartridges yet. Very disappointing.	negative
title: Be wary of these discs [SEP] content: While I'll admit that the price is right: $100 for 100 discs and that the printable surface is superb using an Epson R300 direct to cd/dvd printer... I've had many failures burning a full DVD with this particular brand. My other burns that only make use of 25 to 50% of the disc were great, no problems. It's just when I burn a DVD that has about 4.36 gigs on it that problems arise, with skipping, stuttering and sometimes complete failure to recognize the dvd from both my computer dvd drive and my set-top dvd player. In short, I can only recommend this brand if you plan on not using the outer tracks of the disc because I surmise the dye on the outer portions of the disc media is not consistent and will lead to burn and/or read failures.I recommend TDK brands at this time over Memorex brands.	negative
title: coby mp3/cd player anti skip [SEP] content: terrible product ....do not bother..you will just have to return...first time i used it it just started shutting off...like maybe it gets overheated or something	negative
title: Worthless [SEP] content: When I moved into my new apt the filter needed to be replaced so I bought this twin pack. They are worthless. I followed the instructions for installation and flushing. Not only does the water dispense at a painfully slow pace but it actually raises the parts per million from 255(tap) to 350. While I couldn't tell if the "filtered" water tasted any worse than the tap water it certainly didn't taste any better.I'll stick to my Zero Water pitcher.	negative
title: Big name author writes a dud [SEP] content: I was very disappointed with every aspect of this novel. The story line was choppy and the plot was weak. None of the characters were well developed and the action sequences just didn't have any flow whatsoever. This was an amateurish effort and I'm a little disappointed that the reviews on the back blurb were so favorable. I'll need to check Amazon reviews in the future, to get a better sense of things next time.	negative
title: WEAK!!! [SEP] content: This collection is so lame I don't know where to start. Where's Rock Candy, Trans Am, Plain Jane, This planet's on fire, I don't need love, Three lock box and so on.Oh yea. The fidelity sucks too. PASS!!!	negative
title: Good, but.... [SEP] content: Even though I like a lot of the songs on here, 'Now' should change their title to 'Then.' "Hey Ya" is awesome but it is SUCH an old song-they could have put it on Now 14 or even Now 13. I hate the way Now puts songs that are like several months to a year old on their discs. I mean, don't call it 'Now' if it's not what's happening 'now'!! They should try to get their hands on the MOST recent stuff-they should have had Ashlee Simpson's "Pieces Of Me," Outkast's "Roses" (hate that song but it's more recent than "Hey Ya"), Britney Spears's "Outrageous," and songs that we were hearing on the radio when this was released. I am glad they included "Move Ya Body," "My Band," "The Reason," "Dip It Low," and a few others because those are more recent. But....NOW, next time try to get the radio hits we're hearing NOW!	negative
title: LETS HANG THE EDITOR !! [SEP] content: This could have been such an awesome dvd, with the opportunity to have corrected the ruining of the songs with interviews thus separating them rather than mixing them into the music, once again they drop the ball on this one and released it the same as they did on the vhs version. How Sabbath could have agreed to have such a great concert ruined is beyond me. Out of the 14 song set I regret to tell you there are only 5 unruined songs by interviews, they are: war pigs, after forever, dirty women, children of the grave and paranoid. a mere taste of what might have been. I strongly suggest this dvd gets re-edited and put out the way the fans who pay their hard earned money....DESERVE !	negative
title: OK but could be much better written [SEP] content: The information contains in the book makes it a pretty good primer on SIP. The organization of the book and its content is very good. The language and ways in which the author explains certain things are confusing. I think the author should be able to do a much better job in explaining things. I often find myself having to re-read certain explainations twice and much carefully when I feel I shouldn't have to -- the topics are not complicated but not well explained. Someone like Doug Comer or Richard Stevens would probably be able to make it a much easier read.	negative
title: PERVERTED,SICK,OFFENSIVE MOVIE [SEP] content: I can't believe my brother recommended this movie to me. It was disgusting and VULGAR...Make sure you do not watch it around children due to the sexual content/scenes. Unless you don't care whether the children are exposed to that sort of content. I consider this movie one step from turning into a porno. I didn't find anything funny about it. And I can't understand why anyone would give it more than two stars...that's beyond my comprehension. But as they say 'to each his/her own'. What a waste of time and money.	negative
title: Wife and Daughter walked out on it. [SEP] content: We like Shia LaBoeuf, but every scene was mega violence with little in between. Not much of a story. We didn't finish it.	negative
title: Your Kidding, Right? [SEP] content: Most of the other reviewers got it right. Not only did the cover for the seat back not cover the back, it did not cover the front completely either. At least 4 inches of the seat back still shows below the cover on my 77 GMC. There are not enough ties in the box to put the cover securely on the seat or the seat back. The ones that are attached gave the feel the one should not pull them to tightly for fear of ripping the fabric. One of the most dissapointing products I have ever bought on Amazon. Auto Expressions needs to make it clear this product is not as much as advertised.	negative
title: Junk [SEP] content: This is one seriously useless piece of junk. The sliding door does not stay on track, it was cracked aleready when I bought it, and it doesn't hold many bottles for the room it takes up. The only good feature was the built in dishwasher caddies, but you can get one of those for $4, and a storage bin for $5 and get better use for less money.	negative
title: I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review [SEP] content: Well.... I paid the 9.99 to read I Hate My Neck on my Kindle. This book was our book clubs next read. I've read about 40 pages and so far I haven't gotten into it. I don't feel like it is going to go anywhere. I'm not a person who would ever think about getting cosmetic surgery. I am what God meant for me to be and yes the sags are coming. I am almost 60. My secret is do what I can do (hair, make-up) for going out. After that, don't look in the mirror. LOL	negative
title: Ultra Smug [SEP] content: An intriguing account of how Winterbotham single-handedly made the planet safe for democracy during WWII. One is left with the impression that the great generals and admirals may have had an ace up their sleeves, but also with the impression that Winterbotham is in love with himself. Despite his shameless name-dropping and self-aggrandizement, this book is a must-read for any serious student of WWII, because of the important context it provides for events of that time.	negative
title: Not So Many Collected Works of Gustav Flaubert [SEP] content: How do you put together the collected works of Flaubert and leave out his best novel, Sentimental Education? Who compiled this collection?	negative
title: Ok, but not great [SEP] content: The book didn't seem to be updated much. I liked the SAT for dummies book better for studying.	negative
title: Don't buy Customer Manager [SEP] content: All the reviews here are dead on. This is NOT something I'd recommend at all. Yes, it work on a very basic level without syncing to Quickbooks. But it crashes all the time and it has tons of quirks. Buy something else.	negative
title: Doesn't blow inside out but poor quality otherwise [SEP] content: I have had this umbrella for two years, maybe I shouldn't expect it to last very long. It is true, the umbrella doesn't blow inside out but the quality of it is otherwise terrible. The fabric is disintegrating, all of the caps pop off of the spines so I have to put it back together every time I open it, and some of the caps have ripped because the fabric frayed. The fabric is disintegrating at the top also. I would definitely not buy another one. It started falling apart over 6 months ago and is barely functional at this point.	negative
title: The boat sank! [SEP] content: We put this boat on our pond yesterday. It immediatly began to take in water and it sank to the bottom. There is no way to retrieve it...not that we'd want to! Very disappointed little boy. Aren't these boats supposed to float?	negative
title: Who Cares? [SEP] content: I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written.	negative
title: Shallow City: History of Its Flux from Origins to Eternity [SEP] content: The historical journey Solnit takes through the reoccurring demise of San Francisco's bohemian culture only leads to sob stories in the end and does little for her cause. Remember, these now run-down neighborhoods and homes were expensive and new when first built 100 years ago. Yes, it's horrible that in our time the materially rich are pushing the spiritually rich out of the city, but the book only shows that artists will one day come back again. It may not be the same as when we first came, but that's life - nothing stays the same.	negative
title: Cheesy [SEP] content: This is not a very good album. Julian has an amazing voice and the quality of the instrumentals is great, but the quality of songwriting on this album leaves much to be desired.If you're looking for muzak, this album is the way to go, but do not expect any sort of contemplative, reflective, or simply interesting lyrics from this effort.	negative
title: Cheap seams [SEP] content: I bought this item for use with car camping. It is a simple item made entirely of plastic (with nylon straps) and is as pictured.After sitting in the gear box unused a few times out for short trips, I tried to use the product. There was a leak in one of the basins at the bottom, rendering half of the item useless. The plastic doesn't stand up to the folding induced when the item is stored (as delivered).The construction is poor and the materials are the cheapest available. Given how the product is folded for storage it is inevitable that it will leak and soon.The cost was low, but seeing as I was not able to fully use it once before breaking, it doesn't matter.Don't buy this item.	negative
title: Horribly over-rated drivel [SEP] content: When I first heard "You Oughta Know", I thought it was a parody of bad female "alterna-divas". When I found out it was serious, I didn't know how to feel. Alanis whines, gargles, shrieks and mutters. The one vocal sound she doesn't make is tuneful SINGING. The songs are all of the currently "kewl" retro-60s/70s Pop nonsense, with no real substance, I give this one the definite THUMBS DOWN.	negative
title: Poor Debut [SEP] content: A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie. The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant "Russian element," which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst. The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins.	negative
title: Spiceless [SEP] content: I thought this DVD would have a lot more spice. I ended up being bored with it and wish I would have bought any other DVD that would teach me how to salsa dance.	negative
title: yesterday, today and tomorrow [SEP] content: Terrible! It's dubbed and you can only hear English. It's advertised as having the option of listening to the original Italian but you can't. Don't buy it	negative
title: zatoichi [SEP] content: I will write the same comment on each one that I purchased for my parents. Although the video quality was good, through generations of copying the audio was lousy. My parents, who are fluent in Japanese, needed to read the English subtitles to understand what was being said. Check the quality before keeping the item.	negative
title: Lets try to be english with a has been english band!!!!!! [SEP] content: Please do not buy this garbage!!!!!!The Dropkicks try to be english and cover really poor songs by this band called the business who are as most know horrible.Then to make matters worse the business massacre the dropkick songs.They also allow Al Barr there new singer(if you want to call him a singer)screw-up boys on the docks!!!!!!This once great outfit is really stinkin up the bar these days!!!!!drop the dropkicks and pick-up on a new group from boston,ma called the explosion!!!!!	negative
title: Junk Item [SEP] content: Don't spend money on this item. Total junk of an item.1. Makes a lot of noise while operating. its like your Gears are moving and then final 'Thak' kind of sound2. Sound Quality is horrible. Completely muffled3. Cheap quality of plastic.Te only good thing was fast delivery. Nothing good about this product	negative
title: The Art of Donald Trump's Accomplishments [SEP] content: This book fails to live up to its title "The Art of the Comeback." Having devoting only one full chapter on how he came back from near bankruptcy, Donald Trump fails to give his audience a proper perspective on the ingredients of coming back. His theme, like his other two books, is basically about all his acquisitions. If you truly are looking for a book about the inside secrets of negotiations, business practices, and real estate finance, don't buy this book. Instead, try to get his first book "The Art of the Deal." Now, that's a book you can learn a thing or two from.	negative
title: Not at all sufficient [SEP] content: I just got out of the test and was cursing this book the whole time. The information in this book is not even close to sufficient for what you need to know on the exam.	negative
title: Be Careful, Very Overated [SEP] content: A warning to those thinking of purchasing this DVD. I purchased it on the basis of the glowing reviews posted here. Reviews that called this flawless, brilliant, the greatest TV program ever, etc. I confess that I only watched 2 episodes before putting this one away. It is extremely disturbing. The imagery in it is grotesque, potentialy offensive, and deeply disturbing. If you are a viewer who considers anything gross that pushes the boundries of acceptability art, then you will like this show. But if you are not entertained by depressing and disturbing images and topics, stay away from this one. Many people found the movie Silence of the Lambs about a murderous cannibal "brilliant and entertaining." If you loved Silence of the Lambs you will probably love this too. Otherwise think twice before buying this title.	negative
title: The Politics of Money [SEP] content: A definitive statement from the 1980s music scene has been altered to the point of being a "new" and vastly inferior.Then embroiled in litigation over royalty payments that pitted bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake against Ozzy Osbourne, the 2002 reissue replaced the performances of the pair with bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin. The "new" album muddles the rhythm section to the point of making such incredible tracks like Crazy Train. Mr. Crowley and Goodbye to Romance sound like a medicre cover band at the corner bar on a slow Wednesday night.New fans may never hear the real music, since the original masters have been removed from the marketplace and replaced for all the wrong reasons. That an artist attempts to rewrite history is disturbing...that it cheapens what was a classic hard rock release is disgusting.	negative
title: Cheaply Made [SEP] content: This product is good theoretically but in reality is a piece of crap. Cheaply put together so that the cord would easily fall off.	negative
title: This book is the worst I've read. [SEP] content: I make candles and export them for a living. I read a lot of wax candle and gel candle making books ... ! It doesn't fit for anyone one at all, be it an amateur or an intermediate level crafter. Believe me, it's best for you to avoid buying this book. It's not worth your money and time reading.	negative
title: Great Editorials not so "great" [SEP] content: Aside from the editorials included, the writing is dry and often convoluted. The briefs on the historical periods during which these editorials were written could be improved with a little clarity on the author's part.Though this book was compiled in 1997, women are absent from this collection. Thus, this book perpetuates a subtle stereotype that women have worked for years to destroy: that "greatness" can only be achieved by or associated with men.Look to this book for a one-sided interpretation of editorial writers and history.	negative
title: bloody disaster [SEP] content: heavy handed and dull, the women were not likeable and neither was the guy, cute intro scene with the fluffy pink pen...that's about it.	negative
title: DIDN'T WORK VERY LONG [SEP] content: I was going to keep looking for this item and reorder it when it became available until I read the review from lady from Louisville, Kentucky. Just like her I had this oven for about three or four months - used it about five times and it just quit heating up. Maybe the manufacturer should look into this. I too, had thought that I may have gotten a dudd until I read her review.Diane -	negative
title: Elements burnt out after 14 months [SEP] content: Owned this toaster oven for 14 months when all of the bottom heating elements burnt out and the top ones are going too. There is no way to repair it, and the 12 month warranty is expired, so have to trash it. I do not recommend purchasing this item.	negative
title: Major rules with little league binding. [SEP] content: The rule book is pretty straight foward and easy to use but useless because of its self destructing binding. Open the book fully to a page and you're likely to lose that page as it separates from the "stick-um" type binding. This is not the handy reference guide you'd like to pack in your team bag for frequent inquiries. [....]Better still, buy a rule book in a book store where you can hold it, flip through the pages and imagine it holding up through many challenging game situations.	negative
title: Just OK [SEP] content: I ordered this book because of the good reviews, expecting a great book full of spells.There aren't many spells however, like the cover implies. Instead the author gives his knowledge of herbs, incenses and oils and what each can be used for.Spoken and Written spells seems to give a few spells worth trying, but overall, if you're looking for an actual "spell book", this isn't the one unless you like to go herb/incense/oil hunting.I returned the book the next day.	negative
title: Don't believe the hype... [SEP] content: In addition to what David wrote above, the book has no colour photos (other than in the covers) and even the historical photos aren't that many.Most of it consists of close up shots of museum and private collection exhibits. Lack of drawings is a serious disadvantage and I still don't understand why South Lebanese Army and Ugandan tanks were not covered (they were Israeli sourced and saw combat service) when Chilean Shermans get an entire chapter. To sum up, save your money for the Lioness and Lion of the Line series and leave Gannon's book to the collectors.	negative
title: I am concerned. [SEP] content: This product was the tops with us. We absolutely loved it and it saved us so much time. However, after only owning it 6 months, my 12 year old son used it and the plug started on fire. We were using a normal outdoor extension cord,He could of got electricuted.I am concerned this might happen to someone else too.And... I am not sure what to do with the machine we have.	negative
