title: Not good [SEP] content: Did not like the book really boring might be a classic .but I'm to good for this horrid book sorry	negative
title: Not Worth It, Get the Neat Instead! [SEP] content: I got the diaper genie before my daughter was born. We used it for a while, but it was very hard (not to mention unpleasent) to push the diapers down. It really took some force. The bag constantly ripped. I always had to seperately bag messy diapers because when they got pushed down, some always "escaped". I finally got so annoyed with it I didn't use it any more. We got the Neat system by Safety First at my daughters christening and it is wonderful! Not nearly as much effort to get the diapers down, much nicer looking, and much better than the genie. Save your money, go with the Neat instead!	negative
title: a waste of money [SEP] content: I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost.	negative
title: JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS! [SEP] content: I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic "flashbacks" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one "enlightened" person mentioned in the book had "higher" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible.	negative
title: Left me wanting [SEP] content: I just finished True Believer and I am so glad that I got this from the library, rather than purchasing it.It makes for an enjoyable read, but it seemed rather shallow & superficial. I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong.	negative
title: I'd give ATI NO stars if I could... [SEP] content: This company will tell you that the card is in stock... They lie to the hands that feed them. The products are good if you can get one. I am never going to give ATI my $$ again.	negative
title: Headsets Fall Apart [SEP] content: The sound was awesome - no question about it - but the headphones fell apart after 8 months. The cheap plastic used to connect the ear pieces to the head piece cracked and eventually broke, and now a sharp piece of metal sticks into my head if I ever wear them. I needed to tape them with hockey tape to hold them together.....I expect better for $300![Look in the product images for pictures of where they broke]	negative
title: The Duprees All time greatest hits CD audio [SEP] content: I ordered this audio cd for my husband who has two songs on a Doo Wop VHS of the Duprees singing his favorite two songs.Since the cover said all-time greatest hits, I thought it would be great as a gift for him.He was totally disappointed. The cd had his two favorite songs. The rest he had never heard of or they had been recorded by other singers who did a much better job of recording the songs. Not worth the price.	negative
title: Not as pictured [SEP] content: It isn't the same color as pictured, highly disappointing, and sound quality sucks. Was trying to replace a lost par of skull candy headphones, these do not compare.	negative
title: What a piece.... [SEP] content: Alright first off I was considering ordering this toaster oven off of Amazon but I figured I'd just go to Target. When I opened the box, the little rubber feet fell right out from under it. When I opened the door to place the trays in it, The door came off the hinge and refused to go back on. If anyone is even considering buying it, I suggest you completely wipe this out as an option. Yes it is [inexpensive]... but I would rather put a little more cash in to buy something of better quality.	negative
title: The author's intent was to display his error-free ego [SEP] content: Gen. Matthew Ridgeway is so full of himself that he cannot err. He is quick to point out his perfection by comparing himself to others of his calling, and although forced by history and fact to admit the other fine leaders of the 8th army did actually perform well in Korea, he is obviously reluctant to write of anything unless the sentence begins with "I". His book is garbage, and I'm ashamed to have served under him in that war.	negative
title: Not very helpful for our kids [SEP] content: This book was not helpful for us in terms of really engaging our kids, and we found the writing dry. There is a sexist streak too that won't win the hearts of mothers or daughters.	negative
title: Buy the music, read better books, live the blues... [SEP] content: I really resent the titles of the "XXXX for Dummies," since as a teacher I think it creates self-images of inadequacy... The book is OK. Man, the blues is music. Get out there, get the CDs, Hound Dog Taylor, Rev. Gary Davis, Miss. John Hurt, Muddy, etc. Listen and enjoy and support your local blues organizations and clubs. Books for dummies. Nah.	negative
title: very disappointed [SEP] content: I received the massage cushion in damaged position. The back massage portion would not work.	negative
title: Nice idea, but DOESN'T WORK [SEP] content: I agree with the person who tried this diet for 7 weeks, lost 5 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.) And if your goal is WEIGHT MAINTENANCE while eating anything you want (including pizza, chocolate, ice cream, and pasta) on a daily basis, then this book is for you. But you will NEVER NEVER NEVER lose weight with this.	negative
title: A disappointing production of a great novel [SEP] content: This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellan. The screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. The dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between Marguerite and Percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). But the worst aspect of this video is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Marguerite. Even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. Richard Grant as Percy and Martin Shaw as Chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellan in the same roles.The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the French Revolution. This 1998 A&E production does not do it justice.	negative
title: sold out [SEP] content: i think keane sold out. their first cd was amazing and this one sort of fizzled and died. if they could reconnect with whatever it was that made their first one so great, they'd be back in business.	negative
title: NO SUPPORT - STAY AWAY [SEP] content: I ordered tapered proxabrush refills. I received wide instead. I called the company left messages and no one returned the call. I did not pursue it further as it was not worth my time for a $4 item	negative
title: Sorry. This one just doesn't make it. [SEP] content: I was real disappointed when I saw this movie. It wasn't as good as Look Who's Talking, the first episode, and it was worse than Look Who's Talking Two. It was a waste of time.	negative
title: I am certain that Mr. Beckwith's intentions were pure. [SEP] content: However, I feel that one should do complete and thorough research in order for his writings to be of any benefit to the reader. I appreaciate his efforts but would recommend other sources for a true seeker of the truth.	negative
title: Very Bad Movie!! [SEP] content: This was a very very bad movie. The script was awful. The actors over acted. In many scenes they got overly emotional and cried, what was suppose to look like crying, became forced crying with no tears. Which was down right awful!!!I am sorry I don't have anything good to say about this movie!!	negative
title: Great premise, poor execution [SEP] content: I don't get it. Is it true that a book written like a high school creative writing project can get suchgreat reviews, based only on its thought-provoking premise? It seems so. Yes, the Truth Machine isa great idea. Yes, it would change the world, perhaps even more than Mr. Halperin postulates. But,this work of "speculative fiction" falls a bit short of impressive on the storytelling front. Thecharacters are one-dimensional, the plot contrived and predictable, and the dialogue wooden. As apremise for a story, it's great: recommended. As a story: read Heinlein. You won't be disappointed.	negative
title: Disappointing, sorely lacking in details [SEP] content: After reading the positive reviews on this book, I hoped this book would tell me things MSDN did not. How wrong I was. There is more information on MSDN than can be found in this book. For example, in Chapter 1, the author lists the function ExecuteInDomain, referring to Chapter 7 for details. In Chapter 7, the ExecuteInDomain function is not even mentioned. Also, the author often leaves out crucial details that would allow you to actually understand the point he is trying to make.	negative
title: the partial image of a ghost of a story [SEP] content: I am a simple man. And when I read a story, I would like to have the entire story before me, and not be forced to go to the internet to find the rest of it!!!!!!!This volume, incredibly, omits the third and final chapter of "A Jolly Corner"! It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion."Washington Square" is the only truly great work in the collection. I loved it.I rate it a one because surely a person can read these stories on the internet in their complete form.	negative
title: Norah Let me Down [SEP] content: In Summary - Pretty Lame.She should stick to what she does well - singing other peopls songs.This one doesnt sound like the previous albums, doesnt show case Norah's voice. Just a rich brat complaining.	negative
title: A lot of interesting stuff not here [SEP] content: C;mon Sire! There's way more interesting stuff than this! Where is "Ave Maria" by West India Company or "Stop!" by Data or "Close Your Eyes" by Deborah Harry or "Uncertain Smile" by The The or "Big Hollow Man" by Danielle Dax.	negative
title: did not work [SEP] content: After all the good reviews I thought I was going to get a quality toy... I guess it's a gamble.. Ours worked for a few minutes then stopped working.. Batteries replaced but no luck... Paid full price and shipping so I wasn't pleased.	negative
title: Not worth your time [SEP] content: The two best things I can say about this movie are 1) it is very short, and 2) I rented it so can return it asap. I don't watch movies like this for the plot (good thing!) or the cast, but for the special effects. Which in this case means a whole lot of camera shaking. It makes no sense, there are way too many holes in it, and what in the world is up with Judd Nelson's hair?	negative
title: Waste of Time [SEP] content: Starting homeschooling my 4, 8 & 6 year olds and was wondering what to teach when they need to learn things and where can I find this information. This book did not contain that information is lists books and other information that you can find your self online or in basic homeschooling books. So its just sitting on my shelf collecting dust.	negative
title: Mount incompatible with other Kidde alarms [SEP] content: I bought this alarm hoping it would be an upgrade from the EXTREMELY poor-quality Kidde alarms that came with our house (they are supposedly 3 years old but most have already failed catastrophically - they are Kidde 0915 if you are in the same situation). However, the mounting hardware is incompatible with those alarms, so I have to take down the old mounts in order to use my new alarms. This is frankly an enormous pain and makes me think I was a chump to go with Kidde again. I would have picked another, better brand if I hadn't thought I could use the old mounting hardware with the new alarms.I'm still not sure whether I want to return these or not - still deciding - but in any case don't buy these if you already have Kidde detectors in your house and you think sticking with the same brand will make things easier. It won't.	negative
title: I would have given it a 0. [SEP] content: This has got to be the worst Star Wars book ever.I swear it was a chore reading it.The characters acted nothing like the ones we have come to love(i.e.Luke manipulating his image in Han's mind),they felt like total strangers!The description sounded good,the book could've been good, alas it sucked.Keep away from this book.It will feel like you are doing a chore reading it;save your time and go read a Zahn or Anderson novel.	negative
title: What is so funny? [SEP] content: Please look the back of the DVD cover and see if they have subtitles or CC (Closed Captions). I am deaf and want to read what they are saying.I appreicated it and thank you.	negative
title: Future of Metal, What a joke [SEP] content: These guys are terrible, theyre decent musicians but that doesnt make them a good bandthey are pretty much a second rate metallica clone with some of the worst vocals evermetallcore is becoming the new, nu-metal	negative
title: Each book just gets worse... [SEP] content: I remember the "good old days" when picking up a new Clancy book was an event to look forward to. But now I find myself dreading the first few pages on any new Clancy volume, especially after the disaster that was Rainbow Six.It seems that as the threat of the cold war recedes, Tom finds it more difficult to develop interesting storylines which are relevant (and realistic). It was always Tom's portrayal of the battle or espionage, and the realpolitik which motivates governments and the military alike, which captured my imagination.I can't maintain interest in a thousand page book if it reads like a soap opera!	negative
title: Huge letdown [SEP] content: I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent "uplifting" family film, opt for "The Sandlot."	negative
title: Glad the hype is OVER! [SEP] content: This CD is ok but doesn't draw much attention - especially after the nauseating overkill exposure it received. Hasn't anyone ever heard mindless pop before? However, "Puffy Little Shoes" is both pixilated and intriguing, a recherche moue of a tiny tune. But let's just say "enough" to the Michael Jacksons of Seattle music, ok? Thank you.	negative
title: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT [SEP] content: I should have heeded the warnings of reviews on previous versions of this movie. Or maybe I just had too high of expectations for this compilation. Whatever the reason was, I felt a little "let down" when i finally viewed this DVD. I have been wanting to see one of these movies for about 15 years now since they started the tour. I was intrigued by the name "sick and twisted animation" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an "official grown-up" now it wasn't. I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats. If you like a guy named Bill Plympton, then maybe you will like this as several of the sketches are from him, otherwise I have to give this a big thuymbs down.	negative
title: Dreadful [SEP] content: Frodo gets into trouble, Frodo gets out of trouble, Frodo gets into trouble, Frodo gets out of trouble, and so on, and so on, and so on...Put in some nice special effects and support it with booming sound and you have the so-called "masterpiece" LOTR.	negative
title: Liked their original formula better [SEP] content: I had been using their original cleaner premixed in the little plastic jars and loved it for years so I ordered several of these little packets for my daughter and I. It is not the same. It cleans well, but the formula gets very thick and gel-like very fast with thick clumps so that you have to add hot water. I used a brand new container just once on diamond studs and then two weeks later went to use it again, and it was all thick and cloudy and gross looking.	negative
title: Sadly Not Well Made. [SEP] content: I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do. For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.It is very pretty though.	negative
title: This book is a piece of... [SEP] content: You will not know what I mean untill you buy and use this book. It is not meant for first semester students as the review mentioned. It sucks...examples are so hard, and approach used in the book in so difficult to understand	negative
title: I resent what this implies! [SEP] content: Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected "just for me?" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway.	negative
title: Will not work on PS3!!!! [SEP] content: I was really disappointed to find out that this edition of the film will not work on the ps3. Being that the PS3 is the only blu-ray player I own, this movie was unwatchable for me.	negative
title: you get what you pay for [SEP] content: For $5.oo don't expect good quality. My 4 yo liked it but got tired of it. It has 3 voice settings which pretty much sounded the same to me.The only thing I like about this product is that it's size is perfect for my 4yo son. Not really a good bday present ..but could be a good bday party treat.	negative
title: "I felt like I was visiting Milwaukee, my hometown." [SEP] content: I enjoyed reading the descriptions of Milwaukee flavored by a bit of history. I especially appreciated the dining spots of Milwaukee. It brought back many memories. Since I am an old Nancy Drew fan, I felt Beth was Nancy as a mature detective.	negative
title: It's all about the PICTURES!!! [SEP] content: I love this book because of it's pictures. It demonstrates which primary and secondary muscles are being workied during various exercises, which is pretty neat. Other than that, it isn't very useful. It doesn't provide good routines or workouts that best develop those very areas it demonstrates. Thus, it's not a good workout book, just a nice reference. It's nice to have, but not necessary. Buy it if you like pictures, but don't waste the money if you can only afford one book.	negative
title: never seems to completely absorb [SEP] content: After buying the day and night creams, I was terribly disappointed.I hated the feel of this cream/serum. Maybe I'm using it wrong; everybody else seems to like it. I tried it for two weeks, and after it finally dried it left a sticky, filmy layer on my skin.I have combination skin, and am in my 50's, I didn't expect a miracle, but it never seemed to completely absorb. Wasted my money!	negative
title: nice nail clippers... [SEP] content: the only thing that I use is the nail clippers, and because it has the white attachment is easy to find. My child has never take or will ever take any kind of medication so the spoon and the dropper are compleatly useless. The nose thing is too small and the thermometer I have never use it since she has never being sick.	negative
title: I HATE IT, WORTHLESS PLUG [SEP] content: I REGRET SPENDING 7.00 DOLLARS BUYING THIS PLUG FROM WAL-MART. I DIDN'T NEED A NEW PLUG, MY 128L HUSQVARNA WEED TRIMMER WAS WORKING JUST FINE. HOWEVER AFTER READING THE PACKAGING I THOUGHT HUMM, MAYBE I WILL SWITCH MY RCJ8Y CHAMP..PLUG OUT WITH THIS E3.12 SPARK PLUG. WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE WITH THIS NEW E3.12 PLUG I HAD TO REMOVE IT AND REINSTALL THE OLD PLUG. (RCJ8Y)SPARK PLUG. TO FINISH THE JOB. THE NEXT DAY I DECIDED BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW I WOULD GIVE THE E3.12 SPARK PLUG A SECOND CHANCE. WELL, THE OUT COME WAS THE SAME, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE MY 128L WEED TRIMMER WOULD CUT OFF AS IF IT WAS CHOKED OFF. THEN WOULD NOT RESTART. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, AND WILL ADVISE ALL FRIENDS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SPARK PLUG.IT IS POSSIBLE I HAVE A FACTORY DEFECTIVE PLUG BUT....IM NOT SPENDING THE MONEY TO TRY A SECOND ONE. I SEE SOME PEOPLE HAS WROTE GOOD REVIEWS, I AM NOT KNOCKING THEIR STORIES.	negative
title: Blah! What is this?! [SEP] content: If their is one CD I don't like in this world, this is it! The lyrics are poor and the songs are just plain annoying!! They can't sing at all and it's all I hear on the radio! Avoid it!	negative

title: Knock-off book printed in black & white on low grade paper. [SEP] content: My rating refers to the quality of the item delivered, not the content of the textbook itself, read on for details.I ordered this book through Amazon.com, LLC hoping to avoid the many low quality counterfeit textbooks shipped by many third party sellers. When I opened the box, the packing slip said "Principles of Fluid Mechanics, [Hardcover]" but the textbook was just what I wanted to avoid. The cover was flimsy paper, the entire content of the textbook was printed in black and white on what looked like extremely cheap recycled paper.I thought it had to be an error, so I called Amazon and requested an exchange. Lo and behold, the replacement item was the exact same low quality item. I ended up paying $50 LESS to get an actual hardcover from a third party seller on the site. I hope Amazon.com, LLC will look into their supplier and fix the issue soon. Until then, they are charging $150 for a product that is NOT as described.	negative
title: DO NOT BUY THIS EVER [SEP] content: This is a complete waste of money; the thing just does not work at all. The software is good but I could not get my computer to recognize the drive. The bottom line - buy something else	negative
title: What is this? [SEP] content: What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying "we're trying new ways", "this is our best album so far", "we do what gives us pleasure". One only needs to compare it with "Moving Picture", "Permanent Waves" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!	negative
title: How's Reverend Moon Doing? [SEP] content: Rev. Moon, the guy the republicans don't want you to know about is the man "With The Plan" according to Poppy Bush- maybe his divine guidance helped shape Dumbya's economic miracle. Afterall, Moon says he's the REAL messiah! What else could explain the oceans of lies spun out by the winger think tanks and reported as gospel truth if divine intervention isn't involved? Find out more- google "Moon Primer".	negative
title: A BIG disappointment [SEP] content: I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might "come back to life". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the "living dead" have about as much personality as a zombie from a "B" movie.	negative
title: just don't [SEP] content: the voice actors were all a great choice! The rest just don't put yourself through the pain of watching it just re-read the books :)	negative
title: I didn't like it at all [SEP] content: I'm not really anti Bill Phillips like some other reviewers and I don't know his history. I bought this book, followed the technique to a key and felt worse after. I have a feeling it was the supplements because I never had such headaches just from working out, and I've been working out for years. Somethings I did find annoying like the "late night infomercial" tone through most of the book and each page had the e-commerce website on it six times. I will give credit to Mr. Phillips ability to motivate people but I'm not convinced Anthony Robbins won't do a better job for you.	negative
title: Not Enough Depth [SEP] content: This book falls into the category of books that provide a survey of a field, useful for a beginner but certainly not for an advanced network administrator or cabling installer. For example, I needed to send instructions to an electrician at a remote site in Alaska on basic cabling techniques so that he could set up a small LAN using best practices. Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee.	negative
title: Still Waiting... [SEP] content: I ordered this in the middle of March. If it takes much longer, it will miss the whole Spring season... Sure would be nice to have what I paid for. What in the world takes so long to mail a magazine?	negative
title: A way to get started (and frustrated) with a TabletPC [SEP] content: I've had my machine for almost a year now. It has gone back for trackpad problems once. In addition the CMOS battery was replaced, the case was cracking and it was replaced as well. It was fixed in a timely manner, but it is now doing the same thing. The machine is noisy, hot and the battery life is horrible. I bought it as a cheap way to get into a tablet. I'm convinced of the value of having a tablet; I just need to get a better tablet. If you get one, get an extended warranty.	negative
title: You get only 10% of what you want to know about the breed [SEP] content: This book should only cost 10% of its price, because only 10% of its content is actually devoted to the American Bulldog breed. Don't blame the author, though. As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is "standard" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% "standard" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed. YOU CAN GET MORE VALUABLE information from the few good web sites in the internet.	negative
title: Not literature [SEP] content: Red this book at the request of a colleague. I can see why he liked it, simplistic solutions for very complicated problems, much like ... Well then, a quick read, nothing complicated here, and an alright story but fails a deep understanding and complexity of societies problems. Read the history of places where prisoners have been dumped, e.g. Georgia & Australia, and as Paul Harvey says, "Here is the rest of the story."	negative
title: Amityville 3(3D) [SEP] content: My beef isn't with it not being "3D" but with how boring and awful it is,the only spooks you get is scattered, You got this guy who is a "Skeptic" well needless to say so much for him being a skeptic and gets what he deserves for being so dumb,naive and stubborn or "skeptic". (In the movie of course), Lori Loughlin(Full House), An ever Annoying as Always Meg Ryan(Why couldn't she die in the movie?) and apparently a hot well/fountain in the basement. You want scares Try part 1 with Uber-Liberal Pansy and Stressiand Bum James Brolin and Part 2 With Burt Young(Convoy,Pig Pen) all the other movies after really are a disservice.	negative
title: not made of driftwood [SEP] content: please read the description carefully,,,,this is not made out of wood but made out of resin in china....it is heavy enough but not hand sculpted or even scuplted at all.....for that reason i am dissappointed...I am not sure why they put driftwood in the name of this product but for that reason i feel deceived and dissappointed....this product is not what i was expecting at all....	negative
title: Farfetched [SEP] content: The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched. Everything they do to trap the killer is pathetic. The trip to Italy and changing the newspapers in the web is hilarious. The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way.	negative

title: Do not buy this product [SEP] content: This product is useless.It is a box with a blue light that turns on and off. It does not produce that "ion" smell that all other ionizers produce, it did not make my car smell any different even after running it for a week (my car does not need to be turned on for 12v to work), and it makes no sound or any other indication that it is doing anything besides shinning a blue light.I stuck two of these things into both 12v ports in my car, left it for a week and nothing. I stuck my nose to it while on and it smelled no different than when it was off.Do not buy this product.	negative
title: comprehensive cytopathology: expert consult: online and print [SEP] content: I bought this book from Manhattan Media Mart about $250 and cannot access the online version. Since this book from the Saint Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, which was bankrupcy in 2010. So I only have a book and do not have online access to this book. I was not very happy about this. Next I will buy a new book so that I can access online and it only cause $30 more.	negative
title: Don't do it!! [SEP] content: If I could give a negative review for this I would. The hard drive worked fine up until yesterday when I tried to access it, and couldn't find it in the list! I had no way of accessing the drive. I tried everything - from rebooting my computer, turning the drive on and off, changing usb ports, and plugging it into a wall socket. NOTHING worked! I started google-ing around and found that other people had the same problem, and there wasn't really a solution for it. I even tried calling tech support, but they didn't want to help me unless I paid them $40 since my warranty for the drive was up. Now my only option is to open that sucker up and to put it into a new enclosure. Hopefully that will work or else all my stuff is lost! :(	negative
title: Boring [SEP] content: I own this and thought I would like it much more than I did. The acting is very good but it is very boring and I almost fell asleep. Maybe I'm too young--40 to remember it but I found it slow and boring.	negative
title: It stopped stopping! [SEP] content: After 1.5 years, this automatic tea kettle, which I use every day, stopped automatically turning off at a rolling boil. Indeed, I came into the kitchen and saw a shorted cabinet light because of the moisture from the steam. My fear is, if I completely forgot about it (which happens when I'm focused on my work) it my melt, destroy itself or worse!	negative
title: Was not the edition I needed [SEP] content: I had searched by ISPN number and this book came up so I ordered it. Upon reciept of the book, I realized it was a very old edition and useless to me.	negative
title: still waiting for a response [SEP] content: it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar...	negative
title: Doesnt work [SEP] content: Just received machine today, very excited put it together followed directions and machine doesnt even turn on, yes that is what i said heating element didnt turn on, spinner didnt turn, motor didnt turn on. Machine has two off and on switches and one light on one switch lit up but nothing worked.If you buy this machine do yourself a favor and plug it in to see if it works before you go through the trouble of assembling it.	negative
title: Extremely juvenile [SEP] content: Maybe naive, left-leaning undergrads who have never had to really work will find this amusing.I wonder how many of the "working people" (most everyone I know works) that Moore claims to champion have any interest in reading this or agree with Moore.Moore fails as a humorist and as a political pundit.	negative
title: Jensen JTH940 - BAD WIRE [SEP] content: This was an Open Box purchase. Probably was returned because it was defective. Sound was very scratchy when plugged in. The molding on plug prevented it from fully inserting into the cell phone jack (LG 220C flip phone).I trimmed the molding (which made the headset non-returnable) and discovered the the problem is a bad connection within the molded plug. I have read other reviews who had the same problem after a few months.When the sound worked, the ear phone was great. The ear cushion was comfortable.Never got a chance to test the microphone.I liked the sound well enough that I plan to replace the plug to get it to work.Plan on replacing this headset every few months due to defective wiring.	negative
title: Hot Heart Massager [SEP] content: I realy liked them. My wife realy likes them with the lotion.The only problem I have with them is that they do'nt last very long after about 10 times of boiling them they do not work any more. Other then that they are great.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: I am surely a Shakespeare fan but want to consciously decide to watch a Shakespearean production. Here, I thought I was watching a drama-filled action movie...hardly. Gets a 1 for hiding the reality of the director's direction.	negative
title: A Sham [SEP] content: The essential truth of this book is that it is a lie. If he lied about things that can be verified, then what else? To say it's okay to lie to help people is tantamount to saying the ends justifies the means. Frey and those that support him should be ashamed and if he is the man he claims to be, he should come clean. I will never read anything he writes again.	negative
title: Doesn't keep things hot [SEP] content: I may have just have gotten a bad one, but the one I recently purchased does not keep things hot. I have poured freshly made steaming hot coffee into the Thermocafe multiple times and within an hour it is barely warm. Since the job of the thermos is to keep things hot, I am considering this to be a complete product failure.	negative
title: Worth the shipping?? [SEP] content: Even though it looks nice with the silver w810i, this case has drawbacks. Namely thin and fragile. The clips don't close snug and the case scratches easy. I bought a black case that is nicely sturdy, thicker, and snug fit. So I would recommend paying a little more for a colored case.	negative
title: Trash [SEP] content: I ordered 3 of these and none of them worked for me. Worked about 5 minutes and then cuts out.Save your money.	negative
title: Wrong! Wrong ! Wrong! [SEP] content: Just recently move to Memphis 3 weeks ago from St.Louis and The Pizza he said was the best here was the absolute worst. I was so dissapointed and angry. I don't know where he got his info whether he did a survey or actually tasted himself either way the info was just plain wrong a waste of my time and money.	negative
title: Not Practical [SEP] content: We really tried to live green by buying this product, but there are several problems with it. First, it takes way too long to mow the lawn with this. Second, it's extremely hard to push this around, it just doesn't mow easily, it's a clunker. Third, you have to go over each section several times to get it even. Fourth, if you haven't given up and get done mowing, you then have to rake up all the grass clippings. I don't recommend it. We ended up buying an electrical mower. It's faster and easier. We also like the electric mower more than a gas powered mower because it's quieter and it doesn't use gas, two big pluses.	negative
title: Who Cares? [SEP] content: I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written.	negative
title: Piece of junk [SEP] content: The motion detector went out after only two sets of bulbs in these lights. Given not only the cost of the light but the cost of having an electrician install it, I'm furious. Avoid this light at all costs - looks nice, but is a piece of junk.	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: After having read a fair number of John Irving's earlier novels, I was disappointed with the cardboard characters in this one and the endless elaboration on pointless details. Not once did I get to feel any identification with the main characters. I literally struggled through the 500+ pages of the hardback version.Apart from Toronto, Maine and LA, the book describes scenes in Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Zurich and Mr Irving has gone through great pains to insert local insiders info, rendering the book into something of a tourist guide. The author indulges here in a writer's trick to add interestingness to the novel, which I found irritating.The subject matter is fashionable, and only that, and as thin as the paper is was printed on.I would not recommend this novel.	negative
title: Atonal Amelia [SEP] content: Amelia's trademark is taking all directions literally without applying reason. This time she has the insane notion that she's going to play in the school band. Naturally she bollixes up the works and the show ends on a sour note - literally, thanks to Amelia's blundering miscalculations. Since baking is her strength, perhaps the conductor will relent if he eats some of her desserts.	negative
title: Ho-hum... another Larry Clark something-or-other [SEP] content: Yeah, yeah, great performances all the way around...how could you miss with such a great cast? But one-hit-wonder director Larry "Kids" Clark proves with his pedestrian direction that he's got nothing interesting to say. Feelings of deja vu saturate this film. You've seen it all before. If anything, Clark proves that being an indie filmmaker is no guarantee of talent.	negative
title: 5 minute treat [SEP] content: The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix. Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear. If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.	negative
title: disappointing [SEP] content: Not only was the quality of the video very poor, but it wasn't even the right video. I do not recommend this product to anyone and hope that the seller is ashamed of this blatent false advertising.	negative
title: don't buy [SEP] content: This item came in a sealed bag but when opened it was greasy like it had already been used and it was dented. Don't waste your time and money on this inferior product.	negative
title: doormat [SEP] content: I had this exact same mat before and it lasted me well over 5 years. This one seems to be old and brittle, the coir is already separating from the backing, and there was a big cut in the top of the mat. I had already thrown the box away, and it wasn't worth sending back, but I will not purchase from you again.	negative
title: Nothing to write home about [SEP] content: I am off to Cancun in 2 months. Never been there, so I wanted to "check things out" in advance. I bought this and Frommers Guide. I was not impressed by either one. Fodor's was especially short on info in my opinion. The Cancun section was rather small overall. I have found better information just surfing the internet. They give you some very basic descriptions and price guides, but no recommendations. I have never been there... that is what I need! Which tour is best, which ruins should I see, etc, etc. I got NONE of that! Frommers was a little better in that they gave you more diverse information, but no real recommendations. I will see if I can find something better than both of these before my trip. If you must choose between these two popular travel guides, go with Frommers.	negative
title: I've been a diehard fan for 16 years... [SEP] content: ...and I don't care for this album. There are some parts that sound pretty cool, like the beginning of the 1st song, but throughout most of the songs Deborah just overdoes it. It's disappointing, but even Mark McGuire doesn't hit a homerun at every at-bat. Hoping for better next time...	negative
title: Well-woven masterpiece [SEP] content: Mellon Colloe is the ultimate Pumpkins album. I prefer the hard songs to the ballads, but my god; Corgan sure can craft some songs. Best songs: "Tonight", "Bullet W/ButterFly Wings" and "Ode to No One".Salut!	negative
title: Awkward and trite, too many cliches for me. [SEP] content: While the subject matter of "The Last Dive" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing. Chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. I came away disliking the "cowboy-like" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. Chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. Unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever.	negative
title: Have not read the book [SEP] content: I will admit upfront that I have not read nor will I read this book. But let me say this about R.C. Sproul.He's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - Calvinism.The Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in the U.S. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of Sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.Calvin was wrong from the beginning and Sproul was wrong to take his God-given mind and use it to try to prop up Calvinism.I will say again, Calvin was wrong from the start. The Holy Spirit is nowhere present in the writings of Calvin anymore than He is present in the writings of Sproul because the Holy Spirit is not the Spirit of division and untruth.What a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not Jesus Christ but John Calvin.	negative
title: This book is a total crock. Let me explain why. [SEP] content: This book is a total crock, my reasoning being (1.) I am sick and tired of the author of books like these being non-religious and forced into believeing there is a God and there is a message in the Bible. (2.) In the book, words kept on suddenly popping up after something didn't come true, or wasn't different. (3.) The guy is a reporter supposedly. He is constantly flying out to the Middle East and finding messages in the Bible, so when is he ever reporting? (maybe he works for one of those tabloids...?). This is like the old 'When is Jesse Jackson ever at a church?' question. I gave this book 1 star, only because I can't go lower. Don't waste your money on it.	negative
title: DREADFUL!! [SEP] content: For those of you who rated this one highly, here's one of ....We have a bent lawyer who unknowingly has 2 CIA agents posing in his office. There are a multitude of hidden cameras filming the lawyer day and night and yet when he goes to the prison the CIA only put a mic in his briefcase which ... is supposed to be as big as a golf ball in this day and age. All the time reading it I was thinking, why haven't they wired him all over? A team of crack CIA operatives are watching this pathetic drunk and yet he eludes him - but still ... for some unfathomable reason. while the real 'crooks' somehow don't get knocked off by the CIA and in the bargain get 2 million dollars each. It's bloody rubbish!!! And childish. In fact, the plot would insult a 12 year old.No star. Dreadful!!	negative
title: Nahhhh............... [SEP] content: Not even close to Dark Side of the Moon, Animals or The Wall, this album shows the Dark Side of PF -packing together 23 minutes of lame sound effects with a couple chords and calling it "an epic song" (also known as Echoes). Same can be said of the rest of the album. Oh well, they were good musicians indeed -but anybody can have a faux pas.	negative
title: good timin [SEP] content: This dvd has the songs you remember as a teenager during this era. All the wilson brothers are together along with mike love. This dvd gives you a good feeling and can be watched time and time again. The dts sound is great and the picture quality is good.	negative
title: Thought we had a winner [SEP] content: Bought this for my daughter last year, she loved(s) it. But about 2 months ago the blue light went so faint you can't use it. A few weeks later, the green light faded. Now we can only uses the red, which she doesn't like. I took it apart looking for a way to change the bulb, completely enclosed. Checked the reviews online, found out there is no way to change the bulbs. Went and bought the brand name this time for Christmas.	negative
title: the silly book [SEP] content: it is not a good book , because it is boring . but some of my friends think it is interesting . But i'm not . the beginning was boring but later in the book it was exciting too .	negative
title: For the rest of us... [SEP] content: Any book from InstallShield will target, market and promote the use of InstallShield's packaging tools. I've found the range of books from InstallShield to only contain approximately 30% of useful material for those not contemplating using InstallShield's development tools.The only book which had a generic focus on Windows Installer has been Mike Gunderloy's book. I say "had" because it is no longer in print.If you are not planning to commit your investment in Installshield's products, I would not recommend any book from InstallShield Corporation given cost and the overall content which will be applicable to your MSI development efforts.	negative
title: totally preposterous but entertainng pseudo-scienceI [SEP] content: If you believe in ghosts and fairies, this is the book for you. For me, it is immensely fascinating how seemingly rational persons go for this pseudo-scientific nonsense. I give it 2 stars, not zero, because it's entertaining in its own absurdity.	negative
title: BAH!!!BOOOOO!!!!!:( [SEP] content: All thumbs down I was supposed to read this book for ms. Pilat in Boston, but I didnt, I read two chapters and quit It was horrible, and I say BAH!!!!!!!!!BAH!!!!!!!and a BOOOOOOOO!!!!!	negative
title: Hope you enjoy ironing [SEP] content: Wow, these jeans come out of the dryer more wrinkled than any other pair of jeans that I own. I am hoping if I wash them enough times, they will be more forgiving. We'll see.	negative
title: a rip off [SEP] content: Received my phone and connected it and everytime I used it, you could hear beeping on the line. Emailed the company wanted to exchange for another phone. They said they dont do that, I needed to send the phone back. I called them hoping to get a different reply, and asking about the shipping cost.She said it would depend on the condition of the phone, the phone was brand new, I tried to explain to her that the phone was defective. I sent the phone back and they refunded me for just the cost of the phone. I paid more in shipping charges then what I paid for the phone.	negative
title: Disappointing..... [SEP] content: I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer.	negative
title: Dont bother [SEP] content: Of the 15 or so games I own for the X-box this is the only one I think is a total loss. This game held my interest for all of about 5 minutes. And the "Multiplayer" games that you have to first unlock by beating tracks in single player mode are a complete joke. Dont waste your hard earned money on this one.	negative
title: TERRIBLE ACTING [SEP] content: This movie could have been good, but the acting was SO bad I turned it off after 20 minutes (I can't even believe I watched it that long) I was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but COULD not even get into any of the characters. I don't recommend this movie.	negative
title: leaks, leaks, leaks, [SEP] content: In the long term, a year or less expect this coffee maker to leak....everywhere. The dial indicator will fog up and will not be able to read it. We have the red one. Looks great on the counter, but the metal will begin to rust...yes rust..and corrode around the bottom (where it meets the plastic. So off to find another one....any suggestions?Mr. Coffee blew it this time.Beautiful on the outside, but worthless on the inside.	negative
title: 1 Evil band. Parents BECAREFUL. [SEP] content: the vocals are awful... i have listened to their other albums and it pretty much is the same stuff, they simply can't get heavyand fast with their material.all of their vocalists are not clean but rather rough and scratchy; they all sing like cookie monster. i have seen infernus without corpsepaint and quite frankly the man is ugly. twilight of the idols is just a cool title for there album/cd but this band stinks. they travel to latin american countries for many of there concerts because they can't get an american tour. Conclusion, you are better off going to Karaoke night at the local club as compared to seeing these negative satanist nazi bozos trying to lure your son or daughter in into their world of hell, of the devil. the members are evil satanists. PARENTS DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE.	negative
title: Senseless Drivel [SEP] content: Even though the book is a rework of a previous work of his, I can only pray that he did not really write this piece of trash. This book was a complete waste of time. Thank god it read fast because of the short chapters.Patterson should stick to Alex Cross novels. I can't believe this book is still in the top fifteen of the New York Times bestseller list.	negative
title: Waste of money [SEP] content: When I received this item, part of the black coating (powder coating?) was already coming off around the area that was drilled for the lock. Upon attempting to install the fuel door, I discovered that the lock would not close onto the lock plate without significant trimming of the lock plate. So far I have turned the lock plate, which comes from the factory shaped like a 'C', into an 'L', and it looks like I will have to thin out the vertical section of the 'L' even more to get the lock to close. So much so as to worry me about whether the lock plate will hold together at all.	negative
title: Baaaad [SEP] content: I haven't received my products anymore! Gonna get the responsable people and sue them!!!! I wrote to Amazon but haven't hear anything from them!!!	negative
title: Not as good as I hoped [SEP] content: These little seed things dried out too quickly, and did not give the yield I got from more traditional seed starters. The ease of use was not worth it.	negative
title: Sadly, it fits but it doesn't work [SEP] content: It fits, but it doesn't work, don't buy this, buy a real HDMI to DVI-D cable if you want to play a video game console con your computor monitor	negative
title: o god give it up [SEP] content: ok people. lets get this straight. GOOD CHARLOTTE ARE FAKE, WANNABE, RADIO-FRIENDLY, POP. they are not punk. if u want real punk buy M.I.A. The Complete Anthology by the germs. i am sick of all these people who do nothing but shop at hot topic and pretend they are punk. REAL PUNK IS ANGER. THIS PUNK IS FASHION.DESTROY EVERYTHING!	negative
title: Prices are too high and different colors different prices--Rip OFF! [SEP] content: These items are selling for different prices--It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price--what a cheat!	negative
title: leak [SEP] content: It doesn't leak at the beginning. After freeze and we try to warm the milk in hot water, it just leak. :-(	negative
title: I was an extra in this movie [SEP] content: I got paid $35.00 for 12 hours work. Brad Davis pushed me in the critical student protest scene. I'm the one in the blue sweater.	negative
title: Not new [SEP] content: This was clearly refurbished. The pink plates didn't even match and some of them were worn and dirty looking. It's also set with Cingular backgrounds and logos, I have T-Mobile. Didn't like that either. If they sell something for 100.00 and say it's new, it should be new!	negative
title: Power Failure and Poor Focusing in Low Light [SEP] content: My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras).	negative
title: Just arrived and no worky worky. [SEP] content: Drawer does not open and close. Brand new out of the box. Haven't even tried to see if the microwave works but it looks like I made a bad decision. Now on a brand new appliance I have to call for service and that does not look good from here.Do not buy this product!	negative
title: Underpowered [SEP] content: I owned the predecesssor to this model which was a 12 volt rechargable which hung on the wall in its recharger. the plastic impeller came apart (bad plastic or design) and tried to buy the part. I couldn't do it so I bought this 18 volt cordless model. it has considerably less power than the 12 volt, which had a battery about twice the size of the 18.volt. I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model. Only consider this machine if you have a small area to do and nothing very heavy to blow.	negative
title: This game rocks! [SEP] content: I'd been playing AOE1 before this and it was one of the best games I'd encountered. This one totally blows it away. Better graphics, more tech capabilities and better civilization armies make this game worth every penny. For all those reviewers on this site who say stick with another game (Warcraft or Seven Kingdoms or whatnot), give AOE2 a chance.	positive
title: Highly recommended reading for students of Buddhism. [SEP] content: Gay Watson, et.al. edit The Psychology Of Awakening, which provides an important survey of Buddhism and science in daily lives. Essays consider Buddhist influences in psychology and social settings alike.	positive
title: Pregnancy + back 'N Belly = Better Sleep [SEP] content: This is my first pregnancy and I was glad i decided to invest in this. Sure I still don't sleep the whole night through because of nightly potty breaks but that's pretty much what I wake up for not because a pillow slips out of bed or aching hips. Occasionally I'll wake up to turn over, but it so much easier to get comfortable again without adjusting a zillion pillows. I had some trouble with the seam at the top of the pillow at first, but after breaking the pillow in a little it doesn't bother me. I remedied the problem at first by sleeping with the pillow upside down. I thought the purchase was way worth it.	positive
title: Beautiful Writing Held me by the Throat! [SEP] content: Anne Rice deserves all the fame and fortune she's accumulated! Interview with the Vampire is storytelling at its finest. I'm not a huge fan of horror, but she drew me in on the very first page, making me care about Louis, the vampire struggling with his humanity. Her language is visual, beautiful and original. Rice surprises, while making you believe. And she leaves you with a satisfying twist. A very satisfying read.	positive
title: Best deal for the price! [SEP] content: The Gleim CPA audio cd's are the best deal for the price you pay. I just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam and all I did was listen to the cd's on my way to work in the morning. I didn't use any other study materials. I highly recommend this product.	positive
title: One of the best albums ever! [SEP] content: After such a great first album, I was worried about their sophomore album not living up to my expectations, but I'm happy to say that they far exceeded them. This is one of the best Christian albums I have ever heard. Every song is full of spiritual vision and power, very uplifting. I have listened to this album non-stop since I purchased it and I'm still not tired of it.	positive
title: works for me... [SEP] content: I am very satisfied with this product so far. Ironically, about ten minutes after I put on the keyboard cover, I spilled my drink on my computer. Nothing got in my keyboard :). The cover comes folded up in a little box and takes a few days to fully straighten out, but other than that it definitely serves its purpose...	positive
title: A Great Book! [SEP] content: This is a must-have for dog owners and fanciers alike! I bought this with my birthday money, and the humorous text urged me to snatch it from the shelves. It's a book to read when in the bowels of "Dog Ownwer Despair". If you love or like dogs, this is a book you NEED to have!	positive
title: Very good, very personal [SEP] content: Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's "Straight up" and "Wish you were here" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. "Golders Green" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. "Dawn" is a beutiful Psych ballad,"Makes me feel so good" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.	positive
title: Fantastic! [SEP] content: Excellent so far - I have only begun reading it, but it is very good and I know will continue to be based upon the author and his experience. Highly recommended to any serious strength/bodybuilding athlete.	positive
title: A classic [SEP] content: Many people think this album was the last of Nofx's ability to label themselves as punk rock and retain a sense of dignity. I happen to disagree with these people. Anyhoo, this album is a real classic. It's when Nofx really got there s..tuff together. Fat Mikes story telling seems much more fine tuned in Punk in Drublic than in more recent things. Contains tons of energy and clever lyrics. Anyways, to summurize:This is one of the best punk albums ever and if you don't like this...you probably don't like punk. But don't feel bad....punk doesn't like you either.	positive
title: OMG!! HILARIOUS isnt the word!!!!! [SEP] content: If you want to have a fun night of laughing til it hurts, then you need to get this Jeff Dunham DVD!! I never heard of him, but a friend recommended the DVD, and OH MY GOSH, it was soooo hilarious. He is not a 'raunchy' comedian/vantriliquist. He doesnt have to use profanity like others do to get the crowd going. Jeff Dunham ROCKS!!!!! Both of his DVD's are awesome. Get them both!!!Jeff Dunham - Arguing With MyselfJeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity	positive
title: Well worth the cost [SEP] content: I bought this for my daughter and grandson. They live by the beach and she puts all her beach "stuff" in the wagon including her son, Joey, and wheels it to where they will sit on the sand. She says the wagon wheels are great on the sand and Joey loves the ride.Radio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagon	positive
title: Thin, light and stylish [SEP] content: I got this watch to replacethis guyand I'm satisfied. The Timex is too large and heavy for my wrist: the metal band couldn't get small enough and the heavy watch always made its presence known. The Skagen is also noticeably quieter than the Timex. Why?The Skagen is thin and light and I have gotten several unsolicited comments about its attractiveness. I was surprised to see that the numerals are raised and lined in silver, not outlined in white as it seems from the photo.The calendar will be too small for people with bad eyes, the band is a bit complicated to do and undo (it becomes easier with practice) and you have to use a screwdriver to change the size of the band.	positive
title: comprehensiveand factual [SEP] content: I'm a huge Doors fan, particularly Jim Morrson. I've read a lot of different accounts of his life and this was a really good summation of all my reading. I thought the format was interesting. Good film.	positive
title: AWESOME! [SEP] content: Dancehall Reggae, Soca, and Reggaeton all mixed together one one CD? This compilation is a dream come true. Miami radio station Power 96's Eddie Mix brings the sexy flavor of Miami to wherever you are. If there is a soundtrack to the vibe of Miami this is it! You should probably buy 2 of these because one of your will friends will definitely steal it.	positive
title: great product [SEP] content: I bought one of these 10yrs ago, just died lots ofrattling noises, I tried to see if it was loss screws butwith no success, so I bought 2 more, they are great.Love fans that make noise, easier to block outside noisesspecially during the day.

title: Brain Lock [SEP] content: Very good practical advice for anyone who wants to get insight into curbing obsessive thinking.I would recommend this to anyone as a valuable self-help book whether you have OCD or not .The value is that it helps you identify and deal with thought patterns that are counter to your mental well being.The message of the book is the development of mindfulness but it is very practical and I have taken the authors advice to my benefit.It does go on a bit too much about the world of OCD sufferers which I got a bit tired of, but other people probably wouldn't . This is an immensely practical and commonsense approach to helping people with OCD and their families .I highly recommend this book.	positive
title: John Denver DVD [SEP] content: A Songs Best Friend - John Denver Remembered is a collection of interviews with a lot of people who knew John and some clips of John. This is not a concert by John but a series of people who knew John (his ex wife, manager, etc) There is some of John's music in the background (and 4 of John's songs in another section (Special Effects) but this is mostly people talking about John. I saw this on PBS but at the time they were having pledge breaks. The DVD does not have any pledge breaks or commercels and you can play it whenever you want if you buy it. Even PBS may trim this down to make it fit ther time slot and if they have pledge breaks they may have to trim it more to make room.	positive
title: Good Product [SEP] content: The product is very simple to setup for a PC. It is very quiet, and shuts down when not in use. The instructions for linking to a MAC are not that good, and I have yet to figure out how to share my HP OfficeJet printer via this device.	positive
title: Before There was Conan, There was Kull... [SEP] content: For Robert E. Howard neophytes, a little background. REH created Kull prior to Conan, but had difficulty seling his stories. What few there are were sometimes far more involved and intricately plotted than the typical Conan tale. Since they didn't sell, REH came up with Conan and a few of Kull's tale actully were transformed into Conan stories.One of those was "By This Axe I Rule," which was loosely adapted to become "The Phoenix on the Sword," as I recall. Some people actually prefer the character of Kull to Conan. Regardless, Kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	positive
title: Ran the Stoplight? [SEP] content: Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all.	positive
title: Musical suprise of 2004 [SEP] content: So much hate for the ex Miss Universe I see. Why? This is a solid pop/rock effort and Alicia is one of the biggest musical surprises of 2004. She's got a lovely voice, think María Conchita Alonso meets Lisa Marie Presley. The best track on this album has to be EL PAÍS DE LAS MARAVILLAS. I can not begin to tell you how many times I listen to this song! It should have been the first single. Really give her a chance. Some great songs. I hope to God she records a follow up.	positive
title: Clay and Ruben fan [SEP] content: I think Ruben's cd is great - very easy to listen to and sing along with. He really pulls you into it. I voted for Clay during AI but bought both the cd's and will support both of these talented young men.	positive
title: pretty good cover [SEP] content: This is not a flimsy vinyl plastic cover nor is it leather-like coverage - its in-between and just right. It fits my classic road bike very well and provides coverage all the way down to the ground almost even though I have a tall 27 inch frame. I'm not too enamoured about leaving my bike outside, as I am concerned about accelerating its rusting. We'll see how this works out. Otherwise, this cover is a good value for the money, fits properly and will keep away the bad weather. Perhaps a fully zippered breathe-able fabric cover might be the best? I have not seen one. Lacking that, this one is a very good one and definitely worth the $20.	positive
title: My 2 Year Old Loves It! [SEP] content: We got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she won't even be 2 years old until January. I decided to let her open it early, just to see if I should buy furniture for it or not. She hardly ever plays with anything more than 5 minutes, but this holds her attention for hours at a time. She loves it. She talks to them and makes them interact with each other. The house is made very well too, she likes to stand on the bottom floor and it holds her! I bought her some more people and another horse for it. I still can't believe how good she is doing with it. I'm sure it will be her favorite toy for quite some time!	positive
title: THE BEST SALES BOOK IN THE WORLD [SEP] content: I got into the sales line recently. Badly needing advice on how to succeed in it, I have read a couple of sales books. But I don't seem to learn much and was not at all inspired by them. Until, I discovered this book by Frank Bettger. Reading this book, I found Frank a very sincere person, one happy to pass on all the successful sales experiences he had garnered to readers.No doubt about is. This is the best sales book in the world. Any reader will benefit tremendously from it.	positive
title: Inspirational Book for anyone interested in mosaic-ing [SEP] content: I bought this for my sister-in-law who started doing mosaics but had no reference material. She loves it! Kaffe has an eye for colour and design that can't be faulted, and the instructions are clear and easily followable. There are a range of projects suitable for your home, or gifts. Great book, and I am in the good books with my sister-in-law!	positive
title: Beautiful [SEP] content: This cd is composed of all the background music to the incredible anime series, Rurouni Kenshin. There are 2 vocal tracks on here, Sobakasu-The Opening Theme, and Tears Know-one of the ending songs. The music is absolutley gorgeous, this is one of the few anime series that has great music. This really is a cd that you will want to add to your collection.	positive
title: Strong argument for the impossible [SEP] content: We know that the media is left-wing ; everybody knows that, right? Not Eric Alterman and he'll tell you why the media is far more conservative than you think. While I think he overstates his case, this is an excellent, well-researched book.I don't think he'll change too many minds,as people who are convinced the media is liberal are not going to change their minds just by reading a book, even such a persuasive one as What Liberal Media.I would ask any readers of this book to read this with an open mind and perhaps you might come around to Alterman's point of view.	positive
title: Excellent!! [SEP] content: I just finished watching this and came away thinking this was one of the best movies of this type I have ever seen!Without going into the storyline...the film has a lot of subtitles since it is mostly Chinese speaking. But this only gives you an appreciation for the frustration of the lover who knows little chinese, and of his being part of a charade to fool your lovers aging and ill parents [which includes watching him kiss and marry someone else!]This film brings up all kinds of issues, such as gay acceptance, is lying ever good?, personal responsibility, growing up, abortion, respect, committment....And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't try to answer any of these. You come away sorta happy, kinda sympathetic for everyone, and rather sad that, in the year 2004, going to these sorts of lengths to hide who you really are is not so uncommon in real life!	positive
title: 5-Star Road to Optimal Health [SEP] content: Natalia Rose so gets it right with her waste equals weight concept. I wish everyone would read her book! I've been following her basic principles for 6 months and have watched my skin clear up, my weight drop, my mood lifted and my general energy level doubled. The way to this cleansing from the inside out is simply but thoroughly laid out in her book with recipes to keep you creative as you're cleansing. I don't believe in "diets". I never have. This book, however, is a way of and road map to filling our bodies with real, raw, unprocessed food and finding our purest and leanest selves. The writing is thoughtful, the principles are astute and easy to grasp, and there is something for everyone to find and follow in this book that will lead us to healthier living period. Brava, Natalia Rose!	positive
title: Absolutely amazing mini series [SEP] content: This is one of my all time favorite books, so I was skeptical that the movie would be as good, but was pleasantly surprised at how closely they followed the book. It is an amazing mini series, extremely well made and the characters were true to the book. I would recommend this mini series to any Ken Follett fan or anyone who loves Pillars of the Earth.	positive
title: Very Satisfied [SEP] content: So sharp she cut her finger twice while peeling a potato. Worth the purchase and I would buy more of these items	positive
title: Senior Exercise DVD [SEP] content: Came timely and in expected condition. (Can't review product itself; haven't been able to try it outyet.)	positive
title: Works as advertised [SEP] content: I work in a warehouse loading heavy packages into trailer trucks. I've been having some pain in my wrists and I could no longer do push ups due to the pain. I've been using these wrist wraps for a few weeks and they have limited movement of my wrists so they don't hurt as much. My only complaints are 1) I wish they came in black because I work in a pretty dirty environment and 2) they are somewhat bulky	positive
title: Classic Book for Baby [SEP] content: This Golden Book will bring back memories and give new ones for your little one. I think the story has a great message and needs to be taught to those little children as they are growing.	positive
title: As creative and colorful as the subtitle says! [SEP] content: If you like felt crafts, you're sure to love this book. From practical to whimsical, from cute to wild, these crafts offer something for everyone. There are frames, banners, pillows, accessories, toys, and more. One project offers an amazing new take on felt: using a woodburning tool to create a Celtic banner. You might not need to make these projects - the book is presented so well, you can browse it like an art book! You're sure to come away smiling.	positive
title: Classy, Nothin' Cheap about it [SEP] content: Ive been using this since 2006, girls routinely tell me i smell good.The scent doesnt overpower plus the bottle looks nice, Grab yourself an extra bottle to keep in the car for when you're on the move. 5 stars	positive
title: Rockin! [SEP] content: If you've never heard of Scott Miller, BUY THIS CD! He's a talented songwriter and a lot of fun to listen to. Scott's style of music defies conventional descriptions. Rock? Yes. Country? Yes. Bluegrass? Yes. Gospel? Sometimes. Whatever you call it, you're gonna love it!If you already love Scott Miller but don't yet own this, BUY THIS CD! It's the second best thing to actually being at one of his live performances.	positive
title: Why Weight no longer!! [SEP] content: This is a study guide that has had great impact on me and the other three women in our group. Geneen really helps us to realize the true reason for our overeating and her lessons are great to do alone or with the group. Very impacting study guide and program. Highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling with their weight loss.	positive
title: Love Them! [SEP] content: I got these boots for 3 reasons. 1. I am a huge wonder woman fan. 2. I wanted to dress up as wonder woman for halloween (and I did, 3. I wanted them to wear them in my wedding (and I did!) I got these boots quickly and they were in beautiful shape! The fit perfectly and it was nice to wear heels that didn't make me feet ache 20min after putting them on. I would recommend these to anyone!	positive
title: Good stuff. [SEP] content: This one surprised me. It was better than I thought it was going to be. It's filled with good simple, some practical, things you can do to keep whatever control you have left over your whereabouts and personal information.	positive
title: Celtic bracelets [SEP] content: I bought these for Cheer Leaders that cheer for the CELTICS,,,they are very well made, wonderful quality, and shipment was quick.	positive
title: Better Than The Movie [SEP] content: Hampton Sides' telling of the rescue of 500 POWS, survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March, by U.S. Army Rangers in the Philippines during the waning days of World War II is an outstanding job of reportage. Sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the The Great Raid, the film adaptation of his story. As a working journalist for more than 30 years, I know I good story when I read one, and this one falls into that category.	positive
title: view of someone raised in Islam [SEP] content: As one raised in Islam, I truly wish more Christians would write books like these that would help break down the barrier between Muslims and Christians.	positive
title: Thanks Again Vickie [SEP] content: Just as wonderful as Vickie's Pregnancy book. A must have for the first few weeks back from the hospital when you're unsure of EVERYTHING. Thanks again Vickie.	positive
title: Entertaining with plenty of twists as always. [SEP] content: Any issue of Shanda is going to be great with mastermind Mike Curtis at the helm. We discover Terri has a brother, who inexplicably shows up on Shanda's doorstep, and troubled feelings ensue when Terri tries to defend him and herself against their own family. Heartwarming comic book in the end and worth picking up.	positive
title: More Ruby please [SEP] content: I figured out who the killer was early on but it didnt spoil the story. I really like China Bayles. She is cool. However if I could talk to Ms Albert I would ask her to please include more of the Ruby character and ease back on the Sheila!! I think Ruby rocks!! But I liked this book and I like this series. The herb info is cool too. I am reading these in order so I have a few more to go. I have enjoyed them all.	positive
title: The most usefull and powerfull book for 3dsmax ever [SEP] content: since the dawn of maxscript there has little of no help for its aplication thus resulting in its use rating less than a chocolate firegaurd. But stop! now there is a book for us all, from beginner to advanced it teaches and informs in a clear and conciese language that at defies incomprehention. You are presented with over a dozen chapters tackling most areas of maxscript with cd content to back them up. The biggest secret of 3dsMax is its scripting language and the affect it WILL have of your day to day workflow, this book pulls the cat out of the bag by it's tail and swing it around like a weapon. 80)	positive
title: Quick read world news [SEP] content: I purchased the Economist as a supplement to more expensive financial investment news services online. I had read special editions purchased at news stand prices, and found it almost too much to read in a week. The regular weekly edition is well organized, with capsule summaries of events up front, and longer feature articles on the same subjects further back.The British and European news and political bias is different than what we get on CNBC, Investors Business Daily, and USA Today. Many of the writers are very good, but the usual lack of credibility stands out in some others.	positive
title: Awesome cd. [SEP] content: This cd was easily one of the best releases last year so i had to post a review. From beginning to end every song is catchy yet in your face and thats the best way to do it. The lyrics are insane, guitar work is insane, drums insane. the riff in stab.stab.stab will not leave your head believe me.100/5 stars	positive
title: subtle, comical, and enlightening [SEP] content: I was sitting at Starbucks on a Saturday afternoon, when a very nice girl overheard my guffaw about reading another one of Bush's intelligent statements, "I didn't know the camera was on me!"So we began to talk, and after a few minutes, she pulled this book out of her bag, and told me that I should read it.All weekend long I did read, and I could not put it down. Intense, exciting, exhilerating, comical, a rush of relief in knowing that the end of the world could be an amazing wonderful experience.This book is everything, philosophical, sociological, psychological, comical, dramatic, and your not-so-common, "it just made me laugh at loud and feel good" type of book.My advice?I highly recommend this book, and periodically hanging out in coffee shops to meet really neat people!	positive
title: I hate Paladin's but I love this Book! [SEP] content: This book was so wonderful I almost had a heart attack after I read it. I mean I hate paladin's but the book was so well written It helped me get the few arrogent players who played them into line quick by helping me tighten the reins a little on exactly what Paladin's should and should not be doing.	positive
title: Right on target yet someting missing [SEP] content: The book had been in the making at Stanford for some time. I happened to use a manuscript of it in 1991 at Virginia Tech. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly a student could pick up relevant aspects of compuatational plasticity from this book; the book has a style of its own. We have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity. The book surely makes a useful companion to a plasticity textbook.It is disheartening to see that the numerical schemes for the integration of the constitutive equations of the endochronic theory are missing from the book.	positive
title: Love this book!! [SEP] content: Amazing book! I've read this to my children and give this book as gifts! It's a wonderful gift to give!!	positive
title: It really works [SEP] content: I bought the air revitalizer because I have dogs and a cat and I didn't want my house to smell like I have dogs and cats! When I bought it, I lived in a one story house. It worked great. (The only scent I've used is vanilla.) I don't think the sound is too loud, but I lived in a large house. When my house was for sale, I used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. I moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house. I placed it in my entryway near the stairs and it scents most of the downstairs and upstairs from that location. I am impressed and very glad that I have it.	positive
title: Loved It! [SEP] content: What a good book! It is the story of a medival man turned into a vampire. The book is set in the modern world, but flashes back to the time of King Arthur. I don't want to spoil the story for those who have not read it. Suffice it to say that the main characters are realistic and genuine. The story is entertaining with a lot of action. It is a fun read and the writing style is excellent. I hope these authors collaborate on more books in the future. Richard, the main character, is apparently modeled after the LaCroix character Nigel Bennett played on Forever Knight. This book is a must read for Forever Night fans as well as those people who like vampires, but hate the ultra-gorgeous Anne Rice kind.	positive
title: Our client's favorite [SEP] content: We refer our clients with questions on spreads to this book. Most say it's their favorite because it relies on clear, non-technical language. This book is appropriate regardless of the individuals level of understanding.	positive
title: New in Town [SEP] content: Great comedy and romance. Renee and Harry have good chemistry! Hometown kind of movie. Funny situations and good old fashion humor! Spectacular picture quality. Blu Ray rocks!	positive
title: The Big Country Restored/Preserved & in Blu-ray Format [SEP] content: At the film's conclusion, the follwing message appears: "The Big Country (1958) Restored by the Academy Film Archive with funding provided by the Film Foundation and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences." However, no additional information regarding the restoration process is provided. A ranking Academy member acknowledged several years ago that The Big Country received a non-digital, "completely photochemical" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: Lincoln Spector/bayflicksdotnet}. Perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the Blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same. Regardless, this Blu-ray format presentation of The Big Country is a pleasure to view and I will not fault this Technirama gem-of-a-film. The transfer is very good. (This Wal-Mart exclusive can be purchased for less than $10 at the Wal-Mart company website)	positive
title: Best out there [SEP] content: It works great. It's very light, weighs like 1 pound. One of my fans were at first stuck but I unjammed it with a pencil and its now running smoothly. Highly recommend.Only con is that when you plug it in the blue LED light is very bright.	positive
title: Great slipper [SEP] content: My husband loves his new slippers, because they're super cozy and very warm. They're really well made. I'd recommend these to anyone.	positive
title: not bad [SEP] content: This thing is still going strong after 1 year and my 3 year old submitting it to daily beatings. Would definitely buy again.	positive
title: A classic if ever there was one! [SEP] content: This book is great! Not only does it give me a feel of how life might be durinng end times, but the series only gets better! I learned so much and was inspired to read Revealation in my Bible! This book WILL NOT bore you and was an ingenious idea. I won't give anything away to you, all I can say is READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	positive
title: Love this TV Series [SEP] content: I hate that this TV series didn't stay on the air longer. It has a great story line with lots of drama and action. It is also a get show to watch and learn about things you might want to stock up on in case of a horrible national disaster.	positive
title: So Much Fun [SEP] content: My 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! We take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. She gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!	positive
title: Start them on Blackford Oakes when they're young. [SEP] content: I tend to not appreciate fiction. I read a lot of brain candy as a child, but one day in my early teens I picked up this book.1) I met William F. Buckley, Jr.2) I saw revolutionaries from a different angle.3) I developed a desire to read books with substance.4) I was innoculated against Steinbeck.It's engaging fiction that young people can enjoy. Let them get a little bit of this perspective before their pinko profs get them.	positive
title: Outdated sure, but still relevant [SEP] content: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.	positive
title: Awesome book [SEP] content: I really cannot say enough about this book and how illuminating it is to all of the facets of who Jesus is. We have been using it in a Bible study and I'm giving it to everyone I know. It's a quick, easy read, but packed with insight to really give you a lot to think about and meditate on. I definitely recommend it for anyone who is seeking to know Jesus better.	positive

title: Great musical toys for little hands [SEP] content: This set is great for younger children. I bought them for my 9 month old daughter and they were perfect for her little hands!	positive
title: Hello Kitty [SEP] content: This band is a mix of French and Germans, who sing in five different langauges. Their first record was quirky and decadent, and very over the top. My Melody relies on more subtlety within the band and more cover versions, especially heavy on the Serge Gainsbourg influence. Lead singer, Franoise Cactus is slowly becoming a legend in the international moogcore jetset pantheon. "Discjockey" is a danceable song which sound more like the first record, but most of this one is more torch and tragic. For the fans of Franois Hardy and Gainsbourg, this one is for you. Many club people who live for dressing up retro and fuzzy can't seem to get enough of Stereo Total.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)	positive
title: Power! [SEP] content: The best product I have bought for my camera. It makes my xti look like a large pro camera. and I love the ability to turn the camera 90 degrees and shoot.I have lots of battery life. I mean lots! the camera sits in my case ready to go for days and I never have to worry about running out of batteries or recharging. I charge it once a month, and I am good to go.I also like the AA battery insert, instead of the rechargeable, I could go into any store and buy AA batteries and be ready to go.I had no problem securing the grip to my camera. I was just careful to install it the first time. I will never take it off!	positive

title: Energy Tapping - a new level in healing [SEP] content: This book presents an easy way that even a skeptic can use and get results in dealing with issues that have posed emotional barriers within your life. A must read for anyone who is trying to overcome trauma on any level.	positive
title: CAT-AEROBICS! :) [SEP] content: This cat toy is FANTASTIC! I don't think there is a single cat out there that can resist it. My two cats lunged at it in about two seconds as soon as I gave the ball a little shove to get their attention. They played with it together for about ten minutes straight and it was so amusing to watch them really get all energized over this toy jumping and slapping the ball to each other. They come play with it every time I pull it from the corner of the room.The cat scratcher middle is fantastic as well. I don't have a scratching post so when ever they start getting frisky and clawing my upholstered chairs I just slide out the scratcher and they immediately use that instead! Fantastic toy ...buy one for yourself and any friends who may have a sweet feline!I've had mine since August 2010 and im now on to the second side of the scratching card in case you're wondering if to get extras. You'll have some happy cats with this one!	positive
title: Great little tool! Well built, comfy, light, powerful [SEP] content: Similar to the panasonic/milwaukee 3.6v driver but better. It is a little bigger but not much, grips better due to the nice rubber nubs in the grip, has an LED that can be turned on or off, and a nice size forward and reverse thumb switch. It has a quick release chuck that holds the bit unlike the others I mentioned, so your bits don't fall out. I own the milwaukee also, so I know of which I speak. Full range clutch that can even do light drilling. Comes with a nice charger and TWO batteries. Again, beats the others in overall value and features. Well built and ergonomically excellent. Also comes with a nice little case, again the others don't. Great deal on a great tool. You'll find yourself using this on every project that requires screws, nut drivers or small drill bits.	positive

title: Romantic [SEP] content: This is a wonderful collection of romantic music. The Harp is absolutely exquisite in this collection.	positive
title: Just about perfect! [SEP] content: From the prologue, I felt captivated by this book to it's very end. Wonderfully written! It was moving and fast paced. The only thing that may turn some readers off is some punctuation errors but they are easy to overlook with such powerful content.	positive
title: It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy [SEP] content: Outstanding example of the way things should be done! Wonderful and helpful insight. Thank you.	positive

title: a well-organized introduction to policy studies [SEP] content: Weimer's "Policy Analysis -3rd edition" provides a well-organized, widely-covered, and easily-understandable introduction to policy analysis. Although we have to seek for other materials for an in-depth analysis of some topics, the book helps us start with Public Policy, Policy Analysis, and even economic policies. This is especially good for undergraduate level, since this provides how to study, investigate, and write policy paper.	positive
title: THIS IS THE BEST CD [SEP] content: I LOVE ALL OF THE SOMGS OF THIS CD, I THINK THIS IS THE BEST MASS CHOIR IN MISSISSIPPI. OUR CHOIR SUNG THE SONG "THE'VE GOT THE WORD". THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD, BESIDES "EMMANUEL" , WHICH IS MY NEXT FAVORITE. I SING SOPRANO IN MY CHOIR IN HATTIESBURG, MS, I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SING IN THE MS MASS CHOIR, MAYBE WHEN THEY HAVE AN OPENING, OR NEED MORE HELP, I WILL BE GLAD TO HELP.MISSISSIPPI MASS CHOIR EMMANUEL "GOD WITH US" IT'S ON HIT, OH I ALSO HAVE THE CD AT HOME.

title: A very original and mystical love story! [SEP] content: The Author done something remarkable: he has succeeded in adapting a great Sufi classic, "The Parliament of the Birds" by Atar in the contemporary world of pop music. It is a highly enjoyable read and yet very profound. I loved it!	positive
title: Angels & Demons by Dan Brown [SEP] content: I have read several of Mr Brown's books and enjoyed them all. Loved the DaVinci code but then someone suggested Angels and Demons. So I gave it a try. Easily one of the best books I have ever read. The storyline was interesting and believable. I love the way his stories unfold piece by piece. Would gladly reccomend this book to any and all.	positive
title: Decking review [SEP] content: Excellent book for the home DIY person. If you thinking of hiring contractors to put in a deck, forget it, buy this book and DIY.	positive
title: Revisit or discover it [SEP] content: I owned this in 1980 and loved it but what did I know, I was 9 years old. By the time I turned 11, I'd moved on to something atrocious probably. Anyway, I picked up a copy of this CD as a goof only to realize that this CD has some catchy (though rather amateurish) songs but better yet, it sounds great! When's the last time recorded guitars sounded like this? Basically, this is way more than teen pop. It's hard not to ape Rick's guitar playing when "I've Done Everything For You" is blaring, trust me. To summarize, buy it for a loved one today!	positive
title: Well's second best book [SEP] content: Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it will never match my favorite of his 'The Island of Doctor Moreau.' 'The Time Machine' did seem to start off a little slow and a little to science fiction for my taste. However, it became more stimulating and full of action as the story progressed.	positive

title: Where have you been all my life? [SEP] content: I love building a fire on cold nights, so I use a lot of fire starters. These are by far the cheapest and best fire starters that I've used. They burn HOT. I am very impressed. I'll be using more of these as soon as I can burn through some of the other ones that I've accumulated. I don't foresee buying any other fire starters ever.	positive
title: Pokemon Sapphire is great! [SEP] content: I love this game! I own it in Japanese and it's awesome!the Game play is cool, you can now battle with 2 Pokemon at a time, the Pokedex is cool, and you can link up to 4 players at a time! Seriously, i am looking forward to the North American Release! People: If your a true Pokemon fan, buy this game! It is the most promising pokemon game ever!Newly found information: There is a total of 135 new pokemon. Which makes the grand total(drum roll please!)......... 386 Pokemon!! Sadly, the most i heard you can find is 200. So, you will probably have to buy both games to get them all.Special: Gamers in Japan got a Special boat ticket at a Pokemon Fair and it took them to an island where they could find Latios(in SAPPHIRE) and Latias(IN RUBY). Hopefully there will be an event like this going to malls in different states as previous times.	positive
title: Finally, the complete set! [SEP] content: The thin cases are a welcome addition when you buy this "upgrade" edition. The picture quality of the DVDs is top notch. An outstanding collection.	positive
title: A valuable resource with hard to find information [SEP] content: When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever. It broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously.	positive
title: Wow [SEP] content: Adam Scott wasn't really on my radar but I caught him in the last Season 2 episode of Eastbound and Down. A couple nights later, "The Vicious Kind" was on one of my cable channels. Good God. He has such a delicate face, but with the facial hair, it seemed to help in changing his persona. Really good movie and he was smoking hot in it.	positive
title: Nipple Nibblers [SEP] content: I really like this product. I don't think it's something I will be using on my nipples, but it sure makes a good chapstick!	positive
title: It's the BEST! [SEP] content: Originally I had the aluminum cups that were not double lined and they did not keep anything cold and all they did was sweat all over everything. We were going to Hawaii and I knew I just had to find a better solution. So I gave these a try. OMG!!! The are the BEST cup ever. We would put water, soda, flavored water - whatever - in the cup in the morning with some ice. Then drive around all day and leave the cups in a car that was over 100 degrees and by the end of the day the beverage was still ice cold and the ice had not even melted all the way. Absolutely amazing. You just can't go wrong. Easy to drink from, no sweating - it is perfect. I am keeping these babies under lock and key when our son comes over and wanders off with the hodge-podge of cups and glasses we have, never to be seen again.	positive
title: The title track kept this one from getting five stars [SEP] content: The new songs on this album are some of REK's best. Unfortunately the title track isn't a song at all, rather a rambling monologue that brings to mind J. Geils' "No Anchovies Please". Basically it just wastes space on the disc that would have been put to better use by adding another song.Also, between West Textures and the live album, do we really need a new version of The Road Goes On Forever? I don't think so!	positive
title: Alaskans like to listen to it to keep warm! [SEP] content: A friend of mine just flew in from T&T and she got me hooked on these tunes. To describe Soca is a little like Reggae on a sugar high. Very bouncy and very full of life and energy. Bright sounds that make you want to jump around your living room. Very good for cold dreary days in AK!	positive
title: Great kitchen! [SEP] content: My 18 month old boy normally has a very short attention span (sound familiar?!), but this kitchen/grill set keeps him actively engaged for quite a while! He loves making me a cup of coffee or grilling a burger for dad.My husband and I put this toy together in about 30-45 minutes. I'm sure it would have been harder with only one person. The instructions say not to use a drill, but we did and it was no problem -- much easier/faster!All of our doors fit fine, maybe we just got lucky? I agree more noises would have been nice, but that's what there imagination is for, right?!I definitely recommend this toy!	positive
title: kmtcpp [SEP] content: I dont really agree with many of the opinions above. Jaco had worse days than others, and every Jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his "bad ones" is absolutely wrong. If you've heard the "stuttgart aria" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. Compared to Weather Report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. This is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the N.Y series, with an outstanding 17' Teen Town!!!! A must buy in my opinion.	positive
title: Truly delightful once you get past the whole dead kittens thing. [SEP] content: I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said. My only real criticism of the book was that I found the very ending (we're talking literally the last chapter, not the climax which I loved) to be a touch predictable. Really there was only one of two ways it could go, so I suppose that was unavoidable. BUT, that being said, the journey to that point was unbelievably delightful (again, dead kittens aside). The writing was stellar, as you would expect from Gaiman, and the story was quite original. It's like he mashed up The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, put it underneath modern day London, and threw it all in the middle of a particularly gory slasher movie. I absolutely loved it and it made me just want to buy all of his other books and read them too. So well done, sir. Well done indeed.	positive
title: Good songs...a walk down memory lane. [SEP] content: A walk down memory lane when music was fun and the beat was 'catchy'. I like it.	positive
title: Great deal for quality product [SEP] content: I forget exactly what I paid for these headphones, but I'm pretty sure it was less the twenty bucks. The item showed up promptly, and it was just what I was looking for. A simple pair of headphones, comfortable, functional, and they sound great. If you don't need anything top of the line, and are looking for a good pair of headphones at a extremely fair price, these are for you.	positive
title: Knotwork [SEP] content: I have not yet drawn knots from this book, but I have worked through Celtic Knots-Mastering the Traditional Pattern which I recommend at a first book for beginners like myself. However, I had read this book and can't wait to start drawing its knots.	positive
title: So Great! [SEP] content: This is my first digital camera and I love it! It's small and very easy to use. There's plenty of advanced features to add effects on the computer and different modes which are a lot of fun to mess around with when taking random shots. The battery lasted through several nights of going out (with turning the camera on and off)and the picture quality is fantastic! I would highly recommend this camera to first time buyers, or to anyone who wants a new, easy-to-use one!	positive
title: Excellent information & advice! [SEP] content: This book was suggested to our Sewing Guild during a recent class on fitting. Many of us struggle with finding our own style based on the shape of our bodies. This book gives excellent advice on clothing styles, accessories, shoes, and even makeup suggestions - "don't overdo it"! Classic white shirts, great-fitting jeans, and coats. And, it provides you with brand suggestions as well as where you can get them. Ready-to-wear doesn't fit most of us so they suggest finding a great tailor to help with the fit. Thank goodness WE can do that now! I purchased 6 copies of the book for some of our Guild members and I have someone else requesting 2 more copies. I highly recommend this book as an excellent guide to finding and creating your own style.	positive
title: Huge Hit! [SEP] content: I bought this for my 15 month old son and he loved it!! He pushes is around every where and it actually sucks some! I had to empty it after days of work :).Amber	positive
title: Cardio [SEP] content: I have the Mat workout DVD which I really enjoy. I wasn't sure about the Cardio DVD having read wildly varied reviews from "love it" to "hate it". But, I thought I'd give it a try anyway.My verdict: I really like it. It's not for everyone though.If you just want to put your workout DVD in the player and follow the instructor's commands, then this DVD is definately not for you.However, if you are prepared to put effort into learning routines then you will probably enjoy it. The start of the DVD she goes through each dance combination step by step. Basically you can just keep rewinding and playing back until you get it. When doing the main workout she doesn't call out the next step or instruction - therefore you need to have spend the time learning the routines.The routines do take some time to learn, but with repetitions you will get them down pat. I have some dancing experience but not a lot.I like it because it's a bit different and fun to do. It's pretty high intensity cardio.	positive
title: Used as biotechnological narrative [SEP] content: In his article, Ethnographic Critique and Technoscientific Narratives: The old mole, ethical plateaux, and the governance of emergent biosocial polities, in Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry (25: 355-93. 2001)Michael M.J. Fischer uses this book as a juxtaposition to ethnographic descriptions of bio-ethical realties. It's rather interesting and may possibly add some insight into the novel	positive
title: my abs look good since i started it [SEP] content: i bought this product with the recommendation of my energetically ripped friend. i have to say even tho im not as ripped as him, i love maintaining my body and this helped	positive
title: Keep them coming! [SEP] content: Hooray! I was wondering about the 4th season; it's good to know they're still coming. I'll buy every single season. I think I'll throw up if I read about someone complaining about the packaging on this one--who cares! As long as the DVDs are being released, don't complain!	positive
title: It's a Guy Thing [SEP] content: Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss.	positive
title: The Book of Lists for Teens [SEP] content: The Book of Lists for Teens is an entertaining read for teens of all ages. The book address issues from dating to dealing with racism. Sometimes the advice is serious; others are just plain silly. I like the variety in this book although some lists are more interesting and useful than others. This book gives the readers a lot of miscellaneous facts - perfect for those who love trivia! If the reader is reading this for the first time, my suggestion is to skip around - reading it back to front is dull, and some subjects simply may not interest the reader. All in all, a book worth checking out!	positive
title: Castles and cold white legs [SEP] content: Trying to vididly recall late childhood is a nearyl impossisble task - let alone getting the mood and emotions down in print. Royal Blue does it wonderfully.The main charatcter is in turns the wandering, homeless waif and then, convincingly, the object of desire.A must read for anyone who enjoys an honest, sharply observing voice.	positive
title: Good value vac [SEP] content: Even after reading great reviews of this vacuum we were surprised how much we liked it: Amply powered, with a decent sized dirt cavity, the low price is pretty unbelievable. All in all it's a great deal but I have two complaints: I would have preferred a brush attachment on the little hose end but the real disappointment is the non retractable cord. It has to be wound up to store then unwound to use every time and that's a time gobbling design flaw.	positive
title: SAVE YER DOSH WITH TOSH! [SEP] content: I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER AND I THINK IT IS GREAT, I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE. AC-3,DTS(OUTPUTS)GOOD FEATURES, AND GREAT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY FOR A GREAT PRICE."BUY IT NOW"	positive
title: Amazing Movie [SEP] content: I don't often leave reviews but I felt that this movie deserved it. When you watch the trailer or read the description, this movie comes off sounding stupid. When it came out I decided not to see it but after my friend told me he saw it and i decided to check it out. This movie is great. It keeps you interested the entire movie and you are at the edge of your seat by the end. This movie has such a sad and wonderful story about Jamil. All the things he went through. But there is no doubt this a 5 star movie. I have it pre-ordered and I cant wait to watch again.	positive
title: Breathtaking! [SEP] content: This is a truly beautiful work. I've bought some CDs at the local record store and was very disappointed before I wised up and started looking through the reviews here at Amazon for some better material. This looks not like a Western collection, but like an actual Chinese CD. The liner notes have a rather melancholy feel to them, and this is reflected in some of the music showcased here -- piece number 4, Parting and Yang Guan, is particularly moving. The instruments evoke deep emotions; one in particular (I don't know what it is called, but it sounds like a violin) literally does not "play" but rather "sings" these sweet, expressive, minor-keyed melodies. The haunting voice of this instrument weaves itself all throughout the pieces, narrating stories that are foreign and yet very, very real to a western listener. This collection really deserve the title "Masterpieces". I only wish I knew where to find other works of this high quality.	positive
title: Great for a beginner [SEP] content: Not being a computer or camera "pro" I needed something easy to use. I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon. I decided to buy the F83 model. This model allows for a 15 second "movie". Boy do I like it. I like the ease of the Floppy disk. The quality is fine for my needs. The battery lasts a long time. A camera bag is a necessity since the LCD screen marks easily. I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a digital camera that is easy to use. Thanks Amazon for providing the reviews, and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews. I found them very helpful.	positive
title: Great ideas. [SEP] content: I've been gathering and saving ribbon for years - now I have some great ideas for how to use some of it! This book has so many projects that I almost don't know where to start, but my favorites are the greeting cards - they all look so professional and elegant. Thanks, Heidi, for another "Simply Beautiful" book.	positive
title: a very useful reveiw article collection [SEP] content: It contains very useful review articles. a short description about objectives, materials and methods, and results is very clear and easy to be understood.I know that the 3rd edition is published recently, so I could get the book in your store.	positive
title: this book is the best [SEP] content: this book is an excellent work, which portrayed the struggle between good and evil brilliantly	positive
title: Feeder Funnel [SEP] content: Fit perfectly. Makes the corn run completely out of the feeder so there is no residue left to go bad. Very easy to install and works like a charm.	positive
