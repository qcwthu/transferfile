title: Lowest cost organizer with keyboard and PC interface cable [SEP] content: Yes, the PC interface cable and (slow) backup and address entry software comes with the unit!The To Do list nicely sorts entries by alphanumeric priority, so you can organize by categories like B for Buy or M for Movies, as well as use priority levels 1 thru 9.Fits nicely in your pocket, with a keyboard which is quite usable for typical short entries.The calendar's monthly display shows morning and afternoon appointments at a glance.I'm completing software to speed up the slow backup and to allow importing and exporting entries. Email me if you would like to test and comment on the utility.	positive
title: Listen Carefully! [SEP] content: Whoever thinks "Deep End" is about suicide should really listen carefully to the lyrics. Whoever thinks MadChild doesn't listen to bars should consider that maybe MadChild doesn't give a [damn] and considers that his style. I love Bad Dreams as well as every one of my Swollen CD's. Each MC's style is unique: Prevail is brainy. MadChild uses ancient and fantasy based ideas. Bad Dreams is the cd that you pop into the cd player in your car during a long midnight highway drive. Excellent.	positive
title: Great Product.... [SEP] content: I really enjoy it..came just in time... and sorry it taken me so long to review it..	positive
title: All Quiet On the Western Front [SEP] content: I am a student at Walla Walla High School. I chose to read All Quiet On the Western Front by Erich Remarque, in my senior English class. I think everbody should read this book, just becuase it is a story of an average soilder and how they live. People watch televsion and think war is that way, but when you get on the front line it is totally different, soilders face different missions and problems everday. They are brave, not afraid to die, and they try to defend there country. I think Erich Remarque did a great job on getting the real story about war. Every senior English class should read this book.	positive
title: Great book for kids [SEP] content: There are several books in this series, each cut to the shape of the state! The books have a lot trivia about each state and are fun for kids and the adult reading with them. Wish there were all 50 books in the series!	positive
title: Jerry Lewis is as nutty as can be [SEP] content: This is a hilarious movie.It's one of those films that the whole family can enjoy.When I watched this movie I LOVED it! So buy this movie and bring on the laughs!!!	positive
title: Joan Hess has done it again! [SEP] content: Mystery and humor in one package. Great stuff. I hope she keeps writting about Maggody. -Sharice Lee-Author: "The Survivor's Guide."-	positive
title: Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc. [SEP] content: Dear Potential Reader:I have nothing but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more enriched English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.	positive
title: This book will leave you.. SPELLBOUND. [SEP] content: I am 32 years old and still read this book. In the 90's Pikes book were like the Harry Potter back in England and the States. It has many turns and twists. Its could've made it into a movie. I want to read this book. I will keep reading till the the day that I die.	positive
title: Awe Inspiring! [SEP] content: Bruce's description of how a single cell's intelligence is mimicked by multi cell communities (i.e humans) takes the reader on a journey toward their own ability to change the fate he/she believes awaited them from the start. Kudos to Bruce for keeping at these new discoveries about how humans can thrive and essentially evolve into the next generation.	positive
title: This is your Bible if you have Panic/Anxiety Attacks! [SEP] content: This is the very best book ever written for those suffering from Panic/Anxiety attacks! I could not face life without it! It covers everything about what panic/anxiety is, to how to deal with it, information to help to heal with meditation, diet, drugs, connecting your with higher power. GREAT, GREAT book! I also know of Panic/Anxiety support groups that use this as "the book" for information.	positive
title: TomTom Go 720 [SEP] content: I bought this 720 to replace a 720 that kept falling off the dash board of my truck. The last fall broke the plug where the power cord connects. I love the 720 and was lost without it so I bought a new one. The only problem I have is the suction cup on the mount. It seems like it only lasts for about a year. Of course I leave it in the car with the unit attached all of the time and I have a disc on the dash which the mount connects to. I did have an issue with the maps when I first hooked the unit to my PC. I made the seller aware of the issue and they stayed in touch until the problem was resolved. TomTom actually resolved the issue for me with very little trouble. I actually think my issue was my fault due to already having a 720 set up on my PC. But within a week or two I had my 720 up and running with no further issues. I would recommend the 720 to anyone.	positive
title: Excellent retrospective of a talented band [SEP] content: They may have been a one-hit-wonder, but what a hit! 96 Tears is still a unique rock song, full of hypnotic atmosphere and clever musicianship more than 40 years after its release. The other material on the album is interesting and for the most part, equally well-played and quite enjoyable though less remarkable and less commercial than the band's one big hit. Some songs are ballads, a few are quite bluesy, and others bristle with the unique sound that made 96 Tears a song worth listening to for more than 40 years. With 27 tracks on the CD it's a good sampling of what this band had to offer. I waited for years for this music to become available on CD and purchased this disc without hesitation once I discovered it. Don't sit "down there, lookin up", buy it now!	positive
title: Armageddon- truely enjoyable! [SEP] content: Armageddon is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I saw it 3 times in the theater and loved it each time. Ben Affleck doesn't hurt the movie, either :)	positive
title: Multiple Uses at a Brilliant Price [SEP] content: First of all, I didn't buy these for a child, but for an adult friend of mine who makes Jamaican-style music (Reggae and Dub). While these are labeled as a "toy" or for children, they can also be utilized for just about anything music related.The paint is durable, and the diameter is thin enough to accommodate a myriad of hand sizes. The sound is what you would expect from a Rhythm Stick, and to be honest, why would you pay the up-mark for music-specific branded ones?Overall, a solid buy for all ages.	positive
title: wonderful prose & poignant characters [SEP] content: BRAVO! to Elizabeth Strout. A touching and enjoyable book. The truth often really is stranger than fiction. Amy & Isabelle celebrates the beauty and nobility of the everyday life of ordinary people.	positive
title: movie review [SEP] content: We are Bruce Willis fans, it could of used a little more plot but I would give it 3.5 stars,fun to download off of Amazon, still had some interruption in streaming	positive
title: A good grinder [SEP] content: We have 5 of these. My wife likes them because they are easy and dependable. They don't leave salt or pepper on the table (most important). You can easily see whether it's salt or pepper. Fresh ground salt, "Sal Du Mare" "gross" (French for "course") is much better (and saltier) than the stuff with the little girl on it. And a good black pepper is always better fresh ground. Be careful not to loose the spring if you adjust the grind. It has a tendency to pop out.	positive
title: By Surprise [SEP] content: Picked this album up by chance...you know, never heard of them (can you beleive it...I don't get out much) I have heard much bantor of Electronic Industrial music since the days of infancy with Ministry, skinny puppy, Cabaret Voltaire. That goes back a ways....just can't picture this vocalist, the voice is very familiar...something I heard in a different life. Out on the dance floor, "I can't find shelter in this world, I'm searching for an other world, where I'll feel safe." Brought me back to why industrial music, or "EPM" can still be on the cutting edge, by far better than the dark goth scene. This band will get me out there to get their back catalog. Check this band out..you may be pleasantly surprised.	positive
title: Top of the list for using imagery [SEP] content: I'm biased. I took imagery training with Marty Rossman some years ago and found him down to earth, honest and real, as well as one exceptional practitioner of therapeutic imagery. He writes well too. I came in primed to appreciate his work as I had developed my practice from some of the same sources as Rossman and found that he had done an excellent job of integrating a number of useful techniques and placing them in a good technical context.I have seen clients of mine use the techniques in this book to alter the course of chronic and painful conditions. I have had personal success using these techniques, too. For the years I was teaching Imagery workshops, this was the textbook I used. It generally got excellent feedback from the workshop participants.	positive
title: The Long Shot [SEP] content: I saw this movie first on Hallmark Channel. I am a horse lover, and enjoy watching dressage, and jumping competition so this movie was right up my alley. It's a good family movie that brings home the theme of never give up.	positive
title: River Swim Tube [SEP] content: I purchased this river swim tube 2 years ago and have taken it down the Delaware river on many trips. So far no leaks or punctures. I recommend it highly.	positive
title: Simple and sweet [SEP] content: Yume Bitsu have made a beautiful and moody cd. Somewhere between mogwai and ride with a hint of guided by voices. Doctor trips is the stand out track which has everything from the sound of rain to toy telephones. Very sweet.	positive
title: Small but well designed [SEP] content: This is one of the smaller Brita pitchers. Every morning, after water for the cat, the dog, and my pills, it needs a refill. The great part is, no need to remove the top to add water. A small section of the lid tilts up for refills. No fingerprints, no smudges, no problems. It is small enough to fit anywhere in the refrigerator, door or shelf. Who cares about continuous refills is you don't have to remove the lid and then clean the mess.Also a really easy to use calendar to keep track of 8 weeks between filter changes.	positive
title: Like nothing else... [SEP] content: except maybe Jeanette Winterson's "Written on the Body." I felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. It is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters. But the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. I took it in while I was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in Searle's book were enough to distract me. I consider it my rebound (without the consequences). Please read this book.	positive
title: Probably the scariest pirate story ever [SEP] content: I was not expecting much when I started to read this book. I have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and I wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. Turns out, it's amazing. It took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of Stevenson's style, but once I was able to focus on the story itself, I didn't want it to end. Stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure. The book is scary, with some real surprises and well-developed characters, and I loved it.	positive
title: The purple cow is a long time ago being [SEP] content: I apologize for my english because I'm a french reader(Paris)."The purple cow" is a marketing easy reading book with lots of cases and success stories. I always wonder reading this kind of book if it was so easy to make a successful brand like to make a good cake. I'm sure it's not. The author seems to know all the keys of marketing and resume them in one idea : be remarkable. Isn't it too simplistic ? And what about be unremarkable by being always remarkable,think of United Colors of Benetton. The question is not approached. But the book is a good distraction for thoses who are interesting in funny and rationnal marketing short cuts. Anyway, remain to think in a singular way is always a good work to do in any job. Then, The Purple Cow is a useful training in this way. Enjoy your reading.	positive
title: Kathleen Battle,s "So Many Stars". [SEP] content: A beautiful CD, recorded by an exceptional artist with backup musicians that are the tops. A CD well worth adding to any library.	positive
title: Good Read [SEP] content: E. Lynn Harris never disappoints and he steps up to the plate once again. I loved the story by Jerome Dickey...the characters Kenya and Amir were such a great pair. The Cafe Piel was good...the ending was a bit unrealistic, but the storyline was good. The short story by Channing was awful...I could not finish reading it...I did not know where he was going with the story...this story is why I rate the book a 4 and not a five.	positive
title: GLAZIER'S JOPLIN -- AN EASY WINNER [SEP] content: There are very few pianists who know how to play Scott Joplin with style & rhythm without overdoing it. Joplin's music has built-in rhythm that's tempting to overstate, thus turning rag into a bacchanalia. On the other hand, Joplin played perfunctorily with a tight rein is bland & uninspiring.If you love rag, Richard Glazier's Scott Joplin CD is the one you want to get. I have several versions of Joplin on, both, LP & CD and as far as I'm concerned, this Richard Glazier CD IS "The Easy Winner". His performance is exciting, yet elegant. Everything is in good taste; nothing gaudy nor superficial-- just great style & rhythm. Mr. Glazier grew up playing this kind of music & is a master of syncopated rhythm. He plays this genre of music like Vladimir Horowitz played Rachmaninov & Chopin.RECOMMENDATION: All of Richard Glazier's CDs are masterpieces. BUY THIS CD. YOU'LL LOVE IT!	positive
title: I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!! [SEP] content: I can't tell you how many times I've read "Rawhide & Lace." I first read it when I was about 14. My cousin had a copy which also included part 2 "Unlikely Lover." It is our favorite book. If you love romances and cowboys, trust me, you will not be disappointed with this book. I give it 10 stars.	positive
title: What Every Christian Ought to Know: Essential Truths for growing [SEP] content: Great book. Also gave one as a birthday present to my friend.	positive
title: Galatic Musical Symphony [SEP] content: I first heard the planets when a friend of mine played a sample of Mars that he had downloaded from the Internet. I then felt the vibrant energy that took me to another place where everything seemed distance, I bought the CD two days later and have never looked back. The Planets is a excellent choice and I highly recommended it.	positive
title: seven from thebes [SEP] content: 01/07/12I received the movie in a timely fashion and in good condition. The movie was just fine. It is now part of my permanent collection.	positive
title: necklace extenders [SEP] content: Really nice set, many length options. Decent quality for the price. I got one set in 'silver' and one in 'gold' and have used both.	positive
title: suprisingly good book [SEP] content: I purchased the book to satisfy my curiosity. I was not expecting to learn much since I've been investing for some time. I was wrong. Not only is the book crammed with useful information, but it is very easy to read with abundant graphics and humor.I recommend the book to all, both beginner and experienced investor.	positive
title: The test of time [SEP] content: This recording has been measured praised and condemned (well, no one would be foolish enough for that) over time, but is the best reflection of the power and majesty of Mahler's most coherent symphony. The complaints about the sound not measuring up to the modern digital recordings reflects a need for thunder over substance and a bad stereo system. Walter Legge produced recordings that surpass the restrictions of his time and place and the sound on this is magnificent.And the conclusion, where Scwarzkopf's voice floats over the chorus in the Aufstehen is unequaled.	positive
title: Fun French really was fun! [SEP] content: My almost four-year old twin grandchildren also love this CD. The boy especially likes Goldilocks and the Three Bears; the girl likes the songs to make beginning French easily learned. The first copy I bought was defective but the replacement was very good. The voices are clear and easily understood. The vocabulary is quite age appropriate. Excellent product!	positive
title: Works for me [SEP] content: Originally bought this in the local store and when it ran out, went back to find they no longer carried it. It really did a great job of controlling dandruff. Since my local store no longer carried it, I tried some other shampoos with little luck. I does take a few uses to get things back under control.	positive
title: DEFINITELY ROOM FOR MAYER! [SEP] content: John Mayer finally hits world wide appeal with "Room For Squares". I bought this album before the first single "No Such Thing" was a hit.This album is well written, produced and arranged. Mayer is in top vocal form who keeps being compared to the Dave Matthews Band which is completely false. Mayer has his own style and vocal performance.Songs like "Neon" and his latest hit "Your Body Is A Wonderland" are in no way the same boring drone of Matthews Band who keep churning album after album out with the same song and sound.Mayer is his own man, with his own style. This album is completely solid through and through. A nice enjoyable treat.Someones review compared him to "New Kids on the Block"!...Oh please. People like this - you can show them a Monet, then a Velvet Painting of Kids with BIG eyes, and they would see no comparison.This album is a definite recommendation for Adult Contemporary Music.	positive
title: good advice, if you can follow it [SEP] content: There are things here about the psychology of people who are shy, different kinds of shyness, some root causes, things you can do about it, how to not raise shy kids, and some benefits of being shy (e.g. tend to do good work that would be hard for flighty or gregarious people -- intense research, etc.)The co-author is a psychologist or psychiatrist, and probably contributed the theories.My only complaint was that being shy was occasionally refered to as selfishness in other clothes.All in all, there is some good advice but it didn't change my life or anything.	positive
title: WELL NOW!!!!!!! [SEP] content: Joe has helped many "see the light" in terms of playability. I really don't know how I could of learned so much without Joe. He continues to fascinate me every time I listen to him!!! Who doesn't LOVE Joe?	positive
title: These Recipes Are Magical But So Easy [SEP] content: I knew how easy it is to bake a cake using a cake mix from my pantry as a starter, but the results with the recipes in cake mix magic were overwhelmingly good. I served two cakes-Chocolate Cherry Cake and Blueberry Coffe Cake-at a recent party and they were both gone before I even had a piece. But I did get four requests for my recipes.I will certainly recommend this book to my friends.	positive
title: Great for my 1st grade son [SEP] content: These books have been a great solution for having my [kid] read every evening for his school reading log. He enjoys the stories very much and the chapters lengths are minimal. He easily gets a good 10 minutes read each evening with only an occasional difficult word. He enjoys them so much that now I don't even have to remind him that he needs to read a chapter ... I look in to his room at night and he already has the book out! I love that there are so many books in this series - I plan on buying them all for him :) What a great habit of reading he has gotten in to through the Magic tree House series!	positive
title: An Amazing Shalamar Collection! [SEP] content: I had to write a review for this hits collection because I completely disagree with the other sole reviewer. First of all, it is very well remastered. Sounds superb! Second of all, songs are NOT chopped off half-way through them. It is true... these are not the 12-inch dance-floor versions. They are the single versions!!! But, they are not abruptly edited, as the other reviewer may have led you to believe. Ultimate Collection has a well-represented collection of tracks from Shalamar's discography, even a few tracks from the pre-Howard Hewett period. The cd does not get five stars from me, however, because there are TOO MANY selections coming from the synthesizer-heavy late-'80s. Perhaps 17 tracks on an album is too much of a good thing sometimes! Otherwise, I have NO complaints!!!	positive
title: good for the ecosystem ecologist in everyone [SEP] content: a technical book written for ecosystem ecologists but easy to read. I had to get it for a class, but it was well put-together and organized.	positive
title: Metheny is our Mozart [SEP] content: While not my favorite Pat Metheny selections, certainly this vid will be much appreciated by Metheny afficianados. watching how he makes his music is revealing, to see the facial expressions as his fingers work their magic, especially how his mouth moves - as if the sounds coming from his instrument were in reality coming from his very soul - grin - which of course, they are. A culmination of much of the life long theme that characterizes his work, which any Pat Metheny fan will instantly recognize, this piece is the pure essence of the Man who is surely the Mozart of our age.Jonathan R. Zylstra	positive
title: Great fragance [SEP] content: I was introduced to Versace Bright Crystal in the airport, came home and ordered it online. Very happy with the cologne, shipped very quickly.	positive
title: It's a Guy Thing [SEP] content: Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss.	positive
title: Two great movie screenplays from a great director [SEP] content: Kevin Smith's two best movies, Clerks and Chasing Amy, are available together in this book. While a movie such as Clerks needs to be seen to be appreciated to the fullest, this book provides the scripts so one can enjoy the movies without seeing them. If you read the book, definently see the movie--forget it...see the movies regardless.	positive
title: Religious George [SEP] content: If you want to read a book of about 90% of new material then this is the book...keep in mind it may not be a biography in terms of the man's life or artistic output...it's very much about his religion mainly the India type religion aka yogi's, marehishie? ...and how all that came to be and why it became to be and just how involved George was into all that...brief discussions on the backlash in his involvement and most of all the meaning of his involvement on popular culture as we know it...most people are aware of yoga, chanting, indian religion and 95% of that is the responsibility of George Harrison's involvement...but keep in mind when purchasing this book the book's main focal point is the religious aspect of his lfe...with a very very brief over-view in the beginning chapters.	positive
title: Should be Death or Heaven [SEP] content: This book comes after a 25 year old acquaintance was killed in a bike accident. It examines the questions, 'Is death really that bad if there is a heaven?'. It has a mormon slant being written by one of its most famous leaders of the last part of the 20th century. While only being 12 pages, it poses numerous questions and does a good job at answering them.	positive
title: A hilarious tribute to Star Wars and it's creator [SEP] content: George Lucas said it himself when he reviewed it, "this movie is the life story I wish i had." With it's references to all 3 of the star wars movies and the great acting, George Lucas in love is possibly one of the greatest short films ever made. I'm not the only one who thinks so. Apparently the people at the Texas Film Festival, the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, and the Tahoe International Film Festival, who gave such awards the 2000 Audience Choice Award and the 2000 Best Short Film think's it's pretty funny too.	positive
title: Disturbed's Best Yet [SEP] content: Let the reviews tell the story, this album is, in my opinion, one of the best albums this year. Disturbed has changed their sound a little with this album and all the of the songs are completely power-packed. Stricken is a very nice single and it has Disturbed written all over it. Guarded is also very good it has in your face sound right from the get-go. Enough said. Go out and buy this album, you are wasting precious time reading these reviews.	positive
title: Anne Klein Chain Bracelet Watch [SEP] content: This is a very attractive watch, appears well made, only time will tell. Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife. It isn't Christmas yet!	positive
title: A Priceless Investment [SEP] content: In a world of relativism and unbridled inclusiveness, we need a clear understanding of God's Word. It is life changing. The Bible does not contain but is the absolute truth of God. As one studies God's Word in the original languages (in this case NT koine Greek), untold treasures are revealed concerning what the Lord has for those who believe. We get a better understanding of the mind of God, the value of life and the salvation that every soul needs through Jesus Christ. I highly recommend it.	positive
title: Absolutely incredible! [SEP] content: If you love Blues guitar, or any guitar for that matter, you must own this album.If you play guitar, and you think you're getting pretty hot, take a lesson in humility and study this man's technique.	positive
title: Intermediate Polish rules [SEP] content: I have been a linguist now for six years and have studied Polish and Russian. "Intermediate Polish" by Oscar Swan is perhaps one of the most helpful books I have read. It contains a lot of information and presents it in a concise format.	positive
title: This CD is awesome!!!! [SEP] content: For any teenage Christian who likes heavy rock, fun music, and good spiritual lirics, this is a wonderful album. I recommend it to anyone who needs a bit of relief.	positive
title: Virtual Fireplace [SEP] content: Ironically, after having been in the fireplace business for several years, I do not have a fireplace in my home. I have missed not being able to stoke up a fire on a cold and damp day. The Ultimate Fireplace DVD has been an amazing replacement for the real thing. My wife and I are voracious readers so we curl up in our favorite chairs nightly with our latest books in front of the crackling fire. We have two dogs and it is funny how they start to pant when the fireplace DVD is running. It is so realistic that they are sure they must be getting hot. With Christmas around the corner we put on our favorite Christmas music and the Christmas fireplace scene and our home takes on an idyllic presence with us curled up with a steaming cup of tea or hot cider and the dogs resting beside us. Truly a Rockwell moment.	positive
title: loved it [SEP] content: I loved this book and will read this author again. This is a story of women's triumphs, of celebrating who we are and of our courage to live, love, lose and love again.	positive
title: With a fond shudder of nostalgia, one remembers... [SEP] content: ...the nasty reptilian burn down the sinuses and back of the throat that came with snorting crystalmeth cut with strych, aspirin, baby-lax and Lord knows what else back in those evil days not as many years ago as I wish... The same malicious synth-drive as Chrome and Six Finger Satellite at their most nefarious moments, and then Lordamighty that voice. Successfully replicates the experience of doing bad drugs with a revival minister suffering the pre-epileptic shoogaloos of amphetameanie-psychosis after several comprehensive ECT sessions in the Solitary ward at Parchman Farm in preparation for a public encounter with the chair. Not even Jeffrey Lee Pierce ever got this bad. If you get your jollies off by driving around in heavy traffic imagining running pedestrians down, this rates just beneath the Stooges for the soundtrack to your sickheaded little fantasies. ELECTRICITY!	positive
title: Praise for International Marionettes [SEP] content: I liked the fact the book was written by an ex employee of a major corporation in a manner that related the true feelings that many management employees experience, but do not have the courage to talk about, much less write about. It brings home the job pressures and the need to continually perform and improve. It also clearly outlines what lengths the corporate world will go to to maintain control.The author is to be saluted for having the backbone to fight back and to stand for principle. Most of all it is a story of his tenacity and need to persist and to get answers. Several of the chapters deal with the author's dark side and indiscretions which add flavor, but cause one to say "why did he do that?"	positive
title: trigger happy ME!!! [SEP] content: I totally love the album. "Trigger happy jack" and "another world" are the best songs. Poe's sound is differenent from Pj harevey, tori amos, and Fiona Apples, as they have been compared (i don't know why?). Poe as a really pretty voice, and plays piano very well. This is a very good album, everyone should own it. If only she could get more radio play....	positive
title: Good, strong melodic music [SEP] content: "Sense and Sensilibilty" was fortunate to have Patrick Doyle as the composer. The songs are beautifully written, with strong tones. Even if you've never seen the movie, it's easy to imagine what happens in the movie when each song plays. While this CD isn't exactly car trip music, the instrumental pieces are fabulous. There are also two songs sung by soprano Jane Eaglen.	positive
title: Eye-opening, engaging, and fun [SEP] content: When I first heard about this book, I thought`-- Don't women already know this stuff? I read it at the suggestion of a friend and discovered that there was plenty I did't know. That, for example, doctors and anatomists don`t agree on the shape and size of the clitoris. I'd suggest that every woman read it, even if they start out a bit skeptical, like me.	positive

title: Quite a Nice Read [SEP] content: For many years -- through two marriages and God knows how many moves -- I have kept a moldering issue of PLAYBOY for the simple reason that I didn't want to turn loose of one of my all-time favorite examples of the New Journalism, Ed McClanahan's "Grateful Dead I Have Known." It's THAT good. That landmark piece and other tasty goodies have been collected into McClanahan's MY VITA, with Ed providing some new bridging material describing his growth as a writer. It's a pity he's not a more widely recognized writer. If you dig Terry Southern, Charles Portis, or Hunter S. Thompson, you'll like Ed McClanahan. If you're of that bent, I'd snatch up this book before it falls out of print.	positive
title: Quirky, off-beat material that any Denver fan will love [SEP] content: I have listented to this album hundreds of times. My father used to take the tape along when we went fishing in Wisconsin and we would listen to it over and over together. The material is a real departure from what John Denver usually records. There is a John Prine song in there, a Christmans song, a song about the Canadian Rockies, and it all fits together to form a relaxing, interesting record. I highly recommend Farwell Andromeda to any John Dever fan. It's different, but I bet you'll be playing it over and over just as I have.mike grabowski	positive
title: Sweet! [SEP] content: These things are great!!! Constructed very well, I thought they would be more flimsy but was happily surprised. I foresee many wonderful years of popscicle making. So far I made orange juice pops, chocolate pudding pops, and frozen yogurt pops.......the choices are endless!	positive
title: Revenge of the Geeks [SEP] content: Because of my limited knowledge of modern day space exploration, I did not know what to expect when I saw this film. After viewing it, I knew it wasn't just "another space documentary". It was deeper than that. It was in my words, a "space age gangster flik". I say this because the whole concept of pushing the envelope and successfully launching a privately funded space station under the radar of NASA & the government was just too smooth! Plopping down huge amounts of cash , putting it all on the line for the sake of introducing space travel to the masses. All of this & doing so "privately" without government intervention... well that was the plan. What a concept!Michael Potter's vision was truly multidimensional. Throughout the movie there was a consistent layer of "techie & science" but underneath the veil lies the real concept..Space entrepreneurs, space geeks, conspiracy theorists, or just curious, all have a place enjoying this film & I recommend it for your viewing.	positive
title: Send Me Green...!!! [SEP] content: Maybe Metallica's most popular album is "Master of Puppets"...the songs are very popular in the gigs...there's a fast "Battery", the heavy killer tracks "The Thing That Should Not Be", "Welcome Home", the fast "Damage Inc." (like "Dyers Eve" or "Metal Militia", a heavy track). "Leper Messiah" is a great song too...there's a riff written by Dave Mustaine from Megadeth. The title track is a popular live track but I find it a little bit boring and overrated...still, it's a classic. The songs "Disposable Heroes" and "Orion", an instrumental track are the only songs I wouldn't like to hear live...other are killer tracks.Stars: Leper Messiah, The Thing That Should Not Be, Battery	positive
title: Wonderful! [SEP] content: Gives the reader a wonderful and clear picture of how Egypt has changed throughout history. I send a thank you to the author.	positive
title: It is a great toy [SEP] content: This is a great toy to have!I would ride it every chance I had.I think it is well priced. It is fun for 6-9 years of age.When I got the E-100 a lot of my friends saw me riding it and they got it too.This a fun toy to have and you should buy it!	positive
title: Not Braveheart, but still great! [SEP] content: The first mistake I did when I first saw the Patriot, was that I was expecting another Braveheart. But this is not Braveheart, and it isn't trying to be.Roland Emmerich really shows that he is a great director who can handle a great script without destroying it with specialeffects. After Independence Day and Godzilla, Roland has finally stopped relying on the effects (allthough there are effects, but they do not own the screen at any time) and started to trust his own skills.He also has great help from the cast. Mel Gibson is great as both the carrying father, and as the cruel buther he is in war. Heath Ledger is abolutley a name to recon with for the future, and makes the son very well.So all and all this is a graet movie, that does NOT make all englishmen out to be a sead of evil, that some people have claimed.	positive
title: metal [SEP] content: cannibal corpse is metal. if you look at death metal and merely think only melodic bands from sweden make up this genre, you are dreadfully wrong. cannibal is a brilliant band. they know exactly how to piss of the mainstream and still sell more records than any other death metal band in history. by the way..my favorite band of all time is death, and of course this is not anythinglike shuldiners music. you see, to be a true fan of metal you must have ears for it all. from cannibal to iced earth, from shadows fall to nevermore, metal is metal. as chuck himself once said, there is no death metal, just metal!!!	positive
title: Bride of the Wind [SEP] content: Pierce is in love with Anne, however when Pierce and Rose meet the sparks fly and they instantly do not like each other. Pierce and Rose are forced to marry, and Anne is forced to marry someone else. Pierce is distrustful of Rose(not dumb), and thinks she had something to do with what caused them to marry. Rose is upset as after they are married Pierce, spends his days looking for Anne to verify that she is ok after what happened. From there it is murder and revenge.Reading peoples reviews always shows me that what one person likes another hates. You can't necessarily depend on other peoples reviews. You just have to try it. I love this book. It is one of my favorites I have read it several times, and will continue to read it over again. Great characters and love the story.Heather Graham has some great books under Shannon Drake as well as under Heather Graham.	positive
title: Incredible in all aspects [SEP] content: What an incredible movie. A great movie that I can't stop raving about to my friends. Granted - every movie has flaws - but this movie comes darn close to flawless. In my book - it's the king of "psychological thrillers". Once again - a MUST HAVE for anyone's collection. Believe the reviews - this movie is so fresh and entertaining. A twisty plot, a great cast, and a killer soundtrack make for an excellent film.Hands down - 5 stars.	positive
title: Great MP3; Needs work on the video and shuffle play flexibility [SEP] content: This ipod is great for storing your entire CD collection and still have plenty of space for your latest 100-2000 pictures to share with family and friends. I would like to see some improvements from Apple on the following:1. Video quality - the screen is small and the quality is not real great especially in fast moving action shots2. Must use iTunes - This is sad because there are better applications out there3. Shuffle Play is limited - It is difficult to set a shuffle play for anything smaller than the entire ipod or a playlist. For 2 - 4 GB that works ok, but when you have your entire CD collection loaded up, it is difficult to just play a particular Genre or even artist.	positive
title: A Must Read [SEP] content: this was a very good book. its about friendship,love,and struggles. u learn that when u think its ova..its not! Read it!	positive
title: Hot French rock. [SEP] content: I was on my first visit to France and I went into a record store to buy Ca Plane Pour Moi, by Plastic Bertrand, which was a big hit at the time (we're talking the punk era here). The guy who served me said, you don't want that [...], you want something decent, and he recommended this Telephone disc. I bought it on spec, and am so glad I did - it was my introduction to probably France's best rock/punk band. Melodic and intense, this is intelligent music for people who want more than a mindless pop song.	positive
title: Captures the Imagination [SEP] content: Posthumous speculation on what Hendrix was going to release next. A great collection of mature late Hendrix as he moved into a new period. Heavy guitar solos like Midnight, Pali Gap and Peace in Mississippi really beef up the vocal tracks. This album has been heavily criticized for tampering with the Hendrix vision, but the song selection is better structured than the official release New Rays. It also does justice to the tracks they just threw onto South Saturn Delta without any thought of album cohesion.	positive
title: The Airplane at their peak [SEP] content: One of the most anthemic of rock and roll bands, this album features two of the Airplane's best anthems ('We Should Be Together' and 'Volunteers of America') as well as several cuts of unmatched musical beauty and spiritual harmony. And a Russian Army song. Still has a place of honor on my turntable, after all these years.	positive
title: Love Pampers [SEP] content: These are really great when potty training. My daughter has learned that she can pull them off and put them on. And if she has an accident, you can rip the sides without making a bigger mess down her legs! I love them!	positive
title: NICE!!!!! [SEP] content: I love the contents of this magazine from cover to cover! The only reason why I'am giving it only 4 stars is because the copy I received has non acceptable damaged at the cover; but yet this may be the fault of either the company or the delivery agency... I'' get back with more info when the next copy arrives.	positive
title: A middle man tells his story. [SEP] content: Swofford is part of a Marine STA, so he is not just some grunt at the bottom complaining about serving his country, and he's not a general telling you about all the decisions he has to make and why with all the little details. Swofford shows you who he is and tells an amazing story using the war in Iraq during the first Gulf War as the linear part of the story, cutting in to tell the story of his life. Why he joined, his family, his girlfriends, and about the Marines (the real Marines) and the difference between trained to kill and warrior. Jarhead is a great book and by middleman I am referring to him being above his fellow Marines in combat skill, but not in control.	positive
title: Another solid introduction from Mel Bay [SEP] content: It's a solid introduction to the bongos and worth the few dollars that I paid. If you don't have anyone knowledgeable guiding your bongos purchase than you're better off buying this first to help you make the best decision.However:The book is tri-lingual (English, Spanish, Portuguese) and there's not 33 pages of information but more like 20.Trevor Salloum also wrote "The Bongo Book" which has more advanced information and everything in this book except for the buying recommendations and a few other minor items. I recommend buying it instead.	positive
title: Goode's review [SEP] content: I had a hard time relating to the heroine at first but as the story progressed I became more sympathetic to her fate.By the end of the book I became very involved in her adventures.	positive
title: jangly indie pop [SEP] content: a mix between belle and sebastian and the anniversary. very lush sound for such a small operation. really good stuff here.	positive
title: This Works!!!! [SEP] content: We bought this bear for our daughter when she was about one month old because she would not sleep in her crib for more than an hour at a time. As soon as we turned it on she started to doze off. She is now 4 months old and we still use it. She loves it and looks for it before she goes to bed. The down side is that you will go through a ton of batteries but its worth it for her to get a good nights sleep (and us too!).	positive
title: Great Alterpieces:Gotic and Renaissance [SEP] content: Fantastic book on the subject.The altarpieces are shown in their integrity wich is difficult to see even when youvisitthe different churches were the altarpieces are preserved.The texts are a little bit cold and the whole book very heavy to consult.	positive
title: Best suits my need. [SEP] content: Initially I bought JBL E35 center speaker, it was good but too heavey to place it on a TV OR it took more space on my entertainment center. This one is just the right size and weight to place it on a TV (scotch strip hold them!), voice is very clear and powerful, some time better than JBL. Very glad with the purchase.	positive
title: Bee-U-Tee-Ful & Quality [SEP] content: For those of you who treasured the lovely little round 8 0z. jar once on market from "B--l, the canning jar compay (sadly they no longer offer) these jars are a "FIND".I have not yet used but these are QUALITY worth the price if you really enjoy your canning supplies.	positive
title: Excellent product! [SEP] content: Our family purchased this for my grandparents as a gift and they absolutely LOVE it. It works great, I only wish we had come across it sooner. Family and friends are able to send pictures, notes, whatever to them and I can manage their account online from my home computer. My only wish is it would somehow let the sender know that the email successfully went through. However, that isn't enough to knock a star down on this item.....it is GREAT!	positive
title: Gift to my daughter [SEP] content: I give this to my daughter it arrived fast. And she loves it so far has only had it a few days. I think I would like one.	positive
title: Really Good Flute! [SEP] content: I have several very expensive handmade wooden Native American Flutes. I find that the sound quality of this flute is comparable, and having a flute that you don't have to worry so much about is great! The tone is very consistent, and the flute is quite playable. Since it is a six-hole flute it is much more versitile than the 5-hole versions offered by many manufacturers.	positive
title: Working the bugs out of their propellent [SEP] content: Contacted the manufacturer and they hope to have it back on shelves before the end of 2010. I'm dying here! I LOVE this stuff!	positive
title: Just AWESOME!!! [SEP] content: This film is destined to be a cult classic. The opening credits set the scene of this satirical look into the horror genre. Chaffee cleverly poked fun at horror movies without ever coming close to slapstick. The script was both witty and intelligent; the acting was top notch; and the production quality is superior. I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of horror flicks.	positive
title: This is truly a page turner! [SEP] content: I loved this book, it fully held my attention and I wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. However, I must say that I did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. Granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but I didn't care for that aspect of the book. The heroine, Dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. She is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. Finally, all I want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you DO want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!	positive
title: Knife, A Cut Above [SEP] content: "Lifeboat" has multiple characters to distract you while viewing. "Knife in fhe Water" has but 3.The sexual tension & temptations of the three, would later be recaptured in 1989's "Dead Calm".Herein, lay the original. In Polanski's native Polish yet provided with subtitles, we watch a stressful dynamic unfurl while a couple minding their business during an outing on the sea, find the need to assist a stranger in apparent need of help.The result, should you see someone in distress, would you help? Do you keep going? In today's society, unfortunately, if you want to live, pass on by....	positive
title: is great [SEP] content: i wait a few days but i recived in perfect conditions is a good toys for kids and for gift is perfect!!!	positive
title: PAN [SEP] content: ARRIVED FAST.LOOKS FINE BUT HAVEN'T USED IT YET.I was pleased with the condition and service.hoping to put it to good use after the holidays.lisa	positive
title: Softer sides Vs. Heavier [SEP] content: I actually preferred the slower tracks on this one... and fell pretty hard for them too. The heavier tracks are there but the softer the better on this one. Scott's vocals, Robert and Eric's jazz-lounge rhythms alongside Dean's talents sound absolutely superb in laid back fashion. Undeniably deep songs.	positive
title: THIS WASSUP! [SEP] content: You did ya thing on this book girl! I enjoyed the entire story from page one all the way to the end. It's always a blessing to see a first time author come in the game and put it down! This is definitely a book to read.	positive
title: Vince Vaughn!! [SEP] content: Vince Vaughn should be Pete Tyler! Keanu Reeves might be okay, too, but Vince Vaughn would be better. John Cusask already played the guy in 'High Fidelity' who was a loser, by the way, and Pete Tyler is much cooler and better boyfriend material. Everyone should read this book 'cause it's great and then write Vince Vaughn and tell him to do the movie!	positive
title: A good read [SEP] content: Don't let the title mislead you, this book is not an instruction manual for creative dying. And don't let the blurb about Christian painter mislead you, Hilary Jackson's art is Christian-themed but the story isn't. The Art of Dying is a mystery, a well-crafted mystery about art and murder.Set in the richly described Northern California village of Steeple Hill, author Diana Killian has put together a book with the elements of a cozy mystery; an innocent observer turned sleuth, a small community of artists, murder without graphic scenes of violence, and yep, even a cat - and the elements of romantic suspense; an attractive British man with amnesia, a kind-hearted young woman who cares for him, a dead Scotland Yard Inspector, lingering doubts about altruism or love, and the question of being mislead by someone who may be a victim or a villain. The pieces all fit together smoothly in a good puzzler.	positive
title: Good RL book... [SEP] content: After reading 4 other Ravenloft books back-to-back-to-back-to-back and not really liking any of them, this book was a nice change. It wasn't fantastic, but based on the other 9 Ravenloft books I've read thus far, this one easily ranks in the upper half. I found the story to be quite interesting and had no problem reading it from beginning to end without ever feeling bored. I do recommend this book but as always, "Vampire of the Mists", "I, Strahd" (both of them) and "Knight of the Black Rose" was better.	positive
title: Works very well [SEP] content: I was surprised at how well this FM transmitter works, especially considering the low price. Of the 8 stations to choose from, 3 come in crystal clear 99% of the time. My only complaint (and this isn't a very big one) is that the station numbers aren't backlit. I'm mostly in the car at night, so it's practically impossible to see what station the transmitter is on without turning on a light. But considering how well it works (and how cheap it is), this problem seems really minor.	positive
title: MotoGear arge Scooter Cover [SEP] content: I received this product a couple of weeks back and was quite suprised with the price and quality of the item. I ordered 2 because my partner and myself recently purchased a couple of scooters. The price inc postage to Australia was amazing, worked out to around $20AUD each, compared to the local price of $65 each. We have has some serious rain here in Melbourne Australia and this product has held it own in the weather. I wouldnt say 100% water proof but does hold up real well in very heavy rain. Great quality and hold clips keeps everything ticked in and well enclosed. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for additional protection for their scooter.	positive
title: It's ergonomic, has a cord, and it works. [SEP] content: Other than the elongated Delete key (on the right) being under the Home key (which used to be where the Insert key was), this keyboard has a nice feel to it. If the cord is not an issue, and you have the space for it (it's bigger than the standard keyboard), then it's worth it. Media and program keys are a bit much, but do add flexability.	positive
title: Great History Unveiled [SEP] content: I have almost finished this book and it is an easy read and very informative. I was never taught a fraction of what is in this book concerning the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The young should be taught true history. The author portrays the evil of this time and it compares with the Nazis actions and the evils of the Russian Revolution. I know we have been allies of France in many wars but to bury the atrocities of history because of this is wrong. It was a time and an evil that gripped a people and has been repeated through out history. Evil is not characteristic to one group or nation. God bless the Catholic martyrs of the French Revolution. We could learn much from the way they lived and died for their Catholic beliefs.	positive
title: Who can resist The Saint? [SEP] content: Roger Moore is at his finest in this series. His true personality shines with zinging one-liners, and of course, what red- or blue-blooded female can resist his amazing good looks!But seriously, these stories are set in the top globe-trotting sites on the planet in the 1960's, which brings back such retro nostalgia. The scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the American series "Batman". The stories themselves are very well-written and the adaptations for television are first-rate.If, like me, you're sick and tired of television programmes today which offer a buffet of violence and sex, with nothing left to the imagination, then I urge you to buy this dvd set and enjoy television from a time when good manners were included, ladies wore hats and gloves to go out and about, and the cars were tres cool.	positive
title: MARTY'S MASTERPIECE: ABSOLUTE POWER AND STYLE [SEP] content: The best metal-melodic album of ever!!!! Agressive tone, lightning-fast solos, unique exotic and arabesque style are some of the things you'll find inside this record. I specially recommend it to any person who does like instrumental music (focused in guitars)with style. Plenty of strenght froma young boy called Marty. He hasn't done anything better after this epic LP.	positive
title: Awesome Santana Compilation [SEP] content: This is probably the best available Santana compilation. It features many classics (live and studio) as well as many great unrealeased Santana live and studio tracks.	positive
title: Takes stress out of dinner [SEP] content: This book has taken stress out of dinner. however, I use it more as a guideline because the recipes are not exactly healthy. I definitely subsitute.	positive
title: Like A Cabin In A Bag [SEP] content: We just wanted to say how happy we are with our Pamo Valley tent. It has worked well for us for over four years now, but this time this tent held up against some of the strongest winds I've ever seen blowing through these mountains. Our stuff stayed safe and we had the time of our lives! In fact we ended up with 6 other folks in our tent - 8 total! It's startin' to be warm weather time, so we'll be getting one of the Paha Que' Cottonwoods soon.	positive
title: If you get one Ken Boothe CD... [SEP] content: I'd say this is the one to get. "Freedom Street" is one of the most passionate rocksteady classics I've ever heard. Boothe is more famous for a kind of sappy lovers style. That stuff is OK, but nothing compared to when Ken cranks up and belts out, "Then take off these chains, from off our feet!" The rest of this CD couldn't possibly measure up, but it's mostly in a rougher style than his other albums. If you're a rocksteady fan, this is what you're looking for from Ken Boothe.	positive
title: amazingly brutal [SEP] content: extreme conditions demand extreme responses was a little too simple but a good debut. brutal truth go experimenting here with hardcore punk and industrial but still manage to keep straight up grind in their music. my favorite on the album is godplayer, it starts out slow and industrialish, then gets insanely fast with kevin sharps screaming vocals. his lyrics are almost indecipherable which is a good thing, it makes the music more brutal. another thing i like about brutal truth is that they don't sing about satan or death like a lot of metal bands. they go against trends and sing political songs and songs about social issues. if you're just an average heavy metal fan this may be to brutal for you but if you like extreme stuff, buy this!	positive
title: The most HELPFUL and WELL written resume/job hunt book ever! [SEP] content: This book was a real find for me. I was over qualified for most of the positions I was applying for but this book helped me get all my 'ducks in a row' and land the job of my dream!! Thanks Mr. Montag. You're great!	positive
title: It Floored Me [SEP] content: This book is a whirlwind of fun from start to finish! I literally zipped through the book and was begging for me... which led me to research the referenced authors on the back jacket which led to me discovering Hiassen and Westlake. In looking back, this book is very similar to Westlake's early work and not much like Hiassen. Someone should make this into a movie!	positive
title: This Book will stay with you for a long time [SEP] content: I read this book years ago but I can still remember it to be one of the best true crime books I have ever read, and I have read alot of them. I often wonder what became of the killers, Chuck and Marlene. One can only imagine. These two teenagers were definately evil and I can't imagine how they could live with themselves. The author should definately write another book on how these two wound up.	positive
title: Great Toaster Oven [SEP] content: I really love this oven. The toaster feature at the top is great!! If you plan on doing cooking in the oven, it is important to preheat and turn the tray from front to back halfway through the cooking time. Things	positive
title: Not Microserfs [SEP] content: Dennis Coupland's Miss Wyoming was not at all what I expected, but it was well worth the wild read. Part social commentary on the cult of celebrity and part gonzo Hollywood buddy book, this is a fun story that has some very poignant moments. From the aging movie producer in recovery to the crazy mom of the former child beauty queen, the characters are well-drawn.The locations lack detail and panache, but the real story here is the people. This book leaves you wanting just a little bit more.	positive
title: Pirates Aboard [SEP] content: This is a good book to read for cruisers. It gives the mariner a heightened sense of awareness that must be taken when anchoring in some places. Having a gun aboard for protection is not the answer and one can see why in the reading.	positive
title: fantastic product, I use it almost daily [SEP] content: I adore this flat iron: it doesn't snag my hair, it is lightweight and easy to handle, travels well, and gets HOT.	positive
title: love comes small [SEP] content: my birds love these small bells great for a smaller size bird. parakeets or lovebirds even cockatiels.	positive
title: Easy Climax [SEP] content: I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever.	positive
title: great for sore/cracked nipples [SEP] content: sore/cracked nipples are very common on breastfeeding moms especially first time moms who doesn't have any clue about latching.1 oz might seems very less but it is good enough. Latching will get way better after the first 3-4 weeks and you might not need to use it afterwards. So there is no need to get a 5oz bottle. Motherlove Herbal Nipple Cream helped me a lot with soreness. Also note that this cream is better used for prevention than cure. So apply it before feeding itself. Also remember to air dry.	positive
title: Don't Buy!!! Spare yourself the hassle (and I'd give it ZERO stars if i could) [SEP] content: I used the Palmolive Eco dishwasher detergent and it left all this white residue all over my dishes! I had to hand wash with an abrasive sponge and it was very hard to get off. I have to spend a few minutes on each dish, scrubbing vigorously to get them clean. I won't be buying this product again and I'm sorry I did in the first place.This "Eco-friendly" detergent is causing me to waste so much water and it contains chlorine bleach...how is that eco-friendly?I'm sure they had good intentions in making this product, but this is just bad stuff!	negative
title: Who's singing? [SEP] content: This recording, like so many of the recordings listed by Myto, IDI, and other such companies has absolutely no information whatsoever regarding cast. I don't know about you, but I not about to "plunk" down my money for an unknown. Without cast information, they can rot on the shelves	negative
title: Uncomfy for baby [SEP] content: We bought this tub before our son was born thinking it looked safe & easy to use. I put him in it once & it was obvious that it was uncomfortable & he had too much room to wriggle about. It just made him scream, and after more thought I realized you'd have to fill it with towels to make it feel cozy & cushy to an infant whose already being overloaded with new experiences. It was much easier, and more fun, to just put him in a regular bath with me on my lap where I could hold him & he could feel the warmth & security of my skin. Save yourself the money!	negative
title: They break ... what more needs to be said? [SEP] content: Unacceptably fragile ... both broke within a dozen or so uses. Used them in nothing but standard-sized wine bottles of various common varietals. Did not place any undue pressure on them to insert, but they still developed hairline cracks with a few uses, which eventually lead to complete fractures running the length of the product. Does not seem like I got a few lemons ... seems like a flat-out design flaw. Too bad, because when it comes to their stated purpose, you really couldn't lose a stray drop of wine with these if you tried. Unfortunately, staying in one piece is kind of an important feature for me. Will be trying the flexible foil-style pourers instead.	negative
title: Worked great for 10 months [SEP] content: What can I say...I bought this for my bathroom which is lacking a ventilation fan and has tremendous moisture issues. I left the unit on 24/7 and it worked very well, with the water basin needing to be emptied every 2-3 days. Unfortunately, after 10 months, the unit started just making a buzzing sound and the fan wouldn't work. I tried to open it up and replace the fan, but it turns out the circuit board is cooked. Since I opened up the unit, I voided the warranty and the company won't honor it. What can I say...$50 is a lot of money for 10 months of use.	negative
title: disappointing [SEP] content: I saw the "Picasso" play in Laguna Beach, and was disappointed. I'm a Steve Martin fan, and a fan of the theater. But, frankly, this seemed like a play that was written by a TV gag man (Martin wrote the old "Smothers Brothers" show.) It was very very two-dimensional, considering its intellectual pretentions. Frankly, I think Martin is a first rate comedic actor, and stand-up comedy writer and performer. But the only screenplay he wrote that was good was ROXANNE, and that was good because he just updated--and did a twist on--"Cyrano De Bergerac." He is NOT good at long narrative fiction. He's good--often brilliant-- at small bytes (which is why PURE DRIVEL is good). He should stick to what he does best.	negative
title: Wrong Impression [SEP] content: I purchased this book specifically because it said it was a large print book - it wasn't. The font in the book was a "normal" font like the majority of books have. Obviously the seller doesn't know what LARGE print is. I just wasted my money on a book that I already had but needed to buy the large print version for my elderly mother. Won't be buying from this person again when it comes to books since they don't know what they are talking about.	negative
title: A piece of junk [SEP] content: Don't waste your money to buy this battery!!!!!!Even it is fully charged, it only able to take less than 10 photos or give you message "please change the battery". Save your money to buy canon brand which is working a lot better.	negative
title: Engine failed [SEP] content: The waterject failed to operate after a few times (less than 10). The engine is dead, no water came out.	negative
title: Great Play Bad Edition [SEP] content: Hamlet is one of the greatest plays ever written, and you should absolutely buy a copy and read it. But you should not buy this edition. There are no line numbers, the character names are abbreviated, and the spacing is weird. Of particular concern for students and others not familiar with the play is the lack of footnotes to help provide context or clarify difficult language. I wish I had thought to read the reviews before I purchased this edition.	negative
title: i'm with you all.... [SEP] content: I won't be buying the Fraggle Rock series until Season 4 is released individually. Hell, there are plenty of great episodes from the first three seasons to keep me entertained until then. I'm with you all.... don't buy this product.	negative
title: A letdown [SEP] content: I was very excited to read this book on the plane to Beijing, but it was a big letdown. I have great respect for all who served the U.S. in the military, but as an exciting wartime spy book, Journey to Peking, is not very interesting. Also, the author portrays the Chinese he comes in contact with as shallow fools, and that got old for me real quick.	negative
title: Don't waste your money [SEP] content: Just opened the package and used the thermometer. Probe is about 2 or 3 inches too short. If I were to use this on my BBQ I would get burned. Secondly, display is to pale, hard to see. Older folks with less than 20-20 eyesighjt can't use this. I also bought one for my mother-in-law, I won't give it to here, she won't be able to see the display. Color is way too red.My thoughts: I wasted my money	negative
title: too expensive and breaks too easy [SEP] content: I bought this for my classroom and within a month it stopped working. To be honest with you, you can find a much cheaper sharpener for the same quality.	negative
title: Not Real Good Quality [SEP] content: Fairly low vibration and was not up to my expectation! I believe that it is better to only order products which take AA or AAA batteries, and not use ones with built-in batteries.	negative
title: Disappointing [SEP] content: This book is a collection of ho-hum stories. The Nebula awards must be looking the other way - David G Hartwell has a far superior collection in Best SF 7.Only a few days after reading it, not one story has stuck in my mind.	negative
title: Desperately searching for an editor. [SEP] content: This book really needed to be edited to smooth out the rough spots and eliminate the numerous errors, including stray words and even a few misplaced sentences. I spent my career as an editor (technical documents, not fiction) and I know the value that an editor can add.This author also used a lot of strained similes. I could go back through the book and quote some examples, but they were painful enough the first time.I cannot recommend this book.	negative
title: Great product but horrible taste [SEP] content: I've recently stopped by the store that sells these shakes because I've heard good and bad things about the shakes. I know that they actually do help you lose weight but they are MEAL REPLACERS MEANING THAT THEY WANT YOU TO STOP EATING NORMAL FOOD AND HAVE A SHAKE INSTEAD. People say you get energy and feel so great and lose a lot but at the same time they taste terrible.The flavors are disgusting and since all it is is powder and aloe I could feel the powder in my mouth and throat for a while and also ended up feeling sick. The woman who lost so much weight for these said the only meal she has is dinner.They work but have a terrible taste.	negative
title: Sucks [SEP] content: I had high hopes from this book but this didn't meet my expectations. Names were weird and old fashioned.	negative
title: No Customer service - anywhere! [SEP] content: I bought a set of these lights. Supplied switch is defective. Supplier says Amazon has to handle problem. Amazon says they can't handle problem. Same old finger-pointing junk. Who get screwed? Guess who...? The customer. Very poor Hella! Very poor Amazon!	negative
title: Not the real deal, OK copy [SEP] content: The good news it seems to work OK in my IBM T60. The bad news, as others have commented, this is a misleading product. The description says its made by Lenovo it is not. The label on the fake product is a very poor copy of a IBM PATA hard drive bay adapter. My genuine IBM PATA hard drive adapter has a FRU P/N of 62P4553. The same P/N on the fake SATA bay adapter, not the 40Y8725 P/N called out in the product description. I purchased this fake product because other people have had good luck with it working. Just be warned that the product description is very misleading.	negative
title: Synchronization Doesn't Work [SEP] content: This product proved to WASTE more time than provide a friendly time-saving fix. I realized that the device synchronized some of my appointments, but not all-day events like birthdates and anniversaries. I also realized that none of my Outlook address book contacts were synchronized. This device is a waste of money, for any customer. I received this item as a christmas gift. After realizing that a PDA was a great idea, I chose to purchase a HP iPAQ h1935 Pocket PC. It sells for 200.00 and is worth every penny. If you are a mobile phone user, I would recommend purchasing a Samsung i700 which combines a Pocket PC with digital camera and cellphone.	negative
title: The most frightening polital tome since Mein Kampf [SEP] content: Justice Breyer outlines how a gang of five should overthrow our constitution, for our own good, of course. As Lord Acton said, "Power tends to corrupt. Absolute power corrupts absolutely."	negative
title: Compelling Moments, but Disappointing Overall [SEP] content: I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it. There were several things that did trouble me however:1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person. I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her. Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived. Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements.3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting. For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian.5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy.	negative
title: why [SEP] content: I'm supposed to write a review on this and I don't know why. I do not know what this is or what it is about and I don't recall ever purchasing it.	negative
title: so fake, so un real, so far fetched [SEP] content: jet engines do not run after a bad crash. The writers of this show must have found some LSD left overs. so	negative
title: Beware. This book has almost killed me [SEP] content: Sturve bacteria to death. And where, in bowels (!?) What an increadible idea ! By using this diet you practically illiminate any iron containing food from your menu. So if you have digestive deasese and most likely, already having difficulties absorbing Vitamin B complex and iron - you are on the way to killing yourself. After being on SCD for 7 months and becoming progressively weak and pale, I've had a routine blood test done, which came up with Hematocrite of 23 (!) At that point my physycian was insisting on blood transfusion, but I was lucky to get out of the situation with just Iron pills.	negative
title: does not deserve to carry the title "12 Chairs" [SEP] content: "Twelve Chairs" is one of the greatest classics of Russian literature, the 1977 movie rendition of it (directed by Mark Zakharov) is simply an excellent movie. In comparison (and actually, even without one) this Mel Brooks film is simply pathetic. It is, actually, beyond me why Brooks would choose this poignantly satirical work for a slap-stick comedy. If this is the only version of "12 Chairs" that you have seen, or read, then you have no idea of what that book is all about.	negative
title: Mobile Library [SEP] content: The greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. Most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. This device could revolutionize the future of reading.The downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). Secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. If you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. While the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.In short, I would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot. If you already have a large book collection, I wouldn't go getting rid of it for this product. Besides, what if your power goes out for a week and you can't charge it? What are you going to do, stare at it?	negative
title: Predictable, Dumb and Moronic [SEP] content: I can't believe a star of Lea Thompson's caliber or such a controversial comic like Andrew Dice Clay would agree to star in this film. It tries to make a dark humorous statement about AIDS in the 80s and fails. Dice-Clay's character is likeable, but your stereotypical Jersey guy, and I can't believe he agreed to recite such idiotic lines.While the beginning of the film is ok, it quickly disintegrates into mindless dribble. I get this impression this film was targeted at the adolescent male audience, with lots of sex and some nudity thrown in for good measure. Predictable and formulaic, this tacky little film is not worth your money. What a shame that the talented cast of this film had to utter such stupid, inane dialogue. How amazing that such a ridiculous, badly written script was made into a movie.	negative
title: centrum vitamins [SEP] content: I used to take the old formula with no problems. Something about this one has me getting really sick. It took me a while to figure that it was this vitamin making me sick. After taking this tablet with food or after food, In about 15 minutes I start to feel severe pain around my chest, hardly able to breath. It happened at work and I almost called 911 and my husband, I was sure it was a heart attack. Good thing I waited and after about 1 hour I was OK. I waited a few weeks and tried it again, exact same thing happened. Now I am stuck with a huge bottle of vitamins I cannot use.	negative
title: Asi asi! [SEP] content: I love Marc Anthony's vocal range and passion, and I've been waiting to hear the follow-up to his outstanding English-language debut CD. "Mended" doesn't come anywhere close to what he delivered the first time. There's enough regurg music out there! Don't submerge this extraordinary voice with lukewarm arrangements. Perhaps for the next album Marc will corroborate with the great team he worked with on the first one. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!	negative
title: Do not waste your time [SEP] content: This was this was my first book on my kindle so I was really lookind forward to it. Sadly, it was cliche in so many ways and the ending left so many unresolved issues. I would like to say more but do not want to reveal anything in case someone decides to read it anyway. All I can say is I would not recommend this book.	negative
title: Absolute Garbage [SEP] content: There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well.	negative
title: WON'T FIT YOUR 2003 MERCEDES E320!!!! [SEP] content: I ordered this filter a month ago - outside of the return window. Now that I found out where to install it, I can't - It won't fit. If you want it, come and get it. Don't trust the application info Amazon provides. This filter isn't even close to the right size for ANY 2003 mercedes E class car.	negative
title: Not so close shave [SEP] content: About the only thing I like about this razor is the battery charge seems to hold up quite well. I don't have a heavy beard, and would expect a fairly close shave, but I am left with what feels like a five o'clock shadow. Probably sould have spent the extra bucks and bought a Braun.	negative
title: Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere [SEP] content: Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the "heroine" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her "individuality" and that's about it. George Harrison's song "I Me Mine" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch.	negative
title: A load of crap. [SEP] content: Satanists worship Satan, hence the name. The basis of witchcraft began in old Europe around the Black Sea circa 5000 B.C. It involved the first form of dance and prayer, and a very fat maternal figure. Our principals were set long before Christians invented Satan. If you want history read The Wiccan Mysteries. That's homework. You might want to take a closer look at the Horned God. You'll have a hard time making a vicious hell beast out of Bambie's Dad. Thankfully, George Bush has not yet succeeded at recalling the right to religious freedom. Ho-ya! And next time you accuse people of something put down your name coward.	negative
title: Safe you money! [SEP] content: I dont think this was a vary good game at all.I saw it on the shelf at toys R us and thought it whould be a fun game for my 5 year old.Wean i got home he beat it in about 20 minuits i whatched him play it thare wasent that much to do in it expect bulid a rocket avoid swiper drive a car and fly to the purple planet.After the game my son was vary upset so we went back after lunch and we saw a game called sonic the hedgehog it was alot more callengeing for him and it didnt take about 3 minuits to load like the other one did we also got are 30$ back wean we returend it.We have had to other dora games that wernt so good ether I think that Nick.Jr jest wants your money on these sort games that get you so upset.I think you should choose something else besides this	negative
title: Pet-A-Roo Pet Carrier [SEP] content: This Pet Carrier will not hold any pet up to 20 lbs as stated in the product description. I have a small puppy that is 5 lbs and it is still too small for her. She barely fits in. I would say it is more for a pet weighing up to 3 lbs and no more then that.	negative
title: Cheap, Disappointing and Mailing It Back [SEP] content: After doing extensive research on a thermos style coffee pot, I bought this. I am not sure how this thing has gotten so many good reviews. We have a Zojirushi bread maker that we love dearly but this is a piece of junk. I don't recommend buying this, especially at this price. It may not break, but it feels like it will and is poorly designed.	negative
title: Buyer Beware [SEP] content: I bought two of these earbud sets to go with LG phones. They arrived promptly, but although the packaging was identical the items inside were not. In addition, they did not match what is pictured on this website. The ear bud sets that I received looked used, and they did not work with my LG phones. I contacted the seller for information on returning the items (I had to pay to ship them back...fyi), and after I confirmed with the seller a week later that they had received the items, I was told they would process my refund. Two weeks and several emails after that, I only received the proper refund when I informed Webtreo that I had disputed the charge with my credit card company.	negative
title: corny wack Movie [SEP] content: Ben Stiler is the kind of Cat that I can respect for keeping a Actign Hustle going,but His films are so fluffy&lame it hurts. Jack Black has Potential but is trapped into One trick Pony status as a Actor.this film is boring from start to finish&never reaches a point of hitting at what it was suppose to.	negative
title: I HATE IT !!!!!!!!! [SEP] content: If your an insomniac in need of sleep, this movie is for you. You'll sleep better than you ever have during this movie. I share the same opinion of this movie as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character Elaine Benes in Seinfeld."Seinfeld: The English Patient" (1997)[Elaine and Peterman are watching "The English Patient". Elaine is about to freak out of boredom]Elaine Benes: [quietly] No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long.Elaine Benes: [yells] Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert, and just die already! DIE!J. Peterman: [surprised] Elaine, you don't like the movie?Elaine Benes: [shouts] I hate it![the audience shushes Elaine]Elaine Benes: [shouts back] Oh, go to hell!	negative
title: Must Style Preclude Function? [SEP] content: No index, no page numbers, no captions to the photos--teasing out the credits for them is hard enough. This book is pretty, using very au courant page and font layout and colors, photos of the latest "it" gals and guys (Cameron Diaz, Salma Hayek, Samuel L. Jackson), their clothes and hair(slip dresses, blue eye shadow, twin sets, bouffy hair). This book is going to be out of date in about ten seconds from now. Buy a Vogue magazine instead--at least you'll know who the models are and whose clothes they're wearing.	negative
title: way too simple [SEP] content: This book is far too basic. Almost all of the book isabout very simple electrical concepts; the "hydroniccontrols" portions are only examples of these generalconcepts. I was greatly disappointed with the book --most manufacturer's web sites have much better andmore understandable descriptions.	negative
title: Deceptive, Not Really Compatible With Windows XP [SEP] content: Although this product claims to be XP-compatible, it doesn't really work unless you first change your system settings to run in Windows 98 compatibility mode, and set virtual memory settings back to 200MB. Even though the outer box says Windows XP, copyright dates inside the jewel case make it obvious this is really pre-XP software that has not been updated.Since we use our computer for other things besides games, the only way my son can play is to wait for 5-10 minutes' worth of switching to an admin user account, changing memory settings, then restarting the computer. When he finishes, we have to put the memory settings back again so we can use the computer for other things.	negative
title: Thunderbolt as an aircraft [SEP] content: The movie/DVD was not a description of the origin of the P-47, how it was employed as a fighter, the tactics employed and its opponents (FW-190, Me-109 etc) armaments, and development during WW-2. This was a feel good presentation as bomber, for which it was ill-equiped to function. No performance was given or comparisons made to other US aircraft. The P-51, P-38, the British Spitfire and Hurricane being good examples.	negative
title: Buy Demons & Wizards Instead [SEP] content: Having only been familiar with Demons & Wizards (the side-project of Iced Earth's Jon Schaffer and Blind Guardian's Hansi Kursch - a project which I absolutely love) I figured it was high time to check out Schaffer's prime band. I could not have been more disappointed. If The Blessed and the Damned is Iced Earth's "Best Of", I will definately not be wasting my time checking out their other cds. This may sound harsh, but I had high expectations after listening to Demons & Wizards. Schaffer, hook back up with Hansi and make a third D&W cd. Please!	negative
title: Dry reading [SEP] content: Packed full of information but very dry reading. I think it doesn't engage the reader very well. I bought this book for a college course and found it difficult to read (and I have database experience) because the material was just well, dry and redundant. Could have been way better.	negative
title: Disappointed [SEP] content: I was very excited for this to arrive and when it did it was broken. And it must have been broken before it was shipped because it was the wall of one of the trays that snapped off. And all of the trays are made of cardboard. I remember when they were made of PLASTIC...but clearly that is a thing of the past. Thankfully Amazon's return policy is fabulous and I will get my money back. For $50 not only should the product have been quality checked before it left, but it should be made better as well.	negative
title: Not Dance Music [SEP] content: This CD is not dance music, which is all my narrow mind is interested in. It may be great for listening or whatever, but its not dance and it should not be listed under dance pop.john	negative
title: for pitchshifter diehards only [SEP] content: this is a pretty interesting EP, but will probably only appeal to diehard pitchshifter fan who needs every single EP, remix, single that this awesome band has ever put out. along the same lines as the couple of remix albums that fear factory did back in the 90s, in that the remixes are interesting but not really as good as the originals.	negative
title: The videos aren't bad, but the presentation is horrible... [SEP] content: "All is Full of Love" is a brilliant video in every respect - it's perverse and transcendent at the same time, mixing in humaniform robots with flowing water and hard ceramic - it looks like the future of robot porn.However, what makes me only able to listen to it for brief periods is the menus. Whoever decided that it'd be a good idea to play a hideous cacaphony of every song on the disk, apparently played backwards and at high speed during the menu screens, ought to be horsewhipped for ruining an otherwise good disk. (Even if it is Chris Cunningham.) When the menu screens make you want to take the disk out and throw it out the window, you gotta reconsider the wisdom of doing that.Fortunately, I believe that "All is Full of Love" is available on another Bjork video collection, so I'll buy that and sell this one to the local CD/Video concern.-Darren MacLennan	negative
title: Dosent work [SEP] content: I tried this model for a long time. The blade consistantly veared off to one side cutting the pill 75% - 25% with the 25% side be crushed to poweder. i would give less than 1 star if i could.	negative
title: These suck [SEP] content: Small...plus the focus is bad, not what I was expecting. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for some good binoculars.	negative
title: Way over their heads [SEP] content: I purchased this dvd for $5 shipped and thought it would be a great deal, but I was wrong. I admire the creator Phil Vischer and thought the content would be really sound. The content was fine, but the delivery was not geared towards young children. Having witty puppets intermingled with explanations about the Septuagint is not going to keep the attention of the average child. My five-year-old and three-year-old were quickly lost and never regained much interest. I gave it two stars because I learned some things, but I'm guessing that I'm not their target audience.	negative
title: Not Interesting [SEP] content: Book is written in a blah fashion.A lot of pages but no color photos.If I had to do over,I wouldnt buy this book...Dennis	negative
title: Couldn't understand what it's about!!!! [SEP] content: It's confused movie, and does not go to any direction.A BIG TIME confused movieeeeeee, boring, messed up movie.Does not worth to spend time to watch it.	negative
title: Why was this written? [SEP] content: This is the first review I've written. I usually just read the reviews written by other people but I felt compelled to write one about this book. I cannot understand why Mr. Jordan wrote this book. The book goes nowhere. A lot of characters I've never heard of, or will probably never hear of again were introduced. Absolutly nothing was accomplished, moved forward or resolved. What a "LET DOWN". I really like the Wheel of Time series, but if Mr. Jordan can't come up with anything better than this book, he has lost himself a reader.	negative
title: Exaggerated Fiction in Academia [SEP] content: This book was reviewed in the local paper and the review made is sound like an interesting tour thru academia. Some of it was; but, all in all, the politically correctness of the characters was exaggerated to the extreme. I am sure that somewhat similar people exist here and there, but to put them all together makes for pure fantasy.Hynes character description is detailed and very humorous. Without this I would not give even a two star rating. Also his "one liners" bring on a chuckle.The ending borders on the ridiculous. Perhaps it had a deeper meaning than I was able to fathom, but male and female bodies interchanging, spirits (or someone) jumping off a parapet. academics having a free for all shootout on a lonely campus, towers collapsing in a conflagration, etc., etc. How much liberty can an author take with fiction. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this.	negative
title: Almost worst jerky I've ever had! [SEP] content: This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all. I repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. If you think this will be ANYTHING like Jack Link's peppered jerky, or ANY peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed.	negative
title: Next time, at least get a REAL fan to proofread your BOOTLEG TRASH!! [SEP] content: I was just about to.............but then upon closer inspection, I realized there were a bunch of people that were duped into buying this as an authentic item. They were all selling this on a very very well known auction website. Anyways, honestley If you are going to bootleg leg something even if its old VH1's video clips, atleast don't have the temerity to list all the information on the back of the case with one single ERROR. IT PIPES OF PEACE......not pipes of SPACE. Also for the time period they covered they excluded the videos O'uest Di Soeil & Put it there,(which is one of my favorites, by the way). Save your money on this,if you want the real thing your going to have to wait for Macca to release the whole load as a compilation DVD one day. Till then you'll just have to do what the Japanese do, Laser disc collect.	negative
title: Soooo. sooooo bad [SEP] content: After I bought it I told my daughter and she said that she got one 4 years ago and it did not work. I thought that they would have had to improve it by now. First of all the beaters do not have a shaft going throiugh the middle and a tiny bolt holds them together at the bottom. This seems to weaken the beaters. I tried to cream butter and it threw the butter out of the bowl in chunks. It was sooooo bad. I was very digusted at how badly it preformed...... nothing like the older mixmasters. I took it back and ordered some older models from Ebay to give as gifts for my kids. Even the refurbished ones that are from the 40s or 50s would definately be better to purchase than this terrible, but attractive piece of work! ...	negative
title: DISAPPOINTED!!!! [SEP] content: I am a strict vegetarian who does not use any animal products, so you can imagine my shock when I opened my shipment and found that there were REAL COWHIDE slippers inside!!!! The description clearly says 'FAUX' and the box that came was NOT faux. The description is incorrect in the listing, or someone slipped the wrong pair into the shipment by accident - TWICE!!! Either way - horrible mistake!!!! I bought a pair for my father and one for my boyfriend, who is also a strict vegetarian. Both boxes contained real cowhide slippers. (Why does Amazon NOT let you choose zero stars?)	negative
title: Come See The Worst Album In The History Of Music... [SEP] content: Whoever should read this beware. This is the worst album I have ever had the displeasure of attempting to listen too. The songs are bad, the words are bad and Don Johnson is just plain bad. Don Johnson should take a hint from this album and just quit his job and go live on a desert island. Why do you think MTV and VH1 have declared they will never show this video again. If your name is Don Johnson and you are reading this I mean no harm, in fact I'm trying to prevent this album from taking millions of innocent lives. Say no to "Heartbeat," just say no.	negative
title: Total disappointment [SEP] content: I bought this product with high hopes after reading the product reviews. Recently spent a ton of money re-landscaping our yard and putting down new grass. As soon as we finished Mr.Mole appeared and started tearing it all up. Reviews here were awesome so I gave the product a try. Used all 6 whole worms. Didn't touch the worn with my fingers or with anything with my scent on it. Found frequently traveled holes to put them in. Waited a week. No results. Mole still lives. Feel like I'm on "CaddyShack". The worst thing? Mr.Mole continued to use the tunnels I put the worm in, even pushed the worms out of the tunnel in a dirt pile. 3 of the 6 worm locations resulted in big dirt patches. Moles hunt by finding the vibrations their food gives off when moving... Not sure why I thought an immobile product would work. Time to call the exterminator. Save your money. This product doesn't work.	negative
title: Terrible [SEP] content: It is better to buy an inexpensive one because when the ice melts it leaks through the wood and I have to keep going back to put ice in the bucket because the space is so small. I have one that I bought for $16 and all I have to do is put the ice in one time and wait until it is done. It is not worth getting.	negative
title: Have never received this book!!!!! No response after inquiring!!! [SEP] content: Have NOT received this book - promised 3/25. It is now 6/22- no book!! Unable to get a response of any kind!!!! I've emailed - telephoned - all have gone unanswered.Believe I'm entitled to some explanation!!!!It is now 8/10 and still have NOT received either the book or reply from anyone!!	negative
title: All over the place [SEP] content: I honestly wanted to believe this album was going to be good. I mean here we have five guys who worked to make it. We got to see every little step they took on TV and of course you wanted to root for them. But as much as I wanted to believe I had to face reality. They are an extreme wannabe clone of N'Sync. The album goes from super sappy pop to look at me I can be down with hip-hop/r*b. The music lacks production and the music lacks a concept. The mediocre single Liquid Dreams (have you heard the lyrics!?) and the song Girl are the best songs other than that you're looking at one of the most dissapointing albums.	negative
title: Not the normal reasoned republican book. [SEP] content: Savage is insulting. I am Cuban American, a yellowdog Republican, and yet he still gets under my skin. His books are filled with nativeist, authoritarian, and conspiratorial sentiments. In one chapter he advocates the clubbing of suspects by law enforcement! This is what I expect in Castro's Cuba, not in my parents adopted homeland.If you are looking for an amusing book for a lazy afternoon buy it, but this definitely shouldn't be considered by anyone who takes politics or current events seriously. His writing is wholly dependent on provoking paranoia to such a degree that his fear mongering can be compared to Marxist and NeoLiberal diatribes.	negative
title: Way to sensitive [SEP] content: This collar will spray at the slightest sound or movement. Unless you want your dog to lay perfectly still all day, this won't work. My dog gets sprayed constantly - and it can 't be returned. Although it also sprays when he barks.	negative
title: ....Ehhh... [SEP] content: ....OK For The 6th. Grade Comic Book Reader..(Do Kids Still Read Comics?)..For Adults, It's Insulting & Moronic..!...A REEL STINKER..!	negative
title: Item not as described. [SEP] content: The description for this clock is Large Lighted Readout clock. However that is not the case. The clock is so small and you can barely read the time. The light only stays on for 5 seconds with the push of a button. I would not recommend this product.	negative
title: Could've been better. [SEP] content: Like the songs from Linkin Park and Goo Goo Dolls. Thought the other songs could've been better - a lot better. Especially the Transformes theme song. I do not like this version at all. The version by Lion on the original animated movie is much better.Also much better, and a more recent version, is a version of the song done by Black Lab. This should've been on the album and would've been good for the closing credits of the movie as well. [...] and you can hear their version (and see some YouTube videos of the song).I, too, hope an orchestral soundtrack of the movie comes out.	negative
title: Portraits of My Life: Looking Back As a Adult Child of Alcoholism [SEP] content: I ordered this book because I too am an adult child of an alcoholic. The book is a collection of letters written by the author about her relationship with her father an alcoholic and her relationship with her mother the woman who married him. I don't know where you would find this book in a book store, it is not fiction, it is not a biography or a autobiography, and it certainly not a self help book. The subject of the book spiked my interest, the writing did not!!	negative
title: GO TO TARGET!! TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!! [SEP] content: I got the 24 double rolls for $10 (on sale) from Target . This price is double.	negative
title: I am concerned. [SEP] content: This product was the tops with us. We absolutely loved it and it saved us so much time. However, after only owning it 6 months, my 12 year old son used it and the plug started on fire. We were using a normal outdoor extension cord,He could of got electricuted.I am concerned this might happen to someone else too.And... I am not sure what to do with the machine we have.	negative
title: Hi! [SEP] content: Yo, I hate the band N'SUCK and I really don't want you to buy this cd. After reading the review stating what you REALLY get (it actually helped me), I have come to the conclusion that I needed to write a bad review (since for some reason this cd has no bad reviws and hardly any reviews, so I thought if I wrote a bad review, the overall score would acually go down *evil laugh*, because N'SUNC cds don't deserve overall ratings of 5). Moving on, I have no idea why anyone would purchase an interview cd. WHF?! Yea, dude, just chillin', listening to N'SUCK answer lame question where I don't really care about their answer, I just wanna hear their HOT voices, ohhhhhh! And who wants to listen to "Tearin' Up My Heart" I couls write MUCH better lyrics then that, folks, they say you WAY too much. If you really like the song, safe your money and watch the (very funny) Clueless episode where N'SUCK sing at that girls birthday party (I havn't watched Clueless in a LONG time). PEACE OUT!	negative
title: Not one of Salvatore's finest [SEP] content: I didn't care for this story at all. The story moved very slowly and the characters were very shallow. I kept waiting for the story to pick up, and was sorely disappointed when the predictable end came. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that Salvatore introduced a Dwarf cleric and I was impressed with this new character. Drizz't fans all over will be disappointed.	negative
title: Poor Movie Format [SEP] content: Movie is formated such that it's less than TV resolution. This is the second movie I've rented on Amazon like this. Amazon needs to step up and tell us what the format is. I'm going to be very reluctant about renting another video from Amazon if they can't be forcoming on the format.	negative
title: Who is Lothar Bellag? [SEP] content: This item is misidentified. Lothar is some author and has no connection with this tape. I bought this used through Amazon.com and it is a recording of a live broadcast from Dresden in 1992. The performance includes only three of the six cantatas that make up the Christmas Oratorio. The performance is lackluster and the video is fuzzy, having been converted to NTSC from the European PAL video system. The audio has a strange tapping noise heard between numbers. The harpsichord gets increasingly out of tune as the performance goes on. Someone bought this video when a public library dumped it and has foisted it off onto unsuspecting Internet buyers. The best performance on video is conducted by Beringer and includes all six cantatas and no strange noises.	negative
title: Boring [SEP] content: Unfortunately, the author - a fine illustrator - has little to no original insight into North Korea, and this is a rather uninteresting and trite description of his time in the country.	negative
title: SVAT Wireless Control [SEP] content: Sorry: I ordered TWO...One is working fineOne failed in the battery contact area within days.Customer Service there was good at getting me a new one.It is a SHAME that a seemingly well made product should fail due to a little thing like a poor spring in the battery contact.I LOVE AMAZON overall...best in the business.Wiliam Wells	negative
title: Cannot recommend [SEP] content: When burning an audio cd both WMP and realplayer recognize a blank cd and go through the burning process. Unfortunately, an error message pops up saying that the cd could not be burned, that there may be a problem with the cd or the drive. The process renders the disk unusable. If you've attempted to burn the cd using realplayer, you may be able to play the cd in the car just know that you won't be able to skip tracks, some of the tracks will stutter and skip like a scratched record and some tracks just won't play at all. I am currently in possession of a stack of shiny but ultimately useless drink coasters.	negative
title: You Get What You Pay For [SEP] content: I was greatly disappointed to find out that the person on the other end of the phone could not hear me and I couldn't hear them. It sounded like I was in a tunnel. Others that have this headset have told me they were also disappointed. I would return it but don't know how!	negative
title: I can't wait for the next one! [SEP] content: P.D. James is my favorite writer of this particular genre. In this book, I would have wished that her characters and plot had been tied more to our univeral angst. I would like to know of her tale of the common folks living very much in these times, especially those us living in but not of the world of commerce and the drama of rising and falling stock markets. I didn't care about any of these characters, even Adam seemed so one dimensional. If lives full of anachronisms is what we are about these days, Ms. James succeeded. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps the characters of this book do represent the self absorbed, aggressors we all live with these days. I am however,waiting for and will appreciate her gift of a new novel as I do all of them. Give Adam his soulful thoughts back again, please.	negative
title: DANGER!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP] content: please think when you purchace this toy when I put in the batteries incorecly it blew up and burt my arm and killed 2 of my pet ants it was vwey sad. but on the other hand I think this toy teachs a child the responsebility raising a pet also its poket sized and very fun so try to be carful!!!!!!!!!!!!!	negative
title: bad mac toe [SEP] content: it did not last me for one week ,the sole came off ,it's not worth the money.wasted.,i need my money back or replacement with something else.	negative
title: Not the best soundtrack. [SEP] content: I did not really like this CD. The only songs I liked on the CD were the two Nsync songs and the one that Joey Fatone sings. I think he sounds great. I thought it would have been better.	negative
title: Biblical Misunderstanding [SEP] content: It still amazes me that those who consider themselves to be Christians (after Christ; not Moses or Solomon, etc.)still keep some of what is "called" Biblical law. The Old Testament is a history book which is to lead a believer to the NEW Covenant which has put the Old Covenant (Old Testament) to rest. I shudder to think that the author of this booklet believes that Christ wants them to hit babies and children. Christ taught discipleship. The word 'disciple' means to bring one along side and teach them by instruction and example; not hitting or any other form of violence. I pray that the readers of such books and booklets will follow the example of Christ rather than an outdated, fulfilled, and cast-off Covenant which is no longer in effect.

title: watch a test pattern instead [SEP] content: I paid good money for this thing so i can say what i like.This movie is suppose to put bond movies to shame,mission:failure.It copies every thing from those movies and still bites the big one.I love pointless action and unbelievable stunts but these are plain stupid.The only reason to watch is asia argento and her tattoo mmmmmmmm.vin diesel cant save this junk.	negative
title: Not Happy Velcro [SEP] content: Piece Of Junk, Way To Big For My Pitbull/Bulldog. The Velcro Came Off After The First Week I Purchased It So Upsetting. The Stitching On It Is Not All That Neither The Velcro. I Ended Up Trying To Stitch It Back To Make It More Fitting But Nope That Did Not Work So I Ended Up Buying Something Fitting And Warmer. Waste Of Money I Wish I Can Get My Money Back.	negative
title: communist propaganda [SEP] content: This book is obviously just another sad attempt of the CCP to continue to brainwash its citizenry and those most unquestioning souls around the world. Pathetic, unscholarly and ridiculous. Read "Zhuan Falun".	negative
title: For a class [SEP] content: I'm finding it rather boring and haven't really learned anything new at this point. If you aren't already a teacher, you may find it more useful.	negative
title: Wait, what the [heck]? [SEP] content: Alright, this was NOT MSI. This was Urine and Righ? being goofy. 39 tracks of sound f/x and odd vocals, nothing that really qualifys as an actual song. More like a bunch of jingles for obscene & incomprehensable products. I had ordered it in hopes of getting something with a little more musically quality in it, and I guess I'm just dissapointed that it didn't have any discernable songs. However, I think this CD is amazingly funny, and it's really just something anyone could put on as background music and be entertained for the half hour it runs. Actually, this CD is only 26 minutes long. Another downside and dissapointemnt. [Heck], it would have gotten a better rating from me if it had simply been a little longer.	negative
title: Not exactly what I paid for [SEP] content: Reasonable price, good flexibility but some focusing issues and a real killer-I get an "error" message frequently (perhaps 90% of the time by simply turning it on). The thermal circuit attempts to protect the camera-even when stable at room temperature. I have not cracked the code on getting support. This problem is difficult to work around. Bad enough not to recommend this product.	negative
title: This ain't worth it! Get the Extended version [SEP] content: Just release the DAMN extended version. You are going to earn A LOT from it so don't dupe us anymore from buying both copies. Just release the DAMN Extended version!	negative
title: Disjointed and melodramatic [SEP] content: This book had all of the elements of a great story. Unfortunately, the author didn't deliver a great story. The writing was clumsy and disjointed, the dialogue was melodramatic and unbelievable, the characters were not very likable, and the ending was disappointing.	negative
title: THIS BOOK WAS NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT. [SEP] content: As I said in the top the book was good but not as good as I thought. I think that if you had nothing to do but read a book, than this is the book for you.	negative
title: Omron Missed with This One [SEP] content: Based on so many positive reviews, I thought this is what I need. The first few weeks were great and I especially liked the belt clip that came with - very convenient. But then the aerobic steps measure quit working after three+ weeks and the software became intractible as I attempted to record no aerobic steps. This unit is in the junkyward now.	negative
title: Budget price = Budget product [SEP] content: I received this as a Christmas present after (foolishly) putting it on my list. Let's just say I regret costing my brother $65. Right out of the box, it didn't work. I adjusted the batteries, played around a bit with the USB receiver, and it finally connected. After about 10 minutes of use, it disconnected. Repeated steps 1-2, used for an hour this time, and it stopped working again.So I called tech support and got the answering machine. 10 times in a row, on 10 different days. Emailed them. Never got a response.My advice is to spend your money more wisely and get a better product. This one is not it.	negative
title: if you need someone to justify selfishness, look no further [SEP] content: Ayn Rand has to be one of the most verbose yet immature philosophers I've come upon. She seems to fit the classic definition of a psychopath, as her "philosophy", objectivism, amounts to little more than a "do what you feel if it benefits you" and "greed is good" mantra.There is nothing of value in her works if you are one of those people who consider themselves to have morals, even if you're not a religious person.	negative
title: This man's retarded - and so is anyone who gave this more than a 1-star... [SEP] content: Obviously, you all have no life to speak of...I would've given it a lower rating (like a MINUS 3-star!), but I couldn't find it!	negative
title: Glitzy, but frustrating for younger kids [SEP] content: The program requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too frustrating for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page ("color all the squares blue"). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that even I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In addition, the product is set up around a theme of "save the stars". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them "wander at will" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one.	negative
title: A disappointment [SEP] content: I'm sorry to say, this particular version of this classical movie has the wrong musical score. The music is completely off--happy music is played during the mother's sad scene of giving the child up and sad music is played during parts that were meant to be humourous. The movie itself, with the correct music, is wonderful. But this version is just horrendous and an extreme disappointment, seeing as I was very excited to recieve this.	negative
title: Abandon Senses! [SEP] content: I'm sorry, but the great serious issues at the heart of this film are simply swamped by odd and often hilarious acting, reactions, edits and transitions. Like the boat, the participants are wooden and sterotyped. The black man is "put in his place" by Tyrone Powers, who shouts him into subserviance; later, he sings a spiritual - no kidding. There's the Italian hood with a switchblade, the officious army commander, the loose woman, the professor, and Mary Ann! No kidding, they are all there, 26 of 'em. Even Tyrone gets the treatment as our conflicted hero. The loose woman gives us the defining aside on Tyrone: "THERE'S a MAN!"I rated this not zero, or one star - but I gave it two, simply because this is an absolute stitch to watch. It means well, it is so earnest. For that alone it surely deserves notice as a serious hoot.Now, back to bailing...	negative
title: not good enough [SEP] content: I am not satisfied with my k2s. The wheels disintegrated on me when skating on hot pavement. Two went out on the same skate!The other thing is, I really don't like the cushy boot. I want my skates to be firm against my legs. My rollerblades had a ratchet system which could tighten the boots well. The K2s don't and thus the feel is very sloppy and loose around my ankles. I will never buy K2s again.	negative
title: Standard case [SEP] content: Not so impressed with this case. Once you place your shotgun in it (20 ga), it does not close properly leaving sizable gap for air & elements in. It has nothing to do with the foam/shotgun, it's the plastic model of the case itself that does not fit properly.I went for a less expensive case because the airlines treat all cases the same.	negative
title: Take a Pass on this one [SEP] content: Spread flour on the pan and it comes out the holes onto the counter. The pizza dough will stick to the pan. Hard to serve and even harder to clean. Using a cookie sheet is a much better proposition.	negative
title: Not what I wanted! [SEP] content: This did not have the Tom Bombadil stories that I read 43 yrs ago. It was ok for what it is.	negative
title: Patterns In Imagination [SEP] content: Written during the height of the late Tech Bubble, it often seems to have more faith, in a secular way of course, in the imagined promises of technology in general and software in particular. The similes are compelling, and the parallels are intriguing, but there's always some nagging question on what it all means. None of the short-term predictions have come to pass, and the long-term predictions are more in the way of philosophical musings of the author. And, the almost child-like respect for computer simulations is questionable, particularly when presented without any supporting arguments or explanations. Not a book on technology as such, or anything really concrete or otherwise directly useful. Some of the points bring to mind the clashes between the Copenhagen and Gottingen schools when quantum mechanics was being conjured up. A good read for speculative background on artificial intelligence.	negative
title: Poorly made peeelers [SEP] content: Peelers on the market today are of a poor quality so I was happy to see a more sturdy design. I was disappointed however. It bearly peeled carrots and I tried different angles to be sure.	negative
title: Poor Tape Quality [SEP] content: The story was excellent, but the tape quality was awful. It appeared as if someone taped it at home on their VCR in ELP. I was beginning to think it was bootlegged.	negative
title: Jigga What? Jigga Who Cares... [SEP] content: This album is foolish. Foolish and Empty. Empty and Superficial. Money, women, and violence. Which I guess would be okay if it weren't rapped about over such stupid beats in such a stupid way.	negative
title: The Gnostic Lucas [SEP] content: I am convinced that the George Lucas who created the original, unadulterated trilogy was a benevolent, imaginative visionary. With his dismal prequels and an uncanny talent to botch the original trilogy by "enhancing" it, I believe that, at some point, a malevolent demiurge usurped licht-Lucas' control of the Star Wars universe and now torments us with exasperating changes. The CGI additions are incongruous with the visual style of the rest of the films; the additional dialogue robs the original films of subtlety (are people so dense that they are incapable of sensing conflict in Darth Vader without him shouting "NOOOOO!"?); "Han shot first," &c., &c., &c. . . . the list of grievances is too long to share in a brief review. Alas, Mr. Lucas continually succumbs to the Dark Side.	negative
title: o.k. movie - little disappointing. [SEP] content: With all the rave reviews, i thought this movie would be be much better. don't get me wrong the acting and concept is superb...but the actual movie was slow and drawn out. For being "in the top ten, all-time shocking movies" it was frankly not shocking. I love the criterion collection but I was dissappointed just for the simple fact there were no sub-titles. This is such a basic feature I couldn't believe it wasn't included. Lastly, the picture is average transfer. there are blemishes that are noticable through out the movie. My [less expensive] movies have better quality (same time frame)!!! I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. (by the way - the seventh seal - is the bench mark of criterion in my opinion.	negative
title: Sour grapes from a dramatic former butler. [SEP] content: When I made the mistake of reading this tell-all book,It was clear to me that the writer was very bitter. The book tells us little that shock`s,and seems to have been a means of revenge towards Marlo Thomas. What is also odd, is that not one unkind word is written about Phil Donahue,leading the reader to believe he must not have any say in his own home.	negative
title: Curious Juxtapositions [SEP] content: While I know very little about Quaker boarding schools, I have been studying the traditional boys private boarding military school (middle and high school level) in the U.S. for the past ten years. Very few of my findings or conclusions agree with anything I find in this book. I believe the author probably understands Quaker schools far better than military schools. A curious study, but not recommended	negative
title: Limited usefulness [SEP] content: Nothing in the description indicates what size rolling pin these rings will fit. I couldn't even get them past the handles on mine, so they proved useless.	negative
title: It stopped stopping! [SEP] content: After 1.5 years, this automatic tea kettle, which I use every day, stopped automatically turning off at a rolling boil. Indeed, I came into the kitchen and saw a shorted cabinet light because of the moisture from the steam. My fear is, if I completely forgot about it (which happens when I'm focused on my work) it my melt, destroy itself or worse!	negative
title: I resent what this implies! [SEP] content: Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected "just for me?" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway.	negative
title: Oregon Lighthouses [SEP] content: I wasn't completely satisifed with this DVD. I felt it could have oferred more Scenery of the Oregon Coastline.	negative
title: N is for Not So Fast [SEP] content: This is the first Sue Grafton book I've read and I have to say that I enjoyed it--UNTIL the "quickie" ending, which was such a letdown after having read sooooo many pages to get there. It seemed like the author decided she was tired of writing, couldn't be bothered to explain or justify plot points, and just wanted to be done with it! Such a disappointment.	negative
title: Blue Dog treats [SEP] content: Blue Dog treats, I purchased 2 boxes and my dog will not eat them so I'm giving them to my neighbors dogs. I will never order them again.	negative
title: Not a phone you'd want to use very often [SEP] content: The beeping when you dial the phone, check the caller ID, check your messages, etc, are obnoxiously loud. There's a hum in the background, and you can hear a slight echo of your own voice in the receiver when you're talking. I'm in the process of exchanging the phone.	negative
title: Tastes Terrible [SEP] content: I cannot believe that people like these. My wife bought a variety box and I tried the white chocolate and the chunky peanut butter bars and could not finish one. My wife could only finish 1/2 of the brownie crunch. A waste of money for us. Would never buy again. Our box was purchased from a grocery store and they are not stale or outdated, we just hate how they taste.	negative
title: Outdated. [SEP] content: Could not believe the amount of work I had to go through if I were to use his "methods". By doing some internet research I found a company that has produced a piece of software that would convert any Word file into PDF format file without any problems, without a limited license. I paid $39.99 for the software but did not mind at all as it did a perfect job. This book, in my opinion, should be out of print.	negative
