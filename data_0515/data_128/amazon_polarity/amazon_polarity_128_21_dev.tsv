title: Funny, Poignant and Thought-provoking [SEP] content: "Pappy Jack" Holloway discovers a new breed of mammals on the planet Zarathustra. He feels they are sapient but the company that controls the planet, and will lose their rights to the planet if the "Fuzzies" are sapient, will stop at nothing to prove him wrong. A very good book, that I highly recommend.	positive
title: One of the best cookbooks ever! [SEP] content: This is one of my favorite cookbooks, which I've used for about 20 years. In fact, I used it so much that it was falling apart so I ordered a new one for myself, and then one for a friend as a gift.What I like so much: It's arranged as complete meals, usually 2-3 recipes per meal. Then there are directions for what order to do things in, so everything gets done at about the same time. Mostly very healthy recipes, with calorie counts. And in addition to all that, every meal either takes less than 30 minutes, or you can make it ahead and freeze it.Marian Burros rocks!	positive
title: Guitar delights from the Philippines [SEP] content: Tipanan - A Celebration of the Philippine GuitarYoung Filipino guitarist Florante Aguilar presents a delightful programme of popular music from the Philippines, some traditional, some well-loved popular music from the middle of the 20th century, and some more modern items of his own composition. Don't expect classical fireworks, just simple relaxing melodies played beautifully with great sensitivity. The more modern items are, to me at any rate, not so pleasing as Florante's interpretation of the older melodies and traditional music, very little of which is known outside of the Philippines. With his consumate musicianship and most attractive demeanour Florante makes a fine ambassador for the music of his homeland, and deserves to be known much better outside the Philippines.	positive
title: A nice mouse, but the cordless version is less reliable... [SEP] content: Get the wired version of this mouse. It's quite comfortable, and very good for gaming, and such. I would say the wireless version is much more reliable, and more likely to work. Keep this in mind, wireless tech just isn't perfected yet.	positive
title: Always a recommendation with Jack S. [SEP] content: This is another soon to be classic along with "Market Wizards" and "New Market Wizards". The traders in this book are top notched. It shows how you that others can trade consistently and be profitable. Trading when you understand the rules isn't being in Vegas sitting at the slots. It means being the house at Vegas. It gives me something to shoot for in my own trading.	positive
title: Disturbed's Best Yet [SEP] content: Let the reviews tell the story, this album is, in my opinion, one of the best albums this year. Disturbed has changed their sound a little with this album and all the of the songs are completely power-packed. Stricken is a very nice single and it has Disturbed written all over it. Guarded is also very good it has in your face sound right from the get-go. Enough said. Go out and buy this album, you are wasting precious time reading these reviews.	positive
title: Clever, pratical, sympathetic... [SEP] content: This book will guide you to the best of Paris.I'm french, and I well know Paris. trust me, It's a real good job, even for french people.	positive
title: Blues Galore! [SEP] content: This film is basically the same as the first movie from the 80s, but you've *got* to have it because of the music. Many, many great Blues musicians play in this movie at the end of it, including legends like BB King, Eric Clapton, James Brown, Bo Diddley, Aretha Franklin and many, many others.This is a must-have!	positive
title: Great Show when you cannot be there ! [SEP] content: We have previously been to the Radio City Christmas show. We planned to go again this year with friends who never were, but had to cancel. However, our friends were able to see the show via the DVD. Done well with high quality.	positive
title: Something More [SEP] content: I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but I didn't quite find it: I found something more. I was impressed with the way Moriarty was able to capture the reality of her protagonist's perspective as she move through childhood and adolescence. A coming of age story for the nerdy girl who wants to be loved, the good girl who isn't sure she wants to be good, the gifted girl who must make something out of nothing and figure out what's really important along the way.	positive
title: Best reading instruction book out there! [SEP] content: This book was recommended to me by a friend when my eldest child was 4. She had a great time going through the lessons- and, the biggest surprise of all- so did I! I have no real instinct or patience for teaching, so the fact that everything I was supposed to say, down to how to correct an error, was scripted for me was my saving grace- Hallelujah!That same child is now 7, in second grade (after skipping first grade) and is in the top reading group in her class. I can only credit the foundation that this book taught for that success!I'm working with her younger sister now, and she loves it just as much. I even bribed her to eat all her dinner one night by offering to let her have another lesson after we finished. :D Our little boy (age 2 1/2) will sit at the table and try to mimic what my current 4-year old is doing. Looks like we'll have no trouble getting him started in a year or so as well. :)	positive
title: lovely Bi-Continental Historical Romance..... [SEP] content: Heartwarming romance with a hero and heroine who are good people-no courtesans or rakes here-just two decent people who've been hurt in the past and must learn to love and trust.The story starts in England, travels to America, spends a great deal onboard a ship, to finally end back in England. Mild bedroom scenes, a formulaic but interesting mystery, and lot's of familiar relationships abound.If you are a fan of "nicer" or Christian romances, but without the religious aspect, then you'll enjoy this book.4 stars.	positive
title: Sturdy, and solid wood... [SEP] content: This item looks great. The finish is a rich dark brown. The size surprised me a little though. From the picture, I kind of expected it to be a little taller and not quite as wide, but I am even happier with the actual dimensions, as it fits even better than I thought it would in the space I bought it for.Surprisingly, it has a lot of pieces, and took me about 45 minutes to put together by myself.	positive
title: A Role-Play Specific Doll - Great for the Ballerina Baby Girl [SEP] content: This was another Christmas gift for our 3-year-old daughter, who began taking ballet lessons this past fall. She was very specific about the Barbie she wanted, and it was this one.The Barbie is very articulated (knee and foot positions) which is probably better enjoyed by the older ballet and Barbie fan. Our daughter is younger and has more fun with Kelly spinning to the music, and the fact that one can hold Barbie by the crown on top and spin her as well. The ballet barre and bag haven't caught her eye; it's the dancing Kelly. Because the ballet shoes are molded onto both dolls' legs, these cannot be dressed up like other Barbie and Kelly dolls. These two beautiful dolls are specific to the ballet role-play.	positive
title: Fast delivery [SEP] content: A bit bigger than imagined, but very suitable for the purpose of being wall decoration. The colors are very pretty.	positive
title: Great Servers [SEP] content: I purchased several of these for the church fellowship room. They are sturdy, look great and go with everything, so they can be used with any serving dish.	positive
title: A Very Unique Perspective [SEP] content: This book was not what I had expected it too be when I started out. It was written from the perspective of Death, during a very dark part of the world's history . . . The Holocaust.Very well written, very moving.It proves that some people know the right things to do . . .even if they are on the wrong side. They knowgoodness and compassion.Very well written. I highly suggest reading this moving story.	positive
title: Best self-help book EVER written on dysfunctional "loving." [SEP] content: Read 'em all - Women Who Love Too Much, Men Who Hate Women & the Women Who Love Them, Love Addictions, etc. - but Bryn Collins' book is the end-all, be-all for identifying, avoiding, and healing from emotionally devastating "relationships." Without distracting psychobabble, Collins nails emotional unavailability, in all its forms, precisely on the head. Book contains clear examples, explanations, instructions - and practical (and do-able) solutions, with Bombeck-like wit and insights. Emotional Unavailability is the advice your mother and all your friends would have given you, if only they'd been blessed with Bryn Collins' ability to spark understanding and activate your light bulb. Best book EVER for emotionally-starved lovers past and present, this book should be required reading for entering into an intimate relationship.	positive
title: Does not meet expectations of the book [SEP] content: Before vampires sparkled you had truly entertaining stories. Lestat is on a mission to out vampires to the world and in his doing so meets the true vampire queen Akasha. Great acting, okay story line but NOTHING like the book. If you take it on its own you will be able to enjoy it.	positive
title: Stylish excursion into the wild [SEP] content: Amos Tutuola is one of the handful of master stylists in English of the 20th century. ``Witch-herbalist of the Remote Town'' is a mature work. Comparing it with his first published work (``Palm-wine Drinkard'') demonstrates that Tutuola is, in fact, a stylist and not, as it once seemed possible, a naive product of an unusual and scanty education in English in Nigeria. The compelling factor in his style is rhythm, presumably related to his mother tongue of Yoruba. It has something of the cyclical nature of extended drumming -- it is hard to stop reading it. Plot and characterization are not important in Tutuola's writing. ``Witch-herbalist'' is a simple story of a father's love for his child.	positive
title: Yay for first review [SEP] content: When I bought this album a few months back in a local store in Boston, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't know much of L'Arc~en~ciel's early work, but, I decided to take a chance.After listening to it a couple times, I decided it was okay. But, it grew on me, and now, its one of my favorite albums (I don't have many CDs anyways, but that's beyond the point).My favorite songs off the albums are In The Air (Hyde's voice makes me go all bubbly-fangirly, and the bassline is awesome), And She Said, Caress of Venus, and Winter Fall.If you are a fan of L'Arc~en~ciel, I definately reccommend getting this album.	positive
title: A must have book for those who admire this little "Lion Dog" [SEP] content: I bought this book in order to learn all I could about the Pekingese breed. I wasn't disappointed. It's nicely written, very informative and easy to read. (The wonderful photos are an added bonus.) Caroline Coile obviously has a long-time, loving relationship with the Peke. After reading it, I was convienced. We adopted our own Peke and now use it daily to learn more about the needs of our wonderful new family member. The information is very informative, helpful and acurate. We and our dog are much happier due to the information we gained from Dr. Coile's book. What a bargin!	positive
title: With a fond shudder of nostalgia, one remembers... [SEP] content: ...the nasty reptilian burn down the sinuses and back of the throat that came with snorting crystalmeth cut with strych, aspirin, baby-lax and Lord knows what else back in those evil days not as many years ago as I wish... The same malicious synth-drive as Chrome and Six Finger Satellite at their most nefarious moments, and then Lordamighty that voice. Successfully replicates the experience of doing bad drugs with a revival minister suffering the pre-epileptic shoogaloos of amphetameanie-psychosis after several comprehensive ECT sessions in the Solitary ward at Parchman Farm in preparation for a public encounter with the chair. Not even Jeffrey Lee Pierce ever got this bad. If you get your jollies off by driving around in heavy traffic imagining running pedestrians down, this rates just beneath the Stooges for the soundtrack to your sickheaded little fantasies. ELECTRICITY!	positive
title: Excelente!! [SEP] content: excellent seller, product quality! I recommend the purchase was made on 21/12/11 and 06/01/12 target date.The fragrance is extraordinary, citrus aroma	positive
title: Inspiring! [SEP] content: No matter how pressed for time you are, this book will make you determined to build a gingerbread house. Cargas is a wonderfully generous author, providing directions for a variety of delightful gingerbread houses, loads of practical tips and decorating ideas, and even ways to share gingerbread houses with others (e.g., through parties and classes). Great photos, too. Fun, fun!	positive
title: loved It [SEP] content: I bought this for my friend, who is a big fan of Easy Rawlins. We couldn't find it in any vedio store, so I had to buy it. Although we both seen the movie many times, this is one of those movies you have to watch every year, like the Wizard of OZ. We are waiting for Easy Rawlins to make another movie from one of his books. This is a must see. Chrissy	positive
title: On teh Chopping Block [SEP] content: What can I say? I loved On The Chopping Block. Bobby Jaye getsbetter with each book. It was like old home week. Hearing about the lives of cousins Claudia and Joyce, a deeper look into Brady Kincaid and what he's thinking makes me hope that Bobby Jaye's next book will continue with himcoming back to Early and joining the police force. Of couse there is the enigma of Alice Drinker and Brady, can't wait for her to sort that one out.A terrific read. Couldn't put it down. Even stayed up late to finish it. Rock on Bobby Jaye	positive
title: Great Watch,-- Great Dealer! [SEP] content: I had looked at this watch in regular retail stores. I thought I would check out Amazon's pricing and availability.Fantastic Results! It was half the price and recieved the watch in two days! (standard shipping)It came in a beautiful Seiko box with the factory warranty and instruction book!The watch itself is a great looking timepiece and has been very accurate in time keeping.	positive
title: PERFECT Table saw, PERFECT Grav-rise Stand, for my portable needs, since I don't have a dedicated shop!! [SEP] content: I gave it 5 stars because, although no saw in the "portable range" IMHO is perfect....THIS ONE is PERFECT for me. Comments about no blade lock, ambiguous blade angle determination, and a few others, are all justified, but those are generally only found on SHOP saws which have bigger tables, twice the cost [approx], and are considerably heavier. Again, it's all about what works for you. This puppy is a dream to slide on to the bed of a pickup [check out YouTube for the skinny on how it's done]. As for complaints about the quality [or lack of] of the saw blades, consider this! Absolutely no manufacturer supplies their saws with high quality blades. PERIOD!!	positive
title: Excellent "calming down" book for getting someone to bed [SEP] content: We have been reading this book every night for the last year as our 21 month old son goes to bed. He continues to enjoy the pictures and act out the story. This includes brushing teath, putting on PJs and climbing into bed. The final stage of turning out the light makes a wonderful end for a day.Our only moment of panic caused by the book was when we forgot it when we left on vacation. Fortunatly we know it by heart.	positive
title: A bit of a let down, but still enjoyable. [SEP] content: There is fun to be had here, but for fans of the Jack Sparrow character, he's really not used particularly well here. I also miss the skeleton crew of the first movie. Here, only one man has any real magic power, and his crew is basically prosthetic zombies. Not as cool as previous movies. Still, Depp's Sparrow is fun and keeps you watching.	positive
title: Kodak EasyShare C533 [SEP] content: I was so scared to buy my first digital camera and probably did more than anyone's share of "research" before I bought this, but It has been nothing but wonderful and so easy to use..Amazon helped with any questions I had and it was shipped almost immediatley...I love IT!!!!!!!	positive
title: Great for seniors & kids [SEP] content: We recently bought .Mac for our 90 year old mother, who loves email & surfing on her iMac, but needs a very stable, simple platform. She recently moved to an independent living apartment with high speed internet, but the provider does not provide email addresses and expects users to access web-based email, which we know is just too confusing & too many steps for our mother, who is very used to Apple Mail. Now she has a .mac address, completely integrated by the Apple OS, & it took less than 5 minutes. Yes, it's an expensive mailbox, but I'm so glad it is available.	positive
title: 3 years old and still great [SEP] content: I received this kettle as a gift 3 years ago, and it still works as well as it did when I got it - it's never had problems. Boils very quickly, holds a good amount of water, and works equally well with different water levels. My friend bought a different kettle after liking mine, and it almost boils over if you overfill it.	positive
title: Love concures all [SEP] content: If you just want a feel good,hometown, good ,romantic movie this is for you. It's one of those that will give you the warm fuzzies.	positive
title: One of the best hero games I've ever played. [SEP] content: One of the reasons I like spawn the most is because he is not a wus like superman, and batman. Not to mention those games stunk! But, back to spawn.___Pros___Great graphicstons of origional unlockable contentthe most origional enemies I've ever seengreat gameplay, extreme goreVast selection of guns and weapons___Cons___Story lacking in depthNow stop reading this review and go and buy it now!	positive
title: Super fast shipping!! [SEP] content: The item arrived in almost a day from the order and is exactly as described. I knew the item would be longer than I wanted but it is still a quality product. I would order from this vendor again.	positive
title: Bite sized morsels [SEP] content: John Piper is my favorite contemporary Christian author, so it was no surprise to me that this would be another engaging, worship inspiring work from him. His longer works such as "The Pleasures of God" are amazing when you have a bigger stretch of time for devotion, but this provides a perfect alternative when a larger work might put one off from even getting started. Each meditation is a bit longer than a given entry from say "My Utmost For His Highest" (quite possibly the quintessential daily devotional book), but still easily manageable in a single sitting.	positive
title: This book makes you think [SEP] content: I was excited, yet skeptical when I opened this book. Ireceived it at work, and as I opened it in front of my bossan a co-worker, I thought to myself, "this cover lookspretty thought provoking..I hope they don't think I'm somekind of weirdo." Well, Brodie's book is exactly about these"responses" to memetic programming. If you are at allinterested in questions about why we think the things wedo, and how much of what we think is programmed rather thanconscious decision, then you'll want to read this book.Not only does it get you thinking, it gets you to gettingothers thinking. Whether you (or they) like it or not!The book is itself a "Virus of the Mind." (evil laugh...)	positive
title: the best choice i think [SEP] content: The same work conducted by Klempeler with Philharmonia Orchestra is famous. But I promise this live recording is better and it's the best one I've heard(including Walter,Bernstein,Rattle,Mehta,Kaplan and other Klem's one). Klempeler's reading is insightful and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra played so warm and powerful that I think it is better than the philharminia orchestra especially for its brass. The remastering of this disc is succesful,the sound is more rich than other version. Though there's several cough-sound,it's never mind.I'll give it 6 star if i could.	positive
title: MISS WILSON NEVER MISSES [SEP] content: Miss Wilson is my favorite singer -- there are no exceptions -- so if you're looking for critical words you can stop right here. On this album she puts her unique style and charm to several new tunes (my favorite is "Knitting Class") but most stellar is her version of "Taking a Chance on Love," on which she makes the most of her lower register (which has always been stellar and wonderful). This song, and some others on recent CDs, are from the "old school," as if Miss Wilson FINALLY decided to sing some of the stand-bys, as if clearing up some old "to do" lists. We are the beneficiaries. I'm grateful she continues to record, but I miss very much her live performances.	positive
title: so good! [SEP] content: i loved a few RLJ songs over the years and loved POP POP.....but this anthology reminds me of her artistry in a new way...POET.	positive
title: Just what I was looking for. [SEP] content: Well as a newbie to horse racing, all the data at hand was quite overwhelming. I mean where does one start? While perusing the web I came across this book. I'm so glad that I did! This book has everything you need to get down to some intelligent betting. My first application of the knowledge I got from this book was quite successful (got the trifecta on my very fist try, and these weren't favorites! Also was in the money for all the other races I bet that day (4)... Beginners luck?). Now I have a good basic understanding and a bit of confidence when betting.The only reason this book got 4 stars is that it lacks a glossary.	positive
title: A great mix of happiness and tears [SEP] content: This is a really fun book to read, a great book to take to the beach. It has some tearful moments too. But the characters are real, the situation has just enough fantasy and the humor will make you laugh out loud. I have but one complaint about this book. It takes place in Queens--the home of the Mets-- but the main characters are lifelong Yankee fans!	positive
title: good fun [SEP] content: It's a fun game with some twist and turns that keep it interesting through out. It had a few weird things like wanting you to drink and smoke for good health and also to kill a child to gain more points. I did none of it and still enjoyed the game. I don't know why that added crap like that, otherwise it was fun.	positive
title: A must see series!!! [SEP] content: By far one of the best series I have ever seen. I am not going to write a long review just read all the others here. I am only on episode two and already hooked, can't hardly wait to see the next disk. This is a must see, especially in blu-ray format.	positive
title: Another great Classic by Bauhaus! [SEP] content: Another album by the masters of goth. A "cannot miss" album, very rich in music; add this towards your bauhaus collection.	positive
title: Thank you, David. [SEP] content: In June, I attended a David Sedaris reading, part of his latest book tour. At the end, he held up Francine Prose's "Blue Angel" and said it was the funniest book he's read in a long time. So, knowing his work, I went into this novel expecting laugh out loud hilariousness. This novel is so much more though. Prose writes with such a clever hand that you don't often laugh out loud, but chuckle inside at her deft use of language and humor and wordplay. I loved the characters, especially Swenson, his wife Sherrie, and of course, the Angela, the Blue Angel herself. If you've ever taken a college creative writing class, you'll appreciate the numerous scenes where student stories are workshopped. Francine Prose captures college life and student attitudes perfectly. This novel made me want to read other Prose books.	positive
title: Star rocks! [SEP] content: Just picked up the CD by accident. First track--the ultimate soundtrack to a seductive striptease. A really creative effort.	positive
title: Don Knotts at His Shakiest [SEP] content: Don Knotts as the lovable hero and blunders into the right thing to do. I really enjoyed seeing the oldies but still goodies. Clean and fun.	positive
title: Great headphones [SEP] content: I love these headphones, the only down side is they tend to slip off your head if you lean over. Other than that they come in loud and clear when I watch TV, plus if you go into another room you can continue to hear the TV. I would recommend these headphones.	positive
title: A Must See for any fan of Zenigata [SEP] content: I loved every minute of it. Zenigata gets the spotlight that he deserves in this one. Tokyo Crisis has in my opinion the best "guest" character of all the specials. For non-Zenigata fans there's also plenty of the other characters too, and it provides all the fast-past action you almost expect from Lupin the 3rd. The music--smooth, slick and in-your-face. It even has introspective moments which you might not expect from Lupin the 3rd. And of course, it's hilarious. What can I say? Buy it!	positive
title: best curling iron [SEP] content: This is the best curling iron I've owned, heat setting can be set where you want it and has a extra long cord that swivels at thebase of the iron. This is my second iron I now have two differernt sizes.	positive
title: i love motown music and artists. [SEP] content: I enjoyed the music and quality was fine. it was in great condition and the explanation at bottom when ordered was great. I got what I pd. for . pat	positive
title: I love this Sequel [SEP] content: I have a 3 year old daughter, whom is now into all the Princess'. She watched Little Mermaid one time, and after the enchantment of the fins had her hooked to wanting to watch it every day. When Little Mermaid II came on Disney channel one night, it changed everything for her. She loves Melody, Ariel's daughter. No other Disney Princess movie represents a princess that has a mother. They are all passed on, or non existent. Melody and Ariel has a great relationship, like any young adolescence child and her mother would. I think this movie is a positive role model for children, and yet there is nothing to buy with Melody represented, which is a shame.	positive
title: Stand jacks [SEP] content: Have pop up camper with stabilizing jacks attached to it. They are difficult to access to with bad shoulders, so jacks are very handy and adjust to any height I need, whereas the original jacks on camper, shimming is required.	positive
title: great option for certain motorcycles too [SEP] content: what I like about this product is that it can be mounted without modification to your vehicle, and it can be used on a wide variety of applications.the only negative I've noticed is that the mirror is susceptible to vibration -- but that may be due to my using it on a motorcycle...	positive
title: Better than I expected. [SEP] content: This film was suggested by my 21 year old daughter. She never tires of comedic paranormal films and I now like them as well.	positive
title: Another Winner [SEP] content: I am a huge fan of MHC. I have to say this is one of her best. Not too many characters to keep track of. She has a tendency to do that. Which is a weakness of hers.This was very suspenseful. I had a hard time putting it down. No lags in this story. I love the fact that she gets her point across without the profanity that some authors think they have to have.I will keep her on my must read list.	positive
title: I really enjoy this game. [SEP] content: I really enjoy this game. The commentators are great. The graphics are pretty good. One problem is that whenever they put the screen on a game-cam and then press A, the screen turns blurry. Most of the time, the game seems quite realistic. This is my first football game of this type. We have no other gaming systems besides the Wii.	positive
title: Satisfied Customer [SEP] content: Purchased this folding camp stool primarily for use with my outdoor close-up/macrophotography pursuits, involving use of a tripod to set up close-up shots. Works out great for that. The unit is lightwieght, sturdy and portable. The attached strap, although not adjustable, is more than adequate for comfortable, "over the shoulder" carrying and the stool collapses easily, for space saving storage. Highly recommend.	positive
title: This CD rules! [SEP] content: This CD really bring you back to the honky tonk days, when beer was cheap & so were the women. Johnny Dilks & his fellas really know how to get your toes a tappin'	positive
title: Great!!! [SEP] content: I just bought it and it has arrived today and its already paid it's self off.I fixed three of my xbox360 games one of which was really badly scratched. I am in love with this product! The noise is loud , but who cares it's not loud enough to not make me wan't to buy it. Buy this machine it works great!	positive
title: Ruthless on religion - open on the reality [SEP] content: This book is an excellent take on the absurdity of religion and its power to render a dull, mind-numbing, irrational, and uninspiring view of the universe. Even for an atheist and an aspiring physicist as me, the last chapter was truly interesting on the mystery of consciousness. The man is clear-thinking and smart as can be.	positive
title: awesome value [SEP] content: This is a great flat iron. So much better than the plastic ones. I've had mine for several years. Still works great. I bought this one as a gift for a friend who liked mine.Gets REALLY hot, hotter than any other hair tool I have used before. I have really thick hair, and it works great. My friend who I purchased it for has very thin, fine hair, and it works great for her too. She just uses a cooler setting.I wrap the cord around the flat iron for storage, and the cord got pretty wonky pretty fast. But that doesn't bother me at all.I would buy this product again and again.	positive
title: The Great Great Book of Amber [SEP] content: For those of us who have been through these book a lot, it was nice to get them all together in one volume. I bought this to replace the missing holes in my collection, after having lost them to various friends over the years (what is it that Zelazny says about friends and books?)I wish this volume contained the Amber short stories that Zelazny published after the 2nd series, just to ensure that it was complete.	positive
title: Very pleased! [SEP] content: For a beginner buyer I am impressed with the service. Package on time and in mint condition as described.	positive
title: Another solid introduction from Mel Bay [SEP] content: It's a solid introduction to the bongos and worth the few dollars that I paid. If you don't have anyone knowledgeable guiding your bongos purchase than you're better off buying this first to help you make the best decision.However:The book is tri-lingual (English, Spanish, Portuguese) and there's not 33 pages of information but more like 20.Trevor Salloum also wrote "The Bongo Book" which has more advanced information and everything in this book except for the buying recommendations and a few other minor items. I recommend buying it instead.	positive
title: Outdated sure, but still relevant [SEP] content: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.	positive
title: Review of Matsubayashi Shorin Ryu Karate Vol 2 [SEP] content: This DVD contains Katas specifically for the Shorin Ryu Matsubayashi system. If this is the system you are learning, this DVD is a must. There are many versions of these katas out there, but here you get the original kata, not a watered down version. The DVD quality is excellent.	positive
title: The best way to hear Genesis [SEP] content: Altough maybe you already have the CD's in this collection, if you really like them won't let pass this box. The 5.1 mix of the disks are REALLY REALLY AWESOME. The bonus videos also fulfills the expectations. Why 4 stars? The DTS mix sound a lot lot lot much better than the Dolby one. Why is this? I don't know, but I think is something you should be aware of.	positive
title: Vince Vaughn!! [SEP] content: Vince Vaughn should be Pete Tyler! Keanu Reeves might be okay, too, but Vince Vaughn would be better. John Cusask already played the guy in 'High Fidelity' who was a loser, by the way, and Pete Tyler is much cooler and better boyfriend material. Everyone should read this book 'cause it's great and then write Vince Vaughn and tell him to do the movie!	positive
title: Pretty Good, So Far [SEP] content: As someone who has always admired the Mormons' history, I always felt the average person would be incredulous if the beliefs were actually revealed in detail. This book does a good job of cutting through the fog for those who think LDS is just another branch of Christianity.	positive
title: Love it! [SEP] content: A delightful, light and pleasant tea with wonderful health benefits. We originally purchased because we heard it was a natural aid for breathing difficulties and sinus problems but grew accustomed to the flavor and drink it regularly. My husband adds raw honey to his tea and after drinking will eat some of the seeds in the tea bag, too.	positive
title: Good but a little darker [SEP] content: Have enjoyed the series. This season gets a little darker and would be careful showing it to younger kids. I personally find them to be a little expensive. Still a fan though.	positive
title: The name says it all [SEP] content: Joe Pernice is definitely one of the best songwriters alive today. Yours, Mine & Ours is another great album in his catalog (could even be the best, although I will see how it stands the test of time). From the first listen, you know you must own this album. The opening track, Weakest Shade of Blue, is reminiscent of many songs Joe has penned before, except he is now allowing little rays of happiness creep into his music...and the fun does not end there. As with most of Joe's albums, there is not a bad song anywhere to be found and it leaves struggling amature musicians, like myself, wondering how it comes so effortlessly for Joe. For fans, you already have this..but for newbies to the Pernice world, or anyone else interested in good, pure songrwriting...pick this one up. Ultimately this is a really fun Sunday drive with the windows down album.	positive
title: Decent Messenger Bag [SEP] content: I happen to like this bag even though it's not what I was hoping for.I would like it better if it were more of a cloth type messenger, but the material is tough enough to carry some tools and the occasional knife or two.I have carried a laptop with it and it holds it quite nicely. There's not a lot of 'compartmenting' with the bag, but it does quite nicely for the quick throw over your shoulder and take it with you thing. I use it on a daily basis to carry some of my essentials and have even used it as a 'diaper bag' when taking my 18 month old out to the mall or the park.Excellent bag for the price.	positive
title: Under Rated [SEP] content: I purchaed this amp because I purchased a different Power Acoustik amp for my other car and loved it. Like the other one I own, this one also has loads and loads of power I don't even have it maxed and the output is amazing. If you aren't sure which amp to buy consider this one. It pushes two 10" dual voice coil subwoofers easily. I just wish I had another one for my high channel output.	positive
title: Even Frenchmen can learn from this book! [SEP] content: This book is a good start to understand how we the French are so different..of course to us the "Americains" are the different ones...I wish there were more books like this one about all cultures.Even for a native it is always good to revisit some of the history and to understand how behaviors and cultures are shaped by past experiences. It is true for individuals as well as for nations.I am a French living in the states married to an american and finally understood some of the cultural differences my husband and I have been arguing about for the last few years thanks to 60 million Frenchmen can't be wrong!If you plan on living in France, are living with a French or just interested in knowing why French can be so annoying read on! You won't be disappointed.Excellent job on the not so known Algerian war which I agree with the authors has contribute to shape contemporary France as much as WWII.	positive
title: To Kill a Mocking Bird.....THE BEST! By: Sarah [SEP] content: I read this book my Freshman year in high school. I thought it was excellent. It really makes us think about how racism still effects our world. It also teaches that you should treat everyone as an equal and to be kind. C'mon read it....you won't be dissappointed!	positive
title: Easy, simple and delicious [SEP] content: I originally checked this cook book out of the public library and then I re-checked it out again and when they wouldn't let me have it the third time I figured it was time to just buy it. I also bought 3 extras to give for gifts because I liked it so much. As a cook, I want simple, quick, delicious and healthy meals for my family. This cookbook offers all that!This is a great cookbook for both the seasoned cook and the beginner. The recipes are interesting but very easy and quick to prepare. I also like the suggestion box at the bottom of each recipe that tells you what to serve with the recipe so that you aren't just serving random dishes together. Very user friendly and lot of fun to cook with!	positive
title: Fantastic and Outstanding CD By Frankie Ford [SEP] content: Frankie Ford is an Icon and a fantastic entertainer. He should have been into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame long before now. The Big Boys at the Hall of Fame they usually recognize the big stars when they are long gone and are not here anymore to share in their achievements. With Frankie's New CD "That Can Be Used Again" it is a work of art. Frankie recorded two of my songs I wrote. "Lady Waiting" and "Whenever I" and he did an outstanding job performing my songs. So as I critique his latest works it is outstanding. And what a fantastic CD that should be listened and purchased by anyone who likes music. Frankie Ford is the best.	positive
title: My favorite book on editing. [SEP] content: As an editor, I have shelves of books on the subject. This book remains my favorite. Once you get bored with editing books that read like a high school grammer, check this book out. It brings you to a more refined level of editing.	positive
title: An improvement [SEP] content: As college level writing is different than high school writing, the tools must be different also. This manual provides a good, non-personal source for the student to at least find the answer to easy questions and help construct the questions best answered by the instructor. A good buy.	positive
title: Good for quick touch up [SEP] content: I received the product promptly. I use it when my hair is wet or I wet the stick if my hair is dry. My sister has used this product for years and recommended it to me. It is a good product to use on the crown of your head when you need a quick touch up and don't have time to do a full root color. My colored hair is medium brown so I bought dark brown. My natural color is white.	positive
title: Portrait of an Artist [SEP] content: Perhaps one of the best collections of poetry ever assembled, Sylvia Plath's poems are a must read for Plath fans and poetry buffs alike. Listed in chronological order (as much as possible), readers should pay particular attention to the poems from the summer of 1962 until the last poems in 1963 to fully appreciate the groundbreaking, enigmatic verse that defines Sylvia Plath. In addition to fifty poems written during her years as an undergrad at Smith College, there is a very interesting selection of notes including the original order of poems in Plath's Ariel collection (the order of the posthumous collection was altered following her death). A wonderful gift for (literate) college students (and not just English majors).	positive
title: Light and great [SEP] content: soft and comfy. After a couple wear and washes the started to get a little stringy looking, especially the white one.	positive
title: Master Hardware Guide For All PC Hardware [SEP] content: This is a paper back "bible" for buying PC hardware of any type.You can read it at home and highlight or otherwise note your favorite choices. Then, when you are making your purchase(s) it is small and light enough to take along with you to help with your decision(s). From monitors to modems Mr.& Mrs. Thompson take you by the hand to advise and offer expert opinions in terms anyone will find easy to understand. The book is well written and is a must have for anyone buying computer hardware for a personal pc.	positive
title: Liked it more than Judi [SEP] content: Judi did not care for this movie...even said in her book she was in it just to play Michael's wife...which she didn't! LOL. Good movie, good mystery...Michael Williams was fan-freaking-tastic, as always.	positive
title: Half the songs are great. The other half, so-so. [SEP] content: I got this album years ago on the strength of the remarkably depressing "Twist in My Sobriety," a great song that got a tiny bit of airplay. I still listen to the CD today, but only selected tracks - most of which, sadly, aren't the tracks that Amazon chose to feature audio samples of (with the exception of the bitter "I Love You"). A lot of the tracks on the first half of the album are somewhat bland folk-pop. But let me alert you to the jazzy tornado of "For All These Years" (trumpet by the great Mark Isham), the bluesy epic "He Likes the Sun" and what has got to be one of THE most wildly romantic ballads I have ever heard, "Valentine Heart." Those, with "I Love You" and "Twist in My Sobriety," are wonderful, wonderful songs, and make the album worthy of buying.	positive
title: Great CD!!! [SEP] content: SARAH HAS REALLY DONE GOOD ON THIS CD!! I LOVE FALLEN AND ALL THE SONGS ON AFTERGOLW SHE HAS SUCH A PRETTY VOICE!! IT'S REALLY A GREAT SOUNDING CD!! GOOD LYRICS TOO!!YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS ONE IF YOU LIKE SARAH!!	positive
title: A Fresh Sound to a Point. . . [SEP] content: With some of the same tone and feeling as Nik Bärtsch's Ronin modal improvisations, this album of the postmodern avant-garde trio The Bad Plus demonstrates why they were selected for the recent album of Disney covers, Everybody Wants to Be a Cat. Their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist Anderson, two by drummer King, and one by pianist Iverson) are energetic and often noisy. Each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. The scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. The lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, Giant, arises as a fresh breeze. The well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. The problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. The musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick.	positive
title: Good Read [SEP] content: I enjoyed reading the book, and the price was right. There are stories about how he made his connection with information about how to make your own connection. I would have like to have had more exercises and information about how to make my own psychic connection. Even if you think that he is not a true psychic, there are stories out there of him being debunked as a psychic the reading was interesting and the exercises made sense and were helpful.	positive
title: The perfect horse book! [SEP] content: Ginny has always wanted a pony and when her parents agree to rent one for her, it is nothing like she thought it would be. Read the book to find out what happens and believe me it's great.	positive
title: Satin Jacket [SEP] content: I bought this jacket for work. Our company used to supply these type of jackets with our uniforms but stopped. I had the co. logo put on and it looks great. Very good quality and fit. I can recommend this jacket.	positive
title: Ronnie Was and Remains Great! [SEP] content: This particular album is a wonderful stroll down memory lane. Milsap's voice was so smooth, so strong and so recognizable. His arrangements are beautifully done. For lovers of pop, soft rock,country, or just Ronnie Milsap fans, this is a wonderful purchase and makes a great gift.	positive
title: FINALLY!! [SEP] content: Finally, a wonderful, comprehensive resource to help the average person, who wants to make the change to a healthier lifestyle! I've always felt overwhelmed, with so much conflicting information as to what's safe and what's not. I found out about this book, from the Weston A. Price website - another awesome resource for finding out the truth. The absolute best part of this book, for me (because, honestly, a lot of the "chemical" details are over my head) - are the lists, at the back, of specific products (in each category - hair, face, deoderants etc) that have been tested as absolutely safe. This was so helpful, for me... to have all the research and legwork done, and to be able to simply look up each category, and find out where to buy it. It allowed me to slowly and methodically eliminate my family's personal care products that were harmful and, confidently, replace them with safe ones. The website offers ongoing updates on newly added "Safe" products. This is an excellent gift.	positive
title: Todd Murrison, The Teacher [SEP] content: Todd Murrison demonstrates a wonderful range of techniques for beginners and tackles basic layout for intermediate. As an accomplished graphic artist, Todd explores more graphic applications, than freedom of expression, which this medium can not be separated from. We're waiting for Todd to break the mold in his second book to see all that wonderful talent flurish. Although I do recommend this book as a good one for beginners!	positive
title: I like everything here, but the leads. [SEP] content: Domingo, bless him, just doesn't make Wagner for me. Too light, I think. AndNorman's matronly voice doesn't fit Kundry imo. if you like these singers, it's a gorgeous recording.	positive
title: Staub Fondue Set with 6 Forks, Olive Green [SEP] content: This is a great fondue set. Perfect size for fondue. I ordered it in olive green but was sent black even though the box was marked green. I'm keeping it anyway because it is a nice set.	positive
title: Very Entertaining Saga [SEP] content: I really enjoyed this book and its characters. It kept me interested the entire way. This is one of those 'must reads' for everyone.	positive
title: penlight [SEP] content: We love these lights and always order from this company who ships them right out. They have always had sufficient stock for the orders we place. Great company to deal with.	positive
title: Coordinate plane [SEP] content: A great book to read in the classroom, and given students a different view of the coordinate plane. Helps them to make sense of the reason behind what a coordinate plane does for organizing data.	positive
title: IMHO not for children [SEP] content: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again.	positive
title: What can I say but PURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT! [SEP] content: This is the perfect blend of people, cats, and mystery. Braun has gotten a style that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen while treating all of us cat lovers to two of the smartest cats on earth. All I cat say is don't start it until you can read it straight through because you will not want to put it down.	positive
title: Directing Actors [SEP] content: Judith Weston's Directing Actors is the Oxford Dictionary of English for anyone who wants to learn the language that actors and directors speak to each other. It details the work a director must do on their own before meeting with actors if she or he is to be successful in lifting the story to it's most fulfilling expression.Judith Weston's second book, A Film Director's Intuition, minutely describes every fiber in the strands of the rope that the director must finally use to tie all the elements of the writer's subconscious intention and the actor's sub textual imagination together to express the director's vision that Judith's script analysis process produces.Both books are generously peppered with hints on how to best use the little, but valuable time on the set, if that is all you have to spend with the actors.Karen Aschenbach, Director	positive
title: AWESOME! [SEP] content: I can't believe that my one year old can spend so much time playing with cups! He will stack them and nest them. You can hide things under them or use them in the tub. It is a pre math skill. They are easy to transport and very good quality. I great gift for a young toddler. My only complaint was that they were so hard to find. The only place I could find a good quality product was online.	positive
title: Fabulous-Hors D' oeurvres [SEP] content: Hors D'oeuvresThe Hors D'oeuvres in this book are fabulous and very easy. All my guest love the Hors D'oeuvres that I have made from this book. You will love it too!	positive
title: The title is an oxymoron, but they did a good job of making it simple [SEP] content: I actually really like this book, but I think you do need the extra guidance of a professor when using it. It's very easy to look up the pharmaceuticals and all related info, and I was actually able to use it easily when taking the open book section (looking up the pharms) of a pharmacotherapeutics test. I would definitely recommend this book.	positive
title: Het fantastische boek [SEP] content: Ik nam De Kristal Stap uit van mijn plaatselijke bibliotheek. Zij hebben een onderdeel voor nieuwe vrijlatingen en van de joue binnenkwam slechts. Ik moet zeggen dat ik echt van dit boek hield. Het was veel zoals wat ik hoewel jaren geleden toen mijn moeder werd hertrouwd ging en ik kreeg een nieuwe stap zus en broer die reeped verwoesting op mijn het leven ik wist voor hen. Dit boek indien geweldig voor enig kind door deze soort van dilema gaand. En ik genoot echt van het lezen van dit boek en zal nu uit je andere boeken ook gaan en nemen. Dit is een echt geweldig boek.	positive
title: good cuppa [SEP] content: Good quality and nice looking but only keeps coffee warm for a short time. Does drip if the lid is not exactly positioned correctly but other than that very happy with the press pot.	positive
title: This is the one! [SEP] content: If you haven't purchased anything by Elmore James, this is the place to start. Some of his best music, recorded well and full of the intense energy he was famous for.Screaming slide guitar put to a rockin' beat.Some may say it lacks the "hits" you find on every other James disc, but it doesn't matter, because the songs on this are all excellent! Listen to his vocals on "happy home". Easily among his top performances. Play it loud! Rocking blues at it's best.	positive
title: Travelers of Spain [SEP] content: I thought that this was a good book. I put myself in the places that I read about. I think that Mallorca would be a wonderful place to visit and meet all of the colorful personalities.	positive
title: Very good, very personal [SEP] content: Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's "Straight up" and "Wish you were here" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. "Golders Green" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. "Dawn" is a beutiful Psych ballad,"Makes me feel so good" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.	positive
title: review of Braun 7526 [SEP] content: I received my Braun 7526 sooner than the date that it was promised and it looked like it was brand new. The sideburn trimer is excellent. The shaver works great but I think I have an easier time shaving with a Norelco rotary.	positive
title: Convenient, Compact, Lightweight -- In My Purse All The Time [SEP] content: This is a really fantastic product. It is so small, sleek, and lightweight that it is easy to have it with me at all times. I find it invaluable for determining the size (and therefore the caloric consequences) of restaurant foods. Cannot recommend it highly enough. Go forth and weigh.	positive
title: One of his best [SEP] content: I love pretty much all of his writings, so I may be a bit biased, but this is a great get back story and has all the nice nitty gritty details to keep your attention	positive
title: Joe "Big Time" Budden [SEP] content: Joe Budden, maybe the future of Commercial Rap, His radio friendly single " Pump it up" is definetly a club banger, which sparks interest in the rest of his album, but previous to his album he made a name for himself on mixtapes & was even featured in the Source's Microphone Check. The Hype around this kid is big, and he pulled through with his freshman album. Its def. worth checking out, all the songs featured on the album are hot, the best song on the album in my eyes is track 11, "Calm Down".	positive
title: Great book [SEP] content: Easy to read, all recipes very "do-able", for a non- gourmet chef, but a pet owner who wishes to feed their pets good food.	positive
title: classic [SEP] content: My son absolutely loves this book. I got it for a baby shower gift and started crying after I read it. It is a great book to read and show your child. My son knows all of his body parts thanks to this book! Plus, I think you should always remind your children how much you love them and how amazing they are. I does all of these things. I never get tired of reading it. Nor, does my son get tired of asking for it.	positive
title: Pure tool [SEP] content: This is a great drill - screw gun. I bought it as a gift for a son in law who lives out of town so when I flew in for a visit I could help him tackle a big shelving installation using 3 inch decking screws. We used it for two days straight and I absolutely loved it. It was well balanced and powerful. It reversed direction smoothly when needed and was easy to handle.I was almost sad to leave it behind at his house but it was his birthday present after all!	positive
title: sorely missed on the tele [SEP] content: Now that MST3000 isn't being aired on Saturday mornings, it's good to be able to recreate those days and have a good laugh.	positive
title: Great Set [SEP] content: I upgraded from my DVD set to this one. Other reviewers have gone into the details, so I won't repeat anything here, suffice to say it's a great series. I would have liked to have seen more special features for the BD release, but you can't hope for much with a defunct series 10 years after the fact. The one thing that was missing, and it's a small thing, is just an episode list somewhere. One thing I liked about the DVD release was they had the episodes listed in series order and also the dates they were aired (totally out of order). That way you could clearly see how poorly handled this series was from FOX. It also let you know which episodes were on which disc. As it is with the BD release, know where does it say on any of the packaging or disc labels, which episodes are on which disc. It's a little thing, but I think it's important.	positive
title: Best travel mug [SEP] content: This mug is excellent. Keeps liquids hot and contained. Simple yet sturdy design prevents leaks. Solid construction means it will last. Highly recommended.	positive
title: When Mama Comes Home [SEP] content: We have been using this book in our Child Development Center for years. I love this book and bought one for my 6 month old Granddaughter (who is red headed like her mom) that lives in Haiti. (Missionaries)The illustrations are as pretty as the writing.	positive
title: Beauty Is A Real Gem [SEP] content: What makes this masterpiece speak for itself is the main ingredient none other than the tight harmonies flowing throughout this entire recording,infested with strong lyrics. "Attics Of My Life",smoothly flows like a fine wine remenisant of the Beatles classic,Sun King. And so Classic is as classic does in Jerry Garcia's signature tune,"Ripple",among other notable tunes ,"Sugar Magnolia","Operator","Friend Of The Devil","Box Of Rain". The tight instrumentation is subdued on this album leaving the vocals more room to stand out painting a visual in the listeners mind. Another Grateful Dead classic,an essential containing sixteen remastered tracks,ten are of the original 1970 album,the extra six are live versions of,Truckin',Friend Of The Devil,Til The Morning Comes,including a single version of Truckin',superior audio. An American Beauty.	positive
title: Great product [SEP] content: I love it, it a bit small, love the orange color inside too. Too bad not enought inside pockets. Just enought for a laptop and a small file. If you looking for something that can hold large file, this is not the right now.	positive
title: Works on Wii [SEP] content: i got this for my Japanese version of the game..works perfectly in my Wiitried with dk1(us and japenese), dk2(us and japenese), and dk3 (japanese)	positive
title: Great DVD except for the Kai Lan episode [SEP] content: I got this for my 3 year old niece to watch at my house, she loves it. The Kai Lan episode with "Stompy" is totally annoying! The elephant makes this wounded swan noise that as far as I've seen in nature programs, elephants never make. It's a cute show but Stompy makes that death throes of a swan wailing noise about 87 times and my niece watches it at least twice a week. So thanks Nickelodeon for making kids dvd's even more irritating for adults to listen to.	negative
title: junk [SEP] content: This soap dispenser broke within 2 months of use. It loses it's prime and no longer pumps at all. I threw it away and replaced it with a better quality soap dispenser.	negative
title: not that good [SEP] content: I couldn't get drawn in. Bad acting, very predictable and corny. A lot of unnecessary plot.. way too long. I feel like they did try and make a good movie, thus 2 stars instead of 1.	negative
title: I hate it. [SEP] content: I listened to it and don't like it. Buy king of all kings by Hate Eternal. With only three members they remain heavier than slipknot. Every song has a solo, they are noisier, the drumming is faster, the vocals are better, and the bass guitar is really heavy.	negative
title: More mold please [SEP] content: I have the napoli set and they are...VERY POORLY MADE!DO NOT BUY!The bottom of these dishes aren't sealed so if they aren't completely dry they will begin to gather mold and smell. Had to throw these out after a year of use because of this.	negative
title: Did not meet my expectations. [SEP] content: I saw this first on Oprah and guess I should have known better. But I tried it. It was WAY too thick for me, uncomfortably so. And though I purchased it mainly to help with migraine headaches, sleeping on it one night actually gave me a migraine. This seems gimmicky to me. I don't recommend it at all.	negative
title: Book of Dreams [SEP] content: I was a bit disappointed in this book. The beginning started out well and then I lost interest in the subject matter.	negative
title: Was not the edition I needed [SEP] content: I had searched by ISPN number and this book came up so I ordered it. Upon reciept of the book, I realized it was a very old edition and useless to me.	negative
title: I dislike this product [SEP] content: The product never dries, it stays sticky for hours. I have tried the ultra violet machine and blowing drying but it is still very sticky after several hours.	negative
title: A little American bashing is very funny. Every chapter is not. [SEP] content: I am a huge fan of Clarkson, and I greatly enjoy old and new Top Gear. I loved his Motorworld program. I enjoyed the excerpts of his books. But now, having purchased the full version, I am sick of it. Nearly ever chapter centers around fat, slothful Americans. A reference here and there is funny, but this is just over the top. I don't think I will buy another.	negative
title: Not recommended at all... [SEP] content: This book is very outdated with very stale and cliche type information. I trashed it soon after I received it.	negative
title: couldn't get the stupid thing to run [SEP] content: tried it on two computer. no luck. it kept freezing in the begining even before i got to do anything.	negative
title: I wanted it to be good, really I did [SEP] content: As much as any other horror fan, I'd liked to have seen Tobe Hooper come out swinging with a film that shows he still knows how it's done, but Toolbox Murders sure isn't it. You've seen the same basic premise handled much better a dozen times before (even in hogwash like The Sentinel) and Hooper does nothing new with it. He also never generates any real suspense in Toolbox, the gore murders are silly and pointless, and the acting is wildly uneven. It's too bad because there are a couple ideas here that you can imagine (or have already seen) put to effective use, but Hooper just doesn't make it work.	negative
title: item looks differently [SEP] content: The stethoscope, I got looks different from what I ve ordered...dont know why, but that is not what on pic. So, now in doubt if I got the right item.	negative
title: I was fool and bought this video. [SEP] content: Me and my friend bought this video thinking it was Ninja Scroll part 2. I wonder why i thought that myabe because IT SAYS THAT ON THE BOX!!!. We took it home watched it and went right back to the store to trade it for another video of the same price. There is nothing good about this video it's short and has nothing to do with N.S. avoid it at all cost please!	negative
title: Low, even by Larry standards [SEP] content: Larry the cable guy, star of blue collar comedy tour, blue collar tv, and various morning radio shows, has made an attempt at making a movie. Unfortunately, It would have been better if he would had just left it as a stand up act. Incorperating a stand up comedians work into a movie is a tricky task, and as with many, this movie failed as well. Just corny overall. Weak storyline, and I just did not find myself laughing, and Larry is a funny guy. So Unfortunately, the movie just didn't "git r done", so save your money and get one of Larry's CDs or stand up shows.	negative
title: Much bigger than described [SEP] content: These glasses are described as holding 5-5/8 ounces. A serving of champagne is 4 ounces, so I was excited that I would be able to fill my guests' glasses most of the way while still giving them a reasonable portion.The glasses arrived this morning, and I could tell my looking that they were not 5-5/8 ounces. If you fill one to the brim, it is 8 ounces. I can't imagine how they arrived at the very specific (yet apparently arbitrary) 5.625 number.My two key criteria were that (1) I was looking for a glass that would hold around 6oz and (2) I wanted it to be tall and slender. So, I can only give this glass 1 star. It is tall and fat, and holds nearly 1.5 times as much as they say it does.Other than that, it is as described.	negative
title: Not new [SEP] content: This was clearly refurbished. The pink plates didn't even match and some of them were worn and dirty looking. It's also set with Cingular backgrounds and logos, I have T-Mobile. Didn't like that either. If they sell something for 100.00 and say it's new, it should be new!	negative
title: Sort of readable but forgettable [SEP] content: This novel is trying to be an exploration of passion but comes off as bloodless and wooden. Fifteen-year-old fallen woman Olympia Biddeford, the main character, never comes to life, and the author's attempts to convince us her relationship with a man three times her age is a deep spiritual love is ludicrous. The book is by the numbers, and the attempt at 19th-century speak is irritating. Did not people ever use contractions in their speech back then? I cannot believe they did not, but I shall not argue with the author further.	negative
title: Damaged In Route [SEP] content: I recieved the item and it was dammaged. I believe that this occured in route but do not know. The original merchant replaced item free-of-charge.	negative
title: AAA (An Aimless Album) [SEP] content: I wanted to like this album, I really did. After hearing a fantastic collaboration with Astor Piazzolla on an album they did in 1955, I couldn't wait to hear more. I surfed Solal's album selection on this site and settled on Bluesine as a place to start.Rarely have I been more disappointed. The music is choppy, discordant, and aimless. This just isn't the kind of jazz piano I like. Some do, I suppose, but like pickled jellyfish, its definitely an acquired taste. It is likely to gather dust until someone asks to hear it because a couple of listens is about all I could take.	negative
title: NOOOOOOOOOO THANKS!! [SEP] content: I ordered this product for the Kodack Zi8 camcorder to "improve" the poor mic quality and hoped this would do it but sadly I must say IT DIDN'T. I adjusted and tweeked it but nothing helped, the mic in the camera was better than this added one. This mic might work well with another type of recording machine but not this camcorder so I don't recommened it for the Kodak Zi8.	negative
title: Doesnt work [SEP] content: Just received machine today, very excited put it together followed directions and machine doesnt even turn on, yes that is what i said heating element didnt turn on, spinner didnt turn, motor didnt turn on. Machine has two off and on switches and one light on one switch lit up but nothing worked.If you buy this machine do yourself a favor and plug it in to see if it works before you go through the trouble of assembling it.	negative
title: Don't waste your time or money [SEP] content: This is not "investigative reporting." The book is filled with nonsense. The author did not do any basic research into the teachings or traditions of the Holy Catholic Church. Her title is even wrong, all religious women are NOT nuns.We need to thank most of these Sisters who gave their life to Christ. Mercy Sisters founded the first hospital in Chicago. Catholic Sisters came from Europe and immediately went to the Civil War battlefields nursing soldiers from the north and south. I could go on and on about the schools, hospitals, universities founded by these great women.	negative
title: I can't believe I wasted my time on this! [SEP] content: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I wish I had spent that 80 minutes doing something more important. The movie was poorly written and wasn't frightnening at all. The only thing it left me with at the end, was anger that I had rented it and a horrible headache from the constant shaky camera angles!	negative
title: Broken :( [SEP] content: On my 2nd batch of bone treats for my dogs the middle size bone snapped open :( Bummed! I read all the reviews and I was very gentle while pressing....very cheaply made but are able to get the job done.	negative
title: Oops? [SEP] content: This version of one of my favorite poems seems to have one small problem - the poem itself seems to be missing! The notes are great, however.	negative
title: Some good content, hidden behind impossibly bad writing [SEP] content: A few helpful nuggets, strewn randomly across almost 500 pages of rambling natterings. Comically poorly written book. Seems like the author did some excellent research on a worthy topic, but then felt the key findings were too light to monetize, and decided to stretch a very finite set of insights and suggestions that could easily fit on a couple of pages across (multiple!) tedious filibuster books. It pleased me to see the cheap newspaper stock of this incoherent tome disintegrate in my fireplace.	negative
title: [Garbage]... [SEP] content: Generic [garbage]... Nothing new. Has a NIN/Ministry type of sound, with ... tough-guy lyrics. Very boring, and is probably a great example of the nu-wave movement; one of the worst rock/metal movements ever.	negative
title: Refused to finish the book- It made me SICK [SEP] content: I agree with all the complaints I have read here, this is my very FIRST review I have ever written on any product and I have been using amazon for years. I wish I would have read reviews before I purchased the book, I normally do however I was in a hurry and wanting something asap when I found out I was having twins. This book is all about the author and her own experience and about everything that can go wrong. It does not have healthy beneficial advice or outlooks on having a happy ending. I hope that more people will write a review, I am actually so upset about what I did read that I intend to try to contact the author.	negative
title: Handle broke the second time I used it [SEP] content: The umbrella's handle fell apart the second time I used it.It's too bad, because the canopy of the umbrella seemed to be pretty good. But the handle seemed to be obviously cheap and shoddy to me, before I used it. And then it just fell apart when I did.I don't get where GustBuster is coming from on this. Most people buy super cheap umbrellas on the street while it's raining. But if someone takes the time to look for umbrellas on Amazon, they probably won't really care if an umbrella is $30 or $40. I just wanted something solid. I had a good umbrella that lasted me 12 years, and then I lost it. I wanted to replace it. That's the GustBuster market -- people who take the time to look around, who are willing to pay more, and who want quality.It seems crazy to cut corners on the handle to save a buck. They should build it right and raise the price.Until they do, buyer beware.	negative
title: What's with the cover??? [SEP] content: I should have known by the cover that this book was alittle over the top. Everyone who saw me reading it was also slightly disturbed and had lots of questions. I enjoyed the historical aspect of the book and being an OB/GYN nurse, the midwifery parts, too. The details of the torture scenes and the sadistic personality of the Inquisitor were too graphic and upsetting to me to allow me to relax and enjoy the story. I've already sold it back to the used bookstore that I purchased it from.	negative
title: Cool idea, insufficient execution [SEP] content: This should have been a CD-ROM or DVD product. The stills did nothing to inspire or educate me on motion graphic techniques. Nice philosophic text though.	negative
title: Didn't Seem to Work [SEP] content: Tried for quite a while, my dog seemed to get worse, more stiff and less playful + he would spit them out, had a hard time getting him to eat them. Went back to cod liver oil / salmon oil & baby aspirin, he is much happier.	negative
title: save your time [SEP] content: I am glad I opened this before giving as a gift. The manufacturer has quality control issues. The product that was delivered had only 3 of the 4 rails connected to the glass. The reason why the 4th rail was not connected is that there was no threading drilled in the "ball" for the screw to connect the rail to the glass. They did include the screw in the packaging but without the threads it is worthless. Very cheaply made with no quality inspection before shipping. This was an OBVIOUS defect.	negative
title: Missing text/sentences make this annoying to read [SEP] content: I was amazed when I first discovered the missing text/sentences in this edition, but I am halfway through this book and have many many times come across places where it looks like this: ......" said Vronsky. And the missing text is just not in there to read!This is a five star book but I give a 1 star rating on account of missing text which is unforgivable IMO.I don't understand how this has happened???	negative
title: Poorly made peeelers [SEP] content: Peelers on the market today are of a poor quality so I was happy to see a more sturdy design. I was disappointed however. It bearly peeled carrots and I tried different angles to be sure.	negative
title: um no [SEP] content: I dont own this but have listined to the cclips on here, and the music sounds alright but the vocals sound like a bad Jack Black wannabe- INCUBUS DESERVES MUCH BETTER	negative
title: Weak writing about Matthew 18:15-17 (Biblical Church Discipline) [SEP] content: I read John MacArthur's book The Freedom and Power of Forgivness and R.T. Kendall's book Total Forgiveness a week apart from each other. I found the MacArthur book a stronger book, its biblical insights, and the important coverage given to Matthew 18:15-17, Biblical Church Discipline.Mr. Kendall's book, while sincere and hopeful, doesn't properly articulate Matthew 18:15-17 for dealing with peoples' strongholds of sin. Either Mr. Kendall wasn't taught it, doesn't know how to carry it out, or doesn't know how to carry it out effectively and Biblically. Some of his suggestions about why we shouldn't confront people are contrary to Jesus' express commands that we are required to confront people in their sins (Matt:18:15-17). I found Jay Adams book Handbook of Church Discipline helpful in explaining Matthew 18:15-17, along with John MacArthur's book on Forgiveness, and Ken Sande's book The Peacemaker.	negative
title: Buyer Beware [SEP] content: Warning: This cannot be canceled, no matter how quick. Return is difficult, and expense of buyer. Watch looks like it came from a gumball machine.	negative
title: It should include their singles. [SEP] content: This is an OK greatest hits type of album, but since the title includes the word "Singles", they should have included more singles. The cover picture just screams for singles from Boy and October. This would have been much better if the less than memorable unreleased songs were left off for more singles. I would recommend getting their other two greatest hits so you get better coverage.	negative
title: Bad Design [SEP] content: My husband bought this and we have had it over 2 years without any of the issues others have experienced. However, the water reservoir is a bad design. It constantly sticks and you have to use a lot of strength at times to pull it out and I always feel like I'm going to break it. You also really have to jam it back in and water sploshes out when you do. It is also a very small reservoir. It only hold enough for a small to maybe medium size cup. I like to make a large cup of hot tea, but it doesn't hold enough water. I just don't like it and would never purchase this again.	negative
title: Disgusting! [SEP] content: Salty, too hard to bite, and tastes like chewing on a salt lick. With so much sodium, this is totally a terrible choice. Do not buy!	negative
title: broken stapler [SEP] content: This "heavy duty" stapler is anything but. The tab holding in the staples is a light piece of plastic that breaks off after a year or two of use. How dumb can they be making a heavy duty metal staple dependent on a crappy little plastic tab	negative
title: Don't buy any books with this kind of "Faces" [SEP] content: I bought several "The Complete Reference: ..." style books. I am really and deeply disappointed with them. They are just cheating every time they say "the complete reference:...".Honestly, the content of this book is OK (including others in this kind of "faces"). But, before I bought them, I really wanted to get a good reference but not some kind of entry level's books. Unfortunately they are almost some kind of entry level's books.I hate "cheating in this way". The publisher or editor or write, whoever made decision on the title of these books, are liars, disgusting liars.So, I won't buy this kind of books again. I will give the lowest rate for all this kind of books just because they use "title" to cheat on the market!By the way, if you are beginners, don't quit and some books (such as "The complete reference: Java 1.1" and "The Complete reference: HTML 4") are very good for the beginners.Just trust me.	negative
title: No quality control [SEP] content: I bought this kit last week and it arrived defective right out of the box. The compressor was leaking right at the first connection out of the tank, which could not be tightened. It would not build pressure and run constantly (and loudly). I had to return it. It's impossible that such an issue would not have been found during testing, which means there was no quality control whatsoever.	negative
title: Great Idea - disappointing product [SEP] content: I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.	negative
title: So where are the moves? [SEP] content: This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted.	negative
title: unsatisfied [SEP] content: here is a game that had potential , but dont waste your money. The controls are horrible and unresponsive and the training levels seem to last forever. Not much pay-off in thisgame for all the patience it requires. Do yourself a favor and get jedi knight 2 jedi outcast.	negative
title: I am not an audiophile, or into recording but I am giving these a poor review because of their construction [SEP] content: I bought these because I was in need of a pair of good quality headphones, with good longevity, to wear while I study for finals. I paid 93.08 cents after taxes for these. The sound quality is what i expected, but the construction of these feel incredibly cheap. I will be returning them in a few days, and ordering a pair of krk kns-6400 or 8400.	negative
title: Dog Day Afternoon [SEP] content: It took only an hour or so of reading this bizarre story before I threw the book in my trash can. As a fan of Patricia Cornwell's, I've always looked forward to reading a new title, but this one is disappointing. Isle of Dogs might appeal to those who enjoy talking fish, conversations of crabs, dog's thoughts and computer skills, and seeing-eye mini-horses, but for that sort of thing I prefer Peter Rabbit, Uncle Wiggly, Winnie the Pooh, or science fiction.	negative
title: GI Type Military Repellent [SEP] content: I ordered this repellent to take to Africa. The scent was overpowering. The idea of this toxic substance penetrating my skin and clothing put me off and I never did use it.	negative
title: Awful saw [SEP] content: Received saw, immediately set to cutting simple straight cut mahogany. This is without a doubt the worst saw I have ever used. I can't understand why this saw is so terrible, aside of the fact that the teeth looked completely unsharpened! They appeared to be stamped and not sharpened as though the saw missed an entire step on the assembly line. I was looking to replace a 10 year old, never sharpened, Stanley straight back saw. This saw left exit tear-out 10 times worse than that ancient saw.Sent it back the day after I bought it.	negative
title: IS NO STARS A OPTION? [SEP] content: I didn't get it and could only get through 3/4 of the movie.Please someone tell me the funny parts because I was bored silly and could not understand how EW gave this a A rating.Annoying, boring actors without anything to hold any kind of entertaining merit.	negative
title: They Should Have Recalled This One [SEP] content: Revolting. Repulsive. Turgid. Vile. Nauseating. Did I leave any perjoratives out? This is one of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. It's nothing more than a big budget slasher movie that borders on the pornographic. How respectable actors like Jude Law and Forest Whitaker can involve themselves in such dreck is beyond me. How this project was ever greenlighted is equally unfathomable. There may have been some dark humor to be mined by the film's dubious premise but as executed here it's just unpleasant. Do yourself a favor and avoid this sadistic exercise. Poking hot needles in your eyes would be more worth your while.	negative
title: Lying History [SEP] content: There isn't much to recommend about this book. It should be listed under Fiction headings.	negative
title: Bear and the Dragon Drags On [SEP] content: All of his books are too long and this one is waaaaaaay to long. In the past, I didn't care because I would just scan through much of his rambling because the bottom line was the books were enjoyable. But this one is boring. Once the action finally starts, around page 750, the passages are wordy and without any real imagination. Does Clancy get paid by the word?Lastly, we all know he is a conservative Republican but the inclusion of his political views so many times was uncalled for.The writer of "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger" is taking himself way to seriously has apparently killed the Golden Goose.	negative
title: What a wast of time [SEP] content: It speaks volumes that Bill O'Reily loved this book.The book is a horrid waste of time and waste of money. The sexist attitude towards flight attendants, homophobic comments, and childish approach towards 'scoring with a stew', is what you would expect from a High Schooler and not a pilot.I've worked for an airline for years, spent many hours in cockpit and never experienced the outrageous behavior the author has described. Pilots sleeping on the floor while a newbie on a 747 flies the entrie HNL-AKL leg, does not happen. If it did, all three pilots should lose their ticket.Don't waste your time/money or encourage the author by purchasing or reading this trash.	negative
title: Read it if you must [SEP] content: Good story, terrible writing.Anderson's prose is trite, unimaginative, and, far too often, simply laughable. Which is a shame because the story is compelling.This is a key part of the Star Wars extended universe, however. So, read it if you must. But you've been warned.	negative
title: Can't recommend it. [SEP] content: Warning: animals and humans are tortured in this book. But that's not why I rated it "poor." It's because I figured out, almost from the beginning, who was behind it all and after that, I really didn't care. There were red herrings trying to divert suspicion, chapters that took you into the killer's mind, a massive government conspiracy, a romance for the protagonist, and I still didn't care. In fact, I ended up skimming through most of the book. I've enjoyed other books by Hecht, but just can't recommend this one.	negative
title: Couldn't Get Into It [SEP] content: While the first 20 or so pages of Loraine Adams' "Harbor" had me on the edge of my easy chair, the story seemed to ramble after that and I found it harder and harder to pick up the book. At the start we are enthralled by the story of Aziz, an Algerian illegal immigrant, as he leaps off the boat he stowed away on and swims to the Boston harbor. The tale of his first few days is compelling...after that it seems a miasma of a story of living with characters that we can't really care about. For me, the promise of the beginning was not fulfilled.	negative
title: Money from America [SEP] content: Who ever invested money in this production needs therapy as they have obviously got more money than sense.	negative
title: Not so toddler-tough [SEP] content: My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday. Within minutes, the cover of the drum was broken. She was not extra-rough with it. It is just very poorly-made. Surprising for Melissa & Doug.	negative
title: Rescue me from reading this.... [SEP] content: This book is slow, seems half-written and I thought the ending terrible. After finishing the book I felt cheated. I don't think the characters were fully explored, the story was sometimes muddled and the end felt like it should have been the begining of the real story! I say pass on it and take something else to the beach to read.	negative
title: All Wrong [SEP] content: This book is almost completely factually inaccurate. The math is wrong, the technology is made up, and the author confuses a lot of his terms. It's obvious that some -- perhaps even enough -- research was performed, and it's also obvious that the author understood none of it. Don't. Read. This. Book.	negative
title: Print Shop Deluxe 22 [SEP] content: This program is not compatible with Windows Vista. It locks up or just stops working.	negative
title: One and Done [SEP] content: Worked great for my smoker once. The next time I tried I couldn't get a temperature reading. I'm assuming it's a bad probe. This thing is crap. Never buying a Taylor product again.	negative
title: marketing at it's worst [SEP] content: it is fairly well known that many fans of the show are not little kids. As such how can this outrage continue what is the point of releasing a dvd without a widescreen format? I won't even buy this mockery of a release. They release B-horror movies in widescreen so why not the Powerpuff Girls movie?	negative
title: Beautiful picture color! [SEP] content: I am really surprised to see so many good reviews. I like Christmas movies and I even like Jenny McCarthy, but this movie was absolutely boring. I am glad I got it from the library. It felt like a waste of time watching it. The colors in the movie are quite beautiful for which I give a 2, but the plot stunk. I don't even think the acting was, it was just not a good plot.	negative
title: A waste of money! [SEP] content: This factory refurbished model 360 GPS worked for about ten hours. Initially it worked fine. It then failed to pick up the satellite signal or would loose the signal as a drove along on a trip. I called tech support for help twice. The service personnel are very difficult to understand and they also have trouble understanding me. It is a language issue. They suggested various tests and reprogramming but it did not correct the problem. The unit was fifteen days past the 90 day warrantee so they wanted me to ship back the unit and charge me $144.00 to examine it. I can't afford to pour any more money down that hole for ten hours of service. Stay away from the refurbished unit and don't buy a new unit without an extended warrantee.	negative
title: Hard to drink from, leaked [SEP] content: I really love my 1 liter Platy, but the 2 liter versions are too big and floppy to drink from easily, especially with the closure cap. On top of my overall disappointment with the product, it started leaking soon after I bought it.	negative
title: Go with TurboTax instead [SEP] content: I switched from Turbo Tax because of the offer with MS money, which I use for online bill paying. I figuered since I use that far more frequently, it was better to go with the TaxCut/Money offer. BIG MISTAKE. I had to hunt around to find deductions I knew I was entitled to but was not asked about, and when I imported my deductions in from MS Money, it brought over the payees only, not the amounts. TurboTax worked better with MS Money, and I'm now a loyal TurboTax user from here on in.	negative
title: Wow - what imagination [SEP] content: Despite the fact that the witnesses, ballistics, autopsies, and sheriff reports all point to the fact that there were no "Christian martyrs" at columbine, the author tries to get us to swallow the stories anyway, as if we have no other source for information. He claims that the sheriff and media are covering the truth, his "truth" being that there is a war against Christianity (sheriff and media are fighting Jesus). That is just the beginning of the bunk this guy tries to force feed young America. This is propagand on the largest scale. The good side is that most will realize that this is put out by some who are desperately trying to hang on to their time in the spotlight (and make a little money while they are at it), even if they have to use tragic teen deaths to do so.	negative
title: YOU NEED AN AMPLIFIER TOO...! [SEP] content: The product description is not clear at all but you need an amplifier for this. I had to pay to have the product shipped back even though THEIR product description was incorrect.	negative
title: Romantic Rape? [SEP] content: I enjoy romance novels. I do not enjoy reading about a woman who is abducted, continually raped, impregnated, and then FALLS IN LOVE with her rapist. I kept reading hoping that he would get his just dessert. But he didn't. She falls in love with him and he gets "reformed." ????? The whole time all I could think was--this is called Stockholm Syndrome! I was horrified that this was considered a romance. The rape scenes were graphic and, in many cases, violent.Johanna Lindsey should be ashamed of herself for making rape romantic. It is horrible. DO NOT READ!!!	negative
title: The lag is a big problem... [SEP] content: There is no doubt that the graphics in Sim City 4 are better than those of SC 3000, but the lag you get in return is not worth the relatively puny graphic improvement. Originally, I thought the problem was my computer, but after meeting the requirements, defragging (and going on a deleting spree), and reading similar complaints at both Amazon and Simcity4.com, I'm disspaointed to realize that there is probably something wrong with the game.Hopefully a patch will fix this...	negative
title: broken globe [SEP] content: Globe fell out and broke.Sent several e-mails about a replacement globe with no answers.Poor customer service. How to get another globe?	negative
title: If you have a KB37, DO NOT buy this bag. [SEP] content: If you own a Toneport or Pod Studio KB37, this bag will not fit around your keyboard. Some people say you can and it's a tight squeeze, but it's so tight that if you do manage to smash it in somehow it feels like the bag is going to crack your keyboard if you bump it in to something. Do yourself a favor. Get the GK 2110 insteadMicro Keyboard Gig Bagsalthough it does not say line 6 on the front, it is a perfect fit for the KB37.	negative
title: Sounds like it was written by a high school kid [SEP] content: I enjoyed Dan Brown's previous books, but Digital Fortress was a complete waste of time. The basic story could have been good, but the majority of the plot twists and turns were sophomoric, at best. It read like a love-struck high school kid was writing a novel for a composition class. Don't waste your time. Enjoy Angels and Demons, along with The DaVinci Code, and let it go at that.	negative
title: My Beautiful Johnny Why? [SEP] content: I did not like this film at all I found it very boring!!! And I honestly hated How hidous They made Johnny depp. That bothered me the most!!!! yuck!	negative
title: Let's be honest...not that great. [SEP] content: I'm a little troubled by most of the reviews that I've seen for Groundation. It seems that all of these "real reggae fans" have overlooked the fact that this album is average at best. Bob, Steel Pulse, Midnite, Luciano, Don Carlos, we could go on forever, there is just too much GOOD reggae out there. Unfortunately "We Free Again" and everything else I've heard from Groundation just does not live up to the hype you'll see here in these reviews. Seriously, even John Brown's Body is better. Check out Midnite's RAS MEK PEACE if you want to hear some REAL reggae. I mean if you like Groundation, you'll wet your pants when you hear Midnite.if you want "the real thing."	negative
title: What is this, a bootleg? [SEP] content: I admit that I didn't read the previous reviews, and snatched this up on the spur of the moment with another item I'd ordered. I was attracted by the price and by the apparent completeness of the earliest of Dragnet episodes. I'm puzzled by the omission of the Dragnet theme, so iconic that without it, the shows seem very flat. I'm disappointed at the video quality as well, as if these are copied from a well worn film rather than the masters. Overall, for the cheap price, I guess one can't expect too much.	negative
title: Lasted 4 months [SEP] content: Nice while it worked but after using it a dozen times, the turbin started chafing against the housing and it stopped working: after opening, we concluded it was a very poor design.	negative
title: Non PC Friendly!!! [SEP] content: I play all of my cds in my PCs or Archos Jukebox. This cd refused to play in both of my iMac & Laptop. It has some kind of copy-protected technology to prevent people playing this in their PC. I've contacted BMG,AG as suggested to inform them of the problems & received no reply. DO NOT buy this cd if you are going to play it in your PC!!! I love their music but now I'm out [money] for a disc that I can't even listen to (still sitting on my desk & haven't heard one song!). I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!	negative
title: A fruity foursome strikes again. [SEP] content: To start things off with, this album deserves negative stars. After listening to this album countless times, I came to the conclusion that this is the sort of music that I might think that pirates would listen to. The music is brimming with emotional drivel that makes me quite sea sick. It's time for this fatuous foursome of the seven seas to try something new in life like treasure hunting or shoe shining, but not making another appearance to the studio but to produce nothing but balderdash.	negative
title: the world has gone mad [SEP] content: Please stop the madness and the hype. Jay Z, Jigga, Shawn C. whatever moniker you choose to address him by - should have stayed in retirement. He missed with this one and tried to compensate with an entourage of A list producers. The heart and soul (i.e. passion) is clearly missing."I am the Michael Jordan of record'an" - "Show Me What Ya Got". This is just one of countless examples of how lame and cliche this return from retirement is. Does anybody remember when MJ came out of retirment? What he was like with the Wizards? nuff said.If this CD - ironically titled Kingdom Come is all J has... God help hiphop. Resurrect a real emcee to do the thang.	negative
title: Do Not Buy This Printer! [SEP] content: I would HIGHLY recommend buying another printer than this piece of s&#*. It worked fine for the first few weeks, then it suddenly kept coming up with an error message that cannot be bypassed. The Canon tech support was not helpful in the least, and I ended up having to buy a whole new set of ink cartridges. Very disappointed with this product and Canon in general.	negative
title: This is one of my favorite books [SEP] content: But there is not a copywrite page or anything official looking. There are so many editing mistakes, words misspelled and not capitalized properally. I gave it as a gift because it is one of my favorite books, but I am embarrassed that I gave such a terrible reproduction.	negative
title: Not a very powerful heater for its size. [SEP] content: I purchased this heater for our patio room which was the guest room for Christmas visitors this year. I found that the heater took a long time to heat a 16 X 12 foot room, and it needed to be run almost constantly to maintain the comfort of the room. Also the full wattage setting didn't seem to heat any better than the 750 watt setting. I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long. It remains to be seen how long this one will last. I never did try the remote, so I can't speak to that.	negative
title: too commercialized??? [SEP] content: the first few songs on this album get it going but then it drops off dramatically. The songs seem too similar and don't flow like pauls previous albums.As a fan of PVD, this seems like he is going more commercial instead of sticking with the basics. I think that Vorsprung Dyk Technik is still his best album, too bad it is out of print, if it ever becomes available again, grab it.	negative
title: Water everywhere! [SEP] content: Though I usually don't write reviews, I thought it worthwhile to point out the problem I had with this product: It no longer has enough suction to get the water from the floor into the receptacle. Instead it would suck up water for a bit, then deposit it somewhere else in a puddle. I can't return it since the warranty has expired; I was the only one in the household using it, and I usually didn't have floor duty, so it didn't see all that much use. I cleaned all the parts I could get to; I suspect that somewhere along the suction route something has degraded or broken loose. Given the other reviews here of this nature, I don't really wish to spend more money getting it fixed, though, so back to mops I go!	negative
title: Can't give it zero stars [SEP] content: I wanted to read this book because of the controversy it has generated. There are only 7 editors and contributors who wrote this 6 chapter, 170 page "textbook." The premise is that this "textbook" contrasts intelligent design and Darwinian evolution. In actuality, the book selectively promotes facts and theories that support intelligent design and ignores the other 99% of the existant data. This book is a horrible joke. A religious text masquerading as a scientific textbook. I have to wonder...what do the people who believe this book is credible think about cosmology, particle physics, the rest of the universe out there, and the rest of science that has been discovered in the last 2,000 years. Well, I guess if you make believe it simply doesn't (or even can't) exist, you never have to contemplate it or worry about explaining it. That does make life a lot simpler, doesn't it! I feel better now. Guess I'll stay here with my head in the sand for a while longer.	negative
title: Not worth your time [SEP] content: The two best things I can say about this movie are 1) it is very short, and 2) I rented it so can return it asap. I don't watch movies like this for the plot (good thing!) or the cast, but for the special effects. Which in this case means a whole lot of camera shaking. It makes no sense, there are way too many holes in it, and what in the world is up with Judd Nelson's hair?	negative
title: Wasn't dat great [SEP] content: Diz dvd was alright not all dat great what realy saved it was scenes from blackthought from the roots rhymin about random thangz & the mosdef scene other then dat ? Freestyle was pretty boring. They focus 2 much on supernat insted of focusing on the better onez and why wasnt redman on this dvd ? The vets of this like some one said befo kool k, tribe,REDMAN,kurupt, krs etc... Supernat is brilliant at wut he doez, dont get me wrong but he's not the best. Watch rhyme & reason , the mc, and scratch for better hip hop documentaries. The bahamadia scene & medusa scene were tight doe.	negative
title: Give it time. [SEP] content: maybe in a few years i'll like this cd but, i miss the style of songs from their first cd. My favorite song would have to be, For a reason. When i first got the cd i only liked things like Mr. DJ, Vibe, Groove thing. but, i was also 13/14 then i got older and saw the true beauty of the cd and i think this is what will happen to most who own Saturday night. so in a few years you'll be loving it like the first cd.	negative
title: If your a real fan - you have compiled it already [SEP] content: This little "book" is not worth the money payed for it. If you are a big fan of crusade, you probably have compiled this list by yourself. If you are not a fan, you better wait for a real guidebook like those published about Babylon 5.	negative
title: "Daft Price" is putting it mildly... [SEP] content: Any other time I would support Rammstein by buying their official releases from Amazon or retail stores...but at $200?!?!?! Sorry, you lost me on this one.Off to the MP3 sites for this one. Mind you, only the LEGAL sites.	negative
title: very disappointed [SEP] content: I received the massage cushion in damaged position. The back massage portion would not work.	negative
title: Please skip this one [SEP] content: This is a piece of junk - the cars are supposed to hook together and be able to be dragged along by an 18 month old. The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3. And at that point, this toy is a little beneath them.Terrible, stupid design. I'm glad I got it as a gift, I would have hated to have spent any money on it.	negative
title: Bad Writing and Worse Directing....... [SEP] content: This is a sad, sad collection of mostly movies that never should have been made. The movies are full of politically correct platitudes, silliness, and cornball antics. The characters are all over done to the point of being totally unbelievable. There are some excellent actors in the movies, but the movies themselves are so bad there is little those actors could do to salvage the movie.This collection is little more than series of tedious and repetitious pontifications of Mr. Kramer's extremely liberal political views to the point that the movies become predictable, boring, at times offensive, at times silly, and generally unentertaining.Save your money. This is collection no deal at any price.	negative
title: Poor and Time Degrading Performance [SEP] content: I've purchased two of the Cyberhome DVD-300 players in 24 months. The first one performed acceptably for approx. 18 months, then began to produce erratic/frozen video feed which lead to purchase of second unit. The second unit's out-of-the-box performance never equaled the first unit's. Within the first month of use it was producing the same erratic/frozen video feed - even from brand new dvd's! I will never again waste money on any cyberhome product. Please be aware that the bargain you believe you are buying isn't that great when you have to replace it every 12-18 months......	negative
title: A realistic life of Lucas would have been more interesting. [SEP] content: Great acting, OK directing and terrible writing. Washington, Ejiofor and Crowe and great as usual, Scott seems to be bored and the writing might just be mediocre if it wasn't claimed to be "based on a true story." Among the bizarre claims is that Frank Lucas' collaboration "lead to the conviction of three-quarters of the NY DEA." Reality: zero convictions. He only testified against fellow dealers. Also his relationship with Bumpy Johnson has been falsified. Johnson's widow calls Lucas a liar and the movie false. These are just two of about a half dozen major distortions. Gangster movies are apparently going back to Godfather style fantasy rather than to realism.	negative
title: ANOTHER WARNING ON MP3 DOWNLOAD!!! [SEP] content: I also purchased the mp3 download and it is NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF 2 SONGS!! Sparkling in the Sand and Knock Yourself Out are from the "East Bay Grease" CD. They are NOT EVEN LIVE VERSIONS, no less from Live and in Living Color. These certainly ought to be pulled from the site for purchase, or fix the horrid error.	negative
title: Okay... but [SEP] content: It was an okay book I suppose. It sagged during the middle. I am in Andrea's fiction writers support group, and she is not a very nice person. She puts others down, so that may have cast a shadow over it for me.	negative
title: flaking [SEP] content: Not what I had expected for the price. I think that I feel better about using the $.99 plastic scoop. The coating has been flaking off since receiving the scoop. It was a gift that I would like to return or exchange.	negative
title: Tries too hard to make a point [SEP] content: The makers of this movie try so hard to ram their point down your throat that they forget to make a good movie -- which is quite a feat when you have Gary Oldman, Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater, and Sam Elliott all at their best or near best.	negative
title: Do not waste your time! [SEP] content: This film was a disappointment to me. Even though the director has modernised the film, it still seems "wrong" somewhere. I dont know if its cos of the dialogue.Learnado Dicaprio is definately not the right person to play Romeo, neither is Claire Danes. Is it just me, but arent Romeo and Juliet supposed to be good looking? Neither of them are even remotely good looking. This film would Definately put people off Shakespeare, So i recommend that you read the book first before attempting to watch this atrocity.	negative
title: Another Clarke classic ruined [SEP] content: Clarke is deservedly considered one of the giants of science fiction. In recent years, for some reason, he has been producing many collaborations, and in every one of them, Clarke's genius trips over the banality of his collaborators. Why anyone thought one of my favorite books, The City and the Stars, needed to be reworked, I'll never understand. How bad is the pollution of Clarke's original? At one point in BTFoN the characters travel to earth's moon. But in TCATS, we learned that the moon was destroyed millions of years ago! It was a major plot point when the protagonist discovered the reason that the moon was destroyed. Did Benford even read the original? Does Clarke not remember it? Was the editor asleep? This is quite simply a bad book.	negative
title: Poor Quality [SEP] content: We recieved one for our son's 3rd birthday this June. He LOVED it, but we had to take it back because the sound didn't play. All it kept doing was making the switching of pictures noise. Our replacement did the same thing. We've come to find out that a few of our other friends had the same problem. Until the problem gets fixed, I wouldn't recommend buying one...it seems to be a BIG waste of time.	negative
title: WWJD [SEP] content: This book contradicts `FACTS' from previous books and distorts real facts to get his personal message across. It is filled with misinformation that is based on bias opinion instilling fear while teaching hate, animosity, and segregation towards all religions other than Christianity, though Wicca and the Occult is the target. The Jesus I know taught of tolerance and love, of which neither can be found in this book. The knowledge you will gain from this book is against what Jesus would do.	negative
title: NEVER WORKED [SEP] content: My machine wouldnt recognize the card. Total waste of my money. I have the new slim PSTwo machine... I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. Do yourself a favor and just buy the regular memory cards.	negative
title: It's the same old song [SEP] content: Some beautiful cinephotography is the best thing about this rather pedestrian retelling of the Easter story with a twist.It is rather cliche ridden and far too clean for a dramatic realistic retelling. A rather sparkling Eurocast of actors with a rather good unexpectedly performance from Dolph Lundgren but in the final analysis there is not too much of substance to this movie.I am sure that it will catch the moment just before Easter but it will probably be as quickly forgotten as a Cadbury Creme Egg.	negative
title: NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!!! [SEP] content: This is not a cute Teddy. He is gross, disgusting and very vulgar. Do not allow your small children to watch this movie.	negative
title: Very mixed feelings [SEP] content: On the one hand, I appreciate the amount of effort (roughly Tolkien's whole life) that was spent on creating Middle-Earth. Yet I have to say, regrettably, that I think Lord of the Rings is grossly, grossly, overrated.The dialogue is execrable. The poetry and songs are (largely) grating. The descriptions are (largely) uninspired. Most of all, the characters are as tangible as a Ringwraith without a cloak.It can't be that it seems cliched to me (it is the first - and last - fantasy novel that I have read). It can't be that I am too cynical (I thought The Hobbit was excellent). It's just that this fat lump of a book is plain poorly written. Sorry, Tolkien fanatics.	negative
title: Throw Away The Catcher In Rye [SEP] content: All I can say is wow, there's two hours of my life I will never get back. I was assigned to read this book in high school and everyone in my class hated this book. I've read most of the classics and loved them all but this was just a horribly pointless book. Holden is basically a rich emo kid stuck in 1945. All he did was roam around New York city, talking to stupid people, tried and horribly failed at picking up chicks, got drunk, smoked and then crashed at a closeted homosexual's apartment, because he was too afraid to tell Mommy and Daddy he had been expelled for the 3rd or 4th time. I seriously wanted to rip this book up and throw it in the trash, if it hadn't been a school assigned book. What was with his constant crying? I half expected him to be cutting his wrists and writing a suicide note. He should be on Gossip Girl, not making teens read about his poor rich life.	negative
title: Never worked, had to return [SEP] content: Although the Nova tech support worked with me for over two weeks, posting emails back and forth, I was never able to get the software to function as advertised. I finally had to return the software. I will give the Amazon return procedure 5 stars, however.	negative
title: LEAKS Everywhere!!!! [SEP] content: I have 3 of these cups and they all leak. The lastest one I just bought leaks all of the liquid out within seconds of it being on it's side. It would be less messy if I just gave my daughter a regular cup. Total waste of money! A real disappointment since my daughter really loves these cups.	negative
title: Wasn't what we were looking for [SEP] content: We ended up selling it. It wasn't what we were looking for - we needed something more entertainly/interactively written. It's for an older student.	negative
title: Poor quality, but works [SEP] content: I bought this as a motorcycle helmet lock, for which it works great except the lock itself is is totally cheap. I don't even care so much about the level of security, as this is just a deterrent so somebody can't easily walk off with my helmet; but locking it and unlocking it takes forever. To unlock, when you turn the key it doesn't just release or even disengage so you can pull the pin out, you have to wiggle the key to get it to disengage, and at the same time wiggle the pin while tugging. Then to lock it, it's just as difficult. You don't need the key, but the pin doesn't fit well and has to be wiggled and forced. Like I mentioned, this type of lock with this length of cable is perfect to use as a motorcycle helmet lock,but I would shop around for one with a better lock. The only thing I would add is both the lock and cable are wrapped in a rubber casing and shouldn't scratch your motorcycle, which is why I chose this model. However, for $5 you get what you pay for.	negative
title: I Love my DS (?) [SEP] content: I can not understand that nobody told the publisher that the 'Designer Shock' design crew copied the work of Brittain based 'Designers Republic' Everything, and I mean everything inside is a straight copy of more or less old work of the Designers Republic. It is a bit sorry.	negative
title: Este libro es la guía de teléfonos [SEP] content: Con todas estas estrellas dadas por lectores truchos caímos en la trampa y lo compramos. Amazon no debería suprimir sistemáticamente las críticas negativas, y ofrecer información más objetiva a sus clientes. Este libro es aburrido y pretencioso.	negative
title: Another depressing Oprah pick [SEP] content: Because I like Oprah, I keep trying her "picks," and, invariably (so far, hope springs eternal) I end up feeling I've been had by hype. The characters in this book seem disengaged from their own problems. It's as if the author threw in a "readimix" of contemporary issues to get our attention, then copped out on developing the characters' relationships with those issues. The book's too short; the author doesn't finish telling her story. (What happened to the good old days of long, luxuriant reads?) Maybe my problem is I'm not black, fat, or abused. But, surely Oprah must realize not EVERYONE in her audience IS.	negative
title: Difficulty [SEP] content: Well I have mixed feelings about this headphones. They're in all regards superb for the price unfortunately I about a month after buying my first pair they broke. The left ear went dead. I thought it was just my bad luck so I bought myself another pair and low a behold a little over a month later the same problem. I tried to contact amazon and J Lab to activate my warranty. It has been over a week and I have not gotten a response from either Amazon or J Lab. So I would say avoid this product if you can not because of the product itself but because overall they're for the consumer who likes to throw money away repeatedly.Addendum: I contacted JLAB and they sent me a new pair because I was within the warranty. My opinion of these head phones has increased substantially.	negative
title: Going, going, gone [SEP] content: I bought this for the web downloadable content, which turned out to be non-existant. After a call to customer service I learned that this book has been marked to go out of print by the publisher and the accompanying content was taken off the website. To be able to get the content that goes along with the book, customer service needs to contact the publisher to see if they even have the files in the first place. I was told to expect a phone call in 48hrs, if there is no content the book goes back.Be wary if you need the content that goes along with this book. You may not be able to get it.	negative
title: DRAT, so disappointing, DON"T BUY THIS, ZERO stars [SEP] content: NO RADICAL INDEX OR CHARACTER CHART, that sums it up and then some. If you don't know what you're looking for, you won't find in here. Too bad, I seldom can find NOTHING good to say about a book but this one would get a negative star rating if I could give one. Sorry, but this thing is useless, spend your money on something that will actually be of use like Langenscheidt's.	negative
title: Not the best basketball of all time [SEP] content: a decent game, but hardly better then 3 out of 5. for that reason it gets a 1.	negative
title: What is so funny? [SEP] content: Please look the back of the DVD cover and see if they have subtitles or CC (Closed Captions). I am deaf and want to read what they are saying.I appreicated it and thank you.	negative
title: Loving grandma [SEP] content: I found this item very cumbersome. When the rail is in the down position it is dangerous to young children playing in the room. It's a pain to put up and down and it lasted about a week before one of the hinges broke. Definitely not worth the time or the money!	negative
