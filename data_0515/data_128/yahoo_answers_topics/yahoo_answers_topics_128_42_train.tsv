Jackie is the personal trainer to the stars that has her show on Bravo called "Work Out" (if I am not mistaken) and not only would she beat the s'hit out of Rosie, but, tell her to get her fat a'ss on a treadmill and lose a good 20lbs!

question_title: Why did Itachi Uchiha kill his clan? [SEP] question_content: I'm just asking away. I know the answer but I'm just doing this 'cuz I'm bored. [SEP] best_answer: Noted even within the Bingo Book (a list of powerful ninja who have been marked for assassination because of their crimes), Uchiha Itachi is an S-Class criminal and a Konoha Nukenin. He graduated at the top of his Academy class at age 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chūnin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions and the English Anime) squad leader at the age of only 13.\n\nHe left Konoha about five years prior to the setting of Naruto, after slaying his whole clan, sparing only Uchiha Sasuke, his little brother. At 17, he was feared by even Orochimaru. He is now currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planned to use Itachi's body as a new container for his soul, but Itachi's power had grown to such a frightening extent that Orochimaru dared not carry out his plan, and decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with the younger Sasuke instead.\n\nThe reason Itachi killed his clan, and the reason he left only his brother Sasuke alive, still remains unclear. When questioned by Sasuke, he replied "To test my 'Utsuwa'." In Japanese, 'Utsuwa' (器) can mean "Vessel," or "Container," but it can also mean "Ability," or "Tool." Orochimaru uses this word to refer to the bodies he takes over with his Fushi Tensei no Jutsu ("Living Corpse Reincarnation"). In this respect, Itachi's words can mean anything from him having a past connection with Orochimaru, to him simply wanting to test his own power, or to his plans to join Akatsuki and forsake past relations. To make matters even more ambiguous, the first person pronoun Itachi used can also be used as a vulgar second person pronoun. So he could also have meant that he wanted to test Sasuke's 'Utsuwa,' although this is unlikely, given his previous remarks about his 'Utsuwa'.\n\nHe was until recently the only known person who possessed the Mangekyō Sharingan as revealed in the manga. Hatake Kakashi has somehow developed a different-looking Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga, but to what extent they share abilities is unknown. Itachi has told Sasuke that if Sasuke were to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, the people able to use it will total three. It is unknown who the second person Itachi is referring to, as this statement was made before Kakashi obtained his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n\nDespite being the murderer of his entire clan as well as his best and closest friend, a top member of Akatsuki, and a shinobi capable of putting an adult shinobi to sleep at a mere glance; Itachi is by no means a cold blooded murderer looking for any excuse to kill someone in their way. When Sarutobi Asuma and Yūhi Kurenai stood between him and the way to his goal (Uzumaki Naruto), he did not kill Kurenai when given the chance, though he did wound her enough for her to remember it; as well as trap her within her own Genjutsu.

question_title: Is X Factor in danger of killing real music? [SEP] question_content: Is the industry in general stopping real talent emerging with its obsession for boy band covers and x factor style 'pop stars'? [SEP] best_answer: There have always been performers who don't write their own songs the only difference now is we get to see the selection process (all be it done in a more showbiz way). The only effect it might be having is the same as any reality tv show in as much as some young people today want instant fame without any of the hard work and see these shows as their chance to go to the Ivy and live the lifestyle that really doesn't exsist. It very rarely works out for these people.\n\nI think there will always be room for real talent and it will always be recognised (whether you write your own stuff or just perform other people's songs). These programmes are just a flash in the pan in terms of how the music business operates. They're this generation's must see telly, that's all. Real talent will always survive.	Entertainment & Music

I consider him to have the most intriguing back story, of regretting his duty in the Republican Guard, and yet knowing it is part of him that can never leave him. Like all the other characters, he has a light and a dark side, however, acknowledging his dark side, almost blends it in with the light. In addition, he does show humanity towards the other survivors, as shown with trying to get the signal, his forgiveness of Ana-Lucia, and his speech to Charlie about the others.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Does anyone have any idea what the lyrics to “Tom Sawyer” mean? [SEP] question_content: I was watching the band Rush’s 30th anniversary concert last night on VH1 Classic. I’ve heard some of their songs as I was growing up. (“Limelight” is now one of my favorite Rush songs) They were performing their hit “Tom Sawyer”. I think the music is really good on this one too, but I started thinking about the lyrics.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the lyrics to “Tom Sawyer” mean? They are rather abstract but there has to be some meaning there. [SEP] best_answer: I think it's a song about a basic modern guy. His options are wide open, he's confident. He's got the world at his feet. He's a free thinker and his opinions can't be bought or sold. \n\nA modern day warrior\nMean, mean stride\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nMean, mean pride\n\nThough his mind is not for rent\nDon't put him down as arrogant\nHis reserve, a quiet defense\nRiding out the day's events\nThe river\n\nWhat you say about his company\nIs what you say about society\nCatch the mist, catch the myth\nCatch the mystery, catch the drift\n\nThe world is, the world is\nLove and life are deep\nMaybe as his skies are wide\n\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nHe gets high on you\nAnd the space he invades\nHe gets by on you\n\nNo his mind is not for rent\nTo any god or government\nAlways hopeful, yet discontent\nHe knows changes aren't permanent\nBut change is\n\nWhat you say about his company\nIs what you say about society\nCatch the witness, catch the wit\nCatch the spirit, catch the spit\n\nThe world is, the world is\nLove and life are deep\nMaybe as his eyes are wide\n\nExit the warrior\nToday's Tom Sawyer\nHe gets high on you\nAnd the energy you trade\nHe gets right on to the friction of the day	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Do you think that motivation is all that is needed in order to succeed in life? [SEP] question_content: If I want to be, let's say, an actor, or a writer, do you think that you just need motivation and then the rest will fall into place? Or is money and talent just as or more important? [SEP] best_answer: Motivation and determintation are required to succeed in life.  You don't have to know everything to get ahead; You just need to have the motivation to find the answers and the ability to LEARN. Some people have the drive to succeed and others just don't.\n\n5 years ago I got out of high school and was waiting tables.  I now own my car, my house, my own business, and earn a great living.  I didn't accomplish this by "knowing the right people" or being absurdly talented in one area.  I accomplished everything by the motivation that I wanted to be financially secure and successful.\n\nFaith in God didn't hurt either. ;)	Entertainment & Music

All you need is a new start. I’m off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can stow you away on my ship. I’ll take good care of you and bring you food every day." Moving closer, he slips his arm around her shoulders and adds, "I’ll keep you happy, and you’ll keep me happy." She agrees, and the sailor brings her aboard that night and hides her in a lifeboat. Every night he brings her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit and they make passionate love until dawn. Three weeks later, during a routine search, she is discovered by the ship’s captain. \n\n"What are you doing here?" the captain asks. \n\n"I have an arrangement with one of the sailors," she explains. "He’s taking me to Europe, and he’s scr$wing me."\n\n"He sure is, lady," says the captain. "This is the Staten Island ferry."

question_title: is paula abdul a drunk? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: She's had a (eating?)disorder in the past that she really struggled with. It left behind some emotional scars, as you could expect.\n\nAs to whether or not Paula drinks before/during "Americal Idol" is a question that the producers don't want to answer. After all, by now, Paula's oddball character is as much a part of the show as Simon's blunt answers. I don't think the producers would dare answer "yes" to that question, because it would de-mystify this perpetual myth that helps the Idol buzz machine.\n\nIn my experaince, I've known some people who would be that loopy and emotional without the aid of alcohol or drugs. While I wouldn't put it past the judges to be sipping on some alcohol during the show, I don't think that it's too big of a concern.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: LOST Fans!!!....? [SEP] question_content: Wasnt last night's episode great?!  R.I.P. Eko.  But there are many intriguiging things here.  Why didnt the smoke monster seem scared of Eko this time?  Last time he stared it down and it went away.  What changed?  I also think that Juliet has something up her sleeve for her and Jack to rescue Kate and Sawyer and then get the heck out of Dodge.  And in the next episode, Kate finally chooses Jack or Sawyer.  I'd have to say that Sawyer's ahead of Jack right now, but I hope that changes.  I love Sawyer's character, but I sure hope Kate chooses Jack.  What say you? [SEP] best_answer: Great episode. I don't know about Juliet though. She may be playing Jack because he already thinks that Ben is evil, but maybe she's worse. She could be playing nice now so that Jack will get Ben out of the way during surgery, but then turn on him after he does her dirty work (but no matter how much Jack despises Ben, I don't think that he would deliberately kill him/let him die).\n\nAs for Kate, I think that Sawyer is a better match for her than Jack is, but you never know. \n\nAs for the black smoke monster, I thought that it was intriguing how Locke said he saw it too, but then added wasn't it "beautiful, white light(s)" or something like that. So....maybe if you're pure and have led a righteous life you see a "bright white light" and if you were a killer/thug (even if you're trying to be righteous now) you see the "smoke monster". Remember, Eko told his brother (or the apparition of his brother) that he wasn't sorry for what he did (killing those people and the man he killed to protect his brother when they were kids) so he did not repent...just something to think about.

question_title: are taurus males and female sagittarius capatible? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A big flaw of astrology is that astrology seems to be biased against itself. It does not consider age differences, education, race, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or economic stature important. Nor family upbringing. Don't social issues like single parenting or divorce matter?\nBut basing compatibility just because of birthday, time and location of birth is a bigotry as well. Nobody has control when or where they are born.\nIf you can apply this to relationship compatibility between two unrelated people, can you be bias toward your family as well?	Entertainment & Music

question_title: help with writing a resume? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.	Business & Finance

You need to know about restraining animals, diseases, anatomy, medications - there is a lot to know.  And I believe the salaries aren't that great. If you love animals, though, it will be a very rewarding job.	Business & Finance

Write what you feel and explain everything to detail then give it to the person that you like. You should tell the truth to everyone that are important to you =)	Business & Finance

Now I am worried because I think I screwed up. Can anyone tell me without any smart responses what is the worst thing that could happen to me. They said I received the check to cover the processing fees. I just jumped on an impulse, now I am worrying that I could be charged with bank fraud.  Can I? They said once check clears to give them a call. I have been having alot of money problems and I thought that finally I could get out of them with this check. [SEP] best_answer: If you deposited a check thinking it was a real check, then you did not commit check fraud. If the bank cleared it then to me that is an indication that it is a real check. The bank is the one who should be able to tell yo if it is real. You got scammed, don't EVER PAY for a prize, or a JOB, in advance! They're always scams!  Talk to a lawyer ASAP!	Business & Finance

question_title: How do I get over my fear of flying.  Have tried alcohol, drugs, pschology and hypnotherapy but no luck yet!? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I will be honest.  After a very bad flight 30 years ago, on which I was scared out of my wits, I swore I would never fly again.   This continued until about eight years ago when my best friend died home in Ireland.  There was no other way of getting to his funeral other than flying.  I did so and I can only say that I now feel sorry for all the years I have wasted driving long distances, using Ferries when I could have been to far away places enjoying my holidays better than in fact I did.  I fly everywhere now.\nI discovered that the trick was to face my fear.  I forced myself to sit next to a window and watched everything from take off to the flying and up to the landing.  I know that what I say may seen to you to be of no use in your position but I would say take a short flight and face your fears. Good luck.	Business & Finance

question_title: Google Adsense? [SEP] question_content: Is this website worth keeping on the web?\nhttp://www.trainingtrix.com [SEP] best_answer: If you are asking this question because you are not satisfied with the performance of your website in the Adsense program, I suggest you read the article "Contextual Advertising: Why Are You Earning Only Pennies?" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/022006/adsense.htm . Some sites by their very topic and nature do well with Adsense, but some are really a poor fit.\n\nMy suggestion is to increase the number of ad units you have on your page. Your homepage only has a leaderboard, yet your page is VERY LONG. Have another unit in the middle and another at the bottom. You can also add an Ad Links to your 3 ad formats.	Business & Finance

question_title: How to be popular? [SEP] question_content: I'm not most popular at my school but I wish I was. Please, how to be popular? [SEP] best_answer: Popularity is merely nothing more than a contest. If you wish to engage in such simple, closed minded, shallow activity then change yourself. I remember high school (well, some of it) and all the most "popular" people were always striving to be someone or something they were not. Constantly concerned with their appearance, concerned with the way others viewed them. And worse yet, they were quite the epitomy of phoney. In my opinion is was sad, pathetic and disheartening. \nIf you wish to have more friends then take the advice of liveevilone666 above. Open up more, talk often, ask questions, smile A LOT. \nDo not though, change who you are. You are an individual who deserves respect and kindness just as much as anyone else. If the "popular" people don't see you such then it's their loss...not your's. \nBe yourself...love yourself exactly as you are. If and when you do that, you'll be amazed how many more people will be simply clammering for your attention.	Business & Finance

question_title: Why does college education mean little when looking for a job; everyone seems to value experience more? [SEP] question_content: I graduated from a good university in August. And although my major is in art, I did achieve high academic honors in college and in high school. I have posted my resume on many websites, I have a couple of recruiters, and I visited with  my college counslers (they were of the least help). In an attempt to stay well educated, I read Forbes, Inc., and several newspapers; I am determined to achieve success within any career. \n\nEven the people who give me the interview opportunity seem to say I do not have enough experience. I want experience, how do I get experience if no one will hire me? I've focused my attention on a wide variety of career fields, and so far I have turned up empty. What can I do to get my foot in the door? [SEP] best_answer: You might be viewing your degree in the wrong light.  How people see a degree is that someone can commite to something. \n\n Your next step is to focus on what you want to do and even volenteer your time to get just a little experience and that can make more of a difference that you might think.\n\nAt your old college you can go back and see about helping out with things in your degree field and that is viable experience as well.

question_title: why is it called quitting cold turkey? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One site states, "The state addicts are in when withdrawing from drug addition, especially heroin. Origin: In the state of drug withdrawal the addicts blood is directed to the internal organs leaving the skin white and with goose bumps and thus resembling a turkey." (http://www.idiomsite.com/coldturkey.htm)\n\nAnother site explains, "This phrase meaning "without preparation" dates to 1910. The use in relation to withdrawal from an addictive substance (originally heroin) dates to around 1922. The derivation is from the idea that cold turkey is a food that requires little preparation in the kitchen. So to quit like cold turkey is to do so suddenly and without preparation. It is also boosted by the image of the pallid flesh of a cold, dead, plucked turkey. In the state of drug withdrawal the addicts blood is directed to the internal organs leaving the skin white and with goose bumps and thus resembling a turkey." (http://www.allexperts.com/previousqv.asp?QuestionID=2633904)\n\nYet another site says, "'Cold turkey' is actually based on another colloquial phrase, "to talk turkey" (sometimes "to talk cold turkey"), meaning to face unpleasant truths squarely. It's not entirely clear how turkeys came to be associated with honesty and straightforward confrontation of difficulties, but it may simply be that turkey farmers were renowned at one time for their lack of pretense and blunt speech."

question_title: Why do really wealthy people get tax breaks, whereas 'normal' people have to pay it all? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I'll assume that by wealthy, you mean people earning above $95,000 and are therefore on the top tax rate of 47%. Therefore, everytime you give them a tax break (such as a deduction for donations), they will save $47 in tax for every $100. For the normal person who is on the 30% bracket, they will only save $30 in tax for every $100 they donate. Tax breaks for the wealthy tend to more beneficial because they are already paying a high amount of tax. Tax breaks for the normal person don't look so impressive, because they pay a lower rate.\n\nIt may be because these 'normal' tax breaks are so unimpressive that the government of the day knows that people don't care on election day about the 'sandwich and a milkshake' tax break.

question_title: Is "Work from Home" advertisements for real? [SEP] question_content: There are many advertisements which promise thousands by working from. I wonder if they are really credible. If they really are, can anyone give me a realiable directions to such work? [SEP] best_answer: Most are scams.  If there was a reliable list of the good ones, no one would ever go to a regular job again.  Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n    * What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n    * Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n    * Who will pay me?\n    * When will I get my first paycheck?\n    * What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n    * What will I get for my money?

question_title: What percentage of property value must a monthly rental payment be to make a rental investment worthwhile? 1%? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends greatly on where you are. If the property is in an area where real-estate is growing at 20% annually, then you can even pay people to stay in your place and make a nice return. However, if you expect the property to appreciate only 2% a year, then you will need to charge a lot more.\n\nWhat you need to do is figure out what your annual costs are (cost of capital, taxes, insurance, maintanence, etc) then subtract how much you think the property will appreciate in that year, and the difference will be the minimum you could charge for yearly rent to simply break even (divide by twelve for monthly). To that, add whatever amount you feel the market would bear to provide profit and cover any eventual risks or times of vacancies.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: I'm 49 with no qualifications and my only official experience is in retail and i've already been made redundent in that area and don't want to go back, what should i do? [SEP] best_answer: You should get a job, any even if its back to retail, because it would show that you are still working hard, because people don't want people who sit a home doing nothing, and while your working, in your free time look for a job that provides traing, where you don't need any experience or qualifications, because by your age and if your working already they'd think your responsible and hard working and give you a chance.

question_title: In a corporation, what's the difference between a president, a secretarty, a CEO, and an owner? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the corporation.  The CEO is typically above the President of an organization, usually works with the Board of Directors.  A secretary is typically very far down an organizationla list, and aides the white and blue collar workers in their tasks.  (some firms use the term Secretary instead of Vice President, but this is rare).  For a corporation, the owner is not a single person, but several people.  When you hear about a person having stock in a company, that person essentially 'owns' a piece of the company.  So the owners are a primary source of financing for the corporation because they supply the money (through stocks), but owners have actually very little to do with the day-to-day operations of the firm.

question_title: did you participate in boycott yesterday Walmart from donating a large amount of money to the gay community? [SEP] question_content: What i dont understand why do business have to give money to these groups at ths same time they wont pay their employees better. Its kinda like blackmail ,this is the kind of crap thats hurting this country. If you belong to a certain group you should be able to support it yourself if you believe in that much.Thats what my religion does.There are many familes that cant make ends meet they have children without medical insurance & companies give to a community that knows very little about providing for their family its all about me me me !! [SEP] best_answer: Actually the money goes into funding to generate awareness and acceptance(ie commercials and public speakers)I feel that if a buisness wants to set up a booth or donation box for any reason that is their porogative they dont tell you that you have to put money in its your choice.  I do believe tolorence in any form wether it be for gay, violence, or even religious tolerence is and should still be supported and every religion has some sort of donation system and some of that comes from other odinary people that are not apart of your congregation ie garage sales with donation boxes. so get off your high horse and just because you dont like gays does not mean you should condemn the world to your beliefs.

[SEP] question_content: I don't have socio security number yet, because I just aply to permanent resident. [SEP] best_answer: If you have a bank account-depending how long you've had it and if you have a job(employment) go to the same bank and apply for the loan.  Since this is a small amount and you can afford payments of approx 100. per month--maybe less but only the Loan Officer at your bank can tell you-that is your best bet to get the loan and  you're also establishing good solid credit by paying off a bank loan. Whatever you do-do not get the loan from anyone where you'll have a high finance charge.  Talk to your bank and even if for some reason they can't they can advise if you can get loan and what to avoid doing--if you've applied bring proof and show to bank officer, bring all paperwork that shows you're here legally.

Maybe your best career path is not A-the bank or B-the old company, but rather C-something that is similar but better.	Business & Finance

question_title: Which Job Title is better? Marketing Analysis or Marketing Specialist? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A Marketing Specialist usually does a slightly different job than a Marketing Analyst, or someone in the field of marketing analysis.  \n\nA marketing specialist position could lead to a marketing analysis position.\n\nA marketing specialist is given specific duties, or client care responsibilities, while a marketing analyst oversees, researches, surveys, and reports the results of the company's marketing effort.  The reports from marketing analysis are used to direct the company's marketing efforts in a certain direction, and improve the company's overall marketing effort.\n\nThe term marketing specialist is used because the employee specializes in a specific marketing campaigns or specific duties within a campaign.  Marketing Analysis or a marketing analyst, may have less direct client contact, but more project management, oversee, and reporting duties.  \n\nIt's hard to tell why the company wants to change your job title, it might just be a change in company policy.  The same change could be happening for more employees as well.  It's never a bad idea to talk things over with a supervisor to see what their view might be. Hopefully, you'll get a raise as well as the change in title.	Business & Finance

question_title: i want to apply for a job in australia. what will i do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: #1: Get the work visa! (chances of getting a job without first having the visa are pretty low, so....). Check the Auzzie employment link below which is their official website for forms and brochures for those wanting to apply for a job visa or to migrate. They have different work visas available - I was applying for the skilled visa. You can also qualify for more points (its a scoring system to qualify) if you apply for jobs within certain smaller regions (i.e. Adelaide). They'll list those towns on this website and you may also want to check out the specific municipal websites of those towns as well (they might sponsor if I'm right). Although, I'd go that route if you're low on the point scale. The funny part, is that if you speak english fluently, you already receive a whack of points.\n\n#2: I found that www.seek.com.au was the best job site for Australia (You can have it so certain keyworded jobs are automatically sent to your email)\n\nBest of luck! A little reading is in order for the forms, but that should give  a good starting point. Long live the Auzzies!	Business & Finance

question_title: Trying to get started on paintings for an exhibition. Need motivation and other help, please!? [SEP] question_content: I gave up a career selling art to develop, make and sell an odd kind of moving painting. First experiments worked nicely, sold a few on card. Now making more solid works on canvas. Went back to school to learn AutoCAD to enable me to draw more complex designs. This learning widened my skills, but also seemed to freeze me up.\n\nCan't get started. Please rescue me from the hell of self-loathing and daytime TV. [SEP] best_answer: Hello, fellow painter--\n\nIf you are trying to do a body of work, you can try doing a theme.  Sometimes a theme can be based only on something as simple as a unifying color or unifying size of canvas/paper/frame.\n\nThemes don't have to be evident to anyone else, you can use it in your own head without ever disclosing it to anyone or using it as the title of the show, but you could if you wanted to.  Think Monet's haystack or lily pond series.  Van Gogh and those sunflowers.  Cindy Sherman always using herself as her own model.  Unity will also develop in your work as you go along with what's referred to as "voice".  You don't need to try and develop that style or voice, it is intrinsic to who you are as an artist.  For a painter it might take years for you to see that style in your own work, don't strive to create an artificial style unless you are a commercial artist.\n\nI think your background selling art might be a block for you.  Selling/packaging art for a market is a lot different than creating it.  To really create, really let go, you can't be at all concerned with the bottom line of sales.  Often what you like the best is the last to sell while the one you think is crap is the first one out the door.\n\nI deal with the marketing of my work after creating the work.  so, several months in the studio, when I have a body of work that is done, then I focus on great slides, documenting the series and then finding a venue to show it.  I don't create work to sell it but it does sell...you just can't let that desire to sell your work creep into the work because then you'll make crap.\n\nAnyway, I'll keep an eye out for your posts and try and help when I can!  Good luck on your show!	Business & Finance

I was married about a year and a half ago, and have a 9 month old son, so I have to make a decent living.

[SEP] best_answer: Why not start up your own website, you work from home but could travel to those who need your skills. Start as a freelance teacher then as you become more successful you could employ more careing people like yourself. Post you service's in local shops, health centers, Local phone books etc.	Business & Finance
question_title: how can i proceed to immigrate to canada? [SEP] question_content: I AM A PHARMACIST,GRADUATED FROM CAIRO UNIVERSITY 1978,HAVING AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE IN MARKETING ESPECIALLY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETING,I SPENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS AS WORKING EXPERIENCE WITH MULTINATIONAL HEALTHCARE BLUE CHIPS ORGANISATIONS..take in consideration that i am 53 years old,married with 2 independent children .. [SEP] best_answer: The process to become licensed to practice pharmacy in Canada involves several stages. There is an organization that assesses competency for practice anywhere in Canada, the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC). Their website is http://www.pebc.ca/\nEnglishPages/General/HomePage.html. \n\nInitially a foreign-trained pharmacist would need to have their qualifications assessed. Once that assessment has been made, the next step is to write the Evaluating Exam. Once that is passed, the next step is the two-part Qualifying Exam. Part I is the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) exam and Part II is the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). \n\nA foreign-trained pharmacist may choose to start working on the PEBC requirements before making the commitment to actually move to Canada. For example, the process of having qualifications assessed can be done from overseas and a candidate could come to Canada on a Visitors Visa in order to attempt the Evaluating Exam.\n\nHaving completed the PEBC requirements allows a pharmacist to apply to any provincial licensing body (College) in Canada for a license to practice. In British Columbia, the College of Pharmacists of British Columbia (CPBC) requires completion of a language assessment, a jurisprudence exam and some internship hours. Information regarding these requirements can be found on their website www.bcpharmacists.org\n/registration\n/pdf/QC_Info_Guide_info.pdf. There may be slight variations in these requirements from province to province, but they are essentially very similar. Websites for the various provincial licensing bodies can be found at \nwww.napra.ca/docs/0/745.asp. \nComparative information from the provincial licensing bodies can also be found at \nwww.napra.org/\ndocs/0/94/109.asp.\n\nUBC has a program to help foreign-trained pharmacists learn the skills they need to practice pharmacy in Canada, the Canadian Pharmacy Practice Programme (CP3). Information can be found at \nwww.pharmacy.ubc.ca/\ncppd/programs/CP3_Program.html. \nIn order to be able to register for the program, a pharmacist must have passed the PEBC Evaluating Exam and have completed the CPBC language requirements. Working on their own to prepare for the PEBC Qualifying Exam, foreign-trained pharmacists frequently take 2 or 3 attempts to pass each part of this exam. A program such as CP3 provides the candidate with the necessary competencies for practice, and those are the competencies that PEBC is testing for.\n\nImmigration and visa information can be found at www.cic.gc.ca/english\n/immigrate/index.html. \nIf a pharmacist wished to come on a Student Visa and take the CP3 course, there is a process in place to help with obtaining the visa, but the pharmacist would first need to have passed the Evaluating Exam. If the pharmacist took the course, there is also a process to help arrange a Work Visa or Permanent Resident status once the necessary Qualifying Exams have been passed.	Business & Finance

question_title: in govt organisations the employees get sat and sun as week 's off day but private co give only one day holida [SEP] question_content: IN go vt orgn employees get sat sun as weekly off days where as in private co 's they get only one day as their off. this happens in one country and in one place. is it okay??? when govt labour rules are same for everyone. why this difference. [SEP] best_answer: The govt. employees are the fortunate lot and njoys this two days in a week off. But I do not think all govt organaisations have the two days off concept specially thise in the essential services. Having said that, there are not many jobs available in the govt. sector to offer jobs to the entire work population...so one has to take up jobs in the pvt. sector. I do not see anything wrong in 6 days working concept. Today, pvt. sector offer better pay package and work environment compared to most govt. sector. In any case, in most organisations sat. is a half day working. Instead, of complaining lets make the most out of it .	Business & Finance

question_title: I bought something online.... and....? [SEP] question_content: from the FAQ section of the site, there was a column that said \n"Shipping Choices" and another that said "When should I expect to get my package?"\nthe two do NOT make sense. look at this:\n What types of shipping do you offer?\nUPS Ground: $7.95\nUPS 3-Day: $14.95\nUPS 2-Day: $22.95\nUPS Next Day: $32.95\nUPS Canada: $18.95\nINTL UPS Worldwide: $39.95\nUSPS: $9.95 (For Alaska, APO, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico ONLY)\nPLEASE NOTE WE DO NOT SHIP TO POST OFFICE BOXES.\n\nWhen can I expect my order?\nClick here to estimate your package’s arrival. Weekday orders received before 1pm EST will ship the same day. Orders shipped outside the continental United States (International, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico or any APO/FPO addresses) ship within one business day. Orders received after 1pm EST, on weekends or Holidays are scheduled for the next business day. WAREHOUSE PICK-UP orders will be emailed within one business day to confirm order is ready for pick-up. \n\ni got this from the site, copy/paste [SEP] best_answer: There are two timeframes here that determine the total amount of handling/shipping time. Add #1 and #2 together to figure out when you'll get your package:\n\nTime #1: FredFlare - to - UPS in NY\nTime it takes from when you place your order to when they give it to UPS in NY. This is covered in the "When can I expect my order" section that you cut-and-pasted.\n\nTime #2: UPS in NY - to - UPS in Cali - to - You\nTime from when UPS in NY gets the package to when UPS in Cali delivers it to you. This is covered under the "Shipping Choices" section that you cut-and-pasted above("UPS Ground", "UPS 3-Day", etc.). This depends on what option you choose.\n\nExamples:\n\nSuppose you place your order BEFORE 1pm EST on Wednesday and that you choose UPS 3-day shipping.\n- Time #1 = 0 days(it goes same day because you got order in before 1pm EST and it's not the weekend)\n- Time #2 = 3 days(because you chose UPS 3-day shipping)\n- Total Time = 3 days\n\nSuppose you place your order AFTER 1pm EST on Wednesday and that you choose UPS 3-day shipping.\n- Time #1 = 1 day(it goes out next day because you got order in after 1pm EST)\n- Time #2 = 3 days(because you chose UPS 3-day shipping)\n- Total Time = 4 days\n\nSuppose you place your order AFTER 1pm EST on Friday and that you choose UPS 3-day shipping.\n- Time #1 = 3 days(it goes out on Monday because you got order in after 1pm EST and because they don't ship on weekends)\n- Time #2 = 3 days(because you chose UPS 3-day shipping)\n- Total Time = 6 days\n\nBottomline: just don't order it after 1pm EST on a Friday and you should get it in between 1 - 5 days depending on what option you choose.

question_title: What are some drawbacks and benefits of bilingual education in California? [SEP] question_content: The question is referring to grades K-12. [SEP] best_answer: May/June 1998\n\nBilingual Education and California's "English for the Children" Initiative: Researchers, Practitioners, and Policymakers Debate the Issues\n\nOn June 2, California voters will decide whether to eliminate bilingual education in their state. Proposition 227, also known as the "English for the Children" initiative or the Unz initiative after the name of its chief sponsor, proposes replacing current bilingual programs with a maximum of one year of "sheltered English immersion" (see "Models of Language Instruction"). In this case, parents would have to explicitly ask for their children to be placed in native-language programs.\n\nIf Proposition 227 passes, it could lead to a seismic shift in educating the nation's largest population of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. With 1.4 million LEP students in the state, California is home to nearly half of the nation's population of young English learners. In March 1998, the state board of education gave school districts local control of decisions about educating LEP students. However, if Proposition 227 passes, it would override any other provisions.\n\nIn an effort to advance the dialogue about how best to educate students who do not speak English, the Harvard Education Letter asked some key supporters and opponents of the California ballot initiative to share their perspectives:	Education & Reference

Ignorance of the task is one fundamental problem that instructors trying to introduce the concept of functions have to face.\n\nA good way to do it is take up a task (say calculating interest), let them know the parameters involved (what we call variables in math).. and how the result is derived manually.  \n\nNow, if they are made to understand that excel/spreadsheet is a tool that would enable them to accomplish that same task .... may be they would be able to get along .....

[SEP] best_answer: The only thing positive that I can say about my school experiences is that they have strengthened my resolve that no child of mine will ever attend a public school and that I will homeschool if at all possible.\n\nEverything I have learned academically has been learned either from my parents (reading, early math skills, and the ability to engage in logical argument) or from self study (everything else).  \n\nMost of what I learned at school was social and most of it was wrong. \n\nMy school experiences taught me that to be accepted by society you have to look and think like everyone else.  They taught me that I am living in a world where you have to live in a constant mood of defensiveness and that you always work with people who are about your age, from the same part of town, and that most of those people will be living at my economic level and be of the same race and nationality. Finally I learned that if you believe in God than you are wrong and will be punished for practicing your religion and that this only applies to religions stemming from the judeo/Christian tradition.  \n\nI graduated high school in 1992.  The real world has taught me that you work with people who have different ways of thinking, are of a variety of ages, are of variety of races, and come from a variety of socio-economic, and religious backgrounds.

Find the probability of choosing blue, then yellow.\npossible choices...2/24. 2/3, 1/9, 2/27.\n\nNow suppose you choose one but don't replace the first pick. Find the probability of choosing blue then red. \npossible answers...6/17, 1/9, 8/81, 1/12\n\nNow find the probability of choosing yellow then blue. \npossible answers...1/7, 1/12, 2/27, 5/17. [SEP] best_answer: A) This one is slightly tricky.  The probability of gettng a blue ball is 3/7.  The probability of getting a ball with "4" on it is 2/7.  I want a blue ball or one with a "4", so it seems like 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/7 is correct.  However, this counts the blue #4 ball twice.  So I need 3/7 (probability of blue) + 2/7 (probability of "4") - 1/7 (probability of a blue "4") = 4/7.\n\nB) Probability of blue on the first draw is 2/9.  Probability of yellow on second draw is 3/9.  You want blue AND yellow, so 2/9 x 3/9 = 2/27.\n\nC) You are not replacing.  So probability of getting blue on first draw is 2/9, but red on second draw is 4/8 (there are only eight pencils left--one has been removed).  You want blue AND red, so 2/9 x 4/8 = 1/9.\n\nD) You didn't say whether to use replacement or not.  Yellow on first draw is 3/9, and blue on second draw (without replacement) is 2/8, so 3/9 x 2/8 = 1/12.  However, if you are going to use replacement, yellow on first draw is 3/9 and blue on second draw is 2/9, so 3/9 x 2/9 = 2/27 (which is also a possibility).  Since this comes right after the problem stating that you do not use replacement, I would go with 1/12 on this one.	Education & Reference

People in federal and state penal institutions aren’t eligible for Pell grants, but students in local penal institutions are eligible.) \n\nIf you're not incarcerated, your eligibility for both loans and grants depends on the nature of your offense. The law imposes restrictions on drug offenses: If you were convicted of possession or sale of illegal drugs at the same time that you were receiving federal student aid, you won't be eligible for federal aid until AT LEAST one year since your conviction, as follows:\n\nIf you were convicted for possession, and it was your first offense, you are eligible to federal aid one year from the date of your conviction. If you were convicted for selling (and it was your first offense), you must wait 2 years from your conviction date.... If you have more than one offense for selling or more than 2 offenses for possession, you can only regain eligibililty for federal student aid funds after you complete a certain type of rehab program. If you're not incarcerated and the above doesn't apply to you, you should be OK to receive aid.\n\nFederal aid aside, it is possible that there are scholarships out there for people looking to start anew -- perhaps some specific your circumstances. Try searching www.fastweb.com for organizations that help people looking to give people a second chance. I'm sure there are some out there.	Education & Reference

[SEP] best_answer: Medical school in the US is four years beyond college. The last two years have you getting practical clinical experience, cycling among different specialties such as surgery, ob/gyn, pediatrics, psychiatry, emergency medicine, etc. \n\nAfter medical school, pretty much all doctors go through some combination of internship/residency for about five years, depending on the program. During this time, you are working very hard, sometimes for 24 or 36-hour shifts while you are on call, and you are paid about US$30,000 year. \n\nAfter that, you're a regular old doctor, whose specialty might be General Practice, or you might choose another specialty.

question_title: what is cost production? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the belief that the value of an object is decided by the resources that went into making it. The cost can be composed of any of the factors of production including labour, capital, land, or technology.\n\nTwo of the most common cost-of-production theories are the medieval just price theory and the classical labor theory of value. The labor theory of value, which interprets labor-value as the determinant of prices, was first developed by Adam Smith and later expanded by David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Most classical economists (as well as nearly all Marxists) subscribe to it. However, Marx's theory is not a true cost-of-production theory since the value of a commodity contains a component of surplus value unrelated to the physical cost of producing it. The magnitude of this surplus value may be unrelated to production-costs. A somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the "neo-Ricardian school" of Piero Sraffa and his followers.\n\nThe most common counterpoint to this is the marginal theory of value which asserts that economic value is set by the consumer's marginal utility. This is the view most commonly held by the majority of contemporary mainstream economists.	Education & Reference

question_title: Describe the chief features of the Shore Temples at Mahabalipuram? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Mahabalipuram is a temple town situated along the shores of the Bay of Bengal in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The sheer sculptural extravaganza of the rock-cut temples is not only reflective of the artistic tastes of the erstwhile Pallava rulers: the temples are also regarded as the birthplace of an entirely new style of architecture, which came to be known as the South Indian temple architecture. \nMahabalipuram art can be divided into four categories : open air bas - relief, structured temples, man-made caves and rathas ('chariots' carved from single boulders, to resemble temples or chariots used in temple processions). The famous Arjuna's Penance and the Krishna Mandapa, adorn massive rocks near the centre of the village. The beautiful Shore Temple towers over the waves, behind a protective breakwater. Sixteen man-made caves in different stages of completion are also seen, scattered through the area.\n\nMahabalipuram is about 60 Kms. south of the city of Madras, in Tamil Nadu. Mahabalipuram, or Mamallapuram, was the chief seaport of the Pallavas who ruled over much of South India from as early as the first century B.C to the eighth century A.D., and it is now recognized as the site of some of the greatest architectural and sculptural achievements in India. \n\nTemples of Mahabalipuram\n\nCave Temples were excavated by scooping out the scarp of the hill. The scooping work starts from front to back. The cave temple is usually divided into inner & outer mandapas, distinguished by the difference in levels. The front mandapa will have pillars & plasters numbering 4,6,8,10. The inner mandapa contains single, triple or five cells. The cave temple with little modification is categorized as Mamalla style. The pillars under this style are slender & taller with squatting lion at their base. The pillar is divided into distinct parts known as kalasa, tadi, kumba, padma etc. \n\nMonolithic Temples are locally known as Rathas. They were executed by chiseling out the exterior face of the boulder. Work started from top to bottom. The pyramidal vimana with sikhara at the top is an important feature of this style. It can be rightly said that these monolithic temples must have paved the way for the structural temples with elaborate architectural & sculptural details in the subsequent stage. There a total number of 8 monolithic temples found in Mamallapuram. The five rathas in one place, Ganesha Ratha, Valayankuttai Ratha & Pidari Rathas.\n\nFive Rathas\nA small hill sloping from south to north has been segmented into five divisions & converted into monolithic temples. The heights of the segments have been cleverly used for temples with single tier to three-tiered vimana. Each monolithic temples shows different kind of sikhara. The five rathas are Dharmaraja Ratha, Bhima Ratha, Arjuna Ratha, Draupadi Ratha and Nakul Sahadev Ratha. \n\nShore Temple\n\nThe Shore Temple on the Bay of Bengal was constructed in the 7th century during the rule of King Narsimha-Varman II Rajasimha (c. 690-728).The Shore temples is a temple complex consisting of two Siva temples and a carving of Anantasayana Vishnu. \nThe temple facing east is entered by a small gopura. On plan, it consists of a small sanctum & a front mandapa & is a two-tired vimana. The sanctum is housing a linga. The Somaskanda panel consisting of Siva & Parvati with baby Skanda is on the back wall of the sanctum. The dhara linga & Somaskanda panel on the back wall of the sanctum are the features of the Pallava temples only. \nThe temple facing west is also dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is large in plan comprising sanctum, mahamandapa, front mandapa, balipitha and dvajastamba. The temple’s vimana is four tiered with octagonal sikhara. It is important to note that stupis of both these temples are not covered by kalasa (copper finials).\nThe carving on Lord Vishnu on a boulder in Anantasayana form is lying in between these two temples. It belongs \nto the period of Narasimhava	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: I'm still trying to figure out which of 2 universities I want to attend. I've accepted both until I figure it out. Are there any bad consequences for me when I inform one of them? [SEP] best_answer: Um, depends on what paperwork you've signed so far. For some universities, an acceptance (that is, mailing back in the form that says "yes, I'm coming") constitutes a binding contract and you'll be required to pay a deposit to the school or they can take legal action. For others, this is not true. So read over the form you signed carefully to make sure you're not committing to anything financially before you try this strategy. \n\nA better way might be just calling the department of admissions at both universities. Often if you talk to someone face to face, they can give you an extension on the deadlines for acceptances if you've got a good reason to need it.	Education & Reference

Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. [SEP] best_answer: At some point, every man will come to understand that  it's futile to try to copy other peoples' work or envy them.  He must accept himself as he really is, and understand that nothing good will ever come to him in life unless he works for it.\nTrust yourself completely, the purpose of your life and in your fate that God has arranged for you, your role in society and in the company of your friends, and believe it was all put there for a reason.

question_title: what is the meaning of constitutional law? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Constitutional law is the study of foundational laws that govern the scope of powers and authority of various bodies in relation to the creation and execution of other laws by a government. A constitution binds a government or governments, limiting the contexts in which rules may be created, interpreted and force may be applied. Constitutions may reference various bodies, including organizations, associations, stateless peoples and nation-states.\n\nMost commonly constitutional law is the law of these foundational laws, customs, and constitution a conventions in regard to nation-states. Not all nation-states have constitutions, though all such states have a jus commune, or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules, that may be customary law, oral law and written law that apply in the various jurisdictions of such state. Of those nation-states that do have constitutions, not all are considered strictly written constitutions, as the laws that govern such issues may not be consolidated into one single constitution document or instrument. The constitutional law may be the fact of interpreting a variety of text which may also be informed by history, custom and unwritten constitutional conventions . Compare, for example, the written Constitution of the United States with British constitutional law, which arises from multiple sources including Magna Carta, the common law, and other customary sources. In some countries, the constitution is known as the Basic Law.\n\nConstitutional laws may often be considered second order rulemaking or rules about making rules of exercise power. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. Thus, for example, in the case of a unitary state, the Constitution will vest ulitimate authority in one central administration and legislature, and judiciary, though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities. Whereas when a constitution establishes a federal state, it will identify the several levels of government coexisting with exclusive or shared areas of jurisdiction over lawmaking, application and enforcement.

question_title: im a sophmore in highschool doing report on joseph mendele,I need help what did he do to children in ww 2????? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: He was responsible for the more horrible experiments on Jewish children, (he certainly used adults to).  Twins were used a lot.  Children were operated on and put back together wrong for the amusement of the sick rich also. His experiments have led to the psyhcotronic generator that can read minds or the telepathic radio used in submarines since the 60's.  Our government saved a lot of the scientists and brought them here after giving them a new identity to continue there work.     Our government, the Deutschland government, Britain, France even Japan to some extent was and is controlled by the same people who manipulated and caused world war one which set the stage for world war two and gave them millions and millions of people to experiment on.  Our government brought back  the top Deutsch scientists from the Third Reich.  They changed their faces and gave them a new identity and had them continue their experiments but hopefully not on people, it was mainly nuclear fision, but the mind breaking experiments of Mendele were continued, hopefully with volunteers. It was called operation paper clip. Those same experiments continued in the korean war where our govt. tortured our soldiers to further break into peoples minds. (I know a cia agent who was there, he's an american hero)   In the early or mid sixties the Japanese provided a breakthrough with the microfrogs which proved the persons mind being broken into sound from the source.  A persons own thoughts are reflected back loud, and other subliminals are reflected to the person too.  We can hear up to I would estimate 67 subliminals.  In China they can hear over three  hundred,  making those people more locked in,  because they have a richer language that is more melodic.             If and when we are bombed, and I beleive a bomb is due to drop on L.A. what mendele did to the Jews will cause everyone in America to hear in their heads, whether they are aware of it or not. end of the world as we know it,  we need a world government to prevent this from ever happening again, etc etc.   And if this happens we will live under a complete dictatorship, in a prison until the world dies.  You asked only about what he did to the Jews, I thought the continuing effect of some of his experiments more important than the gruesome details.	Education & Reference

question_title: what does "Dont cut off your nose to spite your face" mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Don't make a stupid decision that could cost you just because you aren't happy with terms\n\nThis is what the professionals say....\n\n"Don't cut off your nose to spite your face" is a warning not to act out of pique or pursue revenge in such a way as to damage yourself more than the object of your anger.  It's not a good idea, for example, to express your (entirely understandable) distaste for the sorry state of broadcast journalism today by tossing your TV set out the window.  Peter Jennings couldn't care less, and you'll miss The Simpsons until you buy another set.  \n\nThe precise origin of "Don't cut off your nose to spite your face" is slightly fuzzy, but it seems to have first appeared around 1200 as a Latin proverb cited by Peter of Blois, a French poet of the day.  The phrase then crops up a bit later in a history of France, written in the mid-17th century, attributed to a courtier who supposedly employed it to deter King Henry IV from destroying Paris to punish the occupants' low opinion of his rule.  The proverb apparently didn't really become popular in English until the 19th century.\n\nSince the advice contained in ""Don't cut off your nose to spite your face" is good, it's not surprising that similar proverbs have been popular in other languages and cultures, including the Chinese ""Do not burn down your own house even to annoy your wife's mother."

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bloor Street is a major east-west commercial thoroughfare in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nHistory\nThe street is named after Joseph Bloor (or Bloore), a developer of this area in the 19th Century and founded the Village of Yorkville in 1830. He is buried at Necropolis Cemetery on Bayview Avenue and Rosedale Valley Road.\n\nBloor Street in Toronto runs from the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto's east-end into the west-end and into Mississauga where it ends at Central Parkway.

You could also use a mirror and a laser to find the position on a the bumper to shoot the cue ball for a bank shot.  If you move the mirror along the bank with a laser behind the cue ball pointing at the mirror, the only time it will shine on the ball intended to be struck will be at the position you would like to aim the cue ball in.  \n\nI just made all this up, so I don't know if it would work.

[SEP] best_answer: Wow.  You have everything?  Except the .05 for your grades.  Guess what, I got into college with lower than a 2.0 before.  You just need to talk to the teacher and say something like: I really want to go, but will I be able to even though I am .05 below the 8.0 grade scale?  I could boost this up if given the opportunity, but to prevent me from going because of a minor thing such as .05 which is not much compared to 1.0  which is not as close as 7.95 as it is exactly 8.0, so if you are as confused as me, would you consider a solution to this problem because I am so close to having an 8.0.  Do I have to go to summer school to improve that by .05 points in order to go?  Is there something I can do to ensure I can go?  Will I be allowed to go even if I do not meet 8.0?  And out of how many others have perfect scores and are allowed to go?  "Just because something or somebody tells you that you cannot, or you will not do this or that, then you must step up and say how come?  Why?  Then after they answer, do you easily give up?  No, you fight back with your words because you really want to go to L.A.

So, be brave, be courageous and when you are ready to speak, let your heart do the talking for you.  Believe it or not, I have always gotten farther with a positive attitude.  But this nation is so accustomed to complainers and whiners that they easily quit on what they really want to do.  No wonder we have psychology!  So, you really do know what to say now, don't you?  Remember the last time you got what you wanted without asking for it first?  Who hands out anything on a silver platter here?  I work hard and earn everything just like you.  So, having a physical disability didn't keep me from acheiving my goals or accomplishing my dreams.  But others who wouldn't allow me to do these did, and they got the wake up call when I spoke from my heart's content, that they were so touched they just had to give me what I wanted because God did the talking for me.  I am just a vessel He uses to get what He wants for me, believe this and you will not need to know what to say when He speaks through your mouth and out comes the words, and it makes you happy because you gained more bravery.  Or you can accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior since He died for your sins, man.  That we are brothers no matter what anyone else may say or do, and it is because God answered your question through me.  No one in their right mind can reject Him.  Hence the words: Right mind.  That means: Free from stress and disappointment in yourself, as well as others.  And I am not a preacher, yet I preach the message as it is universal understanding of getting from one point to another.  You have the help you require when you help yourself first.  Help yourself by speaking and verbalizing your concerns to the teacher, to the administration, to even the president of the United States, but who is going to listen unless you do something out of the ordinary.  Remember, you are like a stranger in a country of your own.  You speak the language differently now.  You should love yourself, so you may do what you really like, then you can use this to help others love themselves so the entire world will love one another, even their enemies and strangers they do not know.  This is the message and it has never changed.  Do you believe it?  Do you want it?  You have to want it more than going to L.A. in order to get to L.A. for those who trust in Jesus get what they need, and even what they want.  And those who do not, I tell you, are suffering needlessly.	Education & Reference

question_title: When is the fafsa due? Is it a universal date or does it depend on each university or college? [SEP] question_content: I just really need to know if there is a date that the goverenment uses to cut off applications. [SEP] best_answer: No, you can continue to file a FAFSA until the semester/year you are applying for is finished, but your school will require it by a specific date. Remember, too, that it takes a couple of days for the school to receive and process your application, and they may request verification of dependency or income. That is random- one out of every 30 at my school, Texas Tech. So, this could slow the process. \n\nApril 1st was the recommended FAFSA due date for the Fall semester at Tech. Your school may have an earlier or later date, but it's important to get it in as early as possible because each school has an amount they give out in grants, and you don't want to find out too late that you're not getting what you need.

This has changed all the zoning lines in our district. Now, I am slated to go to a high school across town (not the new one) where my friends from middle school go. Right now, I go to a school 2 minutes from my house, and I have made many new friends, even though I had to make all new friends freshman year because all my middle school friends went to the other one. I have until Dec. 15h to decide. Here are the Pros & Cons:\n\nCurrent School:\nPros: I like swim coach & swim team better.\nI know the teachers here already.\nI have made new best friends here.\nCons: very hard race for valedictorian\nmiss my middle school friends\n\nOther School:\nPros:easier valedictorian race\nmiddle school friends\n"faster" swim team\nCons: already spirited to current school\ncockier swim team\nmy best friend at current school (is a guy)\n\nPlease help me! I'm sorry this is so long. [SEP] best_answer: If the race for Valedictorian is all you care about, go to the new school. If it's your life you care about, stay. But if you go to the new school and dedicate your life to this race, you'd better make darn sure you win.	Education & Reference
question_title: what are medium format camera's. where do you used them..how do they differ from the range finders? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A medium format camera takes 120mm film so the negative is larger than a normal 35mm.  The larger negative gives a clearer print and so was and still is used largely for commercial work.  Lots of wedding photographers use this format; think Hasselblad.\n\nRangefinder and Single Lens Reflex (slr) is a different matter.  The difference here is how you see, what you see when you look through the viewfinder to compose your picture.  The view finder for a rangefinder is just a clear piece of glass giving you and approximate view of what you camera's lens is seeing.  On an slr the image in the viewfinder is the same as the len's view because the light is going through the lens and then being bounced off a mirror so you can see it through the viewfinder.\n\nClear as mud?

question_title: How can I pay my bills while in school without lots of loans? [SEP] question_content: I have lots of bills, and initially bring home about $2000 per month.

[SEP] best_answer: Get a crappy job on the weekends, play the lotto once in a while, hit your parents up (try to make them feel guilty).

question_title: What are some effective study methods for exams with tons of information? [SEP] question_content: not memorizing materials but knowing it [SEP] best_answer: Start early.\n\nYou should always read everything at least once before class and once after class. You will retain more information througout the entire semester that way. Then, about 2.5 weeks before the exam, start skimming over the chapters again. Focus on what was covered more in class, also. \n\nIf you book has review questions at the end of each chapter, do each review question. I also have a tendency to outline every chapter. It's always better if you are able to apply what you learned instead of only spitting out some memorized stuff (likyou said, you don't want to memorize). So, it might even help if you browse the internet for more information/exercises related to the topic you are covering.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is there going to be any possible cure for cancer some time soon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There always seems to be a new breakthrough.  Little by little traditional cancer research is gaining ground.  As far as soon?  That would take a major breakthrough.  But look at the rise in technology over  the past 100 years, and then the past decade.  We have not only more educated and then knowledgeable brains working on it, but think about the knowledge that isn't being lost now when someone  in the research field dies.  You don't have to go searching for a book for answers, it's right there on a computer.  Quick access has made knowledge so readily available that the rise in medical technology should continue to spike off the charts.   So, at the rate it's going the past predictions of stating a cure may be found in 50 years could be reduced to "some time soon"er than anyone thought.	Health

I don't know who to believe, because my family says I'm thin and I don't need to lose any weight, but when I look in the mirror I always see a fat girl. Oh, and what parents would say to their children that they are fat and ugly, anyway? [SEP] best_answer: You are right, what parent would tell their child they were fat!?\n\nDo one thing, next time you are at the doctor's office have the nurse weigh you and then ask the doctor how you compare to other healthy girls your age.  Then you will know if you are just being crazy or if you should watch what you eat.\n\nIf you should watch what you eat, then try this first:\n\nStop drinking sodas!(or pick the worst thing you do regularly, like eat french fries, or drink whole milk and stop that one thing).\n\nThen do this next:\n\nReplace your worst habit with a good habit.  Drink diet sodas (I know sometimes they taste bad, but it is better than nothing, even if it isn't quite as good as drinking a lot of H20).\n\nEasy right!  Just stop one thing and replace it with one thing.  Do it until you feel you love what you do.  It will help you to feel a bit skinnier, and successful.  You are being healthy!  Awesome.  Now, you can try another thing...like....you be creative.....always improving is what it is all about.\n\nOne last thing; if a new food or habit should come along (ie smoking) save yourself the trouble of having to quit it in the future.....don't start bad habits.

question_title: Can ear candling damage the inner ear? [SEP] question_content: I have been wanting to try ear candling for quite some time as I believe it will improve my hearing, but I can't really find any information about possible damage it could cause from something such as over-drying sensitive membranes or anything of that sort. Any advice is appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: Candling poses several dangers, the most serious of which involve burning caused by the hot wax. Candle manufacturers claim that their candles will drip only down the outside of the ear, but shamefully few direct the user to hold the candle horizontally to prevent this. A 1996 survey of 144 ear, nose, and throat physicians, found that 14 had seen patients who had been harmed by ear candling, including at least 13 cases of external burns, 7 cases of ear canal obstruction with candle wax, and 1 perforated eardrum [3].\n\nAnother case was reported by The London Free Press, a Canadian newspaper. A woman who experienced stuffiness in the nose and ear pains while scuba diving went to a local health-food store and was referred to a "qualified" candler. During the "treatment," she felt an intense burning in her ear. At the emergency room, attempts to remove wax that had dripped from the candle onto her eardrum failed. Surgery was required, and a hole in her eardrum was discovered, which presumably was caused by the procedure. She recovered fully, and luckily her hearing was not affected. The practitioner apologized, compensated the woman, and stopped performing ear coning [4].\n\nAlaska Fire Marshall Gary L. Powell has reported two instances of significant fires associated with ear candling., one of which led to the user's death. On January 27, 2005 a 59-year-old woman ignited her bedding when she dropped an ear candle that she was attempting to use the ear without any assistance. The candle ignited the bedding and quickly spread to curtains and other combustibles in the room. The woman did escaped but suffered an asthma attack and died in a hospital emergency room [5].	Health

question_title: how to gain weight with having fast metabolism? [SEP] question_content: if I eat more i vist the restroom more often or few times a day if i don't then i go every couple days. so what should i do? [SEP] best_answer: The key here is slow down your metabolism....and the way to do that is to eat less meals during the day but eat bigger meals when you do eat. This way your body has too much food to digest and your body stores the fat longer. Obviously the more unhealthy the meal the better for weight gain...however you don't mention the reason for you wanting to gain weight.\n\nIf it is a medical condition such as your thyroid then nothing will help to rectify your weight but medical help.\n\nAlso there are plenty of products on the market at the moment such as shakes to drink etc which help to build muscle....maybe try one of them, or even drinking beer adds on the pounds!!

I see the other amazing things about her, and I don't feel that her acne marrs her beauty (how could something so small completely negate the entirety of her image?).  Find a man who could marry you for all the other wonderful things about you without being distracted by your acne.\n\nTo address the acne issue: wash your face with a nice face wash in the morning and at night.  You can try acne treatments, which will be available at your local drug store.  If none of that works, you can see a dermatologist who can prescribe other things for you.  My younger brother had a prescription that seemed to work miracles for him.	Health

But, I'm right-handed people and want to switch to left -handed people? Is it okay? And what's your suggest to make it easier... [SEP] best_answer: Your teacher was probably referring to ambidextrous people (im able to write, do anything actually with both hands, legs etc.) true ambidextrous people, not people that teach themselves how to do it think differently to just right handed or left handed people. Apparently i can switch my thinking to either side of my brain, over all i tend to have a "center" of thinking.  i can also read backwards and write backwards or with both hands at the same time without even thinking about it. I discovered this when i was a teenager, all my friends thought it was awesome and tried to do it! i thought it was so funny because they were all trying so hard when i didnt even have to think when i did it! \nI'm not sure if im smarter then other people, maybe i am lol! i did always get great marks in school so yer, but there are disadvantages-always have had trouble working out left from right, learning languages, trouble with figures/maths in general. All of those disadvantages are proven.\n\nYou cannot make yourself be left handed or ambidextrous and get the positives with it-like being intelligent (so they say).\nSo dont try to be, you cannot change how your brain works. \nHope this helped.

question_title: Is it really true that drinking tea everyday loosen weight? [SEP] question_content: i was just wondering if it is really true. coz i want to poo everyday to loose weight. Can you give me some advice? [SEP] best_answer: It has antioxidents that will make you less likely to get cancer and wil increase your immune system. They're a natural laxative, and compared to coke, they're a good diet replacement, but not any different from water in a weight sense.\n\nThe fastest way to lose weight is to elevate your heart rate as many times and and as high as you can safely elevate it. Eat small portions of meals many times a day instead of really big portions only a few times a day. Jump rope rules. Anything running or sprinting will burn a super amount of calories, incomparable to weight lost just dieting.\n\nhttp://www.jimmyr.com/lose_weight.php	Health

question_title: Where can you get a fake Rolex watch that looks very real?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The biggest "give-away" of a fake Rolex is the "second" hand.\nA real Rolex watch has a sweeping second hand.  This technology can't be produced cheaply, so if you go to NYC and by one from Chinatown, it'll have a "ticking" second hand.  However, I've seen a fake Rolex with a sweeping second hand at the price of about $700 - $1000.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: Some guys just naturally have a disappearing penis when they go limp. And when you are chilled it might try to curl up inside to keep warm. And for guys who are a bit overweight and have some fat covering their pubic bone, there is a tendency to have their limp penis hide in the layers of fat. If the latter is yoru problem, please consult a doctor and work toward losing weight and getting fit since being obese is a health hazard far worse than your worry about your penis disappearing.  If however,m you are fit and it still seems to go into hiding as it goes limp, well, that is just the way you are.	Health

question_title: Hepatitis B Question? [SEP] question_content: I have been looking and looking for the answers to these two questions: when and where was hepatitis b discovered. if you can b the first (or only) to tell me and give me your source i will choose you as best answer. i am presenting this for bio tomorro and i really could use the help. Thankx. [SEP] best_answer: Hepatitis B: A Brief History:\n\nIn 1965, Dr. Blumberg who was studying haemophilia, found an antibody in two patients which reacted against an antigen from an Australian Aborigine. Later the antigen was found in patients with serum type hepatitis and was initially designated "Australian Antigen". Subsequent study has shown the Australia Antigen to be the hepatitis B surface antigen. Dr. Blumberg was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Initially there appeared to be three particles associated with hepatitis B infection: a large "complete" particle called the "Dane particle", a small circular 20nm particle and an oblong 40nm particle. Further research identified the Dane particle as the hepatitis B viron and the other two particles as excess surface protein. This former terminology is no longer used and the virus is referred to according to its structure.	Health

[SEP] question_content: i had my period about a week ago but today i have started bleeding again with mild cramps. im on the pill and have been for three years. i missed a pill and had unprotected sex with my husband. iv never had bleeding mid cycle before even when i first stared the pill i never got it. so whats happening. i have made an opointment for the doc on monday but it doesnt stop me worrying now.\nany advise?\nam i pregnant? or ill?\nplease help. [SEP] best_answer: More than likely you are spotting/ break through bleeding because you missed a pill or took one late. Did you make up the missed pill? You should always take all of the pills in your pill pack regardless of any bleeding. As soon as you realize that you missed a pill take it and stay on schedule with the rest of your pill pack. Not doing so will reduce the effectiveness of your pills. Also, these may not be the best pills for you, tell your doctor what symptoms you are having and they can determine a better pill for you. If you have stopped taking your pills or didn't make up the missed pills you would be wise to use condoms until you see your doctor and are told otherwise.	Health
question_title: Should I be worried about a swollen gum? [SEP] question_content: The gum in between one of my teeth has been swollen and red for about a week now.

I have used salt water and listerine every day now and it is not helping.  I don't have insurance and can't afford to go see a dentist if it is something normal. [SEP] best_answer: SWOLLEN GUMS IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE OR NORMAL.  let the nurse stick with nursing.  maybe salt water has miracle properties at the hospital but in your mouth it does nothing.  go to the dentist immediately.  if you wait you might end up in the ER with a serious infection and then the dentist after that anyway.  talk about expensive.  don't wait til it's something serious and you lose a tooth.

question_title: Weight loss with an injury? [SEP] question_content: I have a very bad ankle that needs surgery.  I also need to loose about 30lbs.  What kind of exercises can I do to loose weight AND not add more pain or injury to that ankle?  Walking and running are out of the picture entirely.\n\nserious replys only please [SEP] best_answer: SWIM SWIM SWIM. The best excercise in the world. Swimming is totally weightless and it works a series of ways. It is Aerobic and resistance training in one. Aerobic works to get your heart rate going and thus will increase metabolism and help circulation which all burn fat. Also if you are swimming and not doing a stationary type of water work out then your breathing becomes regulated by the type of stroke you are swimming. Resistance training is from the water friction. Every step and stroke you make is like having a few pounds on your hand. Resistance and light weight training is important when losing weight because you have to tighten the skin as well. Good luck, it will change your life when you lose the weight, but make sure you do it right.	Health
question_title: How can I get my abs.? [SEP] question_content: How can I get my abs 100% strong? what should I eat and dont, work outs, and for how long or how many, advice and explain why?\n\nI drink alot of coke and eat alot of fast food. [SEP] best_answer: well you seem to know that drinking soda and eating fast food is not good for getting a six pack.  Running 3-5 times a week is the best way to burn stomach fat.  Doing situps and crunches just strengthens the muscles.  In order to start seeing a hard stomach you need to burn away the fat around it.  I suggest eating high protein low fat meals and if you still eat fast food try eating a salad instead of a burger or even a grilled chicken without mayo. It's all about choices and your dedication to your health. Good luck!	Health

I usually don't like to recommend a specific product, but Dannon has a yogurt out called Activia that could be beneficial.  I have had IBS and attendent problems for quite a few years and the very best advice I can offer is educate yourself!  Don't ignore it and don't let it go.  If possible go to an Enterologist and enlist their aid.  Find one who will listen to you and will work with you to discover the needed treatment\n     Look to your ancestors also, for this is can be an inherited tendency.

question_title: um... am I fat? [SEP] question_content: I'm sixteen, five feet tall, and I weigh around 114 pounds.  Lately I've been eating lots of fruits and whole grains and stuff, and I've lost weight.  Is that a sign that I was overweight to begin with? [SEP] best_answer: You are not by any means fat and do not let others lead you to thinking that you are!  Embrace yourself and be proud of who you are. \n\nA general rule is 100lbs at 5'0" and an additional 5lbs for additional inch, but this does not keep in mind body frame or the weight of muscle.  Muscle naturally weighs heavier than fat, so you may be perfectly healthy, but your doctor or physical trainer would be the only person to tell you for sure.	Health

Even if someone says they are a nurse or doctor, you have no idea if they really are or not.  On the internet, you can be anything you want to be.  There are resources out there.  Go to your doctor, or at least call your doctor.  Many offices have nurse practitioners who can return you calls and answer questions.  Call the nurse at your city/county Public Health office.  At least you will know that you can trust their expertise.

HE HAD OPENED THE NEW NEEDLE AND UNWINDED THE PLASTIC TUBE WITH THOSE BLOOD STAINED GLOVES. ALSO THE TIP OF THE NEEDLE HAD TOUCHED THE PLASTIC TUBE BEFORE HE INSERTED THE SAME INTO MY VEIN..I AM VERY MUCH CONCERNED AND SCARED THAT IF THOSE BLOOD STAINS ON HIS GLOVES CARRIED HIV GERMS THEN CAN I ACQUIRE HIV GERMS THRU THIS MODE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW THAT WHAT SHOULD I DO? IS THERE A NEED TO GET MYSELF TESTED. WHICH TEST DO I HAVE TO GO FOR? I SINCERELY NEED HELP AND AM SCARED TO DEATH. [SEP] best_answer: Based on my knowledge on this issue, if blood is exposed out in the open (air), the virus inside can only survive for a few seconds. Therefore it won't be harmful.\n\nReading from your statement you mentioned it was a fresh stain. I will imply it as dry.\n\nIf you are still worried you can always go for a HIV testing. There's only one test to see whether you're HIV positive or not. Most government hospitals give free testing and the result is strictly private and confidential.\n\nDo inform the doctor of how this matter came to be. There is a 'window period' which means that you might/might not carry the HIV virus. This 'window period' means you have to go for regular testing because they can't detect the virus for a certain period of time. \n\nHope this helps.	Health

What can I do to make myself less scared? [SEP] best_answer: I know its scary honey, but trust me - if you don't tell your mum and go to the dentist, the pain in your tooth will get really bad. I'd advise that you take a personal stereo with you and listen to some music while the dentist is doing your fillings because the noise of the drill is the scariest part in my opinion. Try not to worry too much about it, I know it's scary when you've never had fillings before and you don't know what to expect, but it's really not that bad, I promise.	Health
question_title: I am a massage therapist how should I go about getting clients? [SEP] question_content: I have tried handing out cards and putting up filers. I have a degree in Michigan and I am planning on getting certifed in the USA but so far I am haveing trouble getting people to come see me what should I do? [SEP] best_answer: Someone else on Yahoo recently asked a similar question and my response would be the same...\n\nConsider speaking on massage. As a former massage therapist, I used to offer programs on "self help" massage. In other words, I would teach a combination of bodywork movements done by the client or with the help of a partner. This includes the use of hands, stretching, and commercial or homemade massage tools. Such programs focus on the science of massage; in other words, the reasons why specific movements benefit the body or a health condition. Whereas, the art lies in the personality and passion that blend each movement together into the dance that comes from a professional massage.\n\nBesides the potential for direct income from public speaking, there are other professional benefits. Public speaking provides name recognition. It sets you above the competition. Even if the presentation is free, when an organization hires you to speak, it conveys a sense of endorsement. After all, as a speaker on massage, you must be a great massage therapist!\n\nPublic speaking puts you in front of potential massage clients. Because they come to your program for the opportunity to learn, their natural sales resistance is lowered. Compare self-help massage programs to a first aid course. You learn to treat minor ailments, but still go to the doctor for acute problems and a periodic check-up. Since nothing can replace a professional massage, the audience will automatically think of you when seeking a personal therapist.\n\nPromoting yourself as a personal consultant is a logical extension to public speaking. There were certain techniques that I did not teach in my programs because it would have been almost impossible to demonstrate in a group setting. However, I easily taught these techniques to one or two people who would pay for my time as a consultant.\n\nPublic speaking allows you to market other products and services. Let’s say you are affiliated with a spa. It should be relatively easy to weave discussion of these spa services into your massage program. But what if you are an independent practitioner? Using the spa example, find one locally who would help cover your normal speaking fees in return for mentioning their spa services and providing marketing materials during the program. This allows you to charge lower speaking fees, while getting in front of potential massage clients.\n\nThe marketing value of a presentation extends beyond the program itself. Most organizations hosting your presentation will publicize the event. Even people who do not attend might read the information or hear about you from other attendees.	Health

question_title: Dead protective liner of the intestines? [SEP] question_content: My daughter has been having great adominal pain.  She was told that the protective liner of her intestines has been twisted and is dead as well as possibily infection from it.  Is there a name for this?  What type of surgery will it entail?  What type of recovery will she have?  Is it life threating? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure what your daughter's diagnosis is, so you should try to find out, but one type of "twisted" intestines is called volvulus.\n\nHere is part of an article from emedicine about volvulus:\n\n"In 1992, Messineo et al determined that the most important factors influencing mortality are the presence of necrotic bowel, associated abnormalities, and younger age. Risk of mortality increases 25 times in the presence of bowel necrosis and is influenced heavily by length of viable bowel. They determined that the survival rate is maintained above 93% with 10%, 25%, and 50% of the bowel necrosed; however, the survival rate drops to 35% with the loss of 75% of the length of the small bowel. The presence of other serious abnormalities also increases the risk of mortality by a factor of 22. Given the high association of malrotation with other congenital anomalies, this risk factor heavily affects mortality figures. In addition, Messineo et al found that patients who died after surgery had a significantly lower median age (4 d versus 30 d)."\n\nThis is basically saying that the more of the bowel that dies, the worse off she is.\n\nIn the article, one treatment is a bowel resection, which is when they take the dead part out.  Her recovery would depend on how much they take out.  I would imagine 6-8 weeks or around that unless it's really severe; that is what the below articles say.\n\n\nTry to find out the exact diagnosis--googling that will give you better clues of what to expect.

But something in the air at night triggers my allergies so when I wake up, my nose is stuffed up. Are there any allergenic (don't know if I used that correctly) screens for the window to help me. Thanks for any help. [SEP] best_answer: Hi there\n\nAllergies are a pain in the butt, I have hayfever and for years the same thing happened to me, major sinus headaches and stuffed nose, sore throat every morning when I got up.  I used to take an antihistime before bed, sometimes it would be too drying and I'd have a nosebleed.  What I finally did was buy an air conditioner because of other health problems and it helped.  But you could try an air cleaner with a hepa filter that's supposed to filter out alot of pollens and dust/dirt that comes in the windows.  Pollens are higher at nighttime and early morning so if you can open your window and cool things off earlier in the day, then shut it and use a fan and air cleaner it might help.  You could get allergy shots too that would help desensitize you from the pollens.	Health

It is the way the body makes room for new sperm.\n\nI remember my first wet dream. I was in the back seat of a car and a girl (that I had a crush on) was in the front seat.  I innocently leaned forward to talk to her and my arm went over the seat.  She grabbed my hand and pressed it to her breast.  I woke up feeling a little woozy with my boxers full of a white slimy substance. (I know, a Forest Gump type episode).\n\nThey don't have to be explicit or dirty, just something arousing, enough for the body to do its thing.	Health
question_title: I just had appendectomy.My lower abdomen sort of became bigger than before but it doesn't hurt.Why is this so? [SEP] question_content: Before surgery I was pretty fit so it sort of worries me. I now look like I'm pregnant. Is it just a temporary thing after surgery? I had surgery 3 weeks before to remove my perforated appendix. [SEP] best_answer: If you had your appendix removed Laproscopically, it is probably the co2 they used to air your belly up to visualize and remove your appendix. The air will eventually work its way out. If you had it the "old fashioned way", where they cut you open to get it out, it could be that your muscles were stretched some during the procedure. You should be able to resume your exercise routine as soon as your Dr. releases you, and get your tummy muscles toned back up.	Health

question_title: How Easy is it to live with someone whos a Manic Depressive? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a lot of challenges to living with Manic Depression but it can work as long as there is communication and some planning.  Some of it will depend on how well the person takes their medication. Some people will take their meds only until they feel better and then stop because they feel better {they don't realize they feel good only because of the meds so then they start spiraling down hill} or they stop because they don't like the side effects of the meds.  Also the mood swings can not be rationalized some of the time which can be very frustrating, and people with this affliction tend to isolate themselves only having a few close friends. \n\n If you choose to live with someone with this disease try to keep an open mind and keep plans flexible so stress is minimal on both of you, also try to talk about how they handle bad days so you know ahead of time what you can do to help or so you don't make it worse. Good luck.	Health

question_title: When i bend knee i can feel the entire thing snap n move.?

I'm wondering is it bone chips in the knee lack of cartiliage or possibly osteroposis(sp) because i have crohns disease and Osteroposis comes with crohns. same thing happens with my right ankle oddly enough. i have no pain in it just the feeling. i havent  ran into anything or banged my knee up seriously at all. any ideas? [SEP] best_answer: Id agree with seeing a physical therapist which i am or a doctor doc would be better to see first. being your not having any pain it cant be cartiliage it could be a bone chip or  osteroposis but id believe that if your knee is snapping youd either be in pain or be heavily swollen. if you dont want to see the dr. right away id suggest doing some stretches because it may also be fluid in the knee. stretching would eliminate that problem for the most part.

question_title: can you find someone attractive without being attracted to them? [SEP] question_content: There was this man I worked with, he was in his 40's and I was/am in my 20's, who always flirted with me and acted interested.  The girls at work would tell me that he'd always gush about me, how cute and sweet I was.  However, we never dated and he never asked me on a date.  I was wondering, is it possible that he found me attractIVE but wasn't attractED to me?  I just thought it was kind of weird... [SEP] best_answer: I think that guy was just interested in flirting with you because you were younger.  He might have just wanted to see if he could get a response from you, or maybe he just wanted to get into your pants.\n\nIt is possible to think someone is attractive without being attracted to them.  I think some of my male friends are attractive, but I am not interested in anything other than friendship with them.  I also think that some of my female friends are attractive, but I am "straight" and not interested in them either.  \n\nI'd say it noticing how people look, and how they look to you.\nYou don't have to act on it.  But if you do, ie you go after everyone you think is attractive, then you have issues and people will not think very much of you.  That's my theory.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Public Marital Put-Down? [SEP] question_content: What does it mean when your spouse puts down married life in front of your friends while you're right there? \nAnd what do you do about it? [SEP] best_answer: That may be his sense of humor.  Something he thinks he is expected to do around "the guys".  There is a stigma around marriage that it should be miserable.  Your hubby may be one of those who wants to fit in so he subscribes to the stereotypes people hold of him and his life.  (I could be wrong)\n\nIn private I would tell him that what he said really bothered you.  Ask him if he really feels that way or if he was just trying to be funny.  Inform (gently not confrontationaly) that it wasn't funny and jokes as such really hurt you, especially around other people.  If he really feels that way it may be time for some marriage counseling.

question_title: How do you right a wrong? If the person does not know what you did? [SEP] question_content: If a person does not know that you did something wring but you feel guilty about it how do you make it better [SEP] best_answer: I believe honesty is the best policy, but don't be honest just to relieve your own pain. Being honest about a mistake often hurts the other person more than you think. Sometimes its best to just keep quiet and live with the guilt... and hopefully the knowledge that you made a mistake and will never repeat it. \njust_a_guy_in_florida@yahoo.com	Family & Relationships

question_title: Propose or Promise Ring? [SEP] question_content: I've been with my girl for 4 months.. we wanna get married after college.. we are going to diff colleges... so before i left i was thinking of a promise ring or proposal.. so we could be enagaged the whole time... Please tell what u think... because we are in total love head over heels for each other... and spend everyday together... colleges are only an hour apart.. and we both already promised to never cheat or anything to each other because we love each other too much... so Proposal.. or Promise Ring? [SEP] best_answer: Ok i'm not a guy so I can't give you a guy's point of view but, from my point of view, I think that's really sweet what you are trying to do. And she must be an amazing woman because it sounds like you really love her and don't want to lose her. Please don't take what I'm fixing to write to offense, but I think if yall are in college I wouldn't give her the promise ring. Reason being, yall aren't 15-16 years old anymore. Yall are in college, old enough to do what yall want live together old enough to get married. A promise ring to me is for teenagers. If yall already talked about what you want when you get of college and including getting married, go with the engagement ring. Trust me, well I'm not your girlfriend, but I'm sure she will feel and understand what I'm telling you. Now because I said don't get the promise ring for her get the engagement ring doesn't mean you have to do that. This yall's life you make the desicion I'm giving you my and many other womens point of view. I hope I was able to help.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Body Issue, is it normal? [SEP] question_content: Hey there....I am 16 years old and looking to delve into a relationship with a great girl I can't stop thinking about. I don't want this relationship to be ruined by taking things too fast, but I have an issue. My...erm...unit isn't straight when it's at a full salute. In fact, it leans about 20 degrees to the left. I noticed the scar from circumcision some time ago and can't help but wonder, is this normal? If it isn't...are there options to fix it when I turn 18? What options do I have? Thanks [SEP] best_answer: First off, Kudos to you for not being like every other a**hole guy and going straight into a girls pants!! Secondly,  Believe it or not, not very many guys have straight...uh... areas.  Though, it sounds like it could have been a result of too much skin being cut from your circumcision.  Im assuming its pretty normal considering you have probably had a physical with your doctor and the issue was never brought up before.  If your that uncomfortable about it, ask your doctor if there is anything you can do to change it.	Family & Relationships

My expectation on life is to continue to better myself as a person, spiritually, mentally/emotionally, & physically. My ability to achieve lies within.

question_title: How to beat temtation when my Boyfriend leaves? [SEP] question_content: My bf is leaving for ohio in 3 weeks for 3 months. He is telling my best friend to keep all the guys away and she is going to try. I really think I love him but there is the guy i have had a crush on is now starting to get jealous and flirt alot. He is always trying to kiss me. So how do i keep him away. [SEP] best_answer: if you really love your boyfriend that much, it shouldn't be an issue...do you want to ruin your relationship with him for this other guy who may not even want a relationship with you? He may just want something else, so you gotta really think if it's worth it. My boyfriend has been gone for 9 months and I'm still very much in love with him, and very faithful. I can't imagine losing him for some "crush"...I alwayz say if you want to cheat, you obviously don't want to be with the person you're with...cuz if you do, you wouldn't even think about cheating. Just tell that guy you have a boyfriend and you're not interested. if he keeps bothering you, don't hang around him anymore.	Family & Relationships
question_title: What was the craziest blind date you have ever had? [SEP] question_content: i've had one for the record books......i was just wondering if anyone else had strange experiences too. [SEP] best_answer: I have one for you.  I used to live in Columbus, Ohio, and I'd put an ad in a Single's Magazine.  There was one lady that replied that seemed relatively nice, so we agreed to meet at a restaurant one day.  When we met she was so nervous you could cut the tension with a knife.  I don't remember what we talked about or for how long we talked but after the date was over we never saw or heard from each other again.  She was relatively nice looking and had a pleasant personality, but no matter how hard I tried I could not get her to relax.  I  could honestly feel the tension so bad that I felt I was being pushed against a wall.  Definitely a very strange experience because I don't think I'd ever scared someone so bad in life as much as I think I scared this poor woman.  Oh well, I chaulked it up as one for experience.

Its give and take.  \nthis isnt to say we dont enjoy spending time with you ladies, cuz thats not it at all.  we just need to chill by ourselves now and again, thats all.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: you may need to knee him in the groin area as you're telling him you're not interested. technically, it's not assault. it would be considered harrassment if you had already told him you're not interested before, therefore you would be defending yourself :O)	Family & Relationships

Take in what they are talking about and the way they discuss things. This will give you plenty of clues as to what they want to talk about and how they expect people who are speaking to them to talk about those things. Once you are familiar with all of this, then learn something about any subjects they talk about that you don't know much about, so that you can carry on a decent conversation.	Family & Relationships

You gotta' stay away from those kinds of people, and even the people they sleep with... chances are, there's some type of disease floating around there.\n\nA whore can be either male or female...  Just because a guy sleeps around and his buddies thinks it's the greatest thing, doesn't make him any better than the female who does it.  They are both whores in my book, and need to find some respect for themselves.	Family & Relationships

Let her know that you have feelings for her, which Im sure she already knows, but also let her know that you respect the fact that she is in a relationship and you would never jeapardize your friendship by telling her to leave her boyfriend.

question_title: Do all men cheat their wives? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Everbody is answering as if your question was: Do all men cheat on their wives,............   but what you wrote was:  Do all men cheat their wives?\n\nTo some extent, all men (and all women) cheat their spouse out of something.   Whether it is your 100% attention, love, loyalty or providing a 100% consistently fulfilling sexual partner......... there are times when each of us cheats the other somehow.\n\nAs to whether all men cheat ON their spouses.  No, I believe that some men are capable of keeping their promises and staying faithful.  Unfortunately the 'bad-apples' ruin the reputation for men.	Family & Relationships
question_title: why is he doing this? [SEP] question_content: theres this kid at my high school (we're in 10th grade) who i've known since 9th grade but never talked to. recently i sat at his table in lunch because i have 2 friends who happened to be sitting there b/c they know him. randomly, he turns around and asks me, (note, these words are the first words he's ever said to me in his life) "do you think five inches is small?" one of my friends saved me by answering fo me, but it still was rele weird... he's the popular kind of kid, he knows almost all the "popular girly-girls" so why, out of all the girls would he ask me? (i'm a shy girl) since then (happened around 2 weeks ago) he's been staring at me. and i mean CLOSELY staring. i actually dont notice it. my friends do.  a friend would say, "i think he's staring at you" and when i'd look,  he'd look away. i notice it more and more from the corner of my eye and it's starting to creep me out!\nwhat does this mean, and why is he doing this???\n*sorry that this is so long* [SEP] best_answer: Because he likes you, but being in this day in age in schools he has to keep his image up to all his cronies.  So if you are in a "lower" click than he is, he has to show off in order to talk to you.  don't do it.  it will be one of those hidden sexual relationships.  Not worth your time.

[SEP] question_content: Has anyone had any dealings with fostercare?\nany experiences?\nand what do you think is the perfect family for a fosterchilds background? [SEP] best_answer: My experience with my foster parents was truly awful and has scarred me for life.\n\nJust make sure you don't beat and rape your foster kid and keep them locked in the cellar. But I guess you're not planning on that anyway were you ?\n\nin general I'd say :\n\nIf you treat your kid as a real person, try to make them feel part of your family and that they are valued and cared for. BUT you need to respect that they know they are not part of your family and that they are not your child and could reject you if you try to be too close to them and try to totally replace their real parent, as that is not a good plan.

question_title: She loves me, but I don't love her.? [SEP] question_content: About a month and a half ago me and my gf of 2 years broke up. About two weeks after, I met this other woman, I thought she was very good company and after a month of talking we slept together not once but twice. She's going through some things so I help her out financially, and so forth. I love her company, but recently me and my ex has decided to give "us" another chance. I would love for us to rekindle our relationship, I told the girl that I have been talking to that we can't sleep together anymore, but I would love to still be her friend. She took it terrible, telling me I can't go back with my ex, and that she's in love. She is also living with her "ex"-fiance`, I don't understand how she could fall in love with me so quickly. I care about her, but I don't love her, I love the woman I have been with for the last 2 years. What do I do about this other woman? How do I tell her I don't feel the same way she feel about me? How do I tell her we can only be friends, w/o hurting her? [SEP] best_answer: Ouch!!\n\nOK to me you are doing the right thing in being honest and stopping the sleeping part of your new found friendship with this lady but I cant help feel this new friend is trying emotional black mail on you if she is living with her ex as you mentioned and who isn't to say she isn't sleeping with him why she has been with you?\nI would be more concerned about STD in this situation than her letting go.\nJust stand your ground and be firm and stick to what ever you decide.\nI think your current relationship will rekindle if you both put time and effort into it like you are.\nThey say a break is as good as a holiday.\nSadly some people can think they are in love because they are craving for any type of attention which they could be lacking in there own life or present relationship so they go and search for it else were.\nWe are all guilty of that at some point of time in our life! If we are honest.\nSo once someone nice like you seem comes along and gives them that attention and gives them the inner emotional needs like sex or comfort,then financial help and any other type of assistance whether its companionship or just a cuppa and chat and most times can be taking out of context making it hard for you in this case to break away or "get away".\nSadly some people cry wolf when they see another vulnerable person like them selves which is an easy target to latch on to.\nAs she has found with you!\nPlease just end this other connection with this other lady but sadly I cant help feel she may start giving you a hard time if not your partener of 2 years. \nAs she will feel jealouse of you going back to her and most probly wonder what is wrong with her for you to leave her after a month but honestly this her thinking and doing and not yours.\nDont fall for any emotional words as they are based on making you feel guilty..\nBe strong..And good luck.

question_title: How to relocate family to another state? [SEP] question_content: My husband and I are trying so hard to start our lives over in another state with our family.  We have 5 children ages 12,10,3,and twins ages 20mos.  We have very little money and will be looking for work and a home as well as childcare.  The reason we're moving is to have a chance to make it, because it's very hard on our family barely making it each day.  We were thinking about MN or GA.  If we have to, then we'll start out living in a family shelter until we get on our feet, but how do we go about doing this? [SEP] best_answer: Before going anyplace contact your local housing authority to get telephone numbers of public housing or Section 8 housing agencies. You need to find one that has openings.Section 8 is a good program. You can move into a house, apt, trailer and HUD will pay your rent, you only pay 30% of you adjusted income.  Most agencies also have a Family Self Sufficiency Program that would be excellent for you and your famiy.  It helps you set goals, employment and eventually gets you into homeownership. IF your housing authority where you live now has Section 8 voucher available, perhaps they would let you go portable to where you want to be.  If you have any questions about this program you can call my office 501 624-4405 ext 102 and I will help you in anyway I can.  Good Luck	Family & Relationships

question_title: ive been dumped and its been over six months, im still not over her, what should i do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Tony Robbins says that pain either breaks us, or motivates us.  Try to find out why you were dumped, and do something to fix it.  Work on self improvement projects - look better, work out, get a good hair style, read self improvement books, etc.  Anything you can do to improve yourself.  It will make you feel better.  You will become more attractive to the opposite sex.  Don't focus on the problem.  This will not cause it to go away.  Force yourself to think positive.  Eventually you WILL be thinking positive.  Set goals.  Set a goal to go on a date with someone new in the next month.  Improve yourself everyday in some way.  Get OUT of your house and DO something.  I've been there myself, and it is tough.  You have to BREAK this pattern in radical way.	Family & Relationships

question_title: 10 reasons why most men are smarter, more responsible, and more mature than women? [SEP] question_content: 1. Many of you B*tch over small things that no one should be upset over, especially in the morning and evenings.\n2. Most women in the world still depend on men for their finacial needs. Most (not all) of you need us men to give you money to burn, which is irresponsible.\n3. Most of you women CANNOT completely get along with other females. You argue amongst yourselves and some of your so called friends. Men find ways to deal with each other as friends and enemies.\n4. We climax easier in bed. While you women complain about it, you all secretly wish you where able to climax as easy as we can, because if you could, that would mean every sexual experience would be fulfilling, similar to what it is for us men.\n5. Most women have tried to "change" a man who would beat them and/or treat them wrong instead of  going for the guy that would treat them right. Very naive and immature. Men dont do that. [SEP] best_answer: At 20 you have a lot to learn about yourself before you can put down 10 good solid reasons why men are smarter, responsible and more mature:  Here's a few that you should consider the opposite: \nIf you climax before the woman, then that means you are in for your own pleasure and the fact that  it means maybe you are a minute man or just in a hurry.\nHow many men stay around when they HELP make a baby, where's the child support, etc. (where's the maturity )\n\nSo what if you have a home, car, etc.,  those are the materialistic things some men (like yourself) think make a man.  Maybe you got up  on the wrong side of the bed, if so, go back to bed and try again.  At 20 you are still trying to find yourself.  In fact, you have to depend on someone to go to the liquor store for you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: How can I encourage my wife of 22 years to initiate love making and to learn creativity in this area? [SEP] question_content: It is strange that I feel like I have to initiate our love making sessions. That I have to teach her how. She has no desire to seek out creative lovemaking techniques. She is critical of me trying to spice things up for us. I feel trapped and bored. I have mistakenly turned to the Internet, but have since stopped and am trying to work on things here. Any other guys, Ladies out their want to weigh in on this? [SEP] best_answer: First off congratulations on 22 years, that is an incredible feat in today's society.  I can't wait till I hit that mark with my husband.\n\nThere are several courses of action you could take.  If you think  your relationship is strong enough just simply sit her down and tell her how important it is to you that you need a change.  Be honest with her.  Be specific about what you'd like her to do more often.  Give her examples of what you'd like her to try, and make them easy ones at first.\n\nMaybe suggest to her that you see a sex counselor.  I'm guessing that your wife is at least in her low if not mid 40's.  For women of that generation we were told to be sexually free but not how to go about it.  You'd be suprised at how many middle aged women need to even learn the art of self pleasure.\n\nAnother route would be to lead by example.  Set up a romantic evening and introduce a new toy, or a soft core video.  Maybe a massage with some lotion.  Maybe once you help her to discover her sexual self she'll be more open to initiating it.\n\nBe patient and hang in there.	Family & Relationships

question_title: what do you mean by love? [SEP] question_content: only tell me about love,dont go to sex. [SEP] best_answer: I think everyone means something different under the word 'love'.

When you stand by the person through all the good and hard times. This is just very brief - but I hope you'll consider it... So, what do YOU mean by love?	Family & Relationships

question_title: the break up? [SEP] question_content: the day before thanksgiving my bf decided to break up with me.he said it was because he had doubt about a lot of things.he's a freshman in college and i'm a senior in high school. So after he used this "reason" i didn't believe him because i figured that he just wants to play around while he's there and i told him that i didn't want to see him again. later, he told some mutual friends of ours that he didn't trust me but he wanted to talk to me.they also said that they asked how i was doing because he wanted to know. he's even tried to contact me through facebook and even one of his friends, who had a part in the break up tried to request me as a friend through the site. i happily declined. for me, it seems like he wants to be friends to make himself feel better about everything. when we broke up he hinted at getting together again in the future. i told him that i never want to speak to him again. lately, i've wanted to contact but i don't want to be the one who caves. Advice? [SEP] best_answer: Girl, please.  Trust me don't even waste your time.  Don't call him.  I repeat DO NOT CALL HIM.   You will appear desperate.  Actually you are too young to even be stressing about the situation.  You have your whole life to live.  Men come and go.  Trust me he will want you back.  You're headed for college and there are plenty of guys there.  \n\nGood luck	Family & Relationships

question_title: will i ever find happiness in love again? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. -Hugh Downs \n\nHappiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself. -Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nIf you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.\nIf you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.\nIf you find serenity and happiness, they may be envious. Be happy anyway.\nIf you do good today, people will often forget it tomorrow. Do good anyway.\nGive the world the best you have, and it may not be enough. Give the world the best you have got anyway.\nYou see, in the end it is between you and God, never between you and them anyway. \nMother Theresa   \n\nLove is not the place to find happiness.  Learn to be happy with yourself, and you will find happiness anywhere.  You will even be able to share it with someone you love.  \n\nAnd if you are happy with yourself, you will be better able to receive love and enjoy it more fully.\n\nWe often get caught up in struggles with someone else when what we need most is to make peace with God and within ourselves.  \n\nIf you find that you are unhappy with you, that's actually good news.  You then know where to start turning things around, and it's something you can do.  That's empowering.\n\nForgiveness is usually the place to start.  What haven't you forgiven others for?  What haven't you forgiven yourself for?  Forgiveness is the only thing that will set you free so that you can move forward.\n\nForgiveness is not saying it's okay that someone did something or that something happened.  It's releasing someone from the debt of making it up to you.  In the end, they really can't.  There is no making it up.  What we want is for the deed to be undone - and it can't be.  When you can accept that it can't be undone and you find peace with that, you can move on, unhindered by the grief that unforgiveness brings.\n\nWhatever hurts others have caused you, let it go.  Whatever expectations you had that didn't get met, let them go.  Learn to be happy with who you are and all the other disappointments in life will not be so hard to bear.\n\nWishing you much peace, happiness, and love...	Family & Relationships

question_title: i like this guy but i don't know if he likes me!? [SEP] question_content: i asked him out and his response was: "damn i like you and all but i have all kinds of other shit on my mind. \nand i dont think that i would be a very good boyfriend rite now cuz i'll never have time to spend with you. \nand i'm always to tired to talk on the phone rite now. \nbut yea we can just be freinds for now rite?" \n\nfootball is over.....what should i do?\n\nand do you think that he really likes me or nott? [SEP] best_answer: If he said he likes you, he probably does. Just like if he says that he won't be a good boyfriend, he probably won't be. If you're just looking for someone to date casually he might be a good guy, but if you're looking for more, you should probably just move on.  If he's already telling you he doesn't have time for you, that's not a good sign.	Family & Relationships
question_title: What's her interest level on me? Very confused!? [SEP] question_content: I'm an attractive boy, 21 and I knew a girl(Jéssica, 13) of my city by internet(orkut) the first contact I made with her was at my job. She passed by me a couple of times, I think 5x, she made eye contact sometimes but very fast. Some days later she contacted me over internet asking if was I on the same party she was. note: at this party she looked at me sometimes fast(3 or 4) so stopped. On the msg she said something like "hey, was it you at the party that day?" just that. So I answered informally saying yes, I mentioned I saw here at the party and made a little compliment.\nSo a week after that without any contact, she passed in front of the restaurant I work again 3 times this time she didn't give a look, but at the third time she stopped exactly in front of the restaurant with her friends(smiling and talking) so she looked at me very fast.\nA day after I sent her another message, saying I saw her and asked how she was, life at all and if she'd hang out saturday...to be continued... [SEP] best_answer: Well if she acts like that then I'd say that she is definatlly interested maybe in a crush on the " older guy" type way. If she says she'll hang out then go for it. Otherwise she may just be too shy.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Am I the only one.....? [SEP] question_content: who is afraid they will be alone forever? [SEP] best_answer: i'm always amazed that some people can write the nasty stuff they do just because they know how to type! rather than giving violations for writing adult content, they should give violations for being rude and nasty...anyways...we're all afraid at some point we're going to be alone and even when in a relationship when we feel comfortable there is always a risk that it might not work out and we'll be alone again. what is it you're looking for in a relationship, what is it you are looking for in a guy? i think you need to find someone you can be friends with before anything else, that way you'll always have stuff to share. also what is it, you feel that you want that you haven't gotten yet that means you are still alone? feel free to email me if u want to talk more ;-)	Family & Relationships

question_title: What are your opinions about me not being able to go with my parents to look at houses? [SEP] question_content: Here is my problem. I love looking at houses to buy them. When I went with my dad it was so fun. That is why i was excited when my mom told me i was moving, but then she told be i'd be a distraction if I went?! I just need some opinions. Are there any parents who have had this problem with their kids? How do you feel about me not going with my step-dad and mom to look at houses?\n\nsomeone help me understand why adults don't want me to go! I am not 5! or irresponcible\n\nthanks [SEP] best_answer: if they are insisting that you will just be in the way, then leave it like that. as exciting as it was before and probably will be for the rest of your life, you have to take into consideration in what your parents say. you should work on improving your behavior and prove to them that you are r-e-s-p-o-n-s-i-b-l-e and that you can act civilized when doing grown up things with them. \n\ni understand as a child that they dont have much of say when it comes to adult decisions, but you can mention that you want to feel comfy in your new home too and that you would like to see what houses they're looking at. buying a house is a big thing and all family members should be a part of agreeing with the house, but if youre going to act wild and run around an empty house- youre not going to get anywhere.

question_title: How can a guy tell if a girl/woman is desperate? [SEP] question_content: Why is it such a turn-off? Also, why is it guys want to try and "pick you up" once you are in a relationship? I was just wondering. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: Ways a guy can tell if a girl/woman is desparate...she is overly aggressive and never says no to anything, she calls too much...she emotionally pours out all her feelings toward you before the two of you are considering even dating....those are signs....I dont want to make this sound primative but guys usually prefer to be the predator we like the chase it gives us a feeling of conquest...(we are weird like that..).....and to your 2nd question....For us it's a competition (sometimes within ourselves)...so we can blow up our ego...unfortunately it may not always be about you....(we men suck like that sometimes...sorry)	Family & Relationships

question_title: Please Help- Serious Spyware Problem? [SEP] question_content: Hi,\nI used to get spyware warnings on system tray but unable to download anti-spyware b/c PC restarts at a moment I try to download. I used system restore and was able to download an anti-spyware and it found 2 browser hijackers in the start up and cleans it but the virus reappears again and again and always restarts whenever I type or search words like spyware, browser hijacker, malware, removal, etc.\n\nPlease help. I’m in the middle of a job-project that my file might be damaged.\nMy PC is Intel Pentium 4, win XP sp2, 1.7 GHZ, 512MB ram.\n\nMany Thanks\nHenny [SEP] best_answer: Ur computer has been affected by multiple viruses....since u say that even after removal by the anti-spyware, the virus seems to reappear.before i tell u the reasons i'll tl u what u must do as there is no easy solution to this problem, since the contents of the original MBR(master boot record) is lost.  The only solution for the anti-virus program is to detect that there is a problem, and to over write the contents of the MBR with a valid MBR program, which the anti-virus program will have to carry with itself.  If your favorite anti-virus program is not that smart, consider replacing it with a better one, or just boot from a write-protected uninfected DOS 5.0 diskette, and execute the program FDISK with the option /MBR.  This will re-create the executable code in the MBR without modifying the partition table data.\n\nIn general, infection by multiple viruses of the same file or area is possible and vital areas of the original may be lost.  This can make it difficult or impossible for virus disinfection tools to be effective, and replacement of the lost file/area will be necessary.U must have proper back-up for the projects that are going on.If there are no back ups then i think u have to loose some stuff.\nTHIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED\nThe first of these viruses that infects the computer will overwrite the Master Boot Record with its body and store the original MBR at a certain place on the disk.  So far, this is normal for a boot-record virus.  But if now the other virus infects the computer too, it will replace the MBR (which now contains the virus that has come first)with its own body, and store what it believes is the original MBR (but in fact is the body of the first virus) AT THE SAME PLACE on the harddisk, thus OVERWRITING the original MBR.  When this happens, the contents of the original MBR are lost.  Therefore the disk becomes non-bootable.\n\nWhen a virus removal program inspects such a hard disk, it will see the SECOND virus in the MBR and will try to remove it by overwriting it with the contents of the sector where this virus normally stores the original MBR.  However, now this sector contains the body of the FIRST virus. therefore, the virus removal program will install the\nfirst virus in trying to remove the second.  In all probability it will not wipe out the sector where the (infected) MBR has been stored.\n\nWhen the program is run again, it will find the FIRST virus in the MBR.  By trying to remove it, the program will get the contents of the sector where this virus normally stores the original MBR, and will move it over the current (infected) MBR.  Unfortunately, this sector still contains the body of the FIRST virus.  Therefore, the body of\nthis virus will be re-installed over the MBR ad infinitum.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is the differece between bpo and call centre jobs? [SEP] question_content: what is the difference between BPO and call centre jobs? [SEP] best_answer: BPO means Business Processes Outsourcing. It can involve outsourcing(getting work done by third party) of any activity of a business like accounting, customer service, payroll preparation, data mining and so on. \nA Call centre is a place where trained people take customer service calls/enquiries for a particular company. Now a call centre work can be done by the company itself (called captive call centre) or it can be outsourced from a specialised firm (then it is called BPO).\n\nSo, essentially Call Center is a type of BPO service.\nSecondly, in a call center job you have to answer customer calls, whereas in a BPO job you could be doing call center work or any other process also maybe just desk job like data processing.

question_title: when i try to install a second anti virus program, it cautions me to remove my other programs.  what gives? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is something I noticed with Norton but this is probably because they don't want the competition. Sometimes one antivirus will find things that the other can't but usually collisions don't occur. In theory they can't pickup the quarantine of the other as that defies the idea of quarantine: where a virus is isolated. I have 2 antiviruses working in the background and you find that one will pick it up before the other (For me this is OneCare from Microsoft). Why do you need two antiviruses anyway? One combined with a good firewall is safe enough protection.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how do i connect two computers in a home network? one is upstais and the other downstairs? [SEP] question_content: I have one computer downstairs and another one upstairs. The computer downstairs is connected to the internet via a DSL modem by USB. Both the computers have Ethernet and USB 2.0 ports. What I want to do is to connect the two computers in some way so that both computers will have internet access. The problem is that I don't want to connect them by the means of wireless. I perfer cable. What equipment should I buy? The distance between the two computers is about 50 feet. [SEP] best_answer: You need  a router. if you don't want a wireless router, then you can get a wired router and buy enough cat5 cable to run from the upstairs computer to the router downstairs. You will then connect your DSL modem to the router and both computers to the router. Go to your computer name settings from the properties of my computer and enter a workgroup name for both of them (the default is "workgroup" and will work fine also), not the domain setting. The router software should set up a dynamic host table to give both of the computers their own IP addy to communicate on so you can use automatically detect in the TCP/IP settings. the DSL modem will now recognize the DSL modem as the IP address for your home account, not that of the computer. If you want sharing permissions for files and folders then you will need to create profiles on each of the computers that give the necessary permissions for the other computers profile/sign on. \n\nThe cat5 cable itself will have to be physically run from the upstairs computer to the router so you will need to either get enough to tack it on the stairs and wall trim etc or drill through the floor/ceiling.\n\n\nGood Luck	Computers & Internet

question_title: Why is Ads by google everywhere? I hate it? [SEP] question_content: I'm beginning to hate google. Why is it that all sites are annoyingly congested with google adverts that instead of finding rich content you see google adverts everywhere? Is google paying the site owners for displaying adverts on their sites? How does the whole thing works? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, on most sites, ads are the major source of income.  They are slots sold by the webhost (google in our case) to another company (our example AD)\n\nYou're surfing on Google, hypothetically, and you come accross an annoying AD.  you might click on it on accident, you may ignore it, or you may be intrigued and click on it for more information.  Google is happy any way, because they get money for allowing others to put their information on the Google site.  The company is happy if the first or last happen.  If the first happens they get another "Hit" which shows how many times the site has been visited, increasing rankings/popularity/etc. the third, they get an additional Hit, but they also run the chance of selling something/getting another Hit on a linked site.\n\nSo you see, Ads are needed for a site to run, on both ends.  Its like a helpful parasite, it lives on the Host, but helps it, and the host helps the parasite at the same time	Computers & Internet

question_title: In Java, is it normal for an IF statement to not correctly evaluate a string if composed of characters? [SEP] question_content: I'm working on some Java code, and I create a string with characters of another string.\n\nexample:  strStringName = "" + strAnotherString.charAt( 0 ) + strAnotherString.charAt( 1 );\n\nSince I include the empty quotes at the beginning, this assignment statement should automatically typecast the added characters as string type.  This statement works fine for me in my code; this is not where the problem lies.\n\nNext, I evaluate whether that string is equivalent to a string literal in an IF statement.\n\nexample:\nif (strStringName == "ab")\n{\n    (this doesn't work, blah blah blah)\n}\n\nFor some reason, this IF statement evaluates the express as "false"...which it shouldn't do!\n\nHowever, if I use the charAt method, it works...but it sure is a lot of added code I have to write which I shouldn't have to.\n\nexample:\nif (strStringName.charAt(0) == 'a' && strStringName.charAt(1) == 'b')\n{\n    (this works, blah blah blah)\n}\n\nwtf is going on??!!!!...is it a bug with the SDK/JDK?...bleh!

Now if you want to create truely dynamic web pages that people can log in at, extract data, or search for things you'll want to use PHP.  To search you'll need a database to store info in which case you can use SQL, one such implementation is MySQL.  \n\nThese are all FREE!  There are pleanty of resources on the net to teach you.  So just search on their names and you will get plenty to keep you busy.\n\nThere are more, but this is a very popular group of software commonly known as LAMP.

[SEP] question_content: I only been in a chat room a few time, so I don't really remember, but isen't yahoo answers close to a chat room ?

Mostly about nonsense, sometimes about something in particular.  Again, people are communicating real time, back and forth.\n\nYahoo! Answers offers people a way to ask a question, and solicit feedback from other participants.  It is not real time, and there is little immediate interaction.  It is not intended to be used as a method of direct communication---It is meant to pose questions and share answers.\n\nAs mentioned in Yahoo's own description, the topics can be from the silly to the serious, just like a chat room, but it's not a way to communicate like a chat room.

The work is located on the client's webhost account which I have access to. Is it legal to temporarily shut down the website until payment has been remitted in full?\n\nI understand that I could take the client to small claims court, but even that is no guarantee of payment coming due. Meanwhile, the client is getting what amounts to free advertising.\n\nBoth myself and the client live and work in NJ, and the webhost resides in CA.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!

question_title: can i rename a folder as con in windows operating system. if not why?

It's an internal command in DOS and the word 'con' cannot be used by anything else... if you absolutely insist that you have a folder named con, name it C-o-n, C_o_N or c0n, <--C zero n  that's the only way i know of to do it	Computers & Internet

question_title: How does the speed of the internet connection affect the dowload times of web pages? [SEP] question_content: Could someone explain this to me [SEP] best_answer: When you open a web page, the information on that page (pictures, sound, text, etc.) are sent from the "Server" to your computer through the internet.\n\nSome pages have lots of information on them ... the Yahoo home page, for example, has pictures and links and text.  You'll note also that there are little applications that run a well.  These little applications are called scripts.\n\nA script is a part of the web page that works like a little program.  Ever noticed how when you move your mouse over the icons in the upper right corner of the Yahoo home page, that they buttons "expand" to show you more choices ?\n\nAll of this information and data must be sent from the Yahoo server to your computer.\n\nThink about it this way ... If I had to send you 20 gallons of water, you could get that 20 gallons a whole lot faster if there is a bigger pipe going into your house !   If I'm trying to send you 2000 gallons of water (like a page full of pictures and stuff) and all you have is a soda-straw sized pipe (i.e. dial-up), then it's gonna take a while !

question_title: how to set up a website? [SEP] question_content: My club members want to set up a site [SEP] best_answer: The options for setting up a website are as varied as the options for choosing a car. Choose what you think your needs are from the left-hand column and follow the instructions in that row. \n\nWho You Are  What You'll Need to Invest  Do This  Don't Do This  \nI'm a student and need to be able to put my class projects on a website. \n\nI just want to set up a personal site with a few photos and some generic information. \n\nI'm campaigning for public office and don't want to spend any money on the Internet, but someone told me I need a website. \n\nThere's no way I'm going to spend anything on building a website, but I'm sure I need one.  Free websites are available everywhere. You'll need to spend at least half an hour to set up what you want, but you don't need any special skills. Your only investment is time.  Go to Geocities or Angelfire and follow their very simple step-by-step instructions for setting up a website. If you can follow directions, you can put up a website with one of these services. There are plenty of others available, but these two are the best-known. \n\nWhen you're done, be sure to add the address of your website to the signature line on your e-mail. If you have business stationery or other printed literature, put it there as well. It's just about the only way anyone will find your site. \n\nIf you know anyone with a website, ask them nicely if they would mind giving you a link. Unless some other site links to yours, the search engines will never find it. \n\nExpect to grow annoyed with the ads on your site. Free web hosts use pop-up ads, pop-under ads, and banners built-in to your pages in order to pay for their services. If you're not bothered, don't worry about them. Most users eventually grow tired of them.  Don't expect a lot of visitors. Your address will be long and hard to remember, so unless someone is really intent on finding your site, not many folks will visit. \n\nDon't expect to be taken very seriously. If you aren't willing to put any money into your site, don't expect visitors to think you're an authority. \n\nDon't get caught up in design. There's not much you can do to make your free site look great. Just put the basic information up and see whether it does the trick for you. Crazy backgrounds, wild color schemes, lots of pictures, and sounds that play whenever people visit your site will only serve to irritate. Keep it simple. \n\nDon't forget to add content. Since your page probably doesn't look very special, be sure to add things to it often enough that it serves a real purpose. \n\nDon't put your e-mail address on the page. Anywhere. If you do, you'll get so much spam you'll never forgive yourself.  \nWho You Are  What You'll Need to Invest  Do This  Don't Do This  \nI have a lot to say, and I want to blog.  As little as nothing. Some fees may apply, especially as you become more sophisticated. Expect it to become a regular consumer of your time.  Go to Blogger or TypePad or LiveJournal and follow their instructions. \n\nHave something interesting to say, and often. Keep your site fresh. Political campaigns and businesses are starting to realize the power of fresh information posted to people who actively want to follow what's happening directly from the source. \n\nYou may eventually decide to go solo and run your personal site without someone else's software or hosting. When that time comes, use PairNIC to register your domain and Pair Networks to host your site. Their prices are excellent and so is their service.  Don't expect it to be easy. Well-done blogs often absorb lots of their authors' time. \n\nDon't post so often that you create unreasonable expectations. Sandbag a little until you're comfortable with the amount of time you dedicate to your blog. \n\nDon't divulge personal secrets, proprietary information, or national secrets.

question_title: Hurry..please help!? How do i back up my computer?!? [SEP] question_content: I have an Windows xp Home Edition..im updating my system and need to know how to back up my system in case something goes wrong?! [SEP] best_answer: The most convenient way is to backup your system using special software, such as Acronis True Image, to the CDs or DVDs. True Image has very friendly interface and I think that it won't take you a long to time to understand how it works. The latest versions of ATI can burn a CD or DVD but one can just use ATI 7 (free version) to create an image of a hard drive/of a partition on a hard drive and then just burn it to CD. However ATI 7 can just burn a bootable CD and in case your system fails you'll be able to boot from it just in minutes.\nYou can purchase the latest version of ATI here: http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/\nOr download a free version of ATI here: http://www.acronis.com/mag/vnu-ati7	Computers & Internet

question_title: Is there an easy way to learn JAVA? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Easy is a rather relative term. I found the concepts in Java very easy to learn, but I understand OO design and had a firm understanding of C++ before I started.\n\nThat said, there are a few ways to get started that I can think of:\n\n1. A good book, as someone mentioned already. I don't know of any personally. Perhaps someone can suggest one.\n\n2. A tutorial or two :)  ... A good resource for Java tutorials (well, lots of programming tutorials actually) is ... http://www.programmertutorials.com/tutorials/7/1\n\n3. It always helps to have a mentor with any programming language.

question_title: isnt there a way to format a partition which is a a boot or system partition? [SEP] question_content: further wat is the difference between a boot and system partition.Is there any difference between formatting the drive and selecting everything and simply delete it? [SEP] best_answer: First off you can not format your main "Boot Partition" unless you are going to create a Ghost disk to install after you FDISK or format and keep the OS still.  Once you format / FDISK your Boot Partition it is gone and you have to reinstall your O/S from scratch. (I format my system about once every 6 mo. to make sure crap is cleared up anyway.)\n\nThe difference between a "Boot" and a "System" partition is the boot partition has your MBR (Master Boot Record) loaded on it.  Which in all means the Boot information for your O/S.  (You can have multiple bootable partitions called a Dual/Tri/or even now I've seen Quade boot systems.)  And is your system has to have this partition to boot into any OS.\n\nThe "System" partition is a partition doesn't have to be on a system but can be setup if you have a large hard drive.  (i.e.  300GB drive and you want to make 3 partitions 1-100G "Boot Partition" 2-100GB "System Partitions")  This type of partition doesn't have an MBR.	Computers & Internet

question_title: What is the best program for streaming music off the internet to your PC? [SEP] question_content: Examples: Musicmatch, Yahoo, etc.\nFree music downloads would also be nice. [SEP] best_answer: I think Yahoo's LAUNCHcast service is really great.  You can find it at http://music.yahoo.com/\n\nThey have pre-programmed stations that play music based on themes, such as Big Hits of the 80s or R&B or New Releases.\n\nThey also have a custom station called "My Station" which will play music that you'll like.  This is based on how you rate songs, artists and albums, which you can do on the website or in the radio player.  Once you've started rating, the station will get better and better.  I love it, and I don't think anybody has as good of personalization as the "My Station"\n\nMusicmatch is pretty good too, although it hasn't been getting as much attention since they were bought by Yahoo!\n\nI don't think anybody is going to offer free music downloads (at least legally), other than maybe some obscure indie music.

question_title: How much money monthly you get from Google Adsense? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Your mileage may vary. No one could predict how much one website could earn. A website with the same amount of pageviews may earn $100 per month while the other website with the same amount of pageviews earn $10,000 a month.\n\nIt is important that you experiment, but keep in mind that your mileage varies. Some sites fit so well with Adsense and can earn thousands from it (example is my website), while some can earn very little from it -- EVEN with tremendous amount of traffic. Here's a thread I recently answered where the site owner said that her site was even featured in 60 Minutes show and is enjoying an avalanche of traffic - yet she earns only $10 from it http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Ar5WQhJtsb8LJN4NbpDeivgjzKIX?qid=1006032112980 \n\nYou have to remember that your income will depend on several factors: \n\n1. keywords shown on your site\n2. level of advertiser bidding on your site - e.g. keywords "diamond" is worth more than "squirrel games" because more advertisers are willing to spend money on those interested in diamonds\n3. your traffic levels - the more traffic you have, the better\n4. your CTR rate - the higher the better and this depends on your ad placement, your ad colors\n5. responsiveness of audience to ads\n5. smartpricing - the big unknown in Adsense\n\nThe only way you can learn about how your site will perform with Adsense is through trying it.\n\nWebmasterWorld has a lot of discussions on Adsense and one of the most active discussions right now is the thread "How I made a Million in 3 Months with Adsense  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum89/12751.htm . The person who started the thread is Markus Finch, who operates the immensely popular online dating website PlentyofFish.com. PlentyofFish.com's business model is different from the subscription based model used by the big online dating websites. Instead of subscriptions, Markus relies on advertising, specifically Google Adsense to derive income from his website. The lessons he shares are:\n\n1. Understand your traffic and how it could affect your keywords.\n2. Create sites that will bring in repeat traffic.\n3. Have your users create content and lots of it.\n4. Do not enter markets with a lot of competition monitized via adsense.\n5. Keep your site simple.\n6. Learn from various forums and if people are not talking about your market, there is a good chance you will make money.\n\nMarkus' website has an impressive Alexa rank of 1,407. What is more impressive is that the site is only a two-person operation, with Markus getting help from his girlfriend unlike his big competitors run by big corporations (e.g. Viacom owns Match.com).\n\nI suggest you read the following articles:\n\nGoogle Adsense: How Small Business Entrepreneurs can Earn from Online Advertising http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol123/adsense.htm \nEarning Revenues from Contextual Advertising http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol139/contextual.htm \n8 Tips for Maximizing Contextual Advertising Revenues http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol146/contextual.htm \nContextual Advertising: Why Are You Earning Only Pennies? http://www.powerhomebiz.com/022006/adsense.htm	Computers & Internet

If you read the article I cite in the source, it makes more sense.  Google has devised their own file system, but the operating system they use in their data center is a version of Linux.  So, is it a completely new OS?  Doesn't sound like it.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Where can I download a church membership database model for MS-Access? [SEP] question_content: In my expanding duties to manage a church membership, I decided to move from an MS-Word (my forte) table to a full-featured database application in MS-Access (my proficiency in Access is limited).  The wizard’s models aren’t flexible enough (won’t allow me to delete unnecessary fields, etc.) so I decided to create a new Access database application without the wizard’s assistance.\n\nIt then occurred to me that millions of others must have wanted to put a list of church members together into an Access database so I’m probably reinventing the wheel.  However, when I did a Google search for an Access church membership model, all I could find were trial applications that cost hundreds of dollars and weren’t compatible with MS-Access.\n\nSurely with all the “brotherhood,” somebody must be willing to share their Access database model with other Christians.  It seems like everyone is using “God” as a vehicle to run enterprising businesses with proprietary rights protecting their financial advantage.  I never realized how much opportunity “God” is providing to the religious purveyors of the faith until I tried to find a database application that someone might be willing to share, just to further the gospel.\n\nSo how about it?  Do you know of a place where I can take advantage of someone else’s hours of labor in setting up a church membership database in MS-Access?   Thanks, Johnny [SEP] best_answer: (also answered in the Religion and Spirituality Section)\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMicrosoft has a huge section where you can download things like this.\n\nFor a membership database, you can go to:\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/TC010185841033.aspx?CategoryID=CT063459131033\n(I used this one for a photo club membership database.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Pretty easy, really.\nAfter you kill the squirrel, take your knife and cut a hole in the center of his back, crosswise of his body.  Make the hole about a inch wide.  Next, insert on finger from either hand into the opening, and pull just enough to make the hole large enough to get a better grip with more fingers.  Then just pull your hands apart.  The skin will usually tear around the squirrel, leaving it looking very much like a pair of pants and a shirt on the squirrel.  Pull off the top part first, the "shirt" pulling the skin up until his wrist and neck is free of skin.  Then break the wrist and cut loose below the freed skin.  Remove the head, and the skin from the "shirt" has the head and front feet in it.  Unless you plan on eating the brains, throw it away.  Personally, I'll leave squirrel brains and scrambled eggs to the old-timers!\nNext, hit the bottom half, the "pants"  Same basic procedure, but this time you're gonna have some intestines at the bottom, and if it was a male squirrel there's gonna be some more equipment down there...just yank it or cut it off.\nNow when you open it up, use just the tip of your knife. Put your finger on the backside of the blade, about a half inch or so from the point, so you don't bust any internal organs.  Horrible smell...avoid if possible.  Start at the pelvis and run the blade all the way up to the ribcage.  At this point, rupturing organs are no longer a concern, so go ahead and slice the ribcage open, sternum to throat.  Slide your fingers into the abdomen cavity, and pull out the internals.  Make sure you get all of it; it's not hard.  Next, remove the lungs and heart.  Make sure to get the windpipe.  Also, remember to bust the pelvis and make sure you get all the intestines and any droppings that may have squeezed out.  \nTake the squirrel inside, wash it with cold water, remove the legs and cut in half about halfway up the body.  Fill a fairly large bowl with saltwater, and put the dressed squirrel in it and put the whole thing in the refridgerator for at least a few hours, or overnight.  Then, pull the squirrel out, wash it, and either cook it, or freeze it.  \nI, personally, prefer mine fried, although squirrel dumplings are great, too...	Sports

question_title: Bernard Hopkins or Tarver?...who u think will win??? [SEP] question_content: i'm praying Hopkins can bow out with this win as one of greatest boxers in his weight class.... [SEP] best_answer: B-Hop is moving up to fight tarver, so either way i dont think many would say he wasnt one of the great fighters at 160. Probably one of the best things b hop has going for him is that tarver is coming down in weight from that foolish rocky movie (and a lot of guys cant really recover from cutting all the weight for one reason or another). Tarver is a pretty skilled boxer so hopkins edge against most fighters probably doesnt come into play as much here. I dont know how much he has left in the tank at this point, but i do hope he can beat tarver for one last hurrah. Still i think tarver wins by a close decision, since thats the way it seems their styles will dictate this fight. Either way hopkins is an all time great at 160.	Sports

question_title: When shooting a fire arm how come the rekasha never hit the shooter? [SEP] question_content: i was wonder because on this tv show the were shoooting and it bbounced back and hit the car not the shooter how so [SEP] best_answer: The bullet would have to strike something that would cause the bullet to bounce straight back in order for the shooter to be hit. Normally the bullet will strike something at an angle. When the bullet hits, the object it hits absorbs energy from the bullet. The greater the angle, the less energy is absorbed. Example, if you are shooting across water, the bullet might strike at a 175 degree angle, little energy is absorbed by the water and the bullet will travel very far after hitting the water. If the bullet strikes pavement at 45 degrees, half of the energy will be absorbed by the pavement, and will not travel much farther after hitting the pavement. If the bullet hits a concrete wall at 90 degrees, all of the energy is absorbed by the wall, the bullet has no energy left to ricochet back to the shooter. If the wall were made of rubber, the wall would absorb all of the energy, but because of the elastic properties of rubber, the rubber would transfer some of the energy back to the bullet, and throw the bullet back to the shooter. Hope this helps.	Sports

question_title: Best national anthem? [SEP] question_content: Which national anthem is the most rousing before a football match? For me, France's is spine-tingling..

The Anthem was composed by poet Francisco González Bocanegra and the music was arranged by Jaime Nunó.\nFrance is a classic, also (like Mexico's) a military march, full of feeling and history.. \nUSA's is pretty but not that strong, i feel it more like romatic, but obviously is not a march. I do not know its history, but the lyrcs are very sentimental. That is way it sounds so pretty when it is singed "a capella". \nJust like Germany's hymn from Haydn. the issue with the verses i think its somehow stupid, that had nothing to do with the WWII, I like the lyrics but the music is very pretty and i think its motto Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit represents totally what Germany is today.\n \nAnd the very best is the Hymn of Europa: The tune of the Ode to Joy  (Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and the lyrics are from Friedrich Schiller)	Sports

Lean forward as if you were hurdling grab hold of a fence, wall, or another hurdle. Place you lead leg beside hurdle and snap your trail leg over the hurdle.\n* First, the hurdles must be brought in closer. Shorten the distance between the first and second hurdle so that you can 3 step without bounding.\n* Use your feet to walk off the distance you moved the hurdle from the original marks, now walk off the same distance for all of the other hurdles.\n* Run these in practic till in feel like you are getting too close to the next hurdle then move all the hurdles a step forward.\n* The transition takes time, do not force the 3 step, so "just run" go over the hurdle with what ever leg comes up. Eventually 3 stepping will occur by itself. \n\n\n 300-400M Hurdles running drills\n\nFirst 6:  - The first six hurdles are setup on the marks. The first six hurdle are then ran at race pace to build rhythm.\nRun 5 to 7 of these to build rhythm and strength.\n\n Last 3:  \n- The last three hurdles are setup on the marks, used for 300 hurdle training to build strength.\nRun 3 to 5 of these to build strength.

question_title: How are the Packers going to do this year? [SEP] question_content: How are the Packers going to fair in the upcoming season? [SEP] best_answer: Tough question...\n\nFarve being back, and knowing Farve as we all do, he'll give it his all. But it takes two to complete a reception.\n\nRB situation doesn't look too promising, but after all the ups and downs of last season who knows?\n\nD# needs to seriously tighten the ole belt, but it helps if your offence doesn't put you in a terrible spot.\n\nLast year, the offense self distructed with injuries and they STILL managed to come close to winning several games. But this isn't horseshoes OR handgrenades.\n\nAfter last year's terrible luck, I'm bumping them back up in the end of year rankings for 07, unless that turns into a streak. Then I'm writing another "Maybe Next Year" wish list to the fat man in red and white.\n\nSuperbowl? Nu-uh. Play-offs? Unlikely. This is a rebuilding year regardless of who is back and until Farve retires and a successor is found (Note: Not just a starter but a GOOD QB, so who knows how long.) don't hold your breath waiting to see that silver football in the hands of someone in green and gold.\n\nBut I wouldn't be shocked if they had a winning season either. That is what I love about the Packers. Unpredictable.\n\nDon't feel bad. I'm a KC fan first and foremost. HERM EDWARDS!? Bah humbug!	Sports

The most common complaint is pain at the base of the toe, but you may also have symptoms of stiffness and swelling.\n\nThe name turf toe comes from the fact that this injury is especially common among athletes who play on artificial turf.

Is there anything that you're not really flexible at, such as needing more stretch in your spirals? If you can narrow it down a bit, it might be easier to answer. \n\nBut in general, yoga, ballet and pilates are good places to start looking for stretches and exercises that will help your skating.

question_title: What are the core beliefs of the political left and the political right? [SEP] question_content: What are they trying to achieve in the end? [SEP] best_answer: at the root of the political institutions of the left and right, there are simple human emotions.  Because of this, what those institutions eventually achieve or fail to achieve is ultimately beyond the reach of such institutions to predict, no matter how much the followers of a particular philosophy want it to be otherwise.  \n\nto sum up the emotions I'm referring to: If the status quo benefits someone, they tend to be conservative and on the right.  If the status quo doesn't particularly do any good for a person, they tend to be liberal and on the left.  \n\nthis is why students and young people tend to the left - they have no property or high social status to defend, no great steady job to hang onto.  But these same people, a few years later, often wouldn't be going to protests anymore, because they have a good job and a mortgage and car payments and whatnot.  Generally, as people age they become more conservative.   \n\nthe more status and property people have, the higher their priority is to protect what they've got.  So, the old dad who used to be a hippy, is a grumpy stick-in-the-mud by the time his kids are idealistic teens!\n\nthis dynamic all works on a large, collective scale as well.  It's all about what people have to lose.  The more they have to lose, the further right they drift...	Politics & Government

Despite everything we know about the history of the world and all the technology at our fingertips too many people ignore all the information we have.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would challenge the "not hotly contested" - Carter started off with a lead, but it did get closer towards the end of the race. He only won by about 3 percentage points and it was also fairly close electorally.\n\nAs to the issues themselves, Watergate kind of overshadowed every election in both 1974 and 1976. Carter presented himself as an outsider, someone untainted by Washington politics who would clean up the system.\nFord basically played the experience card, arguing that Carter lacked the experience to lead the country.\nThe other major issues were economics, especially inflation and Ford's inability to control it (look up WIN buttons).\nAnd Ford did make a major faux pas about the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe during one of the debares.

question_title: Do other countries have the right to use rendition to interrogate US civilians or military personnel? [SEP] question_content: Since the US president has first denied, then admitted and then justified the use of extraordinary rendition to snatch individuals out of foreign countries and send them where they can be tortured for information, should other countries be allowed to do the same thing to US citizens and gov't employees? Many other countries consider our actions to be terrorist in nature (not saying I agree, but I am aware of their assertions). [SEP] best_answer: You know, I am never shocked at what one human will do to another, even without just cause.  Torture is in my book an effective means of gaining information, but completely inhumane. Any national of any country technically is forbidden to engage in torture during wartime; as far as I understand the Geneva Convetions. But who is actually going to refrain when they believe their cause for doing so is justified? As for the question of should anyone have the right to engage in torture, I'd have to say level the playing field and let a war be a war again, stop trying to civilize the most uncivilized act possible!

question_title: WHY DO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT GAY MARRAGe? [SEP] question_content: i don't see how it effects enyone. i don't get the big fuss. [SEP] best_answer: Gay marriages are not for any of us to judge.\nDo you want to be judged for your ideals or beliefs?\nNo one has the right to make any law to condemn those who live a different life style just because they don't agree with them or think they are doing something wrong.  Only God has that right and unless you want to go a few rounds with God about this that's fine but for now leave well enough alone and b*t*h about something that's really important, like world peace and how to obtain it without more killings and bombings and so on and so on.

question_title: Even when a report PROVES the existence of WMD's in Iraq the LIBS still don't get it. Why? [SEP] question_content: The report released today proves that the former government of Iraq lied to weapons inspectors and to the UN Security Council and has stockpiles of WMD's stashed randomly around the country and yet even after all of this is proven the libs here and on TV are STILL coming up with excuses. Why can't they just admit they were wrong, or better yet just admit that they're anti-war hippies?\n\nAnd, more importantly, why do the libs always pretend that WMD's were the only reason given for a war in the middle east? [SEP] best_answer: That's easy.  Back when we were all discussing why Saddam needed his ass kicked, the libs kneejerked their way into a corner.  They hate(d) Bush SOOOO bad, they couldn't allow themselves to be seen agreeing with him, so the importance of the WMDs had to be minimized.  Now, any time a report comes out that demonstrates Iraq had WMD's, the lib press and politicians will talk about anything BUT that report.\n\nThe libs aren't completely stupid (ok, they are, but that's another topic) and they realize that to admit they were wrong will not only remove their mainstream base, but they will also loose face with the extreme lefties.  Not a good thing with elections coming up, so all they have left to do is scream about bringing the troops home, blah blah blah to divert attention from the real issues.	Politics & Government
question_title: If the king or queen commits a crime, how will he/she be tried in court? What will be the case's title? [SEP] question_content: Has a king or queen committed a crime and tried before a court in history? I know many monarchs have gotten away with their heinous crimes, while the unlucky ones had their citizens revolt against them, but have any actually been taken to court before? What will be the case's title? After all, the state is prosecuting the monarch him/herself. Rex v. Rex? Regina v. Regina? What about if the king or queen takes their respective spouse to court? Rex v. Regina? Regina v. Rex? [SEP] best_answer: In the United Kingdom the sovereign not only has immunity from prosecution, it has become accepted that he or she cannot be required to give evidence in court. \n\nIt is true that Charles I was tried for treason before a Parliamentary court, convicted and executed. However, it should be noted that after the Restoration in 1660 the men who had tried the king were arrested. Several of them were then hung, drawn and quartered and, with a few exceptions, the rest were imprisoned for life.	Politics & Government

question_title: Last months rent was paid 10yrs ago, w/agreement from landord that it was last months rent. Can they raise it?

We were "to;d" (No signed contract) that it was first and last with any stipulations 110 yrs ago that it would go up with rent increases. Can they demand more than original "last months'" rent? [SEP] best_answer: If not in writing it's going to be tough to fight it. Unless it was specifically addressed in your verbal agreement they have every legal right to ask for additional deposit. Obviously if you've been there for 10 years you must like the place a lot; probably not worth fighting.	Politics & Government

question_title: Question to those who served in the Military.? [SEP] question_content: Ok I'm at the point where i'm considering what to do with my life. And joining the Military(not sure which branch yet) is one of my options. Its not the money or college opportunites that I like about the Military,( I have enough money to go to about any college) mostly its prestige. So anyways my question is basically what were your experinces during training, how tough is it really and any info you can give me on it.  Also which branch would you recommend, and will a GED cut it? [SEP] best_answer: The training in ANY branch is absolutely "no harder than it needs to be".  You'll notice that I put that in quotes.  The saying is old, but it's true.  The idea behind the training is to keep you alive in a combat situation.  Is it hard?  Yes.  Is it too hard?  Depends on how much you value your life, honestly.  The USAF training is not too hard, because they are not on the ground.  USN focuses on swimming and staying alive in water (go figure).  The Army and Marines training is harder (USMC is harder and longer), because they are on the ground and doing the dirty.\n\nWhich branch would I recommend?  The branch that offers YOU the best deal for YOU!  I spent 20 years in the Army, and was a recruiter.  I know that the Army has the best deal out there, but it's YOUR life, YOUR decision.  You need to sit down with each branch, get your information, and make your decision after reviewing ALL the material.\n\nGED?  That's a timing issue.  If you have some college, that will help.  If you can score over 50 on the ASVAB, that will help.  That's another issue that needs to be brought up with the recruiting offices. \n\nGood luck	Politics & Government

I think, I am not completely sure, but I think you cook cocaine with something to make the rocks? It was also more addictive than cocaine. Hence the two reasons it became popular.

question_title: Do you think our government stupid? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well -- it could be better, sure.\n\nBut, when you consider the alternatives:\n\n(1)  For example, the Chinese government, which arrests law abiding citizens just because they hold Bible studies.   Keep them locked up for years.\n\n(2)  China also harvests the organs of political prisoners (there are reports they are simply killed for the organs).\n\n(3)  Think of the extreme governments around the world that hold their women to sub-servient roles, denying them education or career advancement.\n\n(4)  Despotic tribal governments which are conducting acts of genocide on refugee camps, or their own people fleeing the destruction of their own villages.\n\nYou read about this, and you often think, "Didn't this happen in the Dark Ages?"   Sadly, it's a reality that affects over half the planet.   Yes, over half.\n\nSo, while our government can always use improvement, I am grateful to live here.   And, if you really want to change America, you CAN make a difference.	Politics & Government

question_title: probation violation? [SEP] question_content: I have been convicted of 2 DUI's, I was sentenced to 90 days house arrest and 2 years probation. After my house arrest was done. I was seen in a local bar by a probation officer. I met with my probation officer, she made me see the light. I felt it was over. Now I get a letter, 6 weeks later, that I have to go to a hearing for probation revocation. What should I expect to happen? I have no other charges, have not been in trouble. And when I am tested for alcohol I am clean [SEP] best_answer: It is likely that you have a probation term that requires you to not be in a place where alcohol is the primary item sold (such as a bar or liquor store).  Where I work, that is a VERY common term amongst probationers whose probation is due to alcohol charges.  If your probation officer is on your side, now is probably a good time to get in their and sell your case to him or her.  You will need them on your side when you go to court.\n\nIt is likely that a term of your probation included a suspended jail or prison term (jail time that you will have to serve if you mess up on probation) - almost all probation does.  If so, you may be looking at jail or prison time.	Politics & Government

Penal Code § 32.41  (2005)\nIssuance of Bad Check\n(a) A person commits an offense if he issues or passes a check or similar sight order for the payment of money knowing that the issuer does not have sufficient funds in or on deposit with the bank or other drawee for the payment in full of the check or order as well as all other checks or orders outstanding at the time of issuance.\n\n (f) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, an offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor. \n\nClass C misdemeanor is governed by section \nTex.

[SEP] best_answer: IR-2005-99, Sept. 9, 2005\n\nWASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department announced an increase to the optional standard mileage rates for the final four months of 2005.\n\nThe rate will increase to 48.5 cents a mile for all business miles driven between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31, 2005. This is an increase of 8 cents from the 40.5 cent rate in effect for the first eight months of 2005, as set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-64.\n\n<edit>\n\nWhile gasoline is a major factor in the mileage figure, other items enter into the calculation of mileage rates, such as the price of new vehicles and insurance.\n\nThe optional business standard mileage rate is used to compute the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business use in lieu of the extra burden of tracking actual costs. This rate is also used as a benchmark by the federal government and many businesses to reimburse their employees for mileage.	Politics & Government

question_title: Are there any conventions, protocols, bills, that outlaw punishing refugees that are forcibly repatriated? [SEP] question_content: Right now, in the North Korean Refugee crisis, the Chinese are sending North Korean refugees back to their home country. These "returnees" are then punished through labor camps and "concentration" camps. Are there any resolutions or conventions that the United Nations has come up with to ban this sort of behavior? [SEP] best_answer: Theres little point in having these kind of conventions or protocols its hardly realistic to expect that a country which treats people in a way that makes them want to escape and seek asylum in another country would give a toss about protocols etc. The UK seeks assurances from certain countries that returnees will not be tortured,to even pretend that a country that tortures has the morals or ethics to stick to an agreement is laughable.they know exactly what they're sending these poor people back to.

question_title: was there a amercian army base in western victoria in approx 1930 to 1950? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I sure looked and could not find much.  There was a general hospital in the area for a while in WWII.  \n\nIn the 30's the U. S. Army did not have a pot to piss in.  I doubt that they had any presence in Australia to speak of.  It is possible that after WWII some bases stayed open to the 50's, but I don't see any indication.  \n\nAs the war progressed heading towards the Japanese mainland, U.S. units transitioned out of Australia and moved north.\n\nI hope someone has better luck.

question_title: lady feeling violated? [SEP] question_content: lady I take care of came home to her house open.  Thinking that her house was broken into found out by neighbor that the police were called to her residence by the agency that I work for because she didn't answer her door.  The police in this Illinois town had neighbor crawl through his crawlspace into her garage to open door in meantime, broke some expensive things she had boxed in her garage when getting in.  Anyways, police entered her home finding out that she wasn't there.  Then when leaving, neighbor asked if he should lock her house back up and they said no.  She felt so violated and went to the town hall for the report to file a complaint and no report was filled out.  This act was comitted by the Chief of police and is the one who didn't file the report.  How can she get piece of mind about this. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know why they wouldn't relock the door, but since the police received a call about her well being, they were in the right to enter on the premises of that fact alone.\n\nPolice officers are allowed to enter if they believe that there is an emergency, which in this case, they were told by an authoritave agency that she was not answering and that there was concern for her welfare. \n\nI am sorry that this woman received damage and now feels less secure about this, but she will hopefully realize that the police were acting out of concern for her welfare and did not mean any harm. It is good that someone is looking out for her best interest; I think it shows that there are still people who care for others. \n\nSorry to hear about her damages, but at least she is alright.

question_title: Where was the kingdom of Timbuktu and did it affect Europe? How did it affect Italians, Portueguese, spanish? [SEP] question_content: State it if is a fact that the kingdom was centred in Mali and that Italians, Spanish and Portuguese are decendents of intermarriages between black africans and europeans.  State when the kingdom started and ended, and what ended it. [SEP] best_answer: The Mandé peoples settled the Sahel (including present-day Mali), and formed a succession of Sahelian kingdoms, including the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, and the Songhai Empire. Timbuktu was a key city in these empires as an outpost for trans-Saharan trade and a center for scholarship. The Songhai Empire declined under a Moroccan invasion in 1591.\n\nTimbuktu had the first university - as such it was a place of learning.\n\nIn terms of its effect on Europe, in later years, Mali like the other West African countries were affected by the slave trade and later conquered by the European powers between 1880-1900.\n\nMali was invaded by France starting in 1880, which annexed it as an overseas department of France. The colony, which at times also included neighbouring countries, was known as French Sudan or the Sudanese Republic. In early 1959, the union of Mali and Senegal became the Mali Federation, which gained independence from France on June 20, 1960. Senegal withdrew from the Mali Federation after a few months. The Republic of Mali, under Modibo Keïta, withdrew from the French Community on September 22, 1960.	Politics & Government

I don't have the reference for that though, I'll have to look it up.\n\nI look at it thins way, it probably was justified if you believe that war is a contest between enemy populations, and not just between militaries.

I say they should tatoo the crime across the forehead or across the cheeks of the offender.  Noone would ever accidently let their kids play near the guy with "Pedophile" stamped on his cheeks. [SEP] best_answer: Certainly not! It is the responsibility of parents to know where their children are and with whom. To deprive people of the ability to earn a living after conviction for ANY crime is not in the interest of justice or of society as a whole.\nThe way our laws are currently written, a 22 year old guy who loses his head over a perfectly willing and experienced 17 year old girl is catagorized right alongside the monsters who get their jollies with actual children. It would not be right.\nBesides which, any offender with the money could just go to a doctor and have it removed, or get it covered with another tattoo...and don't think there are not doctors right here in the States that would do it.

question_title: Am I an American citizen? [SEP] question_content: My grandparents were Irish US citizens but moved back to Ireland so my parents and I are Irish. Am I entitled to citizenship through them? [SEP] best_answer: It's a little more complicated than that.  Your parents may qualify for us citizenship through the blood of your grandparents.  however, you may not if your parents never lived in the u.s. prior to your birth.  When you say your grandparents are you referring to both your maternal and paternal grandparents?  It's a complicated issue.  A lot of questions need to be answered first. best thing to do is have your parents apply for the u.s. citizenship.  See if they can apply for you to derive citizenship for you.  If they cannot they should be able to immigrate you to the u.s. as a lawful permanent resident.  after that you may qualify on your own merits after 5 years.  you should speak to the u.s. consulate citizenship services division.  they will have the answers that you need.  you may or may not be.  there just isn't enough information provided by you to decide.

question_title: Should graduation be made compulsory for entering parliament? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Definately not.  \n\nWhile I'm not one to promote dropping out of school, many, many good people have succeeded very well without completing their education.  There are many good people who would be wonderful advocates for the people who dropped out of school and spent years and years running their own business.  These people are certainly bright enough and experienced enough to contribute to the democratic process, are they not? \n\nRemember that a diploma is ONLY a piece of paper.  It's a piece of paper that says you completed school--which is a good thing--but says nothing further about your qualifications.  Frankly, these days anybody who wants to can complete school.  It says nothing about what classes you took, how well you did, or what you actually know.  It's just a piece of paper.  \n\nDemocracy suffers if anybody is locked out.	Politics & Government

However, there is a separate code section for sellers of travel (http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&group=01001-02000&file=1688-1693), which might apply to your case.\n\nThe problem is that if the vendor refuses to return your money, then your only recourse for the amount of money to cover a weekend stay and car, is likely small claims court.\n\nThere's no legal means to force the vendor to return your money without obtaining a judgment from the court.

question_title: should a women be president?? please answer? [SEP] question_content: please answer....... [SEP] best_answer: It's not a matter of "should a woman be president." It's not important that we elect a woman, so that we can finally say we did it. What needs to happen is to elect the most effective leader, whether it is a man or a woman. That's not so easy to do. Usually, instead of a leader, we get a politician. A politician is someone who cuts deals, trades influence, and always if it will benefit him or her. That makes politicians self-serving. A leader is someone who does the right thing for the country, whether it is good for him or her personally or not. We haven't had one of those in a long time. Harry Truman 60 years ago. Or maybe John Kennedy 45 years ago.	Politics & Government

I would just like to have a discussion on why I see so many Democrats assert that Republicans are always rich and/or are only concerned about tax breaks for rich people.  I for one would still vote for and appreciate more tax breaks for middle class. [SEP] best_answer: Republicans  have historically been a wealthier contingent of voters because of one simple reason: graduated tax.\n\nThink about it, let's say that Bill Gates is going through the grocery store line behind you.  You pay $1.50 for a loaf of bread.  When they ring his up, they say, "For you Mr. Gates, that will be $1,500."\n\nMost people would say that isn't fair. Just because someone can afford to pay a certain amount, they shouldn't have to. Everyone uses the same postal system, Army, legal system, etc. Rich people shouldn't have to pay more.\n\nDemocrats, conversely, believe that rich people should pay more to support the poorer people to create a more socialist society.\n\nI do believe that if you have money to help other people, you should, government shouldn't force you to donate to programs you don't believe in.\n\nI hope that helps--Read "Atlas Shrugged."

question_title: Do police officers have the right to breathalize passengers if the driver blows .00? [SEP] question_content: And the passengers aren't outrageously drunk. [SEP] best_answer: A police officer has the legal right to breathalyze anyone he or she suspects of having used alcohol. A passenger, not driver - passenger, in a car can be charged with public intoxication if they are over the legal blood alcohol limit. Unfortunately, there are police officers in Texas who are now going INSIDE bars to breathalyze people and giving public intoxication tickets, even if they did not drive to the bar, and are not driving home. Fortunately, the vast majority of cops will not give a ticket someone riding in a car drunk, if the driver is sober. Usually this will only happen if the intoxicated person is belligerent or aggressive, and disrupting the safety and process of the traffic stop.\nAlso, if the passenger is underage, ANY trace of alcohol will result in at least a ticket for minor consumption. If under 18 years of age, each state has different laws concerning minors.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: Not only is it a possibility it is very likely. The US employees Intelligence Tatics (CIA, and secret military units) overseas. These units live in the country as nationals, speak the language, have a job and so on. They are there in case they ever needed and would be the preemptive strike in the event of war with that country. This is fact that these units are there, not conspiracy theory.\nWould not be easier in the US for people of another country to do the same thing? I mean in American we preach diversity, we teach foreign child in their own language at our tax payers expense. We embrace multi-culturism and acceptance. Would it not be easy for a Muslim terrorist group to form within a government protected Muslim church? \nI am not saying that all Muslims are terrorist, but with our acceptance of diverse cultures and the lack of assimilation that is desired by many Americans, the extreme Muslims who are terrorist could come to American and fit in quite nicely.

Is it legal? \n\nRestricted to a designated area means: All package deal students are only allowed in house number "this" to "that", all grouped in a small area. They are not allowed in other areas even if they requested for it or opting to pay extra. In addition to that, all the rooms in different areas has the same rental price. The rooms allocated to these students are among the smallest and least well maintained. [SEP] best_answer: Private Schools and public universities have different rules.  Private schools like private clubs can, for the most part, do almost anything they want.  State universities that accept tax-payer money have quiet strict equality rules.  The second Thing wrong with your argument is the housing is not based on race.  It is based on nationality.  Granted that if the country of origin was China most of the respondents would be Asian but a British person from Hong Kong would qualify.  The same would go for Africa.  Some of the respondents could be white South Africans.  Changing you dormitory after admission in always based on availability.  You will be able to change dorns next semester but take my advice.  Who cares.  The cheaper the better.  After you graduate move into a mansion and your student loans will be less.	Politics & Government

question_title: Americans:  Should gay marriage be allowed or forbidden?  Dont forget....? [SEP] question_content: that this is a country build and based on freedom, and dont forget that there is a seperation of state and church.  What do you think after thinking about all of the aspects that this country is based on? [SEP] best_answer: With the separation of church and state, can the government even legislate what marriage is??  "Marriage" is a religious ceremony to unite 2 people.\n\nIf the government wants to have marriage be a lawful union, then they have to come up with an unbias reason (not based in religious belief) that gays should not marry.  Because it is stated to be wrong in the bible will not fly in a court of law.  Anytime that someone tries to pass a law about marriage being between a man and a woman, it gets struck down as unconstitutional because lawmakers can't come up with a good enough reason other than it's in the bible.  Thank God that someone can still look at the law without pulling the bible into the mix.\n\nI seriously think that no one ever expects the law to pass, and it is only done to make "friends" with the "moral majority".  If the Christian Right is happy, the funds keep going into the reelection accounts.  They can say "well, we tried".	Politics & Government

question_title: what is sun? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Our SUN is a normal main-sequence G2 star, one of more than 100 billion stars in our galaxy. \n\n        diameter:    1,390,000 km.\n        mass:        1.989e30 kg\n        temperature: 5800 K (surface)\n                     15,600,000 K (core)\n\nThe SUN is by far the largest object in the solar system. It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System (Jupiter contains most of the rest). \n\nIt is often said that the Sun is an "ordinary" star. That's true in the sense that there are many others similar to it. But there are many more smaller stars than larger ones; the Sun is in the top 10% by mass. The median size of stars in our galaxy is probably less than half the mass of the Sun. \n\nThe Sun is personified in many mythologies: the Greeks called it Helios and the Romans called it Sol. \n\nThe Sun is, at present, about 70% hydrogen and 28% helium by mass everything else ("metals") amounts to less than 2%. This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core. \n\nThe outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation: at the equator the surface rotates once every 25.4 days; near the poles it's as much as 36 days. This odd behavior is due to the fact that the Sun is not a solid body like the Earth. Similar effects are seen in the gas planets. The differential rotation extends considerably down into the interior of the Sun but the core of the Sun rotates as a solid body.\n\nThere are nine planets and a large number of smaller objects orbiting the Sun. (Exactly which bodies should be classified as planets and which as "smaller objects" has been the source of some controversy, but in the end it is really only a matter of definition.) \n\n          Distance  Radius  Mass\nPlanet    (000 km)   (km)   (kg)   Discoverer   Date\n-------- --------  ------  -------  ----------  -----\nMercury     57,910    2439  3.30e23\nVenus      108,200    6052  4.87e24\nEarth      149,600    6378  5.98e24\nMars       227,940    3397  6.42e23\nJupiter    778,330   71492  1.90e27\nSaturn   1,426,940   60268  5.69e26\nUranus   2,870,990   25559  8.69e25   Herschel    1781\nNeptune  4,497,070   24764  1.02e26   Galle       1846\nPluto    5,913,520    1160  1.31e22   Tombaugh    1930	Science & Mathematics

question_title: If time is the measurement of change...? [SEP] question_content: Can someone tell me what exactly is changing? I mean, is the change thats being measured simply entropy? And if thats the case couldnt you say that time is the measurement of entropy or does that leave out some other change that Im not aware of? [SEP] best_answer: With advances in relativity, quantum mechanics and microscopy, time is actually currently defined as measuring the number of vibrations of a cesium atom.\n\nSince this motion slows down as you approach the speed of light, it could be said that we are measuring how much matter/energy has slowed down from the speed of light since the big bang...\n\nSince entropy is defined as, "the amount of energy that cannot be used to do work," measuring how long it has been since the big bang is not QUITE the same as measuring the amount of energy that cannot be used to do work.\n\nFor example, entropy itself has changes as our technology has progressed - we are now able to utilize a larger percentage of wind and solar energy than ever before in history, which necessarily means that the rate that entropy is increasing has slowed.  There is no reason to believe this will not be the case in other areas, such as nuclear fusion (which powers stars) or even tapping the vast vaccuum energy that is omniprescent throughout space.\n\n:)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is current? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Current is defined as the movement of charge  -- which can either be from the movement of electrons, or the movement of ions in solution.  For metals (and circuits), current is produced when electrons move through the metal.  In water, you can have ions (like Na+ and Cl-) which move in the solution.  The key point is that charge has to MOVE for you to have current.  \n\nFrom a Physics point of view, if the amount of charge is 'Q', then current is defined as 'i = dQ/dt'  where 'i' is current, and dQ/dT denotes the "change in current as a funtion of a change in time."

question_title: Is carbon dating appropriate for measuring the age of materials that are a few years old? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No. Radiocarbon dating relys on Carbon 14 which has a half-life of 5730±40 years. Most answers for carbon dating give a range of 100-200 years over when a sample might be from.\n\nIn addition to the half-life, you also need to know something about where the carbon in the sample came from, because different sources have different starting amounts of C14. \n\nThis means that carbon dating something modern would tell you it was made in the last 100 years. You could probably get a better estimate of the age, just by looking at it.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: A curve in a highway has a radius of 120m and is banked at 2.50 degrees.? [SEP] question_content: On an icy road, what is the safest speed to around the curve [SEP] best_answer: To stay on the road with no slip the vector of total force on a car F must be strictly normal to the bank with b=2.5 degrees. Vector F=Fx+Fy, Fy=m*g being the weight of the car, Fx=m*a=m*r*w^2 is centripetal force on the curve of r=120m, w=v/r is angular speed, v is linear speed, a=r*w^2 is centripetal acceleration. On the other hand as Fx=F*sin(b) & Fy=F*cos(b) or Fx/Fy=tg(b) or [m*r*(v/r)^2]/[m*g]=tg(b), hence v=sqrt(g*tg(b)*r)=7.17m/s=25.81 km/h. Hi to SS!	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: The concept of a time machine could exist, but it would take an almost infinite amount of energy.  The only way it could work is exactly the way you are asking,  You can only move forward in time, just at different rates.  So if you want to see the future then time would need to slow down for you and the world would have to speed up.  After a while you could return to earth and it would be the future.  \nFrom what is presently known about physics you can only move forward in time only at different rates from an observers point of view.

question_title: How would your kidneys maintain the water and mineral balance of your blood on...? [SEP] question_content: a) a cool day when you stayed inside and drank lots of tea?\nor\nb) a hot sports day when you ran three races and had forgotten your water bottle?\n\nplease help! [SEP] best_answer: The kidneys are always trying to maintain homeostasis - keeping the water to mineral ratio in your blood constant.\n\nIf you stayed inside and drank lots of tea, you will have a big increase in water in your blood, while the amount of minerals stays the same. Your kidneys would then remove lots of water from your blood and keep the minerals, to return the concentration of minerals back to normal. (You'll urinate a lot)\n\nIf you used up a lot of your body's water by sweating and then not replenishing it, the mineral concentration would be much higher. The kidneys will try to return the concentration back to normal by letting out a lot of minerals but not a lot of water (You won't urinate as much, and when you do, it will be very concentrated)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can anyone explain the different types of time paradoxes? [SEP] question_content: Are there more than just simple causality? [SEP] best_answer: 1) You can't change a past event, that's nescessary for you to be able to change that past event. (You can't kill your distant ancestor)\n2) You can't go experience a future event, that requires someone from that future event to change your present event. (In the 'Planet of the Apes' movie series, Caesar went back to his past, and started an ape rebelion that built the world that Charleton Heston visited when he went into his future)\n\nBut how would you know? Changing the past or the future might create a tangent universe, that we can't experience.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what creates a black hole? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When a star runs out of fuel, it explodes its outer layer off in a Nova, while the core collapses inwards. Because the continual fusion reaction has stopped, there's nothing to stop the collapse until all of the residual matter presses against each other. This is called a Brown Dwarf.\nIf the star is much larger than our Sun, gravity is so strong that even the matter collapses until the atoms' neucleii press against each other. This is called a Neutron Star.\nIf the star is still larger, not even the neutrons stop the collapse, and gravity causes the whole lot to collapse to a pinpoint. The gravity is still there, sucking in everything around it, even light. This is called a Black Hole.	Science & Mathematics

Since we use sulfuric acid we also add 8 sulfat-ions on both sides and hereby can neutralize the product side:\n\n2 K2Cr2O7 + 8 H2SO4 + 3 CH3CH2OH  =\n                         2 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2 K2SO4 + 3 CH3COOH\n\n3) STOCHIOMETRIC BALANCE OF THE ELEMENTS H and O\n\nTaking into consideration that unused protons finally end up as water, we add on the right side 11 H2O and hereby is also reached the balance of oxigen:\n\n2 K2Cr2O7 + 8 H2SO4 + 3 CH3CH2OH  =\n                  2 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2 K2SO4 + 3 CH3COOH + 11 H2O\n\nSo now good luck for counting the atoms!

question_title: Compare and contrast index refraction and optical density? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The refractive index of a material is the ratio of the velocity of light in free space to that in the material.\n\nThe speed of light in free space is the maximum value. Therefore the speed of light in any medium is always less than that of the speed of light in free space.\n\nTherefore refractive index of any material is always greater than one.\n\nIn a given material the refractive index changes for change of frequency of the light wave. The refractive index of violet (High frequency) light will be more than that of red (Low frequency) light.\n\nThe refractive index of a material is greater implies that the speed of light in it will be less. We call this material as optically denser than the material for which the refractive index is less. \n\nFor the same material the density varies with temperature and generally when the density increases the refractive index also increases.

question_title: Are, Say, Giraffes More Evolved Than, Say, Squid or Amoebas? [SEP] question_content: Are some organisms more "advanced" than others? [SEP] best_answer: You are asking two very different questions here, and I will address each seperately.\n\n"Are, Say, Giraffes More Evolved Than, Say, Squid or Amoebas?"\n\nNo. All life currently on Earth has had ancestors evolving for the same length of time, as all life shares a common ancestor. You might argue that the more generations something has been evolving, the more 'evolved' it is, in which case, bacteria like E. Coli are the most evolved. I consider generation length to be a function of evolutionary adaptation, so I would say that between two organisms which are alive at the same time, neither is more evolved than the other.\n\nAs for your second question,\n"Are some organisms more "advanced" than others?"\n\nSure. It all depends on what you mean by "advanced". Eukaryotes are certainly more complex than prokaryotes, for example, so if you defined "advancement" as "number of cells", then blue whales are probably the most advanced organisms. If you define "advancement" by the number of cell types, well, I have no idea what's the most advanced, but it might be "mammals" or something; regardless, it's probably a pretty big group.

question_title: Why do mirrors only reverse things horizontally? [SEP] question_content: even if you've only got one eye open. [SEP] best_answer: Mirrors don't actually reverse anything.  When you face someone or something, they have to turn around so that you can see them.  A mirror doesn't have this limitation.  You can see something without turning around to do it.  Of course, this is backwards from what you usually see.  In order to see the front of something, you could turn it around vertically instead of horizontally.  In that case, you could maintain left and right, but you would be confused up and down.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: As stated in the "omit" version of this question...\n\nKangaroo rats do urinate, as it is necessary in order to remove nitrates from the body. But they conserve water as a result of being adapted to desert climates, where water is scarce. Thus urine is excreted, but is very concentrated, containing only enough water so that it is able to drain out, thus keeping the body from dehydrating.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Who names tropical Cyclones? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hurricane Names: from the FEMA kids website\n\nAll hurricanes are given names. Why is that? To help us identify storms and track them as they move across the ocean. Remember, there can be more than one hurricane at a time and without naming them, we could get confused and which storm we're talking about.\n\nFor hundreds of years, hurricanes in the West Indies were named after the particular saint's day on which the hurricane occurred. An Australian meteorologist began giving women's names to tropical storms before the end of the 19th century. In 1953, the U.S. National Weather Service, which is the federal agency that tracks hurricanes and issues warnings and watches, began using female names for storms. \n\nIn 1979, both women and men's names were used. One name for each letter of the alphabet is selected, except for Q, U and Z. For Atlantic Ocean hurricanes, the names may be French, Spanish or English, since these are the major languages bordering the Atlantic Ocean where the storm occur. \n\nSo who decides what names are used each year? The World Meteorological Organization uses six lists in rotation. The same lists are reused every six years. The only time a new name is added is if a hurricane is very deadly or costly. Then the name is retired and a new name is chosen.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why do people often feel fatigued before they are diagnosed with diabetes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Diabetes occurs when the body's insulin production is impaired in some way.  When there is insufficient insulin in the body, the complex sugars in our food cannot be broken down into glucose for use by our cells.  Ironically enough, this leads to a situation where the blood has excess sugar but the cells are starved of glucose.  Since glucose is required for many cellular functions and to provide energy, the depletion of cellular glucose ultimately leads to a feeling of fatigue.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: why does magnetic field is produced when current pass through a conductor ? [SEP] question_content: Actually how dose the energy convertion takes place ? [SEP] best_answer: I'm sorry, but the previous answer was very misleading.  First of all, an electron's spin does not give it its charge.  After all, neutrons spin yet they have zero electrical charge.  Its spin gives it a magnetic moment, which is subtly different from a magnetic field.\n\nA charged object such as an electron moving in any trajectory will create a magnetic field.  A charge moving in a helical path will create an approximation to a solenoidal magnetic field.  In current carrying wires, the electrons are moving collinearly with the electric field created due to the potential difference, i.e. in more or less a straight line.\n\nNow, why does the moving charge create the magnetic field in the first place?  A good way to explain it is with an example.\n\nSuppose you have 2 protons (+ charge) placed close to each other, the pair initially being stationary with respect to you.  You know what would happen right?  They would drift apart, repelled by their like positive charges.\n\nNow picture yourself running very fast, past those two protons.  If you run fast enough, the relativistic time dilation will make it appear, from your perspective, that the protons are drifting apart more slowly... as if some force is holding them back.  If you consider that you running very fast with respect to the protons is the same as the protons moving very fast with respect to you, you can see that the two moving charges are having an effect on each other which cannot be explained by their electric field strength alone.  This is what we call the magnetic field, essentially a relativistic distortion of the electric field due to time dilation.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why do we see upside down through raindrops? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: My vision isn't good enough to actually "look" through a raindrop, but I understand your question.  Raindrops are a lot like a lens.  In fact, a raindrop is a lens.  Every lens has a focal length based on its shape and material and when objects within the focal length, they are magnified.  Raindrops, however, have a very short focal length so anything you see through them will likely be beyond the focal length.  Objects beyond the focal length are not necessarily magnified, and in fact they are flipped.  It's much easier to understand with a ray tracing diagram.  I've provided a link to the slides my professor used in his optics lecture.  Slide 5 in particular should be of help.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the importance of the sun to the biological or physical processes? [SEP] question_content: I hope you will tell me the whole process. [SEP] best_answer: To add to Diamond's explanation, remember the food chain that you learned about in lower school?  Small animals eat plants.  Larger animals eat smaller animals and so on and so forth until the top of the food chain dies and decays back into the soil to be used in the growth of new plants.  But the plants need sunlight to live by way of photosynthesis.  And that light comes from the sun of course.\nSo in addition to the heating of the earth and being the engine that powers our weather (which distributes liquid water--another thing plants need--all over the planet) the sun also sustains the cycle of life and the food chain.

However, the seeds of angiosperms are surrounded by the wall of the ovary of the flower which forms the fruit, whereas gymnosperms do not possess this structure. Their seeds are described as naked (Gymnosperm from the Greek: gymnos - naked, sperm - seed). Botanists place the angiosperms in the group (division) Angiophyta but the Gymnosperms do not form a coherent group and are separated into four divisions.\n(from http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/ecotree/gymangio.htm)\n\nI don't really see the wall of the ovary as one of the choices you offer.

question_title: what is Sudoku Puzzle?and how can i solve it?pls? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Sudoku also known as Number Place, is a logic-based placement puzzle. The aim of the puzzle is to enter a numerical digit from 1 through 9 in each cell of a 9×9 grid made up of 3×3 subgrids (called "regions"), starting with various digits given in some cells (the "givens"). Each row, column, and region must contain only one instance of each numeral. Completing the puzzle requires patience and logical ability. Although first published in a U.S. puzzle magazine in 1979, Sudoku initially caught on in Japan in 1986 and attained international popularity in 2005.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Do skunks hibernate for the winter,and do they eat meat or plants? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Skunks is different from other animals and they do not hibernate but become temporarily dormant during severe winter season. Which means, they don't sleep throughout the winter season. They come out when they can handle the cold.\n\nSkunks are omnivores. They feed on various insects and grubs (grasshoppers, beetles, bee larvae), small mammals, the eggs of ground-nesting birds and amphibians. Skunks are especially fond of spiders, snails, ants, wasps, and crayfish. For the whole year, they eat fruits and berries: cherries, raspberries, strawberries, apples and pears.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Patterns of seismic activity along a fault line.\n\nScientists set up seismographs to measure this activity. Movement along faultlines is not uncommon. But we do not usually feel it b/c it is not strong enough. They, however, can detect these slight movements w/ their sensitive equipment.\n\nThere are some other signs as well. An increase in geologic activity near a faultline can give clues. Uplifting of land is one. Increases in geothermal activity may be another.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Will we ever be able to go F.T.L.? [SEP] question_content: i know there are a lot of doubts about this because the energy required would be close to infinite, and opening up a wormhole would also be next to impossible, even in the next 200 years of scientific advancement.  But, are there any scientific optimist out there who truly believes that we'll be able to achieve FTL in the next century or so, and why?  Give some minor facts to back up your claim. [SEP] best_answer: There is a big difference between predictions that the speed of sound could not be broken and that the speed of light cannot. It was always known that *some* things can go faster than sound. Bullets for example. The question was whether we would have the technology to get people to that speed.\n\nThe speed of light is very different since we haven't seen *anything* go faster than light in a vacuum. Nothing. Ever. Furthermore, the predictions of special relativity have been verified in particle accelerators when the particles are going to within a hundred thousandth of the speed of light.\n\nAs an example, at Fermilab protons are accelerated to energies of 2TeV. This is over 2000 times the rest mass of those protons. To accelerate something the mass of a *gram* to an equivalent speed would take about the energy of the largest hydrogen bomb ever exploded. This amount of energy would be needed for each gram to get to that speed, so multiply it by 75000 for a medium sized human. And that doesn't count the spaceship they would have to travel in!\n\nNow, this is how much energy is needed to get to speed we *know* about. To go faster would require even more. Unfortunately, we have never seen a wormhole of any type. But the predictions are that the energy requirements would be even more prohibitive than what I just described.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What about AI-artificial intelligence & Robots and Jobs? Dr Loebner: "I want to see total unemployment" [SEP] question_content: http://loebner.net/Prizef/In-response.html\n\nHe says,\n\n``2. Related to my desire to develop the Turing Test was my desire to advance AI. I have, since adolescence, been interested in the field. When I was in high school, I thought that computers and robots should do all work. I called this philosophy "automated parasitism." I was told this was impossible. To build a computer as complex as the human brain would require a computer as large as the Empire State Building, and it would require all the water of Niagara Falls to cool. Today, I remain an unrepentant utopian. I want to see total unemployment. That, for me, is the ultimate goal of AI and automation. (The problem is to design a society that can equitably distribute the fruits of automation among its members.)``\n\n......I can live off fruit any day! :D [SEP] best_answer: AI and robots, etc. would be a boon to society if they could accomplish all the jobs that ordinary people do not want to do or are too dangerous to do.  There will always remain jobs that people like to do such as compose music.  Also many people would have to "manage" the robots to accomplish what is useful to society.  You would have to manage your own personal robot.  A person relieved of all responsibilities for work (in Utopia?) could devote their entire life to learning; but would they study so hard if there were no useful applications for their knowledge because robots cared for all needs?  People also have emotional needs and it is hard to imagine that a robot could substitute for a loving spouse or the family dog.  Those are "jobs" too.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is it possible to have a reverse fold in a flat die cut corrugated cardboard box insert? [SEP] question_content: I'm designing a box insert from C-flute corrugated cardboard. I want to make a suspended sunken platform and the design I have come up with requires 2 normal folds and 2 reverse folds. The firm doing the die cutting tell me that folds can only go one way when using flat die cutting machinery. This totally screws up my design so i'm wondering if a reverse fold can be made anyway or if there is a way to cut the board such that a reverse fold is enabled. e.g. cutting each end of the fold line, aligning the fold line parrallel to the corrugations or punching slots through the fold line. [SEP] best_answer: eh?	Science & Mathematics
question_title: how is a stapler assembled ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would suggest that you select a particular stapler that you are interested in and "reverse engineer" it in your mind.  Does it use threaded fasteners or permanent rivets?  Imagine the riveting process being reversed (like playing a film backwards).  For example, if your stapler has a plastic piece where you press down on it, would it be easier to add that piece to all the staplers in production before assembling the entire stapler?  Try to identify the sub-assemblies (like the plastic piece) to determine the order in which the entire stapler is assembled from many parts.  Sometimes the order is mandatory and irreversible and sometimes it is arbitrary.  You could perform a similar process to figure out how an entire automobile is assembled and the entire motor would be a sub-assembly in itself.  Good luck.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: If 1 mole of tryptophan can react to produce 1 mole of serotonin, how much serotonin would you produce if...? [SEP] question_content: If 1 mole of tryptophan can react to produce 1 mole of serotonin, how much serotonin would you produce if you ate an entire 11 pound turkey? \n\nThere is...\n\n15400mg of tryptophan in 11 lbs turkey (1 lb of turkey contains aprox. 1400mb of tryptophan).\n\nTryptophan (C11H12N2 O2) = 204.23g/mol.\nSerotonin (C10H12N2 O) = 176.22g/mol.\n\nSo, I'm confused... how do i do this? [SEP] best_answer: 204.23g of Tryptophan is one mole.  Hence by proportion you can find how many moles is made with 15400mg or 15.4g by: 15.4/204.23.\n\nThis number of moles of Tryptophan produced is also equal to the number of moles of serotonin produced.  As one mole of serotonin is contained in 176.22g, you can find the mass of serotonin formed by: 176.22*number of moles of serotonin.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Physics in Action!!!!! need help on these 3 three questions.? [SEP] question_content: question 1:  Why would it be beneficial for a bicycle to have a low center of mass when the rider rounds a turn?\n\n\n\n\nquestion 2:  A bicycle designer recently modified a bicycle by adding cylindrical weights to the spokes of the wheels.  He reasoned that this would make the mass of the wheel, on average, closer to the axle, in turn making the moment of inertia smaller and the wheel easier to rotate.  Where did he go wrong?\n\n\n\n\nquestion 3:  The front wheel of a penny-farthing bicyle is three times larger than the rear wheel.  How much more massive must the rear wheel be to have the same moment of inertia as the front wheel? [SEP] best_answer: 1) has been done above; I agree.\n\n2) The CoM of the wheel is already at the axis.  Adding mass will only increase the moment of intertia; only rearranging the existing mass there could potentially reduce it.\n\n3) For a wheel, the moment of interia is proportional to r squared.  So if the big wheel has 3 times the radius, the small should have 9 times the mass.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Do people lose their senses of smell and taste as they age? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: All sensory nerves start to diminish with age.  This is why you will find elderly people in a heavy sweater when it is 80 degrees out side.  They lose that sense of feeling warm and cold.  \nAlso part of this is due to the surface skin becoming (aplastic) a condition where it is dried out and very thin.  This reduces the sensory perception as well.\nAs far as the other nerves, I am certain that when your body start to degenerate from the aging process they all are effected.  But this was an easy example to give to you.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the reason to put stone pieces (metal) under and around the railway lines.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Track ballast, consisting of gravel, cinders or other aggregate, forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties are laid. It is used to facilitate drainage of water, and to create an even running surface. This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. Such a track is also used to bring the Space Shuttle to its launching pad.\nIn the early days of railroads, much material for ballast came from rock found in the local area. In the Midwest, for example, much use was made of granite, while states in the southeast, such as Florida, made use of limestone. One specific type of granite used in the Midwest earned the name "Pink Lady" due to its color; in other areas, the ballast can be a mix of light and dark colors called "Salt and Pepper".

question_title: Determine the domain, intercepts, asymptotes, critical and inflection points of the graph:     y=lnx/x? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Domain:  All the values of x that provides a defined value of y.  In the equation above if we plug 0 or less than 0 for x, we get an undefined answer.  Thus the domain is x>0.  \n\nIntercepts:  To find intercepts we plug y equal to zero and then solve for x.  So, lnx/x = 0\n                          lnx = 0\n                             x = 1\nThus the intercept point is (x,y) = (1, 0)\n\nAsymptotes:  An asymptote is a straight or curved line which a curve will approach, but never touch.  By looking at the graph of lnx/x, we can conclude that the graph approaches y = 0 but never actually touches 0.  So, the asymptotes is y = 0.  \n\nCritical point:  In mathematics, a critical point (or critical number) is a point on the domain of a function where the derivative is equal to zero. It is also called a stationary point.  Derivative of above function is: \n                        dy/dx = [(x)(1/x)-lnx](x^2)\n                           0 = (1-lnx)/(x^2)\n                           0 = 1-lnx\n                           1 = lnx\n                            x = e\nSo, the critical point is x = e.

[SEP] best_answer: no, you cant.\n\nU cant even test the pH for alcohol even if it is slightly acidic compared to other organic compounds, because it's a weaker acid than water. Alcohol can dissolve in aqueous soln; they dont ionize but form network of hydrogen bonds with water molecules.\n\nIn aqueous solution, no matter how basic it is, (let's say 14, that's the best u can do) alcohol will not lose an hydrogen atom 'cause its conjugate base is a stronger base than hydroxide ions (strongest base in aqueous soln). pKa for water is 15, alcohol is 16-18.

question_title: what are the things required to prepare an aquarium & how to maintain it? [SEP] question_content: pl tell me the fishes that are to be used & how to maintain them. [SEP] best_answer: The water first needs to be dechlorinared if using tap-water, use products sold at pet shops.  An aquarium needs to be cycling efficiently before it can support fish properly; bacteria that converts harmful nitrogenous waste (ammonia) into less harmfull stuff (nitrate) need to build up in the water, plants and substrate.  This bacteria may already be in the tank, but you can ensure it is by getting a plant, filter medium or substrate from a well established aquarium or buying commercialy products from your pet store.\nFirst you need to buy a few hardy fish, the number depending on the size of your tank. Platys and zebra danios are able to withstand a cycling tank and are ideal.\nThe fish will produce ammonia, this ammonia will build up and is very toxic, as levels of ammonia increase bacteria capable of converting ammonia into nitrite will build up. Nitrite is less deadly but levels of nitrite will increase until bacteria populations capable of converting nitrite into nitrate which is far less toxic ( you will still nedd to carry out weekly 10% water changes, using dechlorinated water, to ensure levels of nitrate don't get too high). After a number of weeks the tank will be able to cycle the waste of your fish from ammonia to nitrate, increase numbers of fish slowly, only 2-3 at a time.\nbuy test kits from your pet shop so you can monitor the various levels. \nBe patient, test your water, add few fish at a time and you'll soon have a healthy aquarium.

question_title: Suppose you were given $10,000, what would you do with it? [SEP] question_content: Would you do a good deed with the money or just keep it to yourself?  explain why? [SEP] best_answer: With $10,000 I think I would take in foster children! As a single parent, who is going back to university to get a degree, I don't have much, my children are almost grown, and I feel that there is such a need to help out unfortunate children, in the city I live in, some foster children are being put up in hotels, many kids in one room, now what kind of life is that, oh I realize, hey that's better than being on the streets, but really, how is this going to help this child to understand the love and safety that a family provides. Children need love, understanding, values and morals, how are these taught in a hotel room? I would use the money to set up bedrooms, use the money to help my foster children to play organized sports, take music lessons, and to just enjoy being a child!	Society & Culture
question_title: God is a Spirit? [SEP] question_content: We're all familiar with the Bible verse which says "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worhsip him in spirit and in truth."\n\n But, in Genesis I've found something a bit different.\nGenesis 18:1-4\nAnd the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre; and he sat\nin the tent door in the heat of the day.\nAnd he lift up his eyes and looked and lo, three men stood by him\nand when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and\nbowed himself before the ground\nand said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass\nnot away I pray thee from thy servant.\nLet a little water, I pray you, be fetched and wash your feet and\nrest yourseleves under tree.\n\nIt seems that not only did Abraham SEE God here, but he also thought\nhe was physical enough for his feet to be washed with water.\n\nAnd...in the first verse I mentioned it says God is a Spirit, with a capital S.  Doesn't that mean the Holy Ghost is God?  \n\nSo God is physical yes? [SEP] best_answer: A person needs to read this passage very carefully, and it really helps to read it in the Hebrew. The three men are never actually identified as God. A number of Jewish rabbis have noticed the same thing. It is *first* said that Abraham was sitting in his tent and had a vision of God, *then* he opened his eyes and saw three men. While Moses's narative style sometimes has an overview of events, and then more details, it's hard to say if that's what's happening here or not. In fact, it's almost funny to read if you take the stance that these three were angels in the last half of Genesis, because it has Abraham speaking to the angel that remained behind, and calling him "Adoni" (Lord) but never YHVH. But the one to reply is always YHVY and never Adoni. Also, in Genesis 18:22, it says that the men Abraham was speaking with turned and left, but Abraham stayed and pleaded with the LORD.\n\nBut even if you take the stance that one, or even all three, of these "angels" were in fact God Almighty, there is nothing to keep God Almighty as a spirit from creating a body and animating it himself. St. Augustine gets into that kind of an idea  little bit in one of his 15 books on the Trinity, I don't remember which off the top of my head.	Society & Culture
question_title: What do Christians and non-christians think of Michael and Debbie Pearl? [SEP] question_content: http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/418676.html [SEP] best_answer: Why did you ask for advice about a couple, then post an article about someone who seems to have taken the Pearl's advice to dangerous extremes? This seems unfair.\n\nThe 'pipe' that the Pearl's recommend is soft, flexible plastic water tubing a little over 1/4" wide- almost the kind of tubing you use for aquariums and such- the article makes it sound like lead pipe or PVC plumbing pipe.\n\nI agree with some of the basics at their site, but overall, I am not a fan of the couple or the site. They seem to me to be fanatics in a bad sense of the word.\n\nOddly, it IS NOT their views on spanking or using what amounts to an updated version ofthe willow switch that bugs me the most- it is the commercialism, herbs, and ultra-conservative fundamentalist world-view.\n\nI believe that MILDLY painful stimuli is a powerful learning tool. You see it in real life all the time, and I think it has a role, properly applied, in child-raising. (I never used a switch (or other tool), and never had to do more than a single 'smack' with my 4 kids. Spanking should not be the only or primary tool in your child-rearing toolkit!)\n\nI am horrified at the couple in the article that put such faith in ANY human, then misapply the guy's teachings so grotesquely that death occured. This couple needs psychiatric attention- or if they are mentally OK, needs to be punished for their acts.\n\nThis seems like the blind leading the blind.	Society & Culture

Sorry to say I don't know Krk, but I do know the basics.\n\nI know how it feels when people don't know anything about your country. My partner is from New Zealand, and when we went to the states last year, people seemed to think it was a part of Australia. As it is, people seem to know nothing about us Aussies, which I thought was pretty bad. I can't imagine how frustrating it was being from Croatia and travelling a European country though!

[SEP] best_answer: Well, I beleive all woman have different veiws of a "Man" and what they should be made of.  I was raised to beleive that a man works hard to support his family and is head of his house hold but knows how to run the house hold not just by demanding respect but by giving it also.  You seem to be off to a pretty good start with being able to work hard to support yourself and possibly someone else you decide to be with.  Women like the idea of stability. . . if you can show a woman that you have this in your life now and that is just as important to you, then she will allow herself to trust you as a man instead of looking at you as someone she will have to work on and "Train" as some of us put it.  Have your own life in order and in such an order that bringing someone else into it will be a smooth transition.  It's about being prepared and letting the woman know that you are capable of handling things.  We all want to feel safe in our lives and it is your job as a MAN to fill that need.  Other wise we spend the rest of our lives running home to daddy because he is the one MAN in our life that we trust and feel safe with.  When you are ready to take on these roles woman will veiw you as a man.\n\nI hope that these few words will help you out.  Good Luck on your path to manhood!!	Society & Culture
question_title: I'm protestant - If I married a Catholic...?

(If so, how did you handle it?) [SEP] best_answer: If you want to get married in a catholic church, you will be given all kinds of "conditions" and have to jump through all kinds of hoops to satisfy the priest.  Even after you jump through all the hoops, he might refuse to let you actually walk up the aisle, you might have to stand at the back of the church and get married there.  And the priest also might look and see how much your fiance has donated, and if it is not enough, he might still might not do the ceremony until your fiance satisfies his greed.\n\nUpdate to david_in_mil...:  My brother was one of the people I know that went through it.  He and his wife did all the nonsense the priest demanded, then he told them he would not marry them because he looked at the ledger, and saw no donations from him or his wife.  When they explained that she did not like using envelopes and simply put the money in the collection basket, he said she had no proof, and until they met his price, no wedding.  They went to an Episcopal church and were married there - no nonsense, no problems.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why was the Union fighting at Gettysburg? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually, the Battle of Gettysburg was never supposed to happen.  It was a battle that accidentally occurred when branches of each army ran into each other.\n\nMore here:\n\nThe greatest battle of the Civil War almost wasn't.  It was not a planned attack; rather the Confederate General Lee had his troops on the move trying to threaten other northern cities.  However, Confederate and Union troops came together at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for three days of the most intense fighting to occur during our country's Civil War.\n\n     The geology of the area around Gettysburg was an important factor of the three days of battle.  A number of ridges that play key roles in the fighting run mostly north and south.  These ridges are diabase sills.   The area is made up of the Piedmont proper, the Triassic basins, the Blue Ridge of Virginia, and the Great Valley.\n\nhttp://www.scsc.k12.ar.us/2000backeast/Trip/Members/CopleyJ/	Society & Culture

question_title: Will Harriet Tubman go to Hell for being deceitful? [SEP] question_content: In case you don't know who she is remember the undergroud railroad. [SEP] best_answer: Harriet was a Christian believer. She honored God above any established law of the government. Just as the Apostles did in their day. \n\nRead this article:\n\nHarriet Tubman\nThe "Moses" of Her People\n\n\n"I always tole God, 'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'"\n\nIn 1831 a Kentucky slave named Tice Davids made a break for the free state of Ohio by swimming across the Ohio River. His master trailed close behind and watched Davids wade ashore. When he looked again, Davids was nowhere to be found. Davids's master returned to Kentucky in a rage, exclaiming to his friends that Davids "must have gone off on an underground road." The name stuck, and the legend of the underground railroad was born.\n\nIt was another two decades before the underground railroad became a part of the national consciousness, mostly because of the heroic exploits of the underground railroad's most celebrated "conductor."\n\nBlack Moses Harriet Tubman was raised in slavery in eastern Maryland but escaped in 1849. When she first reached the North, she said later, "I looked at my hands to see if I was de same person now I was free. Dere was such a glory ober eberything, de sun came like gold through de trees and ober de fields, and I felt like I was in heaven."\n\nTubman was not satisfied with her own freedom, however. She made 19 return trips to the South and helped deliver at least 300 fellow slaves, boasting "I never lost a passenger." Her guidance of so many to freedom earned her the nickname "Moses."\n\nTubman's friends and fellow abolitionists claimed that the source of her strength came from her faith in God as deliverer and protector of the weak. "I always tole God," she said, "'I'm gwine [going] to hole stiddy on you, an' you've got to see me through.'"\n\nThough infuriated slaveholders posted a $40,000 reward for her capture, she was never apprehended. "I can't die but once" became her motto, and with that philosophy she went about her mission of deliverance.\n\nShe always made her rescue attempts in winter but avoided actually going into plantations. Instead she waited for escaping slaves (to whom she had sent messages) to meet her eight or ten miles away. Slaves would leave plantations on Saturday nights so they wouldn't be missed until Monday morning, after the Sabbath. It would thus often be late on Monday afternoon before their owners would discover them missing. Only then did they post their reward signs, which men hired by Tubman would take down.\n\nBecause her rescue missions were fraught with danger, Tubman demanded strict obedience from her fugitives. A slave who returned to his master would likely be forced to reveal information that would compromise her mission. If a slave wanted to quit in the midst of a rescue, Tubman would hold a revolver to his head and ask him to reconsider.\n\nAsked whether she would actually kill a reluctant escapee, she replied, "Yes, if he was weak enough to give out, he'd be weak enough to betray us all and all who had helped us, and do you think I'd let so many die just for one coward man?"\n\nShe never had to shoot any slave she helped, but she did come close with one: "I told the boys to get their guns ready, and shoot him. They'd have done it in a minute; but when he heard that, he jumped right up and went on as well as anybody."\n\nTubman said she would listen carefully to the voice of God as she led slaves north, and she would only go where she felt God was leading her. Fellow abolitionist Thomas Garrett said of her, "I never met any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God."\n\nTubman became a friend of many of the best-known abolitionists and their sympathizers. John Brown referred to her in his letters as "one of the best and bravest 	Society & Culture

Once you have completed the entire program, all 30 lessons, get a dictionary in your target language and start from the very beginning of the program and look up all of the words you hear in the dictionary.

[SEP] best_answer: No,it doesn't.Because the Bible doesn't teach that heaven is home to everyone that is good.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 faithful men and women will be reigning in heaven as kings and priests with Christ because that is what the Bible teaches.(Rev.14:1-4)\nThe rest of obedient mankind has the hope of eternal life on earth.This was God's original plan for man.He created the earth for humans.He put the first human pair there,told them to multiply and fill the earth.They were created perfect and designed to live forever.If it wasn't for their rebellion and disobedience,they would still be alive today and we wouldn't all be suffering the effects of their disobedience.It is because of their sinning against Jehovah that they have passed onto all mankind imperfection,sin and death.\nIn God's due time,he will by means of Christ Jesus wage war against this wicked system and only righteous ones will survive.Then God's purpose will finally be fulfilled.The earth will be filled with righteous followers of Jehovah God.The earth will be restored to its original paradise conditions and man will be blessed with eternal life.\nThis is why Jehovah's Witnesses obey Jesus' command to 'go therefore and make disciples.....teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you'(Matt28:19,20),because by our obedience we hopefully will be part of that wonderful new righteous system with eternal blessings in store.\nPs.37:9-11,29;Pr.2:21;\nDan.2:44;Rev.21:3,4	Society & Culture

question_title: I am confused by the term, "resort dressy".? [SEP] question_content: I need to know for a business function coming up in a few days. \n\nI do know that "resort dressy" does not mean the same thing as "black tie". Therefore, I do know not to wear an evening gown as that would be considered "black tie" attire. \n\nWhat I need to know is, what does the term "resort dressy" mean in terms of the items one might pick to wear to such an event. \n\nThe event is a dinner/dance/award ceremony but is specified to be "resort dressy". So, should I take a nice sundress and sandals or dressy pants and a top? Or, is a cocktail dress more appropriate? [SEP] best_answer: Resort dressy means something you would wear on vacation to a resort but is fashionable.  You have to pick light fabrics (linen, cotton, rayon, light silk) and avoid the heavy ones (wool, velvet, etc). Your look has to be light and airy. Since you are going to an award dinner, your best bet will be light silk/rayon. Also avoid dark colors since they have no place in a resort.  The safest to wear will be a white airy dress which you can accessorize appropriately.	Society & Culture

question_title: When does someone says enough, after being taken for a fool.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How long it takes you to say 'enough is enough' depends on how much inner strength you have and how much self respect you have.  Hopefully you learn from experience and the next time things go wrong you can get out quicker with your self respect still in tact.  But some people never learn, and some are gluttons for punishment.\nA lot of this comes down to being needy and not having enough going on in your life, which leads you to become dependent on people and to allow them to mess you around.  If you are happy with your life and strong within yourself then you are less likely to invest your valuable time and emotions in people who take you for granted or don't deserve your energy.\nSome people won't cut away from a bad situation for fear of getting hurt or fear of being alone.  Once you realise that to be alone is nothing to fear, and that emotional pain eases with time, then you are not beholden to these fears anymore and you are better equipped to make the difficult decisions in life.\nI hope that everything works out well for you, whatever your troubles may be.  Take care... :)	Society & Culture

When my sister left, my mom took the turkey out of the oven, removed the stuffing, stuffed a Cornish hen, inserted it into the turkey, and re-stuffed the turkey. She then placed the bird(s) back in the oven. When it was time for dinner, my sister pulled the turkey out of the oven and proceeded to remove the stuffing. When her serving spoon hit something, she reached in and pulled out the little bird. With a look of total shock on her face, my mother exclaimed: "Patricia, you've cooked a pregnant bird!"

question_title: To all overweight Christians - I have a  question? [SEP] question_content: Before I start - please let me get it straight that I am in no way picking on anyones weight or appearance.  I understand that not all weight issues are from over eating.\n\nOk\n\nThe seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, are a classification of vices used in early Christian teachings to educate and protect followers from basic human instincts.\n\nOne of the 7 deadly sins is gluttony.\n\nIf you are overweight from practising gluttony (eating too much), then are you not going against the Christian teachings? [SEP] best_answer: I have fought sin for a long time, everyone does, no one is sinless. The fact is though, that your question/statement is a very sensitive subject for many, many people. I am one of those people who has fought my weight for a very long time, and I am not even 20 yet. Yes, self indulgence is a sin, but there is something that needs to be cleared up here. Most people, including myself, do not eat just to eat. It is something that is hard to beat. It is an addiction that controls you, when you want so badly to break away. Whether it is from deppression, stress, abusive relationships, or whatever, the addiction can creep into your life as a source of comfort from the world. \n\nGod is a loving god, and he is not going to send you to hell just for fighting the battle against your weight. We have to confess our sin and ask him for forgiveness, and not let ourselves be overwhelmed by the hurt or sadness that can drive us into weight gain. \n\nI am a Catholic Christian, and being very overweight is something I have to deal with daily. I am sure that there is someone around you, someone in your life that fights the battle against weight. There are people in every religion, every society who battles weight problems, though many other societies treat the people in question differently than western society does, our society often treating overweight people with contempt and scorn. \n\nPlease know this, God created us all with love, but our sin and hatred for one another has shoved a wedge between him and us. Overeating can be a sin, yes, but not always, and to suggest to others that they are sinners because they fight a emotional,mental,spiritual, and physical battle against weight is very hurtful to them.\n\nWould you honestly be able to go up to a dear family member that is overweight and tell them that they are sinful because of that? That would hurt anyone, if they admit it or not.	Society & Culture

question_title: Who is Gracchus? [SEP] question_content: Roman [SEP] best_answer: TIBERIUS AND GAIUS GRACCHUS  \n   \n \nFew figures in Roman history had the unforeseen historical impact of these two brothers, whose careers prefigured so much of what led to the fall of the Roman Republic. Proud sons of one of Rome’s first families, each ended his life in political murder and riot. In the 100 years following their fall, the Republic, beset by the forces they helped to unleash, let slip the dogs of repeated civil wars. Caesar’s career is unthinkable without them; Augustus built upon what the Gracchi began. It is easy to make such generalizations, but many books on their lives show the truth was far more complex and interesting. No one, however, denies that their history is important in the rolls of Roman events. As the Oxford Classical Dictionary states, their careers marked ”…the beginnings of ‘the Roman Revolution’: the introduction of murder into politics and the breakdown of concordia [the tradition of not pushing legal powers to extremes] on which the Republic was based.” Or as Velleius Paterculus wrote over a century later, speaking of Gaius (though also for Tiberius),\n\n \n  " He was for giving the citizenship to all Italians, extending it almost to the Alps, distributing the public domain, limiting the holdings of each citizen to five hundred acres, as had once been provided by the Licinian law, establishing new customs duties, filling the provinces with new colonies, transferring the judicial powers from the senate to the equites, and began the practice of distributing grain to the people. He left nothing undisturbed, nothing untouched, nothing unmolested, nothing, in short, as it had been. \n  \n Velleius Paterculus History of Rome, II, vi. 3-6  \n \n \n\nSons of a famous father (twice Consul and Censor) and a patrician mother, Cornelia (daughter of legendary war hero Scipio Africanus the Elder, who defeated Hannibal), Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his younger brother, Gaius, spanned the period of roughly 137 to 121 BC Significant problems existed in the middle and later decades of the second century. Rome had finally conquered and razed Carthage after nearly a century of repeated wars of conquest. It was now acquiring the territorial dominions that would lead to worldwide Empire. Yet the machinery of Roman administration, led by the patrician Senate and plebians, was increasingly ineffective dealing effectively with overseas dominions. For a century, small landowners had been taken repeatedly from their lands into Rome’s armies, to the decline and extinction of their farms. There was frequent agitation against the perceived inequality of the agrarian laws. Wealthy landowners bought up the farms, installing slaves in the place of the independent farmer. Landless, jobless, thousands drifted into Rome where they rotted and posed increasing threats to state stability. There was debt, corruption, and lack of an assured food supply for Rome. It was becoming increasingly hard to find enough citizen soldiers to man Rome’s enhanced armies. A growing frustration both among the lower classes, who felt disenfranchised, and the related Italian cities and regions, who sought and were denied full participation in Roman affairs, was creating deep-seated resentment and hardship. \n\n\nTIBERIUS SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS, C. 163-133 BC\n\nThe elder brother, Tiberius, had started his political career under his cousin, C. Scipio Aemilianus (adopted grandson of the famous Africanus). Later, when a quaestor in Spain, Tiberius used his connections to save the army by a treaty which, on motion of Scipio Aemilianus, the Senate refused to ratify. Bitterly disappointed, the young Gracchus joined the party opposing Scipio, including some of Rome’s most prominent Optimates (the equivalent of nobles in Roman politics, with consular backgrounds). Many in this party understood the need for reform; some cynically wished merely to oppose Scipio; some wished, surely, to use Tiberius for their own ends, as a sta	Society & Culture

question_title: Why do so many people take the Bible to be the ultimate word? [SEP] question_content: We know that it has been translated from Hebrew & Aramaic; things get lost in translation.  We know that various monarchs throughout time have removed various parts of the Bible - e.g. Constantine had all references to reincarnation taken out.  Why?  Because if people thought they had a 2nd chance, they wouldn't behave in this life.  We also know that it was written by a man - and ALL men are just that - men. So their translation of spiritual into material has to be flawed.  I hear people say... "well, in the Bible it states"...  I don't care that you were able to memorize the Bible - what do you think?  What do you feel?  What is your opinion?  There is as much spiritual gain to be found in a tree, a love letter or a hug as the Bible.  So why?  Can't we let people think for themselves? [SEP] best_answer: I agree with your statements. \n\nMost people like to believe everything others accept as truths - it is so much easier that way. Not everyone has the intellect or time or truth seeking characteristic in them to make them want to find out the absolute truth (if it exists!). \n\nHere are some other things I question:\n\n1) the book of Mark was the first recorded version of the synoptic gospels (the other books follow mark) - however, early versions (about 50 AD) ended at mark 16:8 and did not include anything about the resurrection.\n\n2) I suppose you are discussing the literary christians - have people really looked at the teachings of the gnostics? Their interpretation makes a lot more sense to me. Perhaps jesus was married to Mary Magdalene....and Saul/Paul was a woman hater....\n\n3) isn't it strange that Paul ursurped the new testament (his teachings take over from those of the apostles after the gospels)? Does this make sense to anyone else - if paul was the right person to expand the religion, why did Jesuah ben joseph (Jesus to most) not accept him as an apostle? Oversight?\n\n4) Popes through the ages have committed incesteous acts, organised murders, led crusades against Christian parties (Saracens were Christians), meddled in politics, made huge errors in scientific terms (earth is flat and all that)...and people still believe that they would not edit the bible to suit their own needs?\n\n5) Most of what Christians believe today were decided at the Council of Nicea (Apostle's creed, Holy Trinity etc etc) - does this make sense? A group of old men telling future generations what to believe rather than letting them make up their own minds?\n\n6) Everything is based on faith. If you wanted to buy a stereo but you could not try it (you have to pay upfront of course), would you do so? You have to rely on faith that it is good and it works....Does this make sense? Can faith be described as ignorance and acceptance of what people tell you without being able to find out the truth? if Thomas can ask questions, are we not allowed to do so as well or is he just an exception?\n\nWhat irks me most are the bible loving people who have not read and have not bothered to do more research on the basis of their beliefs and yet come around and preach to others. isn't it a case of "blind leading the blind", and perpetuating the infallibility of the bible?\n\nI remember a Jehovah Witness telling me that he believes the bible to be true so I should as well. I asked him if a madman genuinely believed he was Napolean Bonaparte, does it make him Napolean? Of course not, this is a subjective belief. Perhaps this is it: we will never find objective evidence to prove religion either way and can only decide subjectively if we want to believe. \n\nBTW, for every example of a scholar who converted to Christianity after doing research, there are also the opposite cases, where scholars have given up their beliefs due to their findings. To quote one or the other as irrefutable evidence of the truth/untruth is probably naive.\n\nHowever, in my search for the truth, I have not come across the indication that the First Holy Roman Emperor removed all references to reincarnation. I question this quote from you.... \n\nUltimately, I ask if the teachings have harmed humanity and I think that my answer is no. The teachings of the bible are in essence good but only intellectual flyweights would believe it wholeheartedly and as literal truth.	Society & Culture

It was very confusing, so can someone explain the old English money system. Guineas, crowns, schillings, farthings etc. I understand the system was decimalized in 1971. How did it work before ? [SEP] best_answer: The pound, was in fact a pound of sterling silver. It took a certain amount of various coins to equal the weight (and value) of a pound of silver. I was serving in the military in the U.K. when the they went to the decimal system and actually operated on the old system for over a year. It takes 12 pence to make a shilling ("bob") and 20 shillings to make a pound (240 pence to the pound. A farthing was a fourth of penny, a half-crown was 2 shillings and 6 pence a crown then equaled 5 shillings. A guinea was a gold version of the pound, but due to increases in the price of gold could be worth as much as 30 shillings.	Society & Culture
question_title: Are gnostic beliefs considered cultist? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Gnostic means "to know", specifically "hidden knowledge". Paul dealt with gnostic belief often in his writings, like to the Ephesians. Which is why he wrote...\n\n"And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ"\n\nBasically, everything we NEED to know, we know NOW through the gospel of Christ. Anything "new" is adding to the gospel and is therefore cultic.	Society & Culture
question_title: Why is there so much anti-islamism and atheism in the US? [SEP] question_content: I have no idea, what US citizens learn in school about religion and other religions, but it seems, that many automatically see islam in general as enemy and well also the christian and jewish religion seem to be pretty unknown.\n\nMany people seem to not know that Allah is just the arabic word for the english word God, and that this is the same God Christians and Jews believe in.\n\nSo when anyone says something versus Allah, this is not only an offense versus the muslims but also versus all christians and Jews.\n\nThis means there have to be large numbers of atheists in the US or extremely bad educated people. People who do not respect anything and anyone. \n\nWhy is it ?  Are there drugs in your drinking water or is there an epidemia of mad cow disease, so that such behavior is the result ?\n\nAnd when some say there is agression in the quran, have you ever read our christian bible or the jiddish Torah. Our books are full of violence. [SEP] best_answer: I was listening to a history expert and he actually said that America is the richest country and the dumbest one. Yup, all in the same sentence.  Doesn't surprise me at all.  People here listen to CNN and other news media and assume it is truth.  It's so sad.  Even the BBC is more truthful (not by much).	Society & Culture
question_title: Christians and Halloween? [SEP] question_content: Why do Christian's allow their children to "celebrate" All Hallow's Eve? It has roots in Pagan beliefs.\nAnd why is it okay for that one day of the year that children are allowed to ring on stranger's doorbells and ask for candy? When the other 364 days of the year, we tell them it is bad. \n\nJust looking for real people's opinions and thoughts, there is no right or wrong answer here. [SEP] best_answer: Good questions!\n\nBut do you know how many Christian holidays are based on Pagan holidays?   It was a transition to get people away from Paganism to Christianity.\n\nI've celebrated Halloween all my life.  Some "Christians" are now transitioning it to "Fall Festival" but it's the same thing/same night/same concept:  Dressing up in costumes and asking for Candy.\n\nIf my child threw all our eggs out into the yard on any day except Easter, I'd be mad...but it's a tradition.  If I was pinched any day except for St. Patrick's day, I'd be mad.  \n\nI have no problem with Halloween.  I know what's in my heart.	Society & Culture

question_title: You're at the dinner table. You have a cold...? [SEP] question_content: Are you supposed to get up from the dinner table and leave the room every time you have to blow your nose?  What about at a restaurant? [SEP] best_answer: To blow your nose -- yes.  To wipe your nose, not necessarily.\n\nIf your nose is absolutely crazy runny, most folks will forgive you if you keep a tissue close.  Just don't touch anyone else's food or utensils, and get up a couple times to blow your nose and wash your hands.  And... don't actually BLOW your nose while sitting at the table.\n\nColds suck.  Having a runny nose that just won't stop is a decent enough excuse to wipe it with a tissue at the dinner table.  Take a good decongestant and keep a few tissues in your pocket at the dinner table.  Hope for the best.  :-)	Society & Culture

question_title: Was the Holocaust in Rwanda predicted a decade earlier? [SEP] question_content: 25th Anniversary of Apparitions to Be Celebrated \n\nKIBEHO, Rwanda, NOV. 13, 2006 (Zenit.org).- The Diocese of Gikongoro has announced a Jubilee Year to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Blessed Virgin Mary's first apparition in Kibeho. \n\nKibeho, where the Marian apparitions began in 1981, is the goal of national and international pilgrimages. \n\nAccording to the visionaries, the Blessed Virgin introduced herself in the local language as "Nyina wa Jambo" -- Mother of the Word -- inviting to conversion, prayer and fasting. \n\nOn one occasion, she showed stark images: a river of blood, people killing one another, and abandoned corpses with no one to bury them. \n\nIn the following years the vision was linked to the genocide that convulsed Rwanda in 1994-1995. Kibeho was one of the bloodiest scenes of that tragedy. \n\nIn 2003, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, then prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, consecrated the Marian shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows in the site of the apparitions in Kibeho. He expressed the hope that Kibeho would become a place in which a Rwandan people would be born renewed in faith and forgiveness. \n\nThe apparitions began on Nov. 28, 1981, and ended on Nov. 28, 1989. "These two dates are considered an important historical reference for all who are anxious to know more about the apparitions and message of Kibeho," said a diocesan communiqué, signed by Father Eugene Dushimurukundo, chancellor. \n\nRecognition \n\nThe Catholic Church recognized these apparitions officially on June 29, 2001, after years of study by two commissions, one medical and the other theological, which were established by the local bishop. \n\nDeclared valid were the apparitions to three visionaries: Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka and Marie Claire Mukangango. \n\nIn a message last Sept. 8, Bishop Augustine Misago of Gikongoro announced that the celebrations for the 25th anniversary would begin on Nov. 28, feast of Our Lady of Kibeho. \n\nIn his message, Bishop Misago says that "to celebrate worthily the Jubilee Year we must make concrete acts in the light of the message of Kibeho." \n\nAmong them, he suggests: "praying during the year for all the intentions of the Pope; increasing participation at Mass and reception of Communion; receiving the sacrament of reconciliation." \n\nThe bishop also urges "striving for reconciliation with enemies; asking forgiveness of people we have offended; respecting others; being tolerant in the family, with neighbors, at work, in meetings and other social events." \n\nTo these gestures he adds "working with courage to promote truth and justice for all, particularly in present-day conditions of the Gacaca courts" -- peoples tribunals charged with judging persons accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide -- "which must be well managed to guarantee they do not become forums for injustice and revenge, covering the law." \n\nZE06111324 [SEP] best_answer: I don't know, but we are all to be blamed for having close our eyes and shut our mouth while tousands were slaugters.\nI'm only 19 y.o. but I feel guilty for this anyway. Even the United Nations didn't act in order to stop the genocide. We ought never to forget what happened.	Society & Culture
question_title: Can an Atheist act Christlike? [SEP] question_content: One of my brothers on here asked who is more christlike, or something to this affect,  the christian who uses profanity or the respectful atheist.\n\nI don't know that I agree with my brothers premise,  that an Atheist can act Christ-like.\n\nYour thoughts please?  I suppose first you must define Christlike. [SEP] best_answer: It all depends upon what standard you apply to "Christ likeness". For instance Christ was loving and compassionate and an Atheist can certainly demonstrate those qualities.\n\nBut if by being Christlike you mean a person who not only possesses qualities like the ones I already mentioned, but who also seeks to do the will of his Father in Heaven like Jesus always did, then the answer would be "No! An Atheist cannot be Christlike although anyone can certainly "act" Christlike".	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: when my friend talk in tamil it sounds cool but the letters are to curly [SEP] best_answer: I speak 7 different languages (of 7 different countries), including Tamil. It's not hard, when you put your mind to it. \n\nThe one advantage Tamil has over most Indian languages (that I myself find difficult to learn, only because I hadn't bothered), is you needn't cough your oesophagus out while trying to pronounce words (like in Hindi/ Urdu/ Arabic).\n\nYou'll get accustomed to the curly writings. Luckily, you have Tamil speaking friends whom you can listen and speak to at every given chance.	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: I'm Jewish and there's nothing wrong with attending a funeral (despite what religion it maybe.)

question_title: Why don't the farmers just stop growing tobacco and start growing more corn? [SEP] question_content: Tobacco is a drug that is very bad for our health, and we need corn to make ethanol.  I've heard that we don't grow enough corn in the U.S to make enough ethanol, so this would solve all of our problems! [SEP] best_answer: Tobacco has been a part of some farming families for generations. It is just as difficult for a Farmer to stop growing his crops and start something new, as it would be for a brain surgion to switch to auto mechinics. The tools and skilled required are differant and very costly to change. You are correct, it is not healthy. And it would make a great source of fuel, but the real deal is obscured by many issues.

[SEP] question_content: what is so logical about god letting his son get killed? why not let him live, and encourage him to travel the whole world, spreading his teachings to those who would otherwise not hear 'em for hundreds of years? he obviously was good at getting people to listen to him, and i'm sure people back then were way more stubborn and hotheaded than today. so why not let him keep working? send him all over, help him get across oceans, maybe bring some disciples along with him. wouldn't that be more helpful? and if he HAS to die like that, wouldn't it be even more powerful of a statement if he already had followers everywhere? also, people from other, distant lands would be more willing to believe in his miricles if they had actually SEEN some of them, and not just been told about them hundreds of years later. if jesus had visited the americas somehow, those people would have told stories passed down through generations. (i'm aware that america was unknown to them, but surely not to god?) [SEP] best_answer: jesus deserved to di3!! if i was around back then i woulda f*ckin killed him myself the dirty jewish b*stard. and i would laughed and pointed while he was hangin there on the cross and i would threw stones and p00p at him and whipped him until he finally d!ed.

question_title: Why is it always the woman that has to wear something sexy and dress up? What about the man? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It originates with objectification.

If so Why? [SEP] best_answer: I guess everyone has there own limits as to how far they will go to commit sin of there beliefs and to double that if they grew up in an Islamic household it was also put in there heads from birth that this is a no no,but if you continue to play around with you faith eventually nothing is forbidden to you.The Jews used to be the same and now I know many many Jews who now eat pork.
