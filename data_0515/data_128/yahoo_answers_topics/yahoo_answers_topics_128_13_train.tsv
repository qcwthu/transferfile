question_title: what is Holy grail? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In Christian mythology, the Holy Grail was the dish, plate, bowl, glass, cup or vessel used by Jesus at the Last Supper, said to possess miraculous powers. The connection of Joseph of Arimathea with the Grail legend dates from Robert de Boron's Joseph d'Arimathie (late twelfth century) in which Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus and sends it with his followers to Great Britain; building upon this theme, later writers recounted how Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him and that in Britain he founded a line of guardians to keep it safe. The quest for the Holy Grail makes up an important segment of the Arthurian cycle, appearing first in works by Chr√©tien de Troyes.[1] The legend may combine Christian lore with a Celtic myth of a cauldron endowed with special powers.\n\nThe development of the Grail legend has been traced in detail by cultural historians: It is a gothic legend, which first came together in the form of written romances, deriving perhaps from some pre-Christian folklore hints, in the later 12th and early 13th centuries. The early Grail romances centered on Percival and were woven into the more general Arthurian fabric. The Grail romances started in France and were translated into other European vernaculars; only a handful of non-French romances added any essential new elements.\n\nSome of the Grail legend is interwoven with legends of the Holy Chalice.

question_title: Is the Church in USA Roman Catholic? What's the relation with the Vatican? [SEP] question_content: I am European. I would like to understand the way the Christian Church is divided in the USA. For instance in Europe you have the Roman Catholics to the West; Protestants in England, Germany etc. and the Orthodox Church to the East. How about in USA?\n\nA good link would do too.\n\nPS: This question is not about faith etc. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I live in a small town in Kansas; right in the center of the USA.  Our population is under 30,000 people.\n\nWe have:\n\n2 Jewish synagogues\n1 Muslim Temple\n1 Pagan sanctuary\n6 Roman Catholic Churches\n4 Baptist churches\n5 (that I know of) Covens (Wiccan)\n5 Protestant churches\n1 Jahovah's Witness' meeting hall\n1 Irish Catholic church\n1 Seventh Day Adventist church\n3 Lutheran churches\n2 Jesus' Christ of Later Day Saints churches\n2 Non-denominational Christian churches\n2 Korean/Christian churches\n2 All Faith religious Centers (catering to any/all religions)\n2 Mormon Churches\n1 Bahai group\n2 New Age Metaphysical groups\n1 Church of Satan\n...  and easily 10 more churches/worhip places which, honestly, I don't know who attends.\n\nI've actually looked for a complete list of churches in Kansas, but can't find one.  There are literally thousands, of varieing faiths.  For all the variety of faiths practicing openly in Kansas, Kansas is, itself, accepted as being one of the more conservative states in our Union.\n\n  \nYou're getting the idea that we really do have a large mix of faiths/spirital practictioners in any area of the USA.  While any given religion might not actually be accepting of another; we do reasonably well at tolerating, if nothing more, people of other faiths.  And tentions/hostilities which do exist are generally demonstrated more covertly than overtly.\n\nSpecifically to Catholicism:  The Roman Catholic Churches in the USA are a bit at odds with The Vatican.  They don't adhere to Papal authority as much as The Vatican would like, and, with some frequency, are threatened with ex-communication.\n\nI hope that gives you some insight into how things work here.  Thanks.	Society & Culture
question_title: I want to know if there are Seventh-day Adventists over there? [SEP] question_content: How do you find life as an Adventist? where's your church located? thank you very much. Have a blessed day! [SEP] best_answer: My whole family are seventh Day Adventists. I grew up SDA and personally found that it changed my life.\n\nGrowing up I had no idea of anything I just believed what I was told. Later on when I was a teenager I started asking questions about Life, God, the Bible, etc. I finally came to my own conclusions about it all and left the SDA's and all other religions. \n\nI personally have found the SDA to be a bit on the strange side. I mean the "branch davidians" branched from SDA and we'll all saw what happened at Waco. Not that all SDA people are wierd, because my family is pretty normal, but I find the teachings to be odd and I wonder why people just follow blindly.\n\nAnyway, whatever you're looking for I'm sure you'll find it and if its right for you, then good.

question_title: Why do Christians keep pushing the lie that the book of job speaks about dinosaurs? [SEP] question_content: Supposedly comes from Job 40:15 - 24. Aside from the obvious fact that man and dinosaurs never existed at the same time, they claim that the phrase "His tail sways like a cedar" means that only dinosaurs had tails like that. However, the problem is that anyone that has at least the most basic understanding of English will notice that "sways like a cedar" means the movement is like the movement a cedar has, not that the tail physically resembles a cedar. Either way, what dinosaur has ever had a tail that looks like this: http://universe-review.ca/I10-22a-cedar.jpg\n\nSo why do you keep pushing this ignorant lie?\n\n(PS. I know someone will say about dinosaur blood found in montana; that is false. They found tissue, but they didn't find ANY red blood cells. And even if they did, that doesn't porve they existed at the same time as humans.) [SEP] best_answer: The correct answer, of course, is that ignorant lies are necessary to the defense of the religion. \n\nWhy would you expect honesty of someone whose goal is to defend a religious belief system?

Also if you do believe in evolution then show me some form of bacteria (or whatever) that will turn into a fish, grow legs and arms,turn into a furry monkey, make fire, straighten out its spine to walk upright, and talk to me.

Because those of us who do KNOW(believe in) GOD would never, well you know evolutionist. Some of you are just dumb and want to say something for the hell of it. If you can believe in evolution why not aliens? Bacteria can be found all over the earth, why not distant planets? If life formed for us in that way then there must be aliens?! If you can't believe that then there is no such thing as evolution!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP] best_answer: the problem is that history can not be proven. science deals with the now. right now we have fossils and bones. what does this mean? that somthing lived and died not that they evolved over millions of years. if the biologists knew anything about astronomy they would realize that the earth is slowing down (hence the leap second) and if somthing is slowing down that means it used to be going faster. and if you do the math on this billions of years ago the earth was going so fast that day and night were one and nothing could stand on its surface.\n\nlets think for ourselves and not let the government or our textbooks tell us what to beleive \ngalleleo along with almost every other inventor would have never made there discoverys had it not been for there mistrust of textbooks.

question_title: When theists say things like how could a watch create its self can they prove it couldn't have? [SEP] question_content: When theists say that how could (name of something manmade) create its self I wonder just how many of them could prove it couldn't have happened on its own without saying because they know it is man made. [SEP] best_answer: Just something to think about: the watchmaker analogy is old, but it does not make sense. A higher power made the watch. It is orderly and perfect in order to work properly. On the same note, if a higher power made the world/nature wouldn't it be orderly and perfect as well? Nature is chaotic and unpredictable. \n\nA watch is proven to be made by man, a physical being that can be touched and felt. Nature has no physical touchable creator that can be proven to be real. There are plenty of logical theories that can be used to explain why nature is how it is. But many people overlook this because they want to believe something more. \n\nThe watchmaker analogy does not hold up logically. I hope that helps?	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: simply put, it is true that we should have freedom but most people that are advocates of 'freedom' in all its forms forget that having freedom is not one-sided.  freedom's twin is 'responsibility'.  one's freedom ends when it starts to encroach on another's.  freedom should be viewed in the correct perspective.  rules and regulations and norms are in place to enforce some sort of order.  but better than rules and regulations are PRINCIPLES.  when we know, have and practice the correct set of principles (which can be summarized into two: love God with all our heart, soul, mind, strength; and love our neighbor as ourselves) then we are able to live responsibly and know the limitations of our freedom.

question_title: supposedly in the bible it says races should not mix if so exactly where and what scripture and verse? [SEP] question_content: if anyone knows please answer [SEP] best_answer: Does the Bible state certain people should not exist?\n\nSatan is brilliant when it comes to orchestrating deception. He has managed to persuade people to make problems when there need be none. No more effectively has He did this than with "race." Satan has deceived people into making "race" a problem by simply defining it as one. The premise usually goes something like this: "God never intended the mixing of the races." The inference is that there are four distinct races and that being in any group other than one of those distinct four "races" constitutes a genetic and aesthetic disadvantage. A person (influenced by Satan) makes the statement, convinces himself that it represents God's point of view and then connects "imagined" negative consequence to what he despairingly terms "race mixing." Since God is supposedly behind the argument, if you or I disagree with the premise, we are disagreeing with God! Who would dare disagree with God? Of course the Bible points out that many will come in Christ's name saying Christ is the Christ and deceive many (Matt. 24:4-5). And, they will kill you and think they do God a service. So, we had better ask ourselves if these ideas really represent God? \n\nThe holder of the argument goes about gathering "data" to support his premise. He usually finds what He is looking for. If evidence doesn't exist he can always "define" it into existence. "Look at the 'race' riots. Look at the 'racial' problems that exist all around the world. Blacks kill whites and whites kill blacks. Therefore, there is a race problem." The average non-thinking person usually swallows this argument. However, if it was pointed out that "blacks" kill "blacks" and "whites" kill "whites" that might infer that "race" was not the causative factor. Killing and hatred are not confined to "racial types." Japanese kill Japanese as do Germans kill Germans. Hatred it seems is not the exclusive domain of "race." Cain killed Abel. What did that have to do with "race?"	Society & Culture

question_title: Does anyone know who translated the Jehovah Witness bible The New World translation of the Holy Scriptures? [SEP] question_content: I have asked Jehovah Witnesses over the years that question and it seems that they themselves don't know. They usually respond that they don't want to give glory to man by revealing that. I want to know who to hold accountable for their outright deceptive translations of John 1: and Heb 1: where the wording has been changed to make Jesus out to not be God as in the original language of the New Testament. [SEP] best_answer: During a court trial in Glasgow, Scotland in 1954, Franz was asked by the Government lawyer just who the translators were. Franz replied under oath: "That is an absolute secret. It will never be revealed now or even after death." Only someone with something to hide would be so intent on secrecy. He was asked: "What happens if somebody submits a translation. Does the committee examine it? Mr. Franz: No. I give it my 0.K., then the President, Mr. N. H. Knorr, has the last word." He was further asked to explain how "translations and interpretations of the Bible were made." Franz replied that they emanated from God: "passed to the Holy Spirit who, invisible, communicates with Jehovah's Witnesses - and the publicity department." (Franz is the head of the Publicity Department).\n\nI found this::  evidently a comittee\nC. The NWT translators were: Nathan Knorr, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas, Fred Franz, M. Henschel\n\n    * "Fred Franz however, was the only one with sufficient knowledge of the Bible languages to attempt translation of this kind. He had studied Greek for two years in the University of Cincinnati but was only self-taught in Hebrew." ["Crisis of Conscience"; by Raymond Franz; Commentary Press, Atlanta; 1983 edition; footnote 15; page 50.]\n    * Four out of the five men on the committee had no Hebrew or Greek training at all. They had only a high school education. Franz studied Greek for two years at the University of Cincinnati, but dropped out after his sophomore year. When asked in a Scotland courtroom if he could translate Genesis 2:4 into Hebrew, Franz replied that he could not. The truth is that Franz was unable to translate Hebrew or Greek.\n    * What we are left with is a very inexperienced translating committee that twisted Scripture to make it fit the Society's doctrine.\nhttp://www.bible.ca/Jw-NWT.htm	Society & Culture

Please state your race and country first then state whether you would etc and are there any races you wouldn't like to date for any reasons? Just for interest really.

If we can love, accept and respect each other, and get along most of the time, then I would date anyone from any race, there's none that I would exclude totally, as everyone even within small regions is different!

[SEP] question_content: If I am wrong and god does exist (which is unlikely) I can look him in the eyes and say I have tried to examine and understand the universe the best I could and I couldn't see you in it." But now what if I'm right there is no supreme being for us to be afraid of offending no one can be accused of playing god because he doesn't exist so science is free to advance without hindrance and that will expanded our knowledge of the universe and save billions of lives as we develop new effective cures for diseases and improve billions of others as new technology is developed .  Also there wouldn't be as much discrimination or war as religion is the main cause of that.  Oh what a wonderful world it would be.  So there you go that is what happens if I am wrong and what happens if I'm right and personally I think it's worth the gamble (not much of a gamble as there is no evidence to suggest god does exist so that would mean I am right just the sooner you theists admit it the better for everyone). [SEP] best_answer: Dude I totally agree with you plus how do we know the bible is true like seriously there is no proof to what they say in the bible it could all be a lie	Society & Culture
question_title: Define "True Friend"? [SEP] question_content: There is so many people that we can call "friends" around us. But it's just so little one that can be called "true friends". Can you define what's true friend, and what's the best way to get a true friend? [SEP] best_answer: True friends are those who never let you down and are there for you (even by email) when you need them, and if they can't they look for a way to make it up to you.. They make you smile, make you cry, and make you angry when they tell you the awful truth that you don't want to hear... They save you when you need it (and when they can) and they support you, even if they sometimes don't understand you... THey let you go and crash when you're stubborn about sdomething that's not right, but they're always there to pick you up and heal you after that crash... True friends are the most important people after your family (and in some cases after your couple)... \n\nThe best way to get one is by doing all the things above with someone that is just your plain friend.. and he/she'll do the same for you eventually... ;)	Society & Culture

question_title: Does this look like an indication of the some (not all) of the answers floating around here??? [SEP] question_content: The Dangers of the Last Days 2 Timothy Chp 3\nYou should also know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. 2 For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. 3 They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control; they will be cruel and have no interest in what is good. 4 They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. 5 They will act as if they are religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. You must stay away from people like that. [SEP] best_answer: Yeah you bet ... but it is not really a suprise because we live in a fallen world. All of us "fall short" and its just that those that don't "love Him" have a different heart, you will recognise a tree by its fruit - out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks - a good tree does not bear bad fruit and in the same way a bad tree will not bear good fruit. You have a Bible, you know the verses. I guess that some of the folks that "know Him" don't come on here due to some of the content on here such as that you have referred to. Hope this answers your question.	Society & Culture

But also explain to her how important this is to you. My mother refused to allow me to go to a party after graduation. I am nearly 50 years old now and I still harbor resentment for that. Be honest with her and with yourself. But also respect her. She has her reasons for wanting to protect you. You will only understand when you become a parent yourself, as I am now.	Society & Culture

question_title: Purpose??? [SEP] question_content: Unless I'm wrong, christians and other such religions believe that life is a test to see whether you go to heaven or hell.\n\nWell, even if it were true, what would be the point?\n\nYou can live on Earth or in heaven, what's it matter?\n\nAlso, don't the supposed gods already know everything?  They know exactly how they made you, and since they are perfcet, they know that you can't turn out in any other way then they meant for you to turn out, sort of eliminating the idea of free will.  So how is it a test if they already know whether or not you will go to heaven or hell.  Also, since god knows how he made you, and if you go to hell, isn't it HIS fault? He knows exactly how he made you, and he knows that you'll go to hell, so why did he do it in the first place?\n\nWhat's the point of this life if we just go to heaven or hell?  This ife isn't a test to see if we're worthy or not becaue they already know if we're worthy...\n\nNone of it adds up...

I don't really need to know what people look like to be able to chat to them, but other people always ask for pics so I guess they do!

question_title: are you a psychic or have you had premonitions? [SEP] question_content: I do believe in paranormal stuff but I'm a little sceptical about the whole psychic thing!  But this is what happened and my mom thinks it is premonitions, I think it is coincidence!  I had a dream about a fire and my dad came home that day and said that one of the old antique million dollar homes in town had burn down.  Then I had a dream about the space shuttle exploding (I thought is was about the challenger)  so I was asking my mom a lot of questions about it and then we watched Columbia and we were like whoa!!  I still say coincidence.  Well my boss hasn't been feeling well and he is really stressed out and the night before last I had a dream that he had a heart attack!  And when I came in yesterday a co-worker said that he had suffered from a mild heart attack!  Is this a gift or coincidence?  And if it is a gift how can I get a handle on it!  Or am I just a loony?  If you have these abilities could you please help me with a little more info about what I am experiencing!  Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: There are NO coincidences.  There are also quite a few folks out and around that have prophetic dreams.  It is a natural talent, just like music in some, that comes from more development/use of your right brain lobe.  \n\nHow to handle it? That's a bit more difficult.  You can't compare your talents to others.  Just compare them to past occurances you'd had and weigh them from there. I wouldn't advise you to tell others what you suspect is coming but you learn by experience at it occurs more.	Society & Culture
question_title: What age of your life did you decide what you believe about religion? [SEP] question_content: Are you firm in your beliefs? Do you still have nagging questions?\nI believe I am a Christian, however I do not take the Bible as literal fact, especially the Old Testament [SEP] best_answer: It actually occured over time.  I was raised a Methodist, but by the time i was in Sixth Grade (now 27 years ago), I began to see there was more out there, at least from the scientific side.  I began to be pretty heavy into science in high school, then began to study religions in the last two years I was in high school.  I had an English teacher than encouraged me to continue to study about them (as a comparative-type study, not a theological path).  \n\nWhen I went to college, I took a major in religion.  I mainly wanted to study world religions, but wound up taking a lot of classes in the Bible.  By the time I had left college, I had read quite a few of the sacred texts of the world's religions (including most of the Bible).  I had even read some of the apocryphal Bible (Old and New Testaments).  I began to believe in Deism during college, but didn't really have a name for it.  \n\nI am a firm believer in Deism today and I really can say I have no nagging questions.  It is a very logical, reasoned religion without a sacred text.  For me, it works.	Society & Culture
question_title: Does Gospel of Judas proves the Islamic version of the end days of Jesus? [SEP] question_content: According to Islam,Eesa(Jesus)was not crucified. Instead the one who revealed him was crucified.\n The Gospel of Judas narrates that Jesus said to Judas that 'you will sacrifice the man that clothes me'.Is Judas the mistaken identity of Jesus for all these years people beleived him to be Jesus. [SEP] best_answer: If the Gospel of Judas was a proper Gospel then it would still not corrabote - as Jesus WAS crucified - but the difference was that Judas is made out to be the hero - as it frees Jesus' spirit from his body - which apparently was the mission.\n\nHowever, this just is not consistent with the fact that Jesus healed people - if the purpose is to free spirits from the flesh then while heal the flesh (and He still does today - see my question on miracles).\n\nBut given that it was written by the Gnostics 200 years later then no.  But it does provide an interesting insight into the Gnostics beliefs.	Society & Culture

question_title: Where do old sayings like "a stitch in time saves nine" come from? Why do we remember them? What do they mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When ALL sewing was done by hand, it was quite a chore to make an article of clothing. IF a stitch popped, a quick repair saved one heck of a lot of time, because, as you well know, if you mend something that just starts to break, it is easy. To fix the whole thing is really difficult. \n"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" is obvious. The world is full of wisdom in these sayings.	Society & Culture

This question is for believers. [SEP] best_answer: I believe Jesus will be coming back within the next 10 years - any time along that time frame - assuming the Antichrist shows his face between now and the next three years.\n\nThese dates are educated speculation based on global trends, so don't rip my head off :-)\n\nI expect THE Antichrist to show in the given time frame, and believe he will be using Islam and the Roman Catholic Church as his springboard. He will most likely be the Muslim's awaited Mahdi.\n\nThe False prophet will (most likely) be a Roman Catholic Pope or someone in the Roman Catholic hierarchy pretending to be Jesus who will tell the world, that Islam's awaited Mahdi is the true chosen one. - my belief is based on recent as well as current events weighed in line with scripture.

[SEP] question_content: What do you think of his books especially the "Purpose Driven Church" and his One World Denomination programs over in Africa?  Do you like his books and him or against him?

However, after the success of the book it seems that everything went purpose driven.  There are purpose driven ties, coffee mugs, and I bet I could find a purpose driven pet carrier if I looked hard enough.

question_title: The Bible states that Tongues are a sign.........? [SEP] question_content: The Bible states in 1St Cor. Ch.14 V22 that "Tongues are a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not" Who are those people refered to as "THEM" [SEP] best_answer: Them refers to unbelievers or those who are not Christians. There is great misuse of tongues in the church. If everyone in the local church speaks the same language, say english, there is no need to speak in a tongue that not everyone is going to understand. God doesn't want confusion in the church. Also if you have the gift of tongues, you will not have to learn to speak it, you will speak naturally although you may not understand it. Either the person who speaks in a tongue is to interpet what is being said or someone else who knows the interpetation. If nobody can interpet the tongue than no one should be talking in that language.  Not everyone has the gift of tongues either.	Society & Culture

Am I correct in my understanding that the "ONE MAN" being referred to is ADAM.\n\nIt just seems SO UNFAIR that WE HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR A MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE BY SOMEONE ELSE... [SEP] best_answer: We don't have to pay for anything but our own actions.\nDoes anything else seem logical to you, other than that.\n\nTaking on Adam and Eve's "sin" is preposterous.\nPlease ... don't we have more logic than that?\n\nWhy yes ... yes we do!     : )\n\nEDIT:  All of the thumbs down Christians just proved a point made in another YA question.  If you don't agree with an opinion different than your own, you click the thumbs down.  I don't do that, even if I don't agree with the opinion.  We are all entitled to our opinion and our answer.

question_title: Doesn't a lightning rod on top of church show a lack of faith? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I find it fascinating that you consider God in such a comic book-super hero mentality.  Because a church uses a lightning rod, it means they're afraid God won't reach down and magically shield them from harm.  Come to think of it, that WOULD make a pretty good super hero.  Too bad it just doesn't work like that.\n\nBy the same token, Christians should just ignore all common sense and step in front of cars, bullets, etc.  It's on God to protect one of His own, right?  Come on now.  We all live in the same world.  Both the righteous and evil face the same physical properties of our planet--not to mention the tragedies that humans cause.\n\nFaith in God is so much more than just blithly expecting Him to automatically shield all of us from harm.  What's the alternative--if we slip up, we're just dead meat?  God loves us all--even the skeptical like yourself--and does protect us from evil.  He just can't stop the world from turning--even if Superman can.	Society & Culture

He would be arrested in any western culture for doing that.  In muslim cultures, little girls are fair game as long as they have had their first periods.	Society & Culture

question_title: I hear lots of people say how Jesus changed their lives. Does the OT version of God ever change anyone's life? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone convert to Christianity because of anything said in the Old Testament? [SEP] best_answer: People might convert to Christianity by seeing how the prophecies of the Old Testament are fulfilled in the New Testament, but that requires a lot more education that most people care for.  Still, I can tell you that the OT changed my view of Christianity.  Before reading it, I always saw the religion as very dichotimized, with the OT God light years away from the NT God.  Having read it, I now realize that's not true.  There's a lot more of a loving God in the OT than people usually give credit for.  Likewise, the NT God is frequently harsher than Christians would care to admit.  It's given me a much more unified, clearer perspective.	Society & Culture

question_title: Any Latinos that have been to Japan? [SEP] question_content: Hello, I was wondering if there is any Latino/Hispano that has been to Japan? If there are any, can you please tell me how your experience was? I know of other people of different backgrounds that have went to Japan, but I have not gotten feedback from any Hispanics that have gone there. Please help! [SEP] best_answer: My friend's wife is from Colombia.  They met while they were studying at an American university, and when he returned to Japan, she followed him.  They eventually got married, but she had a real difficult time for the first year or so because she spoke no Japanese.  Now, after having been in Japan for ten years, she says she loves it here and never want to move to another country, including her home country.  I think Lations and Japanese share some of the same values, like importance of family, so it might be easy to assimiliate in that regards.	Society & Culture

I am an educated person and I understand the moral implications of the word, but seriously why don't people get a life? [SEP] best_answer: the people you are speaking to probably have a problem with 'normal' because they are not and sadly like the rest of parents since the late 80's they believe that positive reinforcement is the way to go so they tell little Johnny he is better than normal which leads to such problems as no-talent idiots thinking they can sing and thus auditioning for pop/american/australian idol and not understanding why they are being told they suck because there have never been enogh 'normal' people to tell them the truth before. that's just one example anyway!

But then again, that makes me think of myself because I was the one who pushed him away.\nWell, anyway, I love my mom to pieces even though I've never told her that.

question_title: Any good none-box office movies ? [SEP] question_content: im fed up with the hollywood crap blockbusters... [SEP] best_answer: Try either "Return to Paradise" "Dark City" or "Mean Creek".  They are all fabulous movie that had little box office success but recieved critical acclaim.  Mean Creek is the only one that is Indie.  Return to Paradise does have stars in it, but kind of flopped.  it is a GREAT movie though.  Dark City is probably one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever.  Better than the Matrix and it came out before it and unfortunatly tanked.  Roger Ebert loves it enough to do a commentary track for the DVD by himself for the entire movie, and has given lectures just on this movie.  \n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0124595/     --- Return to Paradise\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0118929/     --- Dark City\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0377091/     --- Mean Creek\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051106/REVIEWS08/511060302/1023    --- Roger Ebert's Dark City review for his "Great Movie" collection.

question_title: What is the very best joke you know? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is long, but soooo funny:\n\nA little rabbit is hopping through the forest when he comes upon a bear rolling a joint.  He says to the bear, 'why are you doing that, Mr. Bear, please think about your health and put down that joint and come running through the forest with me, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  So the bear thinks about and agrees, off they go running through the forest together.  As they are enjoying their run through the forest they come up to a giraffe about to snort a line of c*ke.  The rabbit is horrified and says to the giraffe 'why are you doing that, Mr. Giraffe, please think about your health and put down that mirror and straw and come running through the forest with us, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  Very hesitant the giraffe gives in and puts down his items and joins the rabbit and bear on their escapade through the forest.  The three of them are now having a blast running freely when they see a lion about to shoot up.  The rabbit quickly runs to him and says 'why are you doing that, Mr. Lion, please think about your health and put down that needle and come running through the forest with us, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  The lion is irritated that he was interrupted, but he puts down his needle, walks over to the rabbit, grabs him by the ears and begins to beat him senseless.  The bear and giraffe are standing there in horror, they scream and plead with the lion to stop asking him 'why are you doing this to him, he is merely trying to help you!?'.  The lion looks at them and says 'bullsh!t, he's not trying to help, everytime he's on ecstasy he makes me run through the forest with him for hours looking like an idiot'.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Batman's costume is dark so he can hide in the shadows.  So why is Robin's costume bright colors? [SEP] question_content: Seriously, my youngest son wants to know.  Has this ever been addressed in the comic books? [SEP] best_answer: The real answer is that the editors that created Robin way back when wanted to create a character that was appealing to kids, the main audience for comics then. And none of the editors since have had the nuts to say "Y'know what? That kinda doesnt make sense. Lets change that." \n\nIts kinda like why superheroes still have costumes with their shorts on the outside. Its outdated stuff that the editors believe cannot be changed without ruining the character, when in truth we want silly things like that changed, for the better, for the more realistic.\n\nStill the latest Robin costume and character is much darker, and Nightwing is too.

question_title: Does anyone else think that are too many people with superpowers in the new TV series, HEROES? [SEP] question_content: How long will this go on?, another character with superpowers every week.  I still like the show, but I'm afraid they will go to far at some point. [SEP] best_answer: That is the whole point....that there are more of these people than one might think.   The idea behind Suresh's work was that the humna race was changing and having more of these people show up reinforces that plot perspective.   Add to that the idea that it goes along with the idea that these people will be connected somehow beyone their powers is just part of the whole myster of how they came into being to begin with and the nature of their genetic differences.   How else could Nikki and her husband both have had powers and neither knew it until last week.   Or the connection between Hiro and Nikki through Hiro's friend, or the conneciton between Peter and Issac.   These people are supposed to met and come tegether at some point...and having these connections between them, chance encounteres and the like is just part of how that happens.   Kind of like a 6 degrees of separation sort of thing.   Or the idea that people like this will always be drawn together even if they don't know each other.\n\nOnce they have introduced all the main players...the number of people with powers should stabilize....and only a few should pop up now and again as necessary plot devices to sort of cement the character traits of some of the more regular players.

question_title: Episode III deleted scenes? [SEP] question_content: I would like someone that has the star wars dvd to please list all the extra scenes in the deleted scenes section. Name and what happens and how long is the clip. [SEP] best_answer: I dont remember them all but let me put in a little info.\n\nFirst: The one major deleted Scene i can tell you was there was a meeting between mon Mothma (wish they hadnt deleted her scene since it was such news as to how she would look a lot younger. Admirl Ackbar, Padme and some others. they were talking about how Palpetine was too powerfull and if he retained his power they should try to fight him. This was entitled (i think) "Rebellion Birth"\n\nNow here's the interesting thing.\n\nIn 1983 George Lucas wrote the scripts for Ep 1-3. I came upon copies of these in 1993 at a mall. The original name for Ep 3 was "Fall of the Republic"\nIt had a..... differnet twist in the storyline, one i wish they had stayed with.\n\n1. The jedi learn of a crystal on Mustafar (the lava world) that can bind and balance the force if they get it. Palpetine learns of the same crystal and knows if he gets it, it will bind his powers as emporer. Obi-wan is sent by the jedi and Anakin is sent by Palpetine. The battle over the lava happens at the beggining of the story versus the end of the story. \n\n2. At some point, Padme is captured and imprisoned. When trying to escape (as stormtroopers seize Corouscant under the new Emporer) she is killed in a cross fire between rebels to be and the ST's.\n\n3. To ensure the government will remain loyal to him, Palpetine orders a blockade of Corouscant. Hoping he can keep all the senators on the planet and under his control, a large space battle happens when Ackbar, Mon Mothma, pilots and soldiers who uppose Palpetine's new order attempt to flea the capitol to form the rebellion. \n\nThese were changed but they would have been better left in it.

[SEP] question_content: When you were a teen what did you do? i want to know how you did it with out getting cought. what did you do? how did you do it? who was with you?? [SEP] best_answer: I was fairly good as a kid. I used to be pretty wild when it came to Fourwheeling and camping. We used to have camping parties behind our properties, and a few times, nearly burned down the forest we were in due to Huge Bonfires consisting of goodies found in a Dump nearby. Luckily, in each case, we were able to control the fire, before packing up, and calling the Fire Dept.\n\nAlso, on these camping trips, we used to take a Fourwheeler, and drive down the Highways in the area, to the local Convenience Store in the middle of the night (4-5 miles away) and buy Food, and Drink. Parents caught wind of this, and told me not to, but I'd do it anyways. I never got caught by the Cops, but my buddy did one night, when I wasn't there.\n\nHow did we not get caught other than his incident?? Just lucky, I guess. Always obeyed any street signs and Traffic lights. I mean come on, there could have been worse things that I did as a Teenager.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Which is more powerful? [SEP] question_content: A smile or a kind word? [SEP] best_answer: How very chicken or the egg. :) I'll explain why......\n\n\nIn my opinion, it is a smile. I've had kind words said to me many times before. At times, someone will email me a kind word, or phone me with a kind message...... or stop me in the hallway at work with a quick word. It always means a great deal to me......and what does it do? I makes me smile. So having said this.... one might conclude that the kind word was so powerful that it caused the smile. But what caused the kind word?\n\nThere are times when someone will speak a kind word and you never know if it is meant with sincerity or not. The smile says so much. I could tell you how amazing you are while looking at my feet and I'm just not sure it would have the same effect as when I look in your eyes and it makes me smile. The power behind that smile is ginormous! It can say so much more than the verbal word. The look in the eyes....the tremble of the lips..... the intake of the breath. The scrunch of the noses... the creation of the dimple... the beauty of the smile. \n\nThat smile can then cause someone to feel as confident, as secure, as happy, as driven as they could ever be. Allowing them to pass on a smile..... a kind word.. a simple gesture. \n\nThe power of the smile is massive. The power of the kind word is as well. But to smile while speaking the word...... that's when you know you could take on the world!	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] question_content: i got a mp3 player for my birthday, but don't know what it is for or what i do with it can u help me please. thanks [SEP] best_answer: An mp3 player is a portable music player. You have to put your Cd's into your computer copy the music using the software that came with it. Then you can transfer onto  your device. Also you can pay for an subscription to a music subscription site like Yahoo! Unlimited. Then you will be able to put an unlimited amount of music o n your mp3 player for 11.95 per month. It should have came with software (a CD) all you have to do is put the CD into your computer and follow the directions. Most famous mp3 players are Ipods but they are the least compatible and have the most bugs.	Entertainment & Music

Approve of the evictions so far? Think David could be the most amusing and also annoying person ever? Is Myleeeeene really that perfect? Can Jason do any silly voices other than "Monty Python" ratbags? Who'd you like to see win? [SEP] best_answer: Ummmm...I think Dean and Matt may go (if not Matt I think Jason). I like Matt actually, in fact what's hard is I like them all now, even though originally I thought I'd hate David and Myleene!

question_title: Why doesn't starch give a positive glucose test? [SEP] question_content: I know so far that starch has an adehyde group but it is too small in comparison to the rest of its own molecule. The experiment used benedict's solution to determine wheter there was a reaction of glucose or not. Starch did not give a positive glucose test. Why? [SEP] best_answer: A starch molecule is made up of 100's of glucose monomers. And each glucose monomer in a starch is linked with another glucose monomer by alpha -1,4 linkage due to which a starch molecule does not have a free aldehyde group which is opresent in a free glucose molecule. At its end it may have a free aldehyde group, but is too small in amount to show the reaction in comparision to a huge glucose monomer. As Benedict's Test is a test to determine presence or absence of a aldehydic group; a starch molecule can not show a positive glucose test. But if a starch molecuse is hydrolysed with help of an acid or amylase enzyme it will certainly show hte positive glucose test.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the best peripheral IV site for giving IV contrast dye for chest angiograms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Generally IV's are started at the most peripheral site that is available and appropriate for the situation. This allows cannulation of a more proximal site if your initial attempt fails. If you puncture a proximal vein first, and then try to start an IV distal to that site, the fluid may leak from the injured proximal vessel. The preferred site in the emergency department is the veins of the forearm, followed by the median cubital vein that crosses the antecubital fossa. In trauma patients, it is common to go directly to the median cubital vein as the first choice because it will accommodate a large bore IV and it is generally easy to catheterize. In circumstances where the veins of the upper extremities are inaccessible, the veins of the dorsum of the foot or the saphenous vein of the lower leg can be used. In circumstances in which no peripheral IV access is possible a central IV can be started.\n\n*** NO NO NO no central line for just IV contrast.  You've got to be kidding me!!!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: How to tighten a screw? [SEP] question_content: When assembling a product I was always taught to tighten one screw at a time unless you are aligning two pieces with multiple screws.  Does anyone knowof any technical papers out there for the best practices? [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what you are putting together.. For some things, it's not important if you screw in all sides evenly.  However for other things that require proper alignment for functionality and ease of construction putting the screws in equally is important.  For example, when you put on a tire for a car, you should put the nuts on evenly (opposite nuts in) so that the wheel remains balancedwhen you drive.  But if you are simply puttng one board to another that does not require balance for the object to function (like wallboard) then it really doesn't matter.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what does metabolite mean? [SEP] question_content: it seems that there's "metabolite 1" and "metabolite 2" . what's the difference? [SEP] best_answer: A metabolite is any molecule that is produced in a metabolic pathway carried out in living cells, starting with a particular substrate and driven by some number of enzymes essential to completion of the pathway.  For example, the complete metabolism of the glucose molecule is driven by a large number of critical enzymes and coenzymes that produce a number of metabolites in the pathway leading to the end products, water, carbon dioxide, and ATP (the cell's chemical "money").\n\nWhen you speak of metabolite 1 and metabolite 2 you are probably referring to primary and secondary metabolites.  Primary metabolites are molecules that are essential to the normal growth, development, and reproduction of the organism.  Secondary metabolites may also have important functions, but are not necessarily essential.  Examples of secondary metabolites are pigment molecules in plants and animals and the substances produced by various fungi that act as antibiotics.\n\nAll of the biochemical reactions that take place in living cells make up the cell's metabolism.  In some pathways, described as catabolic, large molecules are subdivided into smaller ones, usually with the release of energy stored in the large molecule (e.g. glucose).  In other pathways, called anabolic, smaller molecules are combined to form larger ones (e.g. the formation of functional proteins from a directed sequence of their constituent amino acids.\n\nAll chemicals that enter the human body as drugs or environmental contaminants are by definition not strictly necessary for the normal function of the body.  Such chemicals may have direct effects on the body's normal physiology without any metabolic conversion.  The most familiar example of such a chemical might be ethanol, the effects of which are known to anyone who's ever taken a drink.  Other drugs and chemicals may also have direct active effects.  On the other hand, many drugs and chemicals must be converted into an active form before they can have a  physiological effect.  For example, the carcinogen vinyl chloride must be converted into chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde, which have the capacity to bind to and alter nuclear DNA, for the carcinogenic effect to occur.\n\nConversion of "foreign" parent molecules into active or inactive metabolites takes place in primarily in the liver.  Liver cells contain a vast array of enzyme systems which have apparently evolved with our species to protect us from the harmful effects of potentially toxic chemicals in our food and in the general environment.  The primary effect of these enzyme systems, such as the cytochrome P450 system, is to convert potentially toxic chemicals into relatively harmless metabolites, which are then frequently conjugated with another molecule, such as glucuronic acid, making it easier for the body to excrete the metabolites via the urine.  Again, sometimes the metabolites produced by one of these enzyme systems may be more toxic than the parent molecule; or the parent molecule given as a medication does not become active until it has been processed by a liver enzyme system.  Ethanol is another example here; one of its metabolites, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than the parent alcohol molecule.  Usually acetaldehyde is rapidly converted to carbon dioxide in water; many East Asian people are deficient in the enzymes needed to process acetaldehyde, and so have a much more limited tolerance for alcohol than non-Asians.\n\nOne final note:  it is usually the products of metabolism of  many drugs that may be detected in a person's urine.  This is true for most illicit drugs and also for tobacco.  Each drug produces a characteristic metabolite or metabolites that are present in the urine for some period of time after ingestion of the drug.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: I have heard that all living organisms from polar bears to penguins contain DDT in their bodies. How come? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a number of things to consider:\n1) Persistence - the time chemical substance remain in the ecosystem before degrading.  Elements are persistent in the extreme, most do not change during the lifetime of the solar system.  They only change by nuclear processes (fission or fusion).  Some organic substances, such as DDT, persist for decades or centuries simply because there are no efficient mechanisms for their degradation. \n\n2) Bioaccumulation - does the substance accumulate in the the tissues of organisms exposed in the environment due to \na) biocenentration - the tendency of a substance to be found at higher concentration in the organism that in the environment (i.e. higher in fish tissue than in the water they swim in) and \nb) biomagnification - the tendency of a substance to be found at higher concentration in organisms higher up the food chain (higher trophic levels).  There are some substances that bioconcentrate in fish, but do not biomagnify because the things that eat the fish can efficiently metabolize the substance.  \n\n\nand 3) Transportation/exposure - the tendency of substance move from the location it is released in the ecosystem.  More volatile substances are more easily transported around the globe (hence the many problems associated with mercury).  Give a long enough lifetime, most things will be cycled throughout the global ecosphere (to the poles, oceans, all land masses, etc.). \n\nThere are a handful of POPs (persistent organic pollutants-- of which DDT is one of the most infamous, see http://www.pops.int) which persist in the environment for decades or centuries.  The key to minimizing the risk from these substances is to stop their release into the environment so that even the very slow degradation can eliminate them from the ecosystem.\n\nTo sum up, DDT (and other POPs) is very persistent, it bioaccumulates up the food chain (so high-level predators like eagles and polar bears have higher concentrations in their tissues) and is fairly easily transported.

question_title: is the world a colder place today then in the 1930's? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, temperatures are going up due to Global Warming.\n\nCO2 is 30% higher than it has been for 650,000 years. Methane is 130% greater. These are two of the main pollutants humans put into the atmosphere in excess, and they are two of the primary greenhouse gases.\n\nLook at the 'hockeystick', which shows a dramatic warming since 1950 after a fairly stable climate for 1000 years. In fact, the 10 hottest years in recorded history have all happened since 1990, with 2005 being the hottest, and 2006 is shaping up to maybe break that record.\n(see links below)\n\nHow's that for proof of man's fault in this? There is ample proof, any real scientist will tell you that.\n\nThere has NEVER been an article doubting man's influence on global warming published in a peer-reviewed journal. A recent study of almost 1000 proved that.\n\nYes, the earth naturally heats and cools, but the rate and amount we are warming now is unprecedented in the recent geologic past. We are doing this, and we must stop it. This is not some political statement or rhetoric. This is science trying to educate a crass, ignorant public of the damage they are doing. The magnitude of temperature increase ALREADY is about 10x that of the 'little ice age' of the middle ages, and rate and amount are only going up. \n\nJust to be clear, glacial and interglacial cycles are mainly controlled by astronomical fluctuations, but we have a detailed record of the last 7 cycles, and what the climate and CO2 is doing now is way different and extreme. The rate of increase is much higher than in the past AND the value itself is much higher.\n\nHI CO2: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4467420.stm\nHOCKEY STICK: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5109188.stm\nGeneral climate stuff: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3897061.stm	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the difference between a CARDIAC ARREST & a HEART ATTACK? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They are not the same.\n\nCardiac arrest is when a heart stops beating / contracting. That is when you give a CPR and either shock the heart or give appropriate drugs to treat it.\n\nHeart attack is when the heart muscles die as a result of not getting enough blood supply. Here you give drugs directed to improve the blood supply of the heart. In most cases the heart keeps beating after the heart attack. But rarely, if many of the muscle fibers are dead, the person's heart stops beating too. In those cases, cardiac arrest happens as a result of heart attack.\n\nHope its clear to you now.

question_title: How many integers between 1 an 1000000 have the sum of their digits equal to 18? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I can show that the answer is 25927 without using computer.\n\n\nFirst, we can ignore 1000000 since its sum of digits is not 18. Also, let's add 0's in front of numbers to have 6 digits if the number has less than 6 digits. So our range is going to be from 000001 to 999999.\n\nNumber of partition of 18 into 6 whole number is\n(18+6-1)C(6-1)=(23)C(5). Assign these 6 numbers to the 6 digits.\n\nNow, we need to remove the cases where one digit is 10 or bigger. It is very good thing that two digits cannot be 10 or bigger, as the sum would go over 18.\n\nLet one digit has x, where x>=10. The sum of the other 5 digits is 18-x. Since 18-x is partitioned into 5 whole numbers, we have (18-x+4)C(4) possible ways. This should be multiplied by 6 since the big digit can be the first digit, second digit, ..., sixth digit. x is from 10 to 18. So we need to calculate 6((12)C(4) + (11)C(4) + .... + (4)C(4)).\n\nSince (n)C(m)+(n)C(m+1)=(n+1)C(m+1), we get\n(4)C(4) + (5)C(4) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((5)C(5) + (5)C(4)) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((6)C(5) + (6)C(4)) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n...\n=(13)C(5). (This shows beauty of mathematics, doesn't it?)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (23)C(5)-6*(13)C(5)=25927.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the symbiotic relationship between beetle larvae(mealworms) and protozoa in their digestive tract? [SEP] question_content: This is for a Bio experiment, please help. [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the specific protozoa; if for example both the mealworm and the protozoa benefit from the relationship (the protozoa has a nice place to live and feed and the mealworm benefits from the protozoa breaking down other organic matter in the mealworms digestive system) it would be a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.  If, however, the protozoa is using the mealworm as a host carrier in its life cycle as a staging area to propagate itself, lay eggs, or feed on until it is deposited somewhere and it negatively affects the health of the mealworm, it is a parasitic relationship (the protozoa being the parasite).

question_title: why are there 60 seconds in a minute and not a number llike 10 or 100? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You can blame the ancient Babylonians who had a base-60 (sexagesimal) system for counting.\n\nThey liked 60 because it is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6... and it can also be divided by ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty. \n1/2 hr = 30 minutes\n1/3 hour = 20 minutes\n1/4 hour = 15 minutes\n1/5 hour = 12 minutes\n1/6 hour = 10 minutes\n\nIn addition to using base sixty, the Babylonians also made use of six and ten as sub-bases. \n\nTo this day, we bear the legacies of almost every number system our ancestors experimented with. From the duo-decimal systems we have twenty-four hours in a day, twelve inches in a foot, and special words such as dozen (meaning 12) and gross (meaning 12 x 12 = 144). \n\nFrom the Babylonians‚Äô sexagesimal system we have sixty seconds in a minute, sixty minutes in an hour, and 360 degrees in a circle, where 360 degrees is derived from the product of the Babylonian's main base (sixty) and their sub-base (six); that is, 60 x 6 = 360.\n\nThe French at one time tried to mandate a base-10 time system, (10 hours in a day, 100 minutes per hour), but it never caught on.  So like much of the weirdness of our 3 ft / yd, 1760 yd. / mile, 8 oz / cup, etc. we have to live with numbers that aren't all based on 10.  I wish it were so, but it isn't.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: will anyone give me the historic sequence how and what make the avogadro to derive the hypothesis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The name "Avogadro's Number" is just an honorary name attached to the calculated value of the number of atoms, molecules, etc. in a gram mole of any chemical substance. Of course if we used some other mass unit for the mole such as "pound mole", the "number" would be different than 6.022 x 1023. \n\nThe first person to have calculated the number of molecules in any mass of substance was Josef Loschmidt, (1821-1895), an Austrian high school teacher, who in 1865, using the new Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT) calculated the number of molecules in one cubic centimeter of gaseous substance under ordinary conditions of temperature of pressure, to be somewhere around 2.6 x 1019 molecules. This is usually known as  "Loschmidt's Constant."  (This value, no, is now listed at the NIST web site as 2.686 7775 x 1025 m-3)\n\nWhen was the first time the term "Avogadro Number" was used?  The designation seems to originate in a 1909 paper entitled "Brownian Movement and Molecular Reality."  by Jean Baptiste Jean Perrin (b. Lille, France, 30.9.1870-d. New York, 17.4.1942.)  This paper was translated into English from the French in Annals De Chimie et de Physique by Fredric Soddy and is available.  Perrin, was the 1926 Nobel Laureate in Physics for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium.  Perrin should be very well known to anyone who does calculations in molecular dynamics.  Most of these methods were developed by Perrin.   In his paper Perrin says "The invariable number N is a universal constant, which may be appropriately designated "Avogadro's Constant." \n\nIn the presentation of his Nobel prize in 1926 it was said of the work of Perrin:  \n\nIt may perhaps be said that in the work which we have just summarized Perrin has offered indirect evidence for the existence of molecules. Here, follows a direct evidence. Microscopic particles in a liquid are never at rest. They are in perpetual movement, even under conditions of perfect external equilibrium, constant temperature, etc. The only irrefutable explanation for this phenomenon ascribes the movements of the particles to shocks produced on them by the molecules of the liquid themselves. A mathematical theory of this phenomenon has been given by Einstein. The first experimental proof of this theory was given by a German physicist, Seddig. After him, the problem was taken up by two scientists simultaneously. One of them was Perrin; the other Svedberg. I have to speak of Perrin only. His measurements on the Brownian movement showed that Einstein's theory was in perfect agreement with reality. Through these measurements a new determination of Avogadro's number was obtained. \n\nThe molecular impacts produce not only a forward movement of the particles distributed in a liquid, but also a rotational movement. The theory of this rotation was developed by Einstein. Measurements in relation herewith were carried out by Perrin. In these measurements he has found another method for determining Avogadro's number. What then is the result of these researches ? How many molecules are there in two grams of hydrogen? The three methods have given the following answers to this question: 68.2 x 1022; 68.8 x 1022; 65 x 1022.\n\nThe work of Einstein and Perrin gave some of the first concrete evidence for the existence of molecules, entities many still did not recognize even into the early 1900's.   And Avogadro's Number has a value that must be measured experimentally.    Subsequent to the work of Loschmidt and Perrin many scientists carried out many experiments using a variety of techniques to arrive at the most accurate value for this the number of molecules in one mole of substance.  And by 1933 there was still no universal agreement as to what the number should be called.  In a paper entitled "Loschmidt's Number", publi	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can "any humanbeing"can touch the stars...? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Stars are massive, glowing balls of hot gases, mostly hydrogen and helium. Some stars are extremely hot, while others are cooler. You can tell by the color of light that the stars give off. If you look at the coals in a charcoal grill, you know that the red glowing coals are cooler than the white hot ones. The same is true for stars. A blue or white star is hotter than a yellow star, which is hotter than a red star. Temperature of stars range in the high hundreds to thousands degrees F. So to touch the stars that are in the sky is almost impossible, as your body would burn due to high temperatures surrounding them.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Are people made from Stardust? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely.\n\nIt is now thought (and even more radio telescope survey evidence on this has just come in) that at the very beginning of things (the Big Bang) there was nothing but energy. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles were formed from that energy, and some time later, things cooled enough for atoms to form and stay together. Since it takes force to push protons together (to form nuclei of the higher atomic number atoms), and the force wasn't available, only hydrogen (and a very small amount of helium and perhaps an even smaller amount of lithium -- the simplest atoms) resulted.\n\nLots of hydrogen, distributed in a sort of clumpy manner, will eventually collapse into stars. Large stars burn through their available fuel relatively quickly, all the while forcing together protons into more complex atoms such as carbon and oxygen and silicon, and so on. When these large stars go nova, they spray a good part of themselves into interstellar space where the material is incorporated into newly forming stars or collected into clouds around them. As those clouds collapse into planets (which must be very common as we have now seen some hundreds of them around stars in the local area in our galaxy (ie, within a few hundred light years)), the non-hydrogen material in them is actually star stuff. Probably not really dust particles in most cases, but...\n\nAnd that's how it was. Fascinating stuff.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is the importance of solar energy and why do people use and where does it come from? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is suppose to be common sense by now well unless you're 6 yr old then that's different. So I guess you need read this:\n\nsolar energy, any form of energy radiated by the sun, including light, radio waves, and X rays, although the term usually refers to the visible light of the sun. Solar energy is needed by green plants for the process of photosynthesis, which is the ultimate source of all food. The energy in fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil) and other organic fuels (e.g., wood) is derived from solar energy. Difficulties with these fuels have led to the invention of devices that directly convert solar energy into usable forms of energy, such as electricity. Solar batteries, which operate on the principle that light falling on photosensitive substances causes a flow of electricity, play an important part in space satellites and, as they become more efficient, are finding increasing use on the earth (see solar cell). Thermoelectric generators convert the heat generated by solar energy directly into electricity (see thermoelectricity). Several projects have produced electricity on a large scale by using the solar energy available in desert areas. In one system, large numbers of solar batteries generate electricity for Coconut Island, off the coast of Australia. In another, oil flows through pipes that are set in reflecting parabolic troughs that can trap the heat from sunlight falling on them. The heat from the oil is then converted into electricity (see power, electric). Heat from the sun is used in air-drying a variety of materials and in producing salt by the evaporation of seawater. Solar heating systems can supply heat and hot water for domestic use; heat collected in special plates on the roof of a house is stored in rocks or water held in a large container. Such systems, however, usually require a conventional heater to supplement them. Solar stoves, which focus the sun's heat directly, are employed in regions where there is much perennial sunlight.\n\nAlso there are tons of info on this on the web just go to Yahoo search or Google and type in Solar Energy. It's not that hard.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is chip designing ,explain with an example? [SEP] question_content: can this designing be confined only to printed circuit boards? [SEP] best_answer: The process of circuit design can cover systems ranging from national power grids all the way down to the individual transistors within an integrated circuit. For simple circuits the design process can often be done by one person simply designing the circuit as they go along, but for more complex designs, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation are becoming increasingly common.\n\nFormal circuit design usually involves the following stages:\n\nsometimes, writing the requirement specification after liaising with the customer \nwriting a technical proposal to meet the requirements of the customer specification \nsynthesising on paper an abstract electrical or electronic circuit that will meet the specifications \ncalculating the component values to meet the operating specifications under specified conditions \nbuilding a breadboard or other prototype version of the design and testing against specification \nmaking any alterations to the circuit to achieve compliance \nchoosing a method of construction as well as all the parts and materials to be used \npresenting component and layout information to draughtspersons, and layout and mechanical engineers, for prototype production \ntesting or type-testing a number of prototypes to ensure compliance with customer reqiurements \nsigning and approving the final manufacturing drawings \npost-design services (obsolescence of components etc.) \nContents [hide]\n1 Specification \n2 Design \n2.1 Costs \n3 Verification and testing \n4 Prototyping \n5 Results \n5.1 Documentation \n6 See also \n7 References \n \n\n\n[edit]\nSpecification\nThe process of circuit design begins with the specification, which states the functionality that the finished design must provide, but does not indicate how it is to be achieved .[1] The initial specification is basically a technically detailed description of what the customer wants the finished circuit to achieve and can include a variety of electrical requirements, such as what signals the circuit will receive, what signals it must output, what power supplies are available and how much power it is permitted to consume. The specification can ( and normally does ) also set some of the physical parameters that the design must meet, such as size, weight, moisture resistance, temperature range, thermal output, vibration tolerance and acceleration tolerance.\n\nAs the design process progresses the designer(s) will frequently return to the specification and alter it to take account of the progress of the design. This can involve tightening specifications that the customer has supplied, and adding tests that the circuit must pass in order to be accepted. These additional specifications will often be used in the verification of a design. Changes that conflict with or modify the customer's original specifications will almost always have to be approved by the customer before they can be acted upon.\n\nCorrectly identifying the customer needs can avoid a condition known as 'design creep' which occurs in the absence of realistic initial expectations, and later by failing to communicate fully with the client during the design process. It can be defined in terms of its results; "at one extreme is a circuit with more functionality than necessary, and at the other is a circuit having an incorrect functionality". (DeMers, 1997) Nevertheless some changes can be expected and the wise designer keeps his options open: it's easier to remove spare gates from the circuit later on than it is to put them in.\n\n[edit]\nDesign\nThe design process involves moving from the specification at the start, to a plan that contains all the information needed to be physically constructed at the end, this normally happens by passing through a number of stages, although in very simple circuit it may be done in a single step. [2] The process normally begins with the conversion of the specification into a block diagra	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: Zinc is a much more reactive metal than Copper.  Zinc is much higher on the activity series than Copper.\n\nWhen Zinc metal is added to a Copper +2 solution, the Zinc will displace the Copper in solution, precipiating out Copper metal while Zinc ions go into solution.\n\nZn (s) + Cu+2 (aq) --> Zn+2 (aq) + Cu (s)\n\nSince Zinc (II) Sulfate is soluble in water, the Sulfate (SO4-2) ion is a spectator ion in the reaction, it is in solution on both sides of the reaction.

The simple fact is , if that the Idea or notion should make you wonder,than trust and believe that your not the only one who does.How can the possibility of extra-terrestial life NOT exist? The 'Rozwell Incident' was no hoax!! and was promptly swept under the carpet by Government whitewashing techniques.The consesus of people who kept investigating Rozwell, echo words of a 'Trade Off' with the Beings who survived the crash,..There Technology for their ability to continue with whatever they were here for in the first place.It would seem ignorant,for lack of a better word,and closed minded to assume that there is NO other Life forms in the entire expanse of our known Galaxy or for that fact our Universe.Ive taken a keen interest in the existence of Intelligent Life forms after the eye witness account of one of the Space Shuttle Astronauts(and crew) while attached to a teather in open Space.There are 2 sources that might interest you, if you  wish to further investigate;~~~~~~~1) The Bob Lazar Story... \nIn 1989, Robert Lazar came forward with an incredible story : He had been recruited by the US government to work at the top secret Groom Lake/Area 51 research base better known as "Dreamland" (actually at the S4 site, Papoose Lake which is a few miles to the south of Groom Lake) to reverse engineer alien spacecraft! Here are a few things he learned. \nThe disc's reactor uses a fuel which does not occur naturally on Earth. This fuel is a super-heavy, stable, element with an atomic number of 115 and does not appear on our periodic chart. Element 115 has a twofold purpose : First, it is the source of a gravity wave that is unknown to Earth's scientists, the "Gravity A" wave. Second, it is the source of the anti-matter radiation which is reacted to provide power.\nThe Gravity A wave eminates from the nucleus of Element 115 and actually extends past the perimeter of the atom. The propulsion system of the disc amplifies and focuses this Gravity A wave to cause space/time to bend, much like space/time bends in the intense gravitational field of a black hole. The ability to direct gravity to cause space/time distortions allows the disc to cross vast expanses of space/time without travelling in a linear mode at a high rate of speed. \nInside the reactor, the Element 115 is transmuted to Element 116 which is unstable and immediately decays releasing antimatter. The antimatter is reacted with gaseous matter which causes a total annihilation reaction, the 100 percent conversion of matter to energy. The heat from this reaction is converted to electrial energy by a solid state, near 100 percent efficient thermoelectric generator. It is this energy that is used to amplify the Gravity A wave. \nThis mode of travel is one of the two methods of propulsion used by the disc. In this mode, the disc's gravity amplifiers  are in the "delta configuration" and are pulsed sequentially in a rotational pattern. This amplified Gravity A wave is so powerful that the only natural occurring source of gravity that could cause space/time to distort this much would be a black hole! \nThe other mode of travel is the "omicron configuration" and is used for short range travel near a source of gravity such as a planet or star. When a disc travels near another source of gravity, like Earth, the Gravity A wave, which propagates outward from the disc, is phase shifted into the Gravity B wave, which propagates outward from the Earth, and this creates lift. The gravity amplifiers of the disc can be focused independently and they are pulsed and do not stay on continuously.  \nAlien UFO propulsion systems according to Bob Lazar...2) this is a websi	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What are SPECTRA ropes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: SPECTRA¬Æ Double Braided\n\nOne of the most popular high performance lines, G-Force is a double braided rope consisting of 100% polyester braided cover and a 100% Allied Signal's Spectra¬Æ braided core. It was engineered for General Marine, Industrial, and Commercial Fishing applications where extra low elongation and extremely high strength-to-weight ratio of Spectra¬Æ are required. Spectra¬Æ double braided rope often replaces wire of the same diameter. Great for Merchant Marine, Industrial, Commercial Fishing, and Recreational Boating applications. \n\nThis rope offers extremely high strength and low stretch, and is one of the toughest lines around. The HMPE minor tendency to creep is minimized with advanced core design, and this rope is much more tolerant of standard size sheaves than an aramid (e.g. Kevlar¬Æ, Twaron¬Æ) rope. Because the specific gravity of Spectra¬Æ is less than 1.0, size-for-size G-Force is one of the lighter ropes around. Downsize and your weight savings is twofold. This is one tough rope, built to withstand mistrals and gale force winds! The cover is a dazzling tri-color weave, a base color combined with two separate multi-tracers running in opposite directions.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how many fundamental particles are known? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Good question. It depends on whether you count exchange particles (ie particles associated with the fundemental forces of nature), if you count antiparticles, and which particle physics model you are using.\n\nIn the "Standard Model" of particle physics there are the follwing fundemental particles (the word's in CAPTIALS are the type of particle):\n\nLEPTONS:\nelectron, muon, tau.\nelectron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino.\n\nQUARKS:\nup, charmed, top.\ndown, strange, bottom.\n\nGAUGE BOSONS:\nphoton, W+, W-, Z0 (note the +, - and 0 are superscripts)\n8 different gluons.\n\nand finally... the Higgs Boson (still undiscovered).\n\nThis doesn't count antiparticles, of which there are 12 (6 anti-leptons and 6 anti-quarks).\n\n\nSome theories introduce a whole host of new particles, but none of these extra particles have been discovered either.

question_title: how do the cells produced by meiosis reeestablish a complete set pf chromosomes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Remember that meiosis is the formation of gametes from germ cells.  Our bodies begin the process of making germ cells very early in our development, and the precursors to sperm/egg cells are in tact well before puberty.  When a woman ovulates, at the end, four of these egg cells complete the maturity stage in each cycle, but only one survives to become an ovulated egg (accompanied by 3 polar bodies).  This egg (and its complement sperm) have ONE set of chromosomes each, and upon fertilization, the zygote will have 2 copies of every chromosome, one from the sperm, and one from the egg.

question_title: What is the difference between amps and horsepower? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the motor and VFD variable frequency drive industry, the standard speak is Amps, which is replacing HP old school.\n\nYou must realize that in an industry in which the typical 3phase power is based on 480VAC.\n\nThis means when someone is sizing a motor for a specific application they speak of the Amps need to perform the task.\n\nThe drives (VFD) which I work on are typically between 10amp up to 3000amp. Usually, 480Vac, sometimes 600Vac or 690Vac.\nA drive which is rated at 690Vac, 705amp is 600Vac, 800amp for the same drive.\n\nYou need to know both, HP and Amp for the machines which you are interested in. That means what is the typical voltage for the area. USA vs Canada vs UK vs Asia They are all different. \n\nKeep in mind Amps are Amps regardless where you are. Heavy wire sizing is crucial.

question_title: Is evolution possible? Does the scientific advancements gives enough evidence for it? [SEP] question_content: Please answer this with reference to the complexity of life and the chance of origin of life from a state of nothingness. [SEP] best_answer: First, let me get some ambiguous terms out of the way. First, there's micro-evolution. This is like breeding dogs to get the dog you want. Then, there's macro-evolution, which is breeding dogs to get a human after milllions of years. Okay.\nMicro-evolution is, obviously, possible because the genes of the dogs change to let it's grandchild be a different kind of dog. However, there's a limit to how much genes can change. After a while, the dog will be really different from his ancestors (chihuahuas and great danes) but can never turn into a non-dog. I've never seen a dog give birth to a cat-dog. It's just not possible. Think of it this way. If you take the word "Cat" and change one letter at a time, you can come up with "hat," "mat," and "pat." Can you ever come up with "orange?" No, orange doesn't have three letters.\n  The only way for evolution to be possible is if a lizard mates with a squirrel to produce a bird. And I don't think it's possible for that to happen, do you? Sure, donkeys and horses can mate to produce mules, but they're related (like dogs and wolves.)\n   If you ever see an owl-kangaroo, I'll take this back.

[SEP] question_content: based on comparable distances for animals and human distances [SEP] best_answer: It's probably a wash. The weight of the body is distributed over twice the number of legs, so each leg has to do less work. More legs, though, mean that there's more energy required to move them all. The more legs thing could be cut down depending on the gait.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How do you solve the Math Puzzle of the Hexagonal Pattern "The disguised triangles?"? [SEP] question_content: I am looking for how to prove the correct answer. [SEP] best_answer: I'm assuming you are referring to the disguised triangles in the attached link... (link 1).  I'm sure there are some rigorous mathematical proofs you could supply, or automated ways to count the triangles, but I basically decided to just use the "brute force" method of counting.  The hard part is recognizing all the different triangles while not double counting...\n\nWhat I finally did was to create several copies of the diagram and tried to color the triangles.  You can color the individual triangles (24), right off the bat.  Now if you try to pair up triangles, you can pair them one way (12) or another using the flipped image (12).  Grouping them further in groups of three or four triangles, I counted another set of (7) and the flip for another (7).  Then I noticed four other ways to group four triangles (3), (3), (3), (3).  Lastly, there are two large triangles composed of the inner sixteen triangles (1) and (1).\n\nAltogether I got seventy (76) triangles.  You can double check my work using the attached image (link 2).  I think I got them all and didn't double count...	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Computing height vs distance to horizon? [SEP] question_content: If you know your height above the ground, how far away is the horizon, or how can compute the distance to the horizon? [SEP] best_answer: It's a geometry problem.  Suppose you're high up in a building on the beach overlooking the ocean.  You're at height h above sea level.\n\nNow draw a circle which represents the earth, with radius r.  Your distance from the center of the earth is r+h.  The horizon is some distance away, x.  Your line of sight to the horizon is <tangent> to the radius of the earth, forming a right triangle, where the hypoteneuse is r+h.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\nr^2 + x^2 = (r+h)^2 = r^2 + 2rh + h^2\nx^2 = 2rh + h^2\nx = sqrt(2rh + h^2)\n\nThat's the exact answer,  But for practical purposes, 2rh is <much, much> bigger than h^2.  To see this, suppose you're 500 feet in the air.  That's about a tenth of a mile, and using miles, h^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01.  On the other hand, the earth's radius is about 4000 miles, so 2rh = 2 x 4000 x 0.1 = 800.  This is 80,000 times bigger than h^2.\n\nSo we can safely ignore the h^2, and say x = sqrt(2rh).  That can be broken down further.  Again using miles (you can also do this in kilometers),\n\nx = sqrt(2rh) = sqrt(2r) sqrt h = sqrt(8000) sqrt h = 90 sqrt h\n\n(rounding off, since sqrt 8000 = 89.44; also, h must be in miles).\n\nUsing the formula x = 90 sqrt h, suppose you're in an airplane 4 miles up in the air (21,000 feet).  Then the horizon is 90 sqrt 4 = 180 miles away.\n\nOkay, now let's work it out for h in feet instead of miles.  We'll go back to the formula x = sqrt(2rh), and use r = 3960 miles (a more accurate figure).  Then\n\nx = sqrt(2 x 3960 x h / 5280) = sqrt(3h/2) = 1.225 sqrt h\n\nwhere h is in feet and x is in miles.\n\nTwo examples:  (1) For h = 6 feet, use x = sqrt(3h/2) = 3 miles.  (2) For x = 100 feet, use x = 1.225 sqrt h = 12.25 miles.\n\nTo recap:  For h in miles, use x = 90 sqrt h.  For h in feet, either use x = sqrt(3h/2) or x = 1.225 sqrt h.\n\nIn all cases, x will be in miles.  And of course, all of this can be done using meters and kilometers.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Bernoulli's principle? [SEP] question_content: how is a barometer used to pertain to bernoulli's principle? [SEP] best_answer: From an amateur:\n\nBernoulli's principle says that a rise (fall) in pressure in a flowing fluid must always be accompanied by a decrease (increase) in the speed, and conversely, if an increase (decrease) in , the speed of the fluid results in a decrease (increase) in the pressure. This is at the heart of a number of everyday phenomena. As a very trivial example, Bernouilli's principle is responsible for the fact that a shower curtain gets ``sucked inwards'' when the water is first turned on. What happens is that the increased water/air velocity inside the curtain (relative to the still air on the other side) causes a pressure drop. The pressure difference between the outside and inside causes a net force on the shower curtain which sucks it inward. A more useful example is provided by the functioning of a perfume bottle: squeezing the bulb over the fluid creates a low pressure area due to the higher speed of the air, which subsequently draws the fluid up.\n\nThis lowering of pressure in a constriction of a flow path may seem counterintuitive, but seems less so when you consider pressure to be energy density. In the high velocity flow through the constriction, kinetic energy must increase at the expense of pressure energy.\n\nBy measuring the pressure of the medium (by way of a barometer) we can tell a lot about it's velocity and overall energy.  This data would be useful for aeronautics (i.e. airfoil research), civil engineering (i.e. water and waste management), and meteorology (i.e. storm watching).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is the universe and ordered or chaotic one? why? [SEP] question_content: Is the universe and ordered or chaotic one? why? [SEP] best_answer: This is not an either/or situation.  The Universe as seen by physics is a trend for ordered sub-systems to become more chaotic over time.  This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics which states "The entropy of an isolated system not at equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value."  However NO sub-system is ever really isolated.\n\nLiving systems tend to reverse the "normal flow" toward higher entropy.  One might say that life runs counter to the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Living systems tend to induce order to random elements of the Universe over time.\n\nThe best answer to your question is that the Universe is both Ordered and Chaotic, depending upon what localized portion of the space-time continuum one is observing.

question_title: Gravitational Potential Energy? [SEP] question_content: A shot-putter puts a shot (weight = 71.6 N) that leaves his hand at distance of 1.60 m above the ground.\n(a) Find the work done by the gravitation force when the shot has risen to a height of 2.09 m above the ground. \n \n(b) Determine the change (PE = PEf - PE0) in the gravitational potential energy of the shot. [SEP] best_answer: Work = Force x Distance\n\nIn this case, since the shot is going up, i.e. opposite the force, the work done on the shot is negative.  Another way to look at it, if up is our positive direction, the distance will be positive but the force, i.e. the weight, is negative.  Note that the distance over which the weight acts is the difference in height, not the entire height of the shot relative to the ground.\n\nW = Force x distance = Weight x distance = - 71.6 N (2.09 m- 1.60m)\n\nI'll leave the arithmetic to you.\n\nTo answer the second part, just notice that the change in potential energy of the shot will be equal in amount to the work done on it.  Just take away the negative sign, since its potential energy is increasing. Another way of looking at it is to say that the work done on the shot takes away its kinetic energy, hence the negative sign, and converts it to potential energy.\n\nSince you're only concerned with the change in potential energy, you only have to concern yourself with the difference in height.  If you want to use the ground as the reference level, and calculate potential energy, you get\n\nDEL PE = PFf - PEi = Weight x final height - weight x initial height\n\nDel PE = 71.6 N (2.09 m- 1.60m)\n\nSo it works out to the same thing.  Yippee.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What happens (physically) when the Earth experiences a 'Pole shift'? [SEP] question_content: Please be specific without scientific terms. Does the earth stop rotating and spin the other direction? If not, What? What happens on the surface of the Earth? [SEP] best_answer: well there are two answers.  The pole is actually shifting as we speak albeit to such a minor degree that we would never notice during our lifetimes.  The present 'north star' polaris was not always the 'north star' and in the future a new 'north star' will take it's place.  There have been drastic pole shifts possibly resulting from the passage of an enormous comet or asteroid within or close to the orbit of the moon.  When this occurs, drastic changes take place in a short span of time.  It is theorized that the break-up of pangaea into the continents was caused by a sudden pole shift.  From Straight Dope :Geologist Jean Andrews of Columbia University has found evidence to suggest that 180 million years ago the poles were displaced about 22 degrees from their present alignment, with the North Pole located on the northern coast of what is now the Soviet Union.

An example would be the wetlands in Arkansas where the Ivory Billed Woodpecker was recently seen.  This is protected in the same way that a national park is.\n\nA biosphere is a specific ecosystem, including all plants and possibly animals, that exists in an area not normally associated with this ecosystem.  Because of the translocation and possible interaction with local ecosystems, a biosphere must be completely enclosed and self-sustaining.  An example would be, say, a rainforest that is maintained within a zoo.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What's the domain of f(x) = x^x? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: 0 can't be in the domain.\nAlso, -1/2 cannot be in the domain because\n(-1/2)^(-1/2) = 1/sqrt(-1/2) which is not a real number\nI'm not sure exactly how to right this:\nThe domain is any real number except 0 and any number of the form (p/q), where p and q do not have any common factors and q is even and (p/q) is negative.\nIf (p/q) is negative and reduced and q is even, then you would be taking an even root of a negative number(which is never a real number).

Possibly one of the best-written and moth truthful ones I have seen.  It's amazing how well people have hushed up the most recent climatological results which indicate a plateau in global temperatures.\n\nAs they noted at the end of the article, I think it's time we gave up on this misguided effort to "reduce man-made CO2", and start worrying about real issues like shortages of drinking water and environmental pollution.\n\nClimate fluctuations are part of the earth cycle- and we honestly don't understand enough about they systems and their interactions to have any idea how we could possibly effect it.  But the science is in:  this happens ALL the time in earth history, and it's pretty arrogant of us to think that this time it's our fault!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the Singular Value Decomposition for? [SEP] question_content: I dont know, can anybody tell me what is it for? what application i can do with the SVD? [SEP] best_answer: First of all, let me know at what standard u need the answer.  Accordingly I will answer.  Essentially, SVD is used in Matrix algebra.  If you are below graduation, here is the simplest answer.\n\nSuppose you have two linear equations, with two unknowns, we will try to solve them as simultaneous equations.  similarly, if there are three quations with three unknowns, still we can attempt for solution.  Suppose there are mor equations than the number of unknowns, as in the case of randomised variables, that is four equations but three unknowns then the problem becomes serious.  we need to find the unknowns but satisfying all the equations.  Here we use this technique.  We try to find the solution of such cases using matrix inversion using Marquardt's algorithm or the solution of the characteristic equation leads to finding the eigen values.  So and so the theory continues.  That is why I asked at what level u need the answer?	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What will be the genotype and allele frequencies of the next generation? [SEP] question_content: Suppose that a small island population of 100 individuals is visited by 25 sailors who decide to stay and raise families.  Suppose also that 36% of the original population had a counter clockwise hair whorl and that all the sailors had a counter clock wise hair whorl.  \n\nWhat will be the genotype and allele frequencies of the next generation?\n\nThis is an example of what kind of evoluntionary force? [SEP] best_answer: This is a fairly long answer... first you need to get the initial allele frequencies. equation is p2 + 2pq + q2 (p2 and q2 from here on in is p squared and q squared)\nSince I am left to assume that counter clockwise is recessive then .36 is the initial q2. Taking the square root of that we get .6 as the initial allele frequency for q. 1-q=p so p=1-.6=.4. In other words, the island initally has 80p (clockwise)alleles and 120q (counterclockwise) alleles since humans are diploid and have two copies of each gene.\nNow, the 25 sailors have have added 50 copies of the q allele thereby changing the allele frequencies. The new allele frequencies are (120+50)/250 for q and 80/250 for p. when you do the math you get .32 for p and .68 for q. This will be the allele frequencies for the next generation too. \nNow plugging those numbers into the equation that I sited earlier you get .1024 for p2, .4352 for 2pq and .4624 for q2. You can give those a dominant/recessive notation such as WW for p2, Ww for 2pq, and ww for q2 to show genotype frequencies. \n\nThe evolutionary force at work is migration. \nhope this is what you were looking for.

question_title: Velocity Physics Question? [SEP] question_content: A ball is thrown with an initial velocity of 110 ft/s at an angle of 500 above the horizontal.\n Using g = 9.8m/s2, find:\n \ni)  Maximum height (apex).\nii)  Time to top (apex).\niii)  Total time of flight.\niv)  Down range of the ball.\nv)  Velocity of the ball upon striking ground. [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure what 500 above the horizontal means - radians maybe?  Or is there something missing, like a launch angle, and that you're 500 ft above ground when the ball is thrown?\n\nIf I'm picturing the scenario right, you're basically shooting a ball up at an angle and finding all of the specifics - max height, velocity at impact, etc.  All of those can be found using some of the following equations:\n\nvf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad\nvf = vi + at\nd = vt\n\nwhere\nvf = final velocity\nvi = initial velocity\na = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2 or 32.2 ft/s^2)\nt = time\nd = distance\n\nHorizontal and vertical velocity are independent of each other.  The vertical velocity changes due to gravity, and the horizontal velocity will remain constant throughout the ball's flight (assuming no air resistance is in play).  So to find the max height, we'd need the vertical velocity component of the 110 ft/s.  That comes out to 110 sin x (where x is that launch angle I asked for earlier).  So this will be your vi in your first equation.  vf = 0 at the apex (the ball has stopped and is about to reverse direction), and since you are decelerating, use -32.2 ft/s^2 (I know you specified 9.8 m/s^2, but the units don't match the 110 ft/s - you can always convert one or the other if you like).  Solving that first equation will give you the distance it traveled.  If there is an additional height involved (remember if I asked if you were 500 ft above ground?) then your total height from ground level would be your answer from the equation plus 500.\n\nThe time to the apex can be found with the second equation.  Again, using vi = 110 sin x and vf = 0, you can solve for the time (and again, keep your units consistent or else the answer doesn't make sense).\n\nLet's jump to the last question about the velocity of the ball upon impact.  If it falls to the same height that it was thrown at, then the velocity on impact will be the same as the launch velocity - 110 ft/s.  But if there is that additional 500 ft height, we can use that first equation to find the vertical component of the impact velocity.  If we were to picture that part of the equation as starting from the apex, vi = 0.  The distance d will be the distance found in part (i) plus 500 ft.  So you can solve for the final velocity there - but remember that this only solves for that vertical component of the total velocity.  You'd need to find that total via the Pythagorean theorem - picture a triangle with the vertical velocity as one leg, and 100 cos x (the horizontal component of the original launch velocity) as the other leg.  Square both, add, and take the square root to find the total velocity on impact.\n\nOn to part (iii) - now that you have the final velocity (just use the vertical component as calculated above), you can use the second equation to find the time it took to fall from the apex to the ground.  Add this to the answer in part (ii) and you have the total time in flight.\n\nDown range, I'm assuming, is the horizontal distance the ball traveled.  Using the third equation, you can find that.  The velocity in this case is the horizontal component of the launch velocity - 100 cos x.  Take this times the time from part (iii) and you have the range.\n\nHope this helps - figure out what that launch angle is and how that 500 plays in to the equation and you should be on your way!

question_title: Why is it so windy yearly around Passover/Easter time? [SEP] question_content: When I was a girl, my mother used to use a term in Spanish called "Vientos de quaresma" which means Easter Winds!I have noticed a lot of wind all day today. I know that in the bible, The Holy Spirit is sometimes referred to as Wind and in the bible, on the day of Pentecost, it mentions how the Holy Spirit's power fell in a powerful way and it was described as a mighty rushing wind and the people in the upper room all began to speak in tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance! [SEP] best_answer: This has little to do with Easter/Passover and more to do with the time they occur, during the vernal equinox. The Sun has crossed the equator back into the Northern hemisphere again, and is causing temperature differentials, with which comes great winds as they cause pressure differentials. \nYou will notice similar violent winds during the autumnal equinox, as the Sun recedes behind the equator again. See the source for more details.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: animal which cannot swim? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: most of the animals mentioned so far can swim, but they are so inefficient at it they are never seen doing it. There are a very select number of animals in the entire world who are physically incapable of swimming, and the majority of them have adapted to living in places where water is almost non-existent. The food of small desert reptiles can include tiny herbivorous organisms such as flying insectoids that are happy to sit on still water, and are highly bouyant, but are incapable of directional swimming on the surface or underwater (Its easier to simply fly for these animals, so the ability was never needed and thus never developed).

question_title: Differentiate 2x sin x? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: As Stuart has said above, you need to use the product rule to work this out.  The product rule states:\n\nthe derivative of f(x)g(x) is f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)\n\nSo, when you differentiate sinx wrtx you get cos and when you differentiate 2x wrtx you get 2.  Plugging these into the formula above you get:\n\n(f(x)g(x))'=2x(cosx)+2(sinx)\n                =2xcosx + 2sinx\n\nHope that this is helpful!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: If a weather report and it says partly cloudy, then the next day it says partly sunny, what‚Äôs the difference? [SEP] question_content: If a weather report and it says partly cloudy, then the next day it says partly sunny, what‚Äôs the difference? [SEP] best_answer: This is a trick question. There really isn't much of a difference. They all mean the sky is part clear, and part cloudy. It just gives us a larger vocabulary to work with. \n\nAlthough most of the time, we'll tend to use it as a bit of psychological factor. If the forecast is improving (as in, rain event is just ending and we'll clear up a bit), we'll usually go partly sunny. \n\nIf the forecast is deteriorating (as in, it's sunny now, but rain moving in tomorrow), we might say mostly cloudy as the condition during the increasing clouds. \n\nWe tend to save 'partly cloudy' for nighttime, since we can't use partly sunny.

[SEP] best_answer: G/H = {xH: x is in G}.\n\nAction: g.(xH) = (gx)H for every g and x in G.\n\nThis is indeed a left action because: (i) the group operation is associative (so (g''g').(xH) = g''.(g'.(xH)) for every g' and g'' in G and (ii) ex= x (so e.(xH) = xH).\n\nIt is transitive because, to satisfy g.(xH) = yH, it is enough to take g = y(x^-1)).\n\nNote: need H to be normal if the notation G/H is to be legit because it means the quotient group. H need not be normal for G to left-act on the *set* {xH: x is in G}, but this set won't be a group w/o normality of H.	Science & Mathematics

I am curious [SEP] best_answer: Space has been an interest for philosophers and scientists for much of human history, and hence it is difficult to provide an uncontroversial and clear definition outside of specific defined contexts. Disagreement exists on whether space itself can be measured or is part of the measuring system. The term is also used somewhat differently in different fields of study. Many fields use an operational definition in which the units of measurement are defined.\n\nSpace is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics, meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present. Thus, similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities (like time and mass), space is defined via measurement. Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second (exact). This definition coupled with present definition of time makes our space-time to be Minkowski space and makes special relativity theory to be absolutely correct by definition.\n\nIn classical physics, space is a three-dimensional Euclidean space where any position can be described using three coordinates. Special and general relativity uses spacetime rather than space; spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional space (with the time axis being imaginary in special relativity and real in general relativity, and currently there are many theories which use more than 4-dimensional spaces (both real and complex).\n\nBefore Einstein's work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's have shown that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one symmetric object -spacetime. (Distances in space or in time separately are not invariant versus Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski spacetime are - which justifies the name).\n\nThe measurement of physical space has long been important. Geometry, the name given to the branch of mathematics which measures spatial relations, was popularised by the ancient Greeks, although earlier societies had developed measuring systems. The International System of Units, (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used within science.\n\nGeography is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing the Earth, utilising spatial awareness to try and understand why things exist in specific locations. Cartography is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualisation purposes and to act as a locational device. Astronomy is the science involved with the observation, explanation and measuring of objects in outer space.\n\nSpace in philosophy\n\nSpace has a range of definitions.\n\nOne view of space is that it is part of the fundamental structure of the universe, a set of dimensions in which objects are separated and located, have size and shape, and through which they can move. \nA contrasting view is that space is part of a fundamental abstract mathematical conceptual framework (together with time and number) within which we compare and quantify the distance between objects, their sizes, their shapes, and their speeds. In this view space does not refer to any kind of entity that is a "container" that objects "move through". \nThese opposing views are relevant also to definitions of time. Space is typically described as having three dimensions, and that three numbers are needed to specify the size of any object and/or its location with respect to another location. Modern physics does not treat space and time as independent dimensions, but treats both as features of spacetime ‚Äì a conception that challenges intuitive notions of distance and time.\n\nAn issue of philosophical debate is whether space is an ontological entity itself, or simply a conceptual fr	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is thoracic outlet syndrom and its treatment? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Thoracic outlet syndrome consists of a group of distinct disorders that affect the nerves that pass into the arms from the neck and various nerves and blood vessels between the base of the neck and armpit. For the most part, these disorders are produced by positional compression of the suclavian artery and vein and the vertebral artery and the cords of the brachial plexus.\n\nIt is often recommended to modify activities in your life and/or workplace that may be aggravating your TOS symptoms. Patients who have jobs that require a significant amount of lifting, overhead and repetitive activity, or use of vibratory tools are encouraged to make changes in their workplace.\n\nPostural problems can be a concern for those experiencing symptoms of brachial plexus compression. These can be addressed with physiotherapy. Exercises to strengthen the muscles in the back (rhomboids), neck (trapezius and levator scapulae), and chest (serratus anterior), and to lengthen or stretch tight scalene muscles in the neck and pectoralis minor can be useful. With physical therapy, patients will notice some improvement. However, significant improvement will require several months of diligent therapy.\n\nSurgery to release the nerves in the region of the thoracic outlet (Brachial Plexus Decompression) is not a simple procedure, and it should be avoided if at all possible. It is only recommended if your problem is significant and there is little improvement in response to non-operative measures.\n\nI hope this could help a little.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why don't microwaves stay hot inside? [SEP] question_content: Why is it when you take something out of a microwave it is always hot...but the inside is never hot.  Unlike an oven...where you can't touch the inside for at least an hour? [SEP] best_answer: An oven cooks by heating the air and then a combination of conduction and convection conveying this heat to the food.\n\nA microwave does not work in this way. It exposes the food with much longer wavelength radiation tuned to directly excite vibrational modes of water molecules. This means that the microwaves only heat things that contain water.

question_title: a contract valued at 15000 requires payment of $1684.65 at the end of every six months.if interest is 7.4%? [SEP] question_content: compunded semi-annually,what is the term of the contract? [SEP] best_answer: You want to find how long the contract is for.  Using the compound interest formula,\nA(t) = A (1+r/n)^(nt) where A(t) is final value, A is starting value, r is interest rate, n is number of times interest is counted in a year, t is number of years. In this case we want to figure t.  Thus,\n\n(15000+1684.65) = 15000(1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n16684.65 = 15000(1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n16684.65/15000 = (1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n1.11231 = (1+.074/2)^(2)(t)\n1.11231 = (1.037)^(2t)\nln (1.11231) = (2t) ln (1.037) \n2t = ln (1.11231) /ln (1.037) \n2t = 2.93\nt = 2.93/2 \nt = 1.47 \nSo the term of the contract is 1.47 years or almost one and half year.

question_title: human body sparking..the "zap" thing.. ever experienced it? [SEP] question_content: static between persons.. why does it happen. can someone explain it please... seriously. [SEP] best_answer: It is just the equalizing of electrical charge between two people or a person and a conductive object.\n\nFor example, if your dragging your feet on the carpet, you are building up a greater negative electrical charge on your body.  When you come in contact with someone who has less negative charge than you, nature tries to make everything equal by sharing some of your negative charge.  \n\nSimilar concept if you add saltwater to pure water, the mix shares the salt with the "less salty" water.  Now the pure water is more salty, but the salt water is less salty than it was.  Hope this helps.\n\nThe link below is a bit more complex, but explains the underlying priciples.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: phytoplankton  About algae? [SEP] question_content: iam full of life.love music&reading [SEP] best_answer: Your question is vague and / or incomplete.Still I will do my best to answer it.\n Planktons = Planktons are microscopic aquatic organisms that float and drift on the water surface. Mostly are single celled but need not be always.The size matters and it has to be microscopic.\nThese planktons are of two main types i) Phytoplanktons and ii) Zooplanktons.\ni)Phytoplanktons-: Basically these are planktons as mentioned above as they fit in to that category.In addition, they have chloroplasts with chlorophyll. So they can prepare their own food like all plants that we know.Therefore the prefix PHYTO- is put before them to indicate their plant like character and affinity with the Plant Kingdom.\nMany unicellular algae come in this group.They are found in the seas as well as fresh water.Diatoms Volvox Chlamydomonas Eudorina Pandorina are but a few examples.\nii) Zooplanktons-:Basically these are planktons as mentioned above as they fit in to that category.But they do not have  chloroplsts like the first one and hence they cannot prepare their own food.Thus they are more animal like in their nutrition and hence the prefix ZOO- is put before them to indicate their animal like character and affinity towards the Animal Kingdom.These are also found in sea and fresh water.Many protozoa and larvae of aquatic animals come in the category.\nHuge animal like Baleen Whale largy depend upon this planktonic flora and fauna for their subsistance.\n Now in the light of the above information kindly rephrase your question. Your personal information will have no bearing on the answer so you need not give it.	Science & Mathematics

Approximate the percent error in computing the area of the circle.  Estimate the maximum allowable percent error in measuring the circumference if the error is computing the area cannot exceed 3%. [SEP] best_answer: The first part of the question is telling you that you have a circle that has a circumference of 56cm, but it could be off by 1.2cm, give or take. The want you to find what percent it is.\n\nFor the math: (1.2/56)*100 \n\nor, using proportions  1.2/56  =  x/100\n(Setting the fracions upright, cross multiiply, solve for x)\n\nFor the next one, they are saying that the circumference can be off by 3%. In this case: (3/100)*56\n\nor, using proportions: x/56 = 3/100\n\n**For setting up basic proportion, you measurments have to be on one side and your percents have to be on the other.\nmeas./total meas. = percent/total percent	Science & Mathematics

When I print a picture and it have black in it the outline of the black is yellow\n\nP.S. I have done Nozzle checks and the Nozzle check comes out good. [SEP] best_answer: your nozzle check is good.  Run a couple cleanings on it.  then check again.\n\nYou may have a priming issue with the bulk ink systems.  Epsons always need a little ink to remain inside the print head in order for them to print.   If the system is drawing back in after a print then you will have a void in the print head resulting in a lack of print.\n\nDo a few nozzle cleaning since those tend to use a little ink do your nozzle checks as well.  Trying printing immediately after wards.   Do a couple pages to see if there is improvement.  If that works then you have huge problem with the bulk ink system.  One that will eventually damage the print head beyond repair.	Computers & Internet

question_title: What is your experience with Alienware? [SEP] question_content: Mine is so bad that cant get any worse. Spent $3,400 on a Area-51M 7700 a year and half ago.  After a few months, the color of the case started  to fade, the LCD screen was getting more "winkles", never seen that on any monitors. It totally broken down a months ago. They charged me $99 for the shipping when I send it in for repair, and $160 for two hours of labor. I had to pay upfront, dont know whats the hurry since they will have my computer. one month after they received  the system, I was told  they need to replace my mother board because it got overheated.  I have never heard that one before, but whatever. They said they will charge me $312 for the board and it will take another week. So  I bought a Dell, tired of their lies. When i looked at my credit card statement, Alienware charged me $312 + $ 4,080.00. If you are thinking about buying an Alienware, think again! Crappy parts + ripped off price + the worest service = Alienware [SEP] best_answer: Lesson here for all.

question_title: i want 2 write my name at  START (left bottom on d system)? [SEP] question_content: in window syatems there is START on d left bottom side, i want 2 write my name on this [SEP] best_answer: 1. Download Resource Hacker.\n\n2. Locate explorer.exe in your C:/Windows directory. Copy this file somewhere and give it the name explorer.bak.\n\n3. Launch resource hacker and use resource hackers menus to open up explorer.exe. Once opened you will see a lot of collapsed folders.\n\n4. Expand the String Table folder and then find folder No. 37 (folder No. 38 if you're in Windows Classic mode).\n\n5. Click on resource 1033 and locate the text that says 'start.' This is your Start button, Change the 'start' text to your text of choice. You don't have a character limit, but the text takes up valuable taskbar space, so don't make it too long.\n\n6. Click on the button labeled Compile Script. This updates the settings for your Start button. But nothing will happen until you complete through step #20, so keep going!\nIf you just want to change the text and nothing else like hover text, image, etc. jump to step 16.\n\nChange your hover text\n\n7. While you're here, why not also change the text that pops up when your mouse hovers over your Start button?\n\n8. Right now it says 'Click here to begin.' Well, duh! We already know that's where to begin!\n\n9. Open folder No. 34 and click on resource 1033.\n\n10. Find the text that says 'Click here to begin' and change it to something cooler.\n\n11. Click on the Compile Script button to update this resource.\n\nCustomize your Start icon\n\n12. For an added bonus, you can also change the Windows icon to the left of the text, too.\n\n13. Collapse the String Table folder and expand the Bitmap folder at the top of your folder list.\n\n14. Click on folder No. 143 and click on resource 1033. You should see that familiar Windows icon.\n\n15. Go to the Action Menu and select 'Replace bitmap.' Select 'Open file with new bitmap', and locate the replacement image on your machine. Note: The image must have a .bmp extension and a size of 25 pixels by 20 pixels. Then click the Replace button.\n\nMake your new Start button active\n\n16. Now that you've made your changes, save the file in your Windows folder with another name, such as explorer1.exe. Don't name it Explorer.exe, because that file is already being used by your system.\n\n17. Now that we have created a new Explorer1.exe file we need to get Windows to use it. That‚Äôs where the Registry editor comes in. Click on your "start" button and then click "RUN". Now type "regedit" and click the "OK" button to open the registry editor.\n\n18. In the registry editor go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92; SOFTWARE&#92; Microsoft&#92; Windows NT&#92; CurrentVersion&#92; Winlogon". Once there double click on the string value "Shell". Once inside the text box will have "explorer.exe" in it, delete that and type in "explorer1.exe", (what we saved the new explorer file as) then click the "OK" button.\n\n19. Make sure explorer1.exe is in the "C:&#92;Windows&#92;" directory otherwise you will have to type the whole path ito the text box.\n\n20. Now reboot your computer and enjoy your new start button!

[SEP] best_answer: call me 760-242-5453\nask for alan.\nor e-mail me at alan@axiommedia.net\n\nChances-are, you are trying to use the same network address as the one the modem has given your router. Something I've run into a GREAT deal of late. damn hybrid modems !\n\neg. if you DHCP RELEASE and RENEW your Router, it obtains a **WAN** IP of 192.168.0.1 YOU CANNOT USE 192.168.0.X for your **LAN**\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter that the subnet 255.255.255.0 would allow you to......don't do it. Put your Router on a **LAN** IP of something else....like 192.168.2.1\nthen with your PC's on DHCP themselves, Release and Renew them as well.\n\nhope this helps-------------------------------------\n\nin the LAN portion of your Router setup use the IP I gave you. \nif your Router is on  192.168.2.1\nthen YOUR PC needs to either be on DHCP, or \na static ip of\n192.168.2.100\nsubnet mask of\n255.255.255.0\ndefault gateway of\n192.168.2.1\nand dns of\n192.168.2.1\n\nhmmm, if your going to use DHCP for other computers in your house, and you want to use a Static IP for yourself, then use instead IP address 192.168.2.99 for yourself.

[SEP] question_content: HOW CAN I CREATE SOFTWARES?\nWILL I BE ABLE TO CREATE SOFTWARES AFTER LEARNING C++ LANGUAGE?

Consequently I set up a firewall, that does not allow http requests to or from any of the following servers (this has eliminated all my pop-up problems):\n\ncrutialparadigm.com\nadonspot.com\nadbrite.com\nzedo.com\nrevenue.net\nallfeeds.com\nadrevolver.com\nrealtechnetwork.net\ncentrport.net\ncoremetrics.com\nmediaturf.net\n2mdn.net\natdmt.com\nfastclick.net\ncontextweb.com\nquestionmarket.com\nadvertising.com\nhitbox.com\nmediaplex.com\ntargetnet.com\ncasalemedia.com\ntrafficmp.com\nfirstadsolution.com\nsmashits.com\nbollywoodondemand.com\ntribalfusion.com\nfalkag.net\ntqlkg.com\nawltovhc.com\nafcyhf.com\nftjcfx.com\nci.com\nkanoodle.com\n\nIn my opinion these guys serve a bulk of the pop-up ads on the web, and blocking them resolves the problem without additional software -- which may need to be continuously updated.

At This Point You Press Any Key.After you do that you will be lead to a blue screen that starts loading a bunch of things. Once it is done loading you have to acsept the licence aggrement from microsoft (I think you press F8 but it will tell what to press). You will then be asked if you would like to repair windows. Cancel and press escape. You Will Then Be shown all the partions on You HardDrive. Delete all the partions (except the unused on). You Have Now Erased the HardDrive. If You Want to install windows again you must create another partion. If you are using only one operating System use the max space alloted. Your new partion will then be formatted. Once that is complete some new files will be written to your hard drive. Now after that is complete your computer will restart and automaticly install windows. From Here all you have to do is pedioticly enter some information (Ex. Name, Time Zone). That Is How Erase A Hard Drive. Note that this could take up to 3 hours. Good Luck.	Computers & Internet

question_title: i get confused when when amd athlon say 3500+ and people say it 3.5ghz is that tru? [SEP] question_content: because when i go to cercuitecity.com or bestbuy.com it mentions 2.2ghz i dont get it. [SEP] best_answer: Actually, the number 3500+ is a relative rating that compares AMD to its competitor Intel. 3500+ means that it performs relative to a Pentium4 at 3.5 GHz. The architecture of the AMD cpu allows it to perform faster at lower clock speeds than intel processors, although that is not necesarily better. The current maximums of literal clock speeds is about 3.5GHz or 4GHz when overclocked. This literal speed has not been surpassed because of the amount of heat that the cpu generates, therefore companies have been modifying data pipelines and creating dual core cpus to get better performance. The real speed of your computer is still a balance between all components, so as sockets upgrade and architecture changes to better accomadate faster ram and hard drive speeds and real support of 64bit computing is created, performance can still increase while cpu clock speeds can't be raised.

question_title: how to develop a database replication system? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This thesis is centered around the topic database replication. The work has been motivated by the advances in the development of cluster databases and their specific demands in terms of high throughput, low response times, flexible load-balancing, data consistency and fault-tolerance. Eager, update-everywhere replication seems a promising mechanism to achieve these goals. By replicating data across the cluster, transaction have fast access to local copies and the available system can take over the work of failed sites. Using eager replica control the updates on the different copies are coordinated before the transaction commits providing data consistency and fault-tolerance in a straightforward way. Update-everywhere is a prerequisite for load balancing since only then a transaction can be submitted at any site without any restrictions. However, existing eager, update-everywhere solutions have severe performance limitations and are barely used in practice.\nWhat is needed is a solution that bridges the gap between theory and and practice, and implements efficient, eager, update-everywhere replication. The thesis provides several contributions to this goal.\nWe start with a detailed analysis of existing solutions depicting those assumptions and techniques that make current solutions inefficient and impracticable. In an attempt to eliminate these limitations the thesis presents a couple of basic techniques that we believe are necessary to provide efficiency: keeping the number of messages small, using the powerful multicast primitives of group communication systems to support replica control and fault-tolerance, simplifying the coordination between the database systems, avoiding deadlocks and a 2-phase commit protocol, and providing different levels of transaction isolation and fault-tolerance in order to adapt to various hardware and workload configurations.\nBased on these techniques the thesis develops a replication tool in three steps. First, we develop a theoretical framework including a family of replica control protocols. These protocols delay communication until the end of the transactions where all updates are multicast in a single message to all sites. By using a total order multicast as provided by group communication systems all messages arrive in the same order at all sites. By guaranteeing that all sites serialize conflicting transactions according to this order transactions are globally ordered without further coordination among the sites. In order to reduce resource consumption remote sites do not need to reexecute the operations but only apply the physical changes. The proposed replica control protocols provide different levels of isolation allowing for various degrees of concurrency. Furthermore, they offer two levels of fault-tolerance which vary in the degree of data consistency on failed nodes. All protocols provide data consistency on available sites and correctness criteria that are well understood and widely used in practice.\nIn a second step we evaluate our approach in two ways. First, we have built a simulation system that provides a performance comparison of all proposed protocols and a comparison with traditional solutions. This study shows that our approach provides superior performance compared to traditional solutions, is more stable and applicable for a much wider range of configurations and workloads. By providing a whole family of protocols the approach is able to adjust to the environment since the protocol can be chosen that is best suited to alleviate the specifics of a given configuration. In particular, the protocols are able to address high network costs and high conflict rates. Second, we have proven the feasibility of the approach in a real cluster environment by integrating it into the database system PostgreSQL. Most of the functionality has been added in separate modules and only few changes to the existing PostgreSQL system were necessary. With this, we are confident that the approa	Computers & Internet

Open and turn off Microsoft Windows firewall.  Microsoft Windows firewall, only gives you one way protection.  A true firewall as to give you incoming protection from rogue ports and outgoing protection from private data leaving your pc without your permission.   \n\nOn a professional level I consider both garbage.

question_title: what is the actual reason why do CPUs wont start. Good monitor and its cable... cpu dont display CMOS startup? [SEP] question_content: The Processor overheating.. Is it possible that sometimes it was a result of compatibility of power supply.   It was a second power supply.   It was used for almost 6 monsths.... [SEP] best_answer: There are many probable causes:\n\n!. Yes, the power supply may be the problem,  the power connectors from the supply to the motherboard may have loosened a bit or damaged.  A poor connection between the headers and the plug may burn the header connectors over time. I have experienced it before.  An irregular supply between the wires may cause system hangup (under or overvoltage supplies, remember, digital circuits need 5V or 12V with a 12% tolerance).  Frequent cooling down produces what we call "thermal runaway", when a component frequently heats and cools down, connectors become "loose" and continuity or contacts slowly separate resulting in poor contact.\n\n2.  CMOS SETUP.  You may have dead backup cells on the motherboard resulting in corrupted settings.  You may need to replace the CMOS backup cell.  \n\n3. Check for proper mating or connection between the signal cable and the video card connector.\n\n4.  Check your video card and have it tested to another good PC.  This may also be the culprit.\n\n5. Did you test your monitor to another PC again?	Computers & Internet

question_title: Does all computers come with only 1-yr warranty? [SEP] question_content: as titled, just wondering if I can get a computer that has a longer warranty period to avoid the hassles...Thanx. [SEP] best_answer: Most low end computers currently come with only 90 days, even Dell. You can buy extended warranties but unless it is a laptop, I wouldn't bother. Laptops take a lot more abuse and are much harder to upgrade or repair. Repairs are usually more costly also, since you usually have to buy parts from the company rather than generic parts. Most desktops, if you don't have a problem within the first 90 days you should be good. I have owned both high and low end computers since 1991 and the only thing I have ever replaced on a warranty on a desktop was a mouse.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How to use NTFS and FAT32  w/  Windows XP? [SEP] question_content: I recently formatted my C:&#92; drive - which is 40gigs. After the format, I reinstalled 98SE then the XP CD Upgrade. I then began to download SP2 when I realized XP is showing both my C:&#92; & D:&#92; with only 19g & 18g total size of the drives. Both are 40gb. \n\nAfter posting that question here, in regards to why this happened, someone said to load NTFS. So after some research, I found info on how to convert my drives from FAT32 to NTFS at: (http://www.mvps.org/marksxp/WindowsXP/fatntfs.php) and how to clean-install XP upgrade w/o having to install 98SE first at: (http://www.duxcw.com/faq/win/xp/clean.htm) .\n\nMy 1st question is, do I have to format my C:&#92; again and then convert? Or can I convert to NTFS w/o having to reinstall again?\nAlso, my D:&#92; is FAT32 and I want to change it to NTFS w/o losing my data. \nSo my 2nd question is can I convert my C:&#92; to NTFS first, then move all my data from my D:&#92; , which is FAT32, to the new C:&#92; using NTFS w/o losing data? \n\nAny help would be great! [SEP] best_answer: I am not certain that the trouble is the hard drive format. Whether you format a drive in FAT or NTFS, it will not cause the drive to be reported incorrectly. That is almost always caused by the BIOS or operating system misreporting the size of the drives. \n\nOlder motherboards, and older operating systems, had drive size limitations, they can't recognize drives over a certain size. \n\nYou should check the BIOS to see how it is reporting the drive sizes and go from there. Here is a good story on FAT and NTFS.\nhttp://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/l0606/16l06/16l06.asp\n\n\nIf you are still hoping to convert your hard drive to NTFS, here is some help from Microsoft:\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/307881/	Computers & Internet

They think they know, and they know a lot, but they don't know everything.  That is why they drive us nuts.  They love us soooo much and want what is best for us to the point that it makes us crazy.  They want us to not make the mistakes they made and they don't want to see qualities that they do not like in themselves in us.  So that makes it a battle between their will for us and our will.

question_title: what is the appropriate rent increase for a commercial property in San Bernardino County per year? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my experience the average rent/contract price increase from year to year is in the range of 4%-6%.  However, you must factor in that you are in the San Bernardino area, which I am under the impression is a good place to be.  So you may want to add a couple more percentage points.  I would not recommend going above 10%.	Business & Finance
question_title: What is the difference between a modular and a true modular? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Interesting question! I've never heard the term "true" modular.\n\nA modular home is one that's built in a factory, and trucked to the building site. It does not have wheels or a chassis, and is of a construction similar to "stick built" on-site construction.\n\nThe modular home typically comes in at least two units (modules), for a standard ranch house. I own a modular custom-colonial two-story, and it came in 10 units.\n\nOnce the modular home is installed on the foundation ("set" in industry terms) it cannot be moved.\n\nThis is all in contrast to a "mobile" home, which is built on a chassis, has permanent wheels, and can be moved at any time.\n\nYou might be thinking of a "manufactured" home, which is essential a mobile home without the wheels, and is typically one-piece.

question_title: love my job but got offer at competing company w/ 25% raise, how do i approach counter offer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You should not counter offer them.

(If that is what you mean by counter offer) If you want to stay where you are at, (make sure the offer is genuine) tell your current employer you got 25% raise at the other company. If they really value you, they should at least try to match. If they don't, you can still leave.	Business & Finance

question_title: What's the E Commerce ...? [SEP] question_content: What's Your Opinion ... Profits ... Disadvantages ...  Which Level is Your Country in ? [SEP] best_answer: What is E-Commerce.\nElectronic Commerce (E-Commerce) is simply any business transacted electronically.\nIn today's parlance it has come to mean "Business transacted over the Internet".\n\nE-Commerce consists of three components.\n\n1. A Merchant Account. The Merchant Account gives you the ability to take Credit Card information from your \nprospective customers. There are many sites on the Internet where you can apply for a Merchant Account. Typically\nyou pay from $100 - $300 to start this process. Ultimately the Merchant Account is issued through an \nAuthorizing Bank. Click here to access EasyCart Merchant Account provider partners.\n\nThink of the Merchant Account as a Drivers License. Just because you have a Drivers License doesn't mean you \ncan drive. In order to move around you need a vehicle! Likewise - in order for you to use your Merchant Account \nyou need a vehicle to move the information around. An example of how to move this information might be a \ntelephone. You could just ask your website prospects to call you on the phone. The phone is then your vehicle \nto move the Credit Card information.\n\n2. Online Shopping Cart software is another example of a vehicle to move Credit Card and ordering information. \nYour customers can efficiently order 24 hours a day. Also a Shopping Cart eliminates some potential for error \nbecause there is only one human involved in the process - rather than two. Online Shopping Cart software also \nincreases your credibility on the Internet.\n\nThe Shopping Cart is a vehicle that enables you to; Get the ordering information from the customer; Verify via \nemail to the customer that the order has been made; Deliver the notification and ordering information to the seller. \nThe more information the shopping cart can collect - the wider it's application can be.\n\n3. Transaction Device or Software is how you Deliver the money. Now that you have the customers money - \n(Credit Card information)- you need a place to deposit it. Your Bank! But you still have some choices to make. \nAre you going to walk in and place the transaction with the Teller? Are you going to drop it in the Night Deposit \nbox? Are you going to utilize the bank's Drive In option?\n\nIn the same manner you have to decide how you are going to deposit the E-Commerce transaction into \nyour bank account.\n\nHere again you have 3 basic choices.\n\nA device in your office to enter the transaction over the phone lines. This device will be similar to those you \nsee in retail stores when you buy something using a credit card. There are many options with widely \nvarying prices. \nInternet software that enables you to 'deposit' your transaction over the Internet. Typically by filling out an \nonline form. Here again you will find a rather wide variation - in most cases you will need to rent the software \non a monthly basis. \nReal Time Credit Processing. This is the service provided by companies such as AuthorizeNet. Using this \nmethod your Shopping Cart interfaces with the Real Time Credit Processing company to complete the transaction. \nThis takes place automatically while the customer is placing the order. Using this method the customer and the \nseller is notified as to whether the credit card account has sufficient funds to enable the transaction. \nThe only difference between these three is how the transaction is entered with the bank. We suggest you use the \nmethod most economical to your situation.	Business & Finance

First, be on time, dress appropriately (not too formal because you look fake and not too casual lest you look sloppy), be prepared for the standard interview questions (how would you contribute, what difficult situations have occurred in previous employment and how did you handle them, strengths vs. weaknesses)...it's christmas time, seasonal help is needed all over, as long as you follow these simple suggestions it is in the bag, don't worry and get some sleep to be well rested for the interview	Business & Finance

question_title: Do you know anything about CREDIT SCORES? [SEP] question_content: Is it true that Insurance companies Like AUTO, HOME OWNERS insurance, check your FICO score before giving you insurance rate? If so, WHY? what is the correlation between having  bad score, and the insurance rate? I would appreciate any help, and any resources that you can point me too. THank you!! Im doing this for a school project! [SEP] best_answer: Yes and no.  Your beacon score (the number generated by the major credit bureaus) is different from your insurance score (the term used by insurers for the application of credit).  Every company has a proprietary way of reviewing credit and the factors that determine your insurance score will vary from company to company.  Your insurance score can be substantially different from your beacon score, depending upon the weights and factors used by the insurance carrier.  \n\nFor your beacon score, the key factors are things like paying your bills on time and not being maxed out in terms of your debt to availability ratio.  Insurers won't necessarily place the same weight here, and often look at factors like the types of debt you have, the frequency with which you open new accounts, inquiries and collections.  \n\nInsurance companies analyze risk.  The riskier your behaviors (like running up $30,000 in credit card debt) have an overall indicator that someone is less financially responsible than someone who has no debt.  Keep in mind that insurance carriers are looking at the law of large numbers here, as well.  Of course there are great customers with a ton of debt (small business owners, for example), but the state departments of insurance prevent insurance carriers from evaluating on a case by case basis and require that carriers file their credit review procedures. \n\nAlso keep in mind that credit is one of literally dozens of factors that determine premium (like age, driving record and address for auto or location, claims and age of dwelling for home).  There is a direct correlation between having a lower insurance score and the frequency/severity of claims filed.  Interestingly, the correlation is often stronger with regard to auto claims rather than to homeowner's as might be expected.  \n\nInsurance carriers are looking for any statistical data that helps them splice and dice risk.  If they could find evidence that supported saying blondes deserve better rates than red-heads, they'd go with it.  Insurance companies compete any many different levels and the company with the best ability to sort risks out into pricing levels will win in the long run.  \n\nHope this helps!	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: Best answer will automatically go to first irreverant, yet practical answer.

However, most of these benefits consist of health insurance paid to men who have leachwives and rugrats at home.  \n\nIt is unfair.  You should not be compensated for things that do not benefit the company.  In fact, if anything, leachwives and rugrats detract from an employee's performance and compensation should be deducted for having them.	Business & Finance

question_title: why cant i get a job? the agencies seem to throw away my number the moment i register. how do i get a job??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The process for getting a job is similar to the process for getting a girlfriend: you have to figure out what it is that they want and then give it to them.\n\nPeople who look for jobs are often too self-oriented and they don't do research on the company to understand what the company really needs.\n\nFirst of all jobseekers should understand that a company creates a job because there was a problem that was persistent. If you know what the problem is, then you can position yourself as the solution to that problem. Only then will they give you the job.\n\nGoing to the job market without having a clear solution to offer is never going to work, in the same way that a guy who wants to date women but only thinks of sex and not what he can bring to them, will never get a girlfriend.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci may have been an artistic and scientific genius, but he also did something few job seekers know: in every cover letter he sent to patrons, he would always list 10-15 specific solutions or projects he could do for the employer. He even offers to work for free, so the employer can go for a "free trial"!\n\nGood luck!	Business & Finance

question_title: What is escrow? [SEP] question_content: How does this apply to houses? [SEP] best_answer: 1- What Is Escrow?\nEscrow is a process that provides for a fair and equitable transfer of property from one person to another.\nEscrow opens when the buyer and seller sign a sales contract, commonly called a real estate purchase agreement and receipt of deposit. The contract, along with any additional instructions, serves as instructions for the escrow officer. \nEscrow assures that the lender releases the home purchase funds at or about the same time that the deed is recorded to reflect new ownership. Escrow includes depositing, with a neutral third party, funds, documents and instructions necessary to complete the transfer. \nBecause the real estate transaction involves large sums of money and reams of documentation, escrow is not always a predestined, step-by-step process, but can become a confusing end game of details, nit picking and overlapping procedures. It requires preparation, attention to detail, and desire from both sides to close the deal. \nRegional custom will dictates who (the buyer or the seller) chooses the neutral third party and who that third party will be. A neutral third party can be an escrow officer from an escrow company, someone from a title company or from a title and escrow company. Some regional areas use title and escrow attorneys. Custom and market conditions also dictate which escrow costs the buyer or seller pays. The amount typically totals about 1 to 2 percent of the cost of the home. \nChoosing an escrow officer is much like choosing any real estate professional. Get several referrals from trusted people, then compare services, cost and convenience. \nYour escrow officer opens escrow by assigning your escrow an account number and collecting the contract and other instructions, the buyer's deposit and perhaps additional proceeds or documents related to the transaction. Deposits are either applied to the purchase price, or returned should the deal fall through. \nThe buyer orders title insurance, to protect him or her against blemishes on the title, and he or she orders a preliminary title search to determine if there are any claims against the title. \nThe contract and escrow instructions likely contain contingencies for home insurance, flood insurance, home inspections, financing, repairs and other tasks either the buyer or seller must complete before the transaction can progress. Each time a contingency is met, the buyer or seller signs off with a contingency release form or letter copied to all parties, including the escrow officer. \nAt some point, parties will receive a preliminary title report which summarizes the condition of the title, including easements and liens, claims and encumbrances against the property. The seller must resolve any claims against the title, or they could stall the deal. \nThe title company may check once again and produce a final report to be sure existing claims have been removed and that no claims have been filed since escrow opened. \nOnce the loan is funded, contingencies are released, the title is cleared, the buyer inspects the property and decides how to take title, only a few loose ends must be tied before close of escrow. \nRemaining paperwork to sign a few days before close includes the buyer's grant deed, any final escrow instructions or contingency releases, the settlement sheet of disbursements, title reports, the deed of trust lender forms, inspection reports, tax statements -- and a rental agreement if the seller will live in the home for some time after escrow closes. \nEscrow closes and the deal is sealed when the escrow office records a new deed in the buyer‚Äôs name, the seller gets paid for the home, and all other moneys are disbursed. \nMoney may be held in escrow after the close to pay contractors for unfinished work. \ntop	Business & Finance

question_title: what is meant by 100% book building offer in respect of public issues by corporate entities? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Whenever a company comes out with an IPO (Initial Public Offering), its valuation is done either internally by the company or most likely by an Investment Bank/ Private Equity, depending on its current revenues, profits, future prospects, management transparency, good corporate governance, etc.\nWith all these parameters and more they come to an approximate value of the company and decide the price band within which the valuation must be fixed, i.e. a lower limit and upper limit is fixed (Example price is between $20-$24)\nWhen potential investors apply for the shares they mention the price that they are willing to pay for the share. This is called 100% BOOK BUILDING, which is the most transparent method of arriving at the valuation of the company. \nIf the shares are over-subscribed, then the shares are allotted to the highest bidders and if any shares remain then to the nest lowest bidder and so on. So as a potential investor I think that if at $20 (Above example), I wont be allotted shares because a lot of people will bid more than me, I will increase my price. However if I think that the high price is unjustified, I will bid at the lower limit.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: About listing fees, insertion charges, and final value costs, how is it profitable to sell items, for example, ebooks) for only $0.01 or $0.02 each?\n\nThe Listing Fee Schedule states that any item between AU$0.01 and AU$0.99 has a Listing Fee of AU$0.30.\n\nPlus, eBay charges an additional Closing Bid or Buy It Now final value fee of at least 5.25%.\n\nIt also says that even the "Buy It Now" option costs at least a flat fee of $0.10 per listing. So, how are eBay sellers achieving success selling so many low-cost items?\n\nIt is quite common to see such low prices, and seeing something priced, let's say, above $3.50, is very uncommon.\n\nPlease explain. [SEP] best_answer: Most of these sellers charge exorbitant shipping charges and make their money that way.  Even a paperback sold at 0.01 can be very profitable is you charge 3.50 for shipping.\nOthers, like myself in the past, are more interested in making quality books available to the largest amount of people, and therefore offer such items at a low price, knowing that they will go to an appreciative buyer.  This is the best way to recycle and is much better than throwing stuff away.  Surprisingly, there are a lot of people on Ebay who have motivations other than simply making money.	Business & Finance

question_title: Can I receive Social Serurity Disability benefits for having Fibromyalgia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes. I am on SSDI for Fibromyalgia. I had the problem that I filed when I was 27 years old so the Board that reviews the applicants denied me twice. Finally, my application was going before the Appeals Judge and before the court date he read my file. He overturned the original rejections and I received payment back to the date of disability. It took over two years for this process.\n\nMy best suggestion is that when you answer any questions answer as if it's your worst day possible. There's an article called Helping Fibromyalgia Patients Obtain Social Security Benefits by Joshua W. Potter, Esq.\nFrom: The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine September 1992\nhttp://www2.rpa.net/~lrandall/ssdi_fms.html\n\nAnother good article is http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/social_security_disability_fibromyalgia.html\n\nAnother helpful article is:\nWhy Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) & Fibromyalgia (FM) Sufferers Lose Their SSDI Claims\nby Janet Mizrahi\nImmuneSupport.com\n\n09-01-2000 \n\nYou feel awful all the time. You can barely dredge up the energy to take a bath, no less get dressed, go to work, and actually be productive. You know you‚Äôre disabled--your doctor knows you‚Äôre disabled. So you‚Äôll win that disability case to get SSDI, right? Well, not necessarily so, says Scott Davis, an attorney who specializes in FM/CFS disability cases. \nAccording to Davis, ‚ÄúOne of the biggest reasons people lose disability cases is because they don‚Äôt retain an attorney at the beginning of the process. It sounds self-serving, but it‚Äôs not,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúDisability attorneys work on contingency fee basis, meaning you only pay a fee if you win your case ‚Äì you have nothing to lose.‚Äù \n\nUsing a lawyer before or at the time of filing a claim will help build the proper case to show to Social Security and a judge, who will ultimately hear the case and decide your fate. \n\nBut besides that, Davis says, an attorney can help you forge ahead with the process. Many people never bother to file a claim because they don‚Äôt have the energy or feel it‚Äôs just hopeless or simply because they don‚Äôt know what to do. An attorney not only can give you hope that you have a case, he or she guides you through the process. \n\nAnother death knell to a disability case, Davis says, is inadequate medical records. ‚ÄúDisability cases are ultimately won and lost on adequately documented medical records and detailed opinions from the treating physician regarding their ability to work, or their inability to work,‚Äù he states. \n\nLack of documentation can happen in a number of ways. One may be a result of a lack of adequate treatment. ‚ÄúParticularly in the FM/CFS arena,‚Äù Davis says, ‚Äúpeople are repeatedly told by their doctors that there‚Äôs nothing medicine can do, to live with their illness and deal with it. Which is exactly what people do. They stop seeking treatment. \n\n‚ÄúOr I‚Äôve seen people do the opposite. They go to a host of doctors on an odyssey to get a diagnosis. After being worn out from seeing doctor after doctor and getting treatments without any benefit, they quit going. The attitude becomes, why bother? Nothing is helping to alleviate the symptoms.‚Äù \n\nBoth tactics result in barren medical records -- a huge mistake. ‚ÄúEven if you have a very good attorney, I‚Äôm only the orchestrator,‚Äù Davis says. ‚ÄúMy ability to help a client is more limited if there are no medical records or if the medical records don‚Äôt say anything. Medical records load the gun for me to use when I argue a client is unable to work.‚Äù \n\nDavis suggests that ideally, people should view their medical records on a regular basis. This way you can see for yourself if your complaints of pain or other symptoms are being documented. If they are not, patients can tactfully ask their doctors to work with them to get the records in shape for their cases. Many general practitioners and HMO physicians are overburdened and do not take the time to dictate their repo	Business & Finance
question_title: what should i do with my 401k  w/  less than $5,000 from my previous employer.? [SEP] question_content: my new employer offers sep ira but i do not become eligible until 2007. any info is much appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: Under IRS rules, you can only roll over a 401k into a Traditional IRA and wait at least one year before moving it into Roth IRA. Remember, 401k sitting in previous employers will not have any growth. It is a frozen account until you roll it over.\n\nIRAs are always a good plan to save for retirement. You can pick any mutual funds that is offered by a financial institution (most mutual funds require a minimum initial deposit of $1000). And can be tax free after age 59 1/2 when you start using it.

[SEP] question_content: For example, the 7 seals, the 7 bowls, the 7 trumpets, etc. [SEP] best_answer: It's frequently used to signify completeness. At times it has reference to bringing a work toward completion.Or it can refer to the complete cycle of things as established or allowed by God.The 7 congregations mentioned in Revelation 1:20-3:22 give a complete picture of all the congregations of God on earth. The 7 heads of the wild beast of Rev.13:1 show the limit to which the beast would be allowed to develop. And a repetition of seven was equivalent to saying indefinitely or without limit at Matt. 18:21,22.	Business & Finance
question_title: Which high profile brands does GE own? [SEP] question_content: While watching the Olympics and noting that General Electric owns Bob Costas and NBC, I was curious about which other brands we see every day are companies owned by GE. Here are some that I know are already on the list:\n\nGE Energy (power generators, wind turbines, aircraft engines)\nGE Healthcare appliances (MRI, Ultrasonic, etc..)\nHotpoint appliances\nRCA (does this include the electronics as well?)\nNBC, MSNBC, CNBC\nUniversal Pictures and Universal Studios\n\nDoes anybody know of any others? [SEP] best_answer: Actually, RCA (and GE) appliances are no longer owned by GE.  GE got out of the appliance business some time ago, and sold the brand names to Thomson Consumer Electronics.  Thomson is a well-known brand in the European Union, but still uses the old established brand names in the US (RCA and GE). \n\nThe link below will show you all of the sub-brands actually still owned by General Electric.  It's interesting to note that more than one-half of the company's business is now in the financial services market.  They've diversified quite a bit from the days when they made lightbulbs, wouldn't you say?	Business & Finance
question_title: What does it take for a guy with a master's degree to get a desk job? [SEP] question_content: I have a master's degree, and my health limits me to a job without standing, lifiting, bending, or walking.  Temp services ignore me, and when they don't, they have something for me when I have to go to the doctor.  I've done a dozen resume revisions to the point that "experts" (like at the college career center) don't know why I'm not getting called for interviews.  The unemployment office hasn't helped, welfare hasn't helped; the department of labor hasn't helped.  Is this vengeance on the brains or something? [SEP] best_answer: 	Business & Finance

question_title: whats the earliest age can you walk home after school? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I started kindergaden at 4, and walked home a few times alone. I was in first grade twice, and at age 6 it was a long walk home. about 12 blocks in a suburb of Chicago. By 2nd grade, 3 blocks to school was easy and normal. But there were bullies that stole my lunch. And all kinds of things can happen in 3 blocks. I wouldn't trade those memories of walking to school for anything. I became a safety patrol in 5th grade, safety captain in 6th grade. And on bicycles, me and my friends ruled the streets! The video game was at the boweling ally, a pingpong then the lunar lander, both black & white. Age 7 is the earliest I would recomend, but when both parents work and have an infant to care for at home, walking just has to be for a young school kid. My sister was a year younger, she walked too. But not with me most of the time. We did get rides to school alot, but always had to walk home.	Business & Finance

It doesn't matter if you already know what they are about to say, or what they are thinking, everyone just wants someone to hear them. So after they are done talking/crying/yelling or whatever, then you talk to them calmly about how you feel about the situation. Don't be so quick to blame, just talk. If they still don't want to listen to you, then let them go,  they'll know where to find you once they are ready to listen.	Business & Finance
question_title: what is insiders trading what about the consequencess they should face on the insiders trading? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Insider trading is using privileged information in order to make a profit on the stock market. For example, if as a part of your job, you work for a multinational company, and you hear through the channels that your company is planning a takeover of a rival company. Such news will generally drive up the price of the shares of the company being taken over. If you were to purchase shares in the rival company, with the plans of selling them after the share price has been driven up once the takeover has been announced, you would be guilty of insider trading. (If you were caught, of course). Penalties can include jail time and heavy fines.	Business & Finance

I just watched a report on 60 Minutes about this subject and we are in deep trouble.  They showed a picture of the arctic in 1979 and one just taken six months ago.  It is unbelievable how much ice has melted in just 26 years.  The most noted authority on this catastrophe said that even if we were to stop putting greenhouse gases into our atmosphere, it wouldn't change the fact that our global temperature will still rise.  It probably wouldn't rise quite as fast, but it will still happen because of all the gases we have already emitted.  We can only sove this problem collectively as a human race and not separately as nations.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Do you have the money to pursue these things?  Maybe, maybe not.  The ACLU stands up and helps those who think they have been wronged who may not have the means nor smarts to do it on their own.\n\nThey look after civil rights in the constitution just as the NRA rights for 2nd amendment rights.   Both are necesary advocates for our constitutional rights..   You may not always like what either does but in general they're good org's to have in place.	Politics & Government

Why do Mexicans think they are better then everyone else?  Not all Mexicans, just the ones bitching about everything. [SEP] best_answer: ILLEGAL ALIENS in America are here only because they are GUILTY of CRIMINAL VIOLATION  of our FEDERAL LAWS, Jumping our borders and living in a shadowy underground economy. They are morally culpable for shoving aside those who adhere to the law and enter these United States in orderly and Legal Fashion. \nSince when do criminals and cheaters receive pride of place for the blessings of liberty, over those honestly, earnestly and faithfully seeking to become American citizens? \n\nPresident Bush has called for a reasonable and civil debate over the issues of border security and immigration reform. But the American people understand there can be no responsible immigration reform UNTIL OUR BORDERS ARE SECURE. ‚ÄúGuest worker‚Äù amnesty programs ARE NOT a part of border security. \nAmnesty is not the answer. To grant amnesty to these trespassers is to say "You crossed our borders ILLEGALLY, You BROKE OUR LAWS and now we are REWARDING you with U.S. Citizenship -- Congratulations!" \n\nThis is unacceptable.

[SEP] question_content: when i met my husband he was and still is cleaning floors its not easy work to strip and wax a store as big as a wal-mart in one week but he did it. when we moved on behalf of his job we tried to find a white or anybody (other than hispanic) to take the job it payed $2,800 a month do you know the ONLY person willing to take the job was a mexicon so why is every body so down on having hispanics legal they so jobs no white man wants even when it pays good money [SEP] best_answer: That's nice because your illegal husband is making more than most legals make.  You say $2800 like it's nothing.  That's a lot of money.  So if your husband becomes legal, then does that mean he will stop doing the work he is doing now?  If your arguing that illegals work hard and do jobs that U.S. citizens wont do and that this benefits the U.S., then with your logic if he got amnesty he would quit that job and then no one would do that work period, right?

question_title: Is there a common formula for a judge to sentence a convicted person to death? What exactly does he/she say? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: 1.) Only certain crimes are eligible for the death penalty. The jury must first find the defendant guilty of an eligible crime (with aggrivating factors if required by the state).\n\n2.) To my knowledge, all states as well as the federal government require a jury to vote unanimously for the death penalty. This is why prospective jurors are asked if they would apply the death penalty if it was called for by law.	Politics & Government

I have asked a few of the local antique dealers around and they have not been able to help me out. If you need pics, please let me know as I can get some by next week. Thank you for any help.

question_title: How does a criminal record affect the immigration process to get a permanent green card? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what the crime was.  \n\nIf it was only a speeding ticket, you're okay.  First offense DUI, you should be fine.  \n\nBut if you're talking about drug trafficking, illegal immigrant trafficking, murder, etc., then forget about it.  The USCIS will deport you at the first chance.  \n\nSo, as always, it's best to consult with immigration attorneys.  The general rule (the "line") is whether that crime involves "moral turpitude."  But you may want an attorney to represent you to argue your case (or present it in the best light) in your adjustment proceedings.	Politics & Government

question_title: does anyone know the cause of napoleons defeat at waterloo? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Napoleon lost the battle for a number of reasons:\nan accident of weather. As before all of Wellington's battles, it rained heavily all the previous night so Napoleon could use neither his guns nor his cavalry to their best advantage. His guns sank up to their axles in the mud and his cavalry could not charge uphill in the soggy conditions. The start of the battle was delayed for about two hours, so that the ground could dry out a little.\nWellington's tactics were superb. He refused to move from the high ground into the boggy valley, so the French had to take the battle to him, uphill and through mud.\nWellington used the "thin red line" and hid his troops: this surprised Napoleon, who had never seen this method of fighting. Wellington had perfected them in Spain while Napoleon was occupied in fighting elsewhere.\nWellington's smaller force held the French to a stalemate from about 11 a.m. (when the battle started), until about 4 p.m. Wellington was about to give the order for a general retreat following Napoleon's order for a general advance, when Blucher arrived and tipped the balance in favour of the Allies.\nNapoleon said he lost Waterloo because of the "obstinate bravery of the English troops" - many of whom were Irish. [1]\nThere is an account that Napoleon was not functioning at his best because of a medical problem. It seems that he suffered terribly from haemorrhoids (piles); his physician used leeches to alleviate the pain but during the night of 16 June, the leeches were lost. The physician gave Napoleon laudanum to alleviate the pain but by accident administered an overdose; consequently, at Waterloo, Napoleon's abilities were imp	Politics & Government

question_title: Discovery or Discloser law? [SEP] question_content: I am not sure of the correct terminology but I know that both the prosecution and defense have a duty to disclose and share all evidence that they may have so as to give each side an opportunity to have their own experts give their opinion. does the defendant and or his or her spouse have a right to view this evidence as well?  in other words can the defendants spouse optain any and all copies of paperwork that the attorney may have regarding the case?  what is the exact statute and wording? [SEP] best_answer: It's not a statute, it's a court rule of procedure. Discovery takes in interrogatories, requests for documents and depositions. It can include a "view" when the locus of an event cannot be seen from a public way.\n\nJust because the information has been disclosed to the party's lawyer does not mean it can be shared with a spouse of the party, since the attorney must maintain attorney-client privilege even as to a spouse.\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecution generally has a duty to disclose evidence exculpating the defendant. The defendant, except in MA and a couple of other states and federal courts, there is no general duty on the defense to share information with the prosecutor.\n\nA defense lawyer will usually share any disclosures with the defendant. But the lawyer will tell the defendant not to disclose it to anyone else if it will affect the case when it gets out.	Politics & Government

question_title: Border walls... Good? or bad?   who is aginst them and why... who thinks they are godd and why?  Reasons GOOD! [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: a. They are a good idea, but they must be built properly. You can't build a 700 mile fence on a border that is over 1,950 miles. You also can't build a fence that is only three feet tall or made out of chain-link, wood- and- post, etc. (There are 5 year olds that can climb over them.) \n*****\nWhat I would do: \na. Height: At least 15 feet. \nb. Fence type: Chain-link fence with razor wire and barbed wire intertwined through it. (Anyone who is stupid enough to try and climb it will get exactly what they deserve.) There will be one wide gate that can be opened to let buses, trucks, cars, etc. through every 25 miles. Also, there should a large slab of concrete wall underneath the fence to prevent tunneling.\nc. Other forms of security: \n1. Cameras wherever the border patrol deems it necessary. \n2. ARMED border patrol agents with vehicles best suited to the rocky desert terrain. They will patrol the border and be stationed at the gates. (They'll check the interior of the buses, trucks, cars, etc.) \n3. Small helicopters to patrol from overhead. \n4. (Hopefully.) Start pulling in U.S. troops and start sticking them on the border. \n5. Force anyone that leaves food, water, and/or medical supplies on the border to leave. Then, take the supplies away. \n\n-Incidentally: Leave about three inches of fencing without wire on the bottom just to make sure that small lizards, etc. won't get cut. I'd also keep a few veterinarians on hand. Also, if Mexico or some "do-gooder" wants to send doctors, fine. Just remind them that: \na. They are going to have to pay for the treatments with their OWN money. \nb. The illegals will be immediately deported when they get bandaged up and ready to start the road to recovery. \nc. Any potential anchor-babies born on U.S. soil would not get an automatic path to citizenship. Instead, they'd get sent back to Mexico with their mother's citizenship. \n*****\nb. Who is against the fence? Illegal immigrants and their relatives. \n\nc. Why is the fence good? It blocks one wave of illegal immigrant from entering the country. After our border is secured, we can start working on deportation, tracking tourists, and on keeping tack of people that have visas. (We must make sure that the latter don't "mysteriously disappear.")

question_title: What are your thoughts on the American Press? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: they are failing to inform Americans of certain dangerous trends in America.\nlike no more religion in school and how this was done and by what type of thinking did we get to this point in America.\nWe have given all our rights over to the state and federal government and this is what happens when you pass laws restricting freedom .WHEN you tell me it is illegal to be in a public place like a park after 10 pm or before 6 am you have opened your self to so many losses of freedom that ,  that type of law makes possible i am ashamed to be an American today .\nWe had people fight and die so that we could be free from oppression and servitude.The right to have representation to ensure the public intrests were served and not taxed without it being for the good of the people.\nTHAT these people would never pass laws that infringed upon the   basic freedoms of all men and the bill of rights describes our freedoms.This does not mean o fifty foot statue of a naked man and woman engaged in intercourse can not be placed in public on my property.\nthis does not mean i can not engage in sexual acts on my property in full veiw of passers by.\nTHIS does not mean that Ican not or should not be deprived of the right to be free.\nto this end you have the right not to buy my services not to have me work for you denie me permission on your property denie me the right to shop in your store and to make it known that you do not approve of my actions and until i come to my senses i am not wanted around.\nyou may say this leads to discrimination but i say it leads to people providing work and food and services to the very type of person that you wish not to support in yopur community and those who wish to help them by giving food and jobs and support can also be included in you freedom to denie sevices to such people as you see fit .\nTHIS however does not give me the right to refuse sevice on account of race religion or sex age marital statues and so on .\nBY making sex in public veiw illegal you have violated that persons rights to do as he wishes and there fore opened your self up to laws being passed to prevent you from doing what you wish . \nBAD community behavior needs to be handled by the people in the community by making live difficult for people wh othrough there actions do not change to meet those standards and it is your right to refuse to help someone for these resons and these reasons alone.Some where in america naked statues and open sexual gratification may be acceptable and in many places it is not so naturaly some one stiggmatized by a community would search out a place that he could live in peace and enjoy freedoms to shop and go where he is accepted .by passing laws against anyplace exsisting where he can do this you risk losing your freedoms also .\nAmerica does not recognize the danger in forbidding gay marriage or many other laws that end freedom and more and more america is becoming a police state.ONLY people who can afford fifty foot fences are free today to do what i have descibed and this is wrong america for what goes on behind closed doors can affect all americans if to many fences go up all of us lose our freedom and the ones behind the fence do as they please secure in there property to act as they will.these were called lords of the manner dukes and so forth with the power and control of the people who the took pleasure in taking from there hard work and goods for the protection of the castle walls.\nHAVE we become so entreched in our own needs and freedoms we have destroyed all freedom and choice i may not agree with a persons right to say what they want like a kid who mentions jesus in a speach at school but i sure do defend her right to do so as well as a man to erect a disgusting statue or fonicate in public as repulsive as i find some behavior it is freedom i find more important then stoping him .ONCEone persons behaviour is questioned it only becomes a matter of time till you too are being denied your freedoms.\nWE	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would believe that the trogan war was a great battle, as far as original battle strategies.

I believe that the best battle are faught before you even got to physical war. So you will not see these battles in history books.\n\nSun Tzu in the art of war says "Therefore, to gain a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; to subjugate the enemy's army without doing battle is the highest of excellence. \n\nTherefore, the best warfare strategy is to attack the enemy's plans, next is to attack alliances, next is to attack the army, and the worst is to attack a walled city. ? \n\nLaying siege to a city is only done when other options are not available.\n\nIf you like to see more of this check this out . \nhttp://www.sonshi.com/index.html	Politics & Government

I have never heard of your lease automatically renewing though.  Are you sure that it doesn't just go from the 1 year lease to a month to month lease.  Also, You said that you looked at your original lease, does it say anything in there about it automatically renewing itself?  If not they can not hold you to it.  They would need to file an addendum stating that you are renewing your lease.  You would have to sign this in order for you to be held to the contract.  These are just some thoughts, i don't want you to think that i am an expert or anything like that, because i am not.

question_title: Is the US a declining empire? [SEP] question_content: Seems like the US is a declining empire. They have elected an idiot for a leader and they are borrowing great sums of money from the world. Soon the American dollar will be worth less then a peso.China/Japan and other countries are quickly out pacing US technologies. You've squandered your natural resources and have become dependant on other countries for their resources. They are in a battle against a world wide organization that gets more supporters every time the US bombs a town. But, most of the US doesn't care about these issues or lies to themselves about these issues. They would rather kill each other for PS3's. Do you think the US is a declining empire? [SEP] best_answer: The U.S. is absolutely a declining empire.  It's a hard fact for most of us Americans to admit.  Most can't admit it at all.  But do a detailed comparison between decline of the Roman empire and the U.S. today (bread and circus, anyone?).

[SEP] best_answer: You shouldn't expect to get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case.  It would take an attorney no small amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details.

question_title: Post Divorce property? [SEP] question_content: Divorced for over a year now and the ex had rang up tons of debt with a POA and some in her name only as well while I was deployed, she allowed a car to get repo'd that was awarded to her that was in both out names and one credit card went to collection, I was awarded a auto loan that is in her name only and have possesion of the auto. Other than the divorce decree that awards me the debt what legal obligation do I have to pay the debt, as this would only affect her credit not mine and since she has all ready failed to pay her debts according to the divorce decree what obligation should I have to do the same. As of right now I cannot even contact the lender to obtain a pay off or even get the status of the account as she has locked me out and have red flagged the account so as to not allow me to even inquire about it. So even if I do pay the debt in full the title will go to her which in the long run means I will have to contact her to get the title. [SEP] best_answer: The bottom line is you have the pay the debt because the court ordered you too.  ALthough it will only affect her credit, you can bet if you don't pay she'll drag you into court on a contempt order.  Failing to obey the court's order will make you subject to arrest and imprisonment.  So to asnwer your question, the divorce decree is enough of a legal obligation - its all that's needed.  It a court orderfor you to pay the debt - if you don;t you get cited for contempt and go to jail.  If you don't like the decree get a lawyer and go into court to get a modification.  SHort of that, pay the debt.	Politics & Government

We also have increased security at our air ports which we would of done after 9-11 regardless of who was president . We have taken a closer look at securing possible targets for terrorists which we would have done regardless of who was in the White house .\nSo I must ask what has Bush Done .\nFinding Bin laden would be nice if he is still alive but really the terrorists react to our policy not our military .\nWe could have 10 million troops in Iraq and nothing would change  whats going on .\nUnless we handcuff each Iraqi to one of our soldiers nothing will change for the better for 50 years there .\nThese people do not change a religion overnight or in ten years it will take several generations to change how these people look at the world and what they believe God wants them to do .\nIt was not long ago we had witch trials and in the 50's we had a communist hunt that ruined hundreds of lives for no reason at all .\nIraq and terrorists are more of a threat now then the day before 9-11 .\nThey now know that 9-11 did nothing to prevent us from destroying what was a religion and way of life for millions of people .\nWe are forcing these people to let their women educate themselves, work in the community ,and earn money . Choose what kind of life they want .\nThis goes against everything these people have been taught .It is part of the teaching they follow out of the religious book they have .\nIt requires women to be the subjects of the husbands and to do as they are told without question .\nYou can not change this way of thinking in 10 years .\nIt is going to take a long time .\nHad Bush understood these people and not the Americanized version ,he would of known better then to invade Iraq and try to attempt the impossible .\nI wish it had worked out the way Bush had it planned in his head .1) we move in and secure the area \n2) we remove Saddam and the evil people running Iraq .\n3) We install a new government that is open to change and democracy for all .Restoring women's rights and peoples freedom to live free and not under a dictator who has killed tens of thousands of his own people .\nI do not deny that Saddam is or was a BAD leader .It is just not up to America to fix the worlds problems .\nWe need to have the commitment of every major nation on earth to achieve a change such as this .\nWe do not have it .\nagain I say what has Bush Accomplished .\nHe has eroded our civil rights and what we thought was freedom from intrusion into our personal lives is now common.\nTapping phones is not going to end .The genie is out of the bottle .\nPeople who are charged with crimes now will soon face torture because we let that out of the bottle also .\nOur bank accounts are no longer as private as we would like .\nI am concerned that writing a check to habbebes' dry cleaning will get the once over .\nWe have under Bush had the Supreme Court rule Against his plans and actions on numerous occasions .\nBush As far as I am concerned has done little to protect us from terrorists and opened the door to increase the surveillance of people and soon we will be like England and a guy will announce over a loud speaker to walk that bike across the street or pick up that Taco bell rapper you dropped .\nDo we want big brother looking at us all the time .\nThey read our post here all the time , Screen the mail and open suspicious  packages ,and have created a society that turns people into the government for a cookie .\nAs far as i am concerned Bush In his Attempt to protect America has overlooked the inherent problems that we will have as a result  of his Presidency and the regulations and laws he has requested to be in-acted for our good .\nThey are goin	Politics & Government

question_title: Has Y! Politics Evolved by Users into Something Y! didn't expect, but is better than what they intended? [SEP] question_content: Seems to me that Y! Politics has become an anomolistic breed in Answers unlike anything else in Answers.  Obviously, Y! hates it but sometimes you need to let users decide how best to use a technology and roll with it, rather than fight it.  That's the whole POINT of Web 2.0, let the users dictate the direction and contribute the content, not have the corporations predict how people will want to use technology and participate.\n\nY! would be far more successful if they listened to the vibe that their users were giving them and responding to it, rather than constantly trying to squash it.\n\nY! Politics is interesting because everyone has (at least the capacity for) good questions and good answers to contribute to virtually every topic.  Other questions tend to be narrowly focused and largely unanswerable 99% of the time.  Doesn't that make this area pretty unique?  Its highly interactive subject really allows people's intelligence, personality, and humor (or lack thereof) to shine. [SEP] best_answer: I have often wondered when Yahoo would 'get it'. This site has evolved into something their Community Guidelines could never have anticipated. And their relentless pursuit to get users to 'conform' is equally disappointing. Talk about having a 'goldmine' and not knowing how to 'mine it' !!!\n\nThere has been a recent, significant decline of users on this site as well. I'm talking about 'post election' numbers only . Even well after the elections, this site was 'rockin'. I believe many, many users got fed-up with the 'reporting sytem' and it's 'blind enforcement'. Again, go back to having a 'goldmine' and not knowing how to 'mine it' !!!\n\nThis topic is worthy of Full View by all Y/A users. Perhaps you should post this in the 'forum', and encourage all users to respond. Yahoo does recognize 'one thing'. And the 'one thing' is NUMBERS !!!!\n\nFeel free to email me,, if you plan on posting this in the 'forum'. I'll gladly respond. Thank you for addressing this issue!!!	Politics & Government
question_title: Hasn't Bush simultaneously taken on the powers of a wartime president re Al Qaeda and yet said the Geneva... [SEP] question_content: Convention doesn't apply to incarcerated Al Qaeda suspects because they are terrorists not POWs? [SEP] best_answer: WE are a signatory nation in the Geneva Conventions, and reading them, they apply not just to us, but anybody we fight against...pretty much so long as they openly carry a weapon and shoot at us.  Rounding up the local apple salesman of some Afghan village because the local peach salesman took $20 to tip off the local police does NOT make him a terrorist.  It makes us look very stupid for holding him for 4 years.\n\nThough I'm sure there's 3 or 4 really dangerous guys in Gitmo...TRIAL THEM and LOCK THEM UP FOR REAL.  That's how we work, that's how we've always work.  That's what the Bill of Rights says...those first 10 are INALIENABLE RIGHTS.  Rights we can't take away or grant because they inherently exist for ALL HUMAN BEINGS.\n\nTorturing ANYONE and holding ANYONE without trial is a massive violation to our Constitution.  Bush WILL be in handcuffs for this sooner or later.	Politics & Government

His appeal is limited to pathetic guys who actually look like him.\n\nLimbaughtomy is the transparently gay, verbally diarrheic spaz. He won't shut up, but never does anything but nag and whine and shriek in ecstacy. I have started liking him for turning more people to Liberalism than any public figure since FDR.

question_title: Is Muslim/Islam bashing becoming highly fashionable these days? My my, it seems Muslim or Islam bashing is? [SEP] question_content: ..common place in the West these days. \nYes, it is true that a handful characters who happened to be "muslims" have done evil things in the past, hence it seems to be OK to demonise all muslims. \n\nMuslims have only one problem. They have no quarell with the europeans, or Americans. They feel that their comrades in Palestine have been  marginalised, kicked out of their land, tortured, murdered by the Israelis, and the West has for some reason turned a blind eye. It is this injustice that the vast majority of muslms are angry with.\n\nMuslims have been living without any problem whatsoever in much of Europe in the last century, but recently eveything they do seems to attract the attention of the Europeans and the "Christians" living in these countries. It is shocking when dignified people in the Christian world (like the Pope) joins his country men to sneer at & talk about a handful of nikab wearing muslim women, -- dont u think perhaps we said ENOUGH to this shameful Muslim bashing? [SEP] best_answer: People love to hate.  And nothing will bring more people from different backgrounds together than hate, it makes people feel good to be able to look down on others and feel better about themselves.  It is very sad and I believe what goes around comes around for all of us.	Politics & Government

question_title: i live in michigan, can my employer not accept a doctors note to excuse an absence? [SEP] question_content: when i was hired my employer accepted doctors notes as an excuse for absence.  I have been there for 2 years and now they are trying to get me to sign this paper saying doctors notes are not accepted for excuse of absence.  They only give you 3.33 hours of sick time a month.  The paper says that they will terminate if you do not work your required number of hours even if you have a note from a doctor saying you were ill.  Now i thought they had to accept this because the doctor confirms you were ill.  I need help before i sign this paper because you can't control if you get the flu or something.  Am i supposed to go to work sick.  Basically is this legal? [SEP] best_answer: Yes. You failed to mention your employer. Not everything in Michigan is unionized. \n\n3.3 hours per month is really pretty stingy, but, considering most employers carry it forward, and into the non-flu season, and into the rest of the calendar year- it does add up....\n\nYou are always free to take your services elsewhere....correct?\n\nMichigan is not a service sector state, many of our citizens are not easily bullshitted, and some of us actually know and understand real economics, and, we also know that production is the real source of any growing wealth. Refute that promise to the Cbanking terms of downhill desguises.  \n\nSocialism, and communistic thoughts are at constant odds with real freedom. Certain legalities are up to the employer and the contract, and unto the employee to read. Providing said employer he/she has not broken any state or Constitutional liberties in the process.\n\nThe globalized work force is separating many false pretensions...more and more average American citizens are finally realizing who actually runs the big show and controls their worth with inflation/deflation/interest rates.\n\nI have no need to sidetrack myself and go there tonight.\n\nYou probably work for a smaller employer, if you need more time - then simply ask, and make it back up later when you are A1 healthy again. You must be valuable to them, and they will see that... right?\n\nTakecare, and be well.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why can people not debate this intellectually? [SEP] question_content: Why do all the supporters of illegal immigrants throw around all kinds of useless propaganda like we are all immigrants, or this is a smoke screen for(name your demon), or they just want a better life? Why can they not come up with anything other than saying that they work hard, as if that is their saving grace? Everything else they through around is baseless and useless in todays world. You say we NEED illegal immigrants, and I ask for some empirical evidence PROVING that. Notice the word illegal, so you don't get confused with illegal and legal immigrants. [SEP] best_answer: I am a real liberal rather than the usual anti-conservative and I am completely against illegal immigration.\n\nPeople are coming across the border (not just from Mexico and Latin America, but from Asia and Eastern Europe; not just in sweat shops but in sex industry as well) illegally because they are being recruited by unscrupulous employers to circumvent the idea of free market economics. If the demand for workers is greater than the willingness of the indigenous labor supply to settle for the money offered then wages are supposed to go up. Instead, a black market worker is smuggled into the country, often at great physical peril, and then is kept at a job which would be illegal because the hours are too long and the environment is too unsafe by the threat of deportation or physical intimidation and the worker cannot seek redress because he must remain secretive. This is BAD for America.\n\nHowever, and I am sure you will not like this, I fear that if the War in Iraq were going better we would not be debating this issue right now. The economy has been in the tank for almost five years, and illegal immigration has been a non-issue until six months before a major election when the party in power is seen as being weak. Maybe that is a smoke screen, maybe it's just a coincidence.	Politics & Government

I don't know if gets broken down into which media is used and how much is spent per outlet, but some basic deduction skills could get you in the ballpark.	Politics & Government

It happened with me.\n\nMy ex-wife left with the guy across the street.  I moved with our daughter (told my wife that we were), she didn't do squat.  Only called for a month or so, then just quit calling.\n\nAfter a year or so, I contacted an atty, and he filed the abandonment paperwork and 3 months later - she has no rights whatsoever.\n\nAfter 13 years, I still haven't heard a word from her.\n\nIt is especially sad that a woman would abandon a child.  she gave birth to it, cared for it and then decided that it was to much for her to deal with.

question_title: The supreme court decision that gave women rights? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Please be more specific.  \n\nRoe vrs. Wade gave a woman the right to suck a baby into a sink, ripping it from limb to limb.  \n\nThe 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote.\n\nNote to tulaksam: Less than 5% of all abortions are due to rape or the health of the mother.  All other abortions (including those conceived via incest) are abortions of convenience.  If women are so strong why can't they say "no" to sex when they do not want to carry the baby to full term?  If they get pregnant and don't want the baby, why are they not strong enough to give it up for adoption?  Roe v Wade will be overturned, because it is based on an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution. Abortion is an issue for each state to decide.  It is not a federal issue.  That is why it will be overturned.	Politics & Government

"\n\n\nLmao. What will you say next??? That the Red Cross and Red Crescent "help carry out terror attacks"??\nThe only reason Israel is stopping these HUMANITARIAN workers from entering Israel and the Palestinian territories is because you don't want them to help the Palestinians and you don't like the fact that they stand up for the Palestinian Peoples right to exist!

question_title: How do you change your drivers license number? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You cannot.  It is a uniquely identifiable number that actually incorporates some of your vital statistics into it.  They include your month of birth, state of birth, year of birth, sex, and first digit of your last name.  If you know what to look for you can tell a lot about a person from their driver's license number.  Bottom line - you cannot change your DL number without committing perjury (lying under oath) in most states, or without violating state statutes about providing false information on a DL application.  However, if you absolutely HAD to do it, you'd have to start with a new name and a new (probably fake) birth certificate.  Good luck getting that crap.	Politics & Government

question_title: why is it that our government thinks korea is going to fire a missle on us? [SEP] question_content: We are in the 21st century, why is everyone so over paranoid [SEP] best_answer: North Korea is a viable and potential aggressor. Under Kim's leadership, the government remains hostile and very anti-US. Some believe it is a device to attract attention and generous support from countries to just stand-down. They issued booklets warning citizens to prepare for a US invasion so is it a bluff? With missiles capable of reaching America and every major city in China, Japan and other areas it would seem to be a major gamble to doubt them and not be prepared. I do think that the US over-reacts in some places and sees shadows that don't exist but we shan't have the luxury of Paul Revere riding about to tell us the North Koreans are coming. It is a matter of minutes before your hometown might vanish. Is that so paranoid?	Politics & Government

question_title: What does a CASA volunteer do and do they require training? [SEP] question_content: CASA is court appointed special advocate. [SEP] best_answer: Each year over 500,000 children in the United States are thrust into court through no fault of their own. Some are victims of violence, psychological torment or sexual abuse. Others have been neglected or even abandoned by their own parents. Most of them are frightened and confused. \n\nIn many cases these children become victims a second time in an overburdened child welfare system that cannot pay close attention to each child whose life is in its hands. \n\nOften these children also become victims of this country's overburdened child welfare system - a complex network of lawyers, social workers and judges who frequently are too overburdened to give thorough, detailed attention to each child who comes before them. \n\nThat's where CASA comes in. Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) are trained volunteer community members who are appointed by a judge to advocate, on a one-to-one basis, for a child who has been removed from home due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment. The volunteer gets to know the child and then lets the judge and others in the child welfare system know the child's perspective and the child's needs.	Politics & Government

He then kidnaps a woman, forces her into the truck of his car, proceeds to leave the area only to swerve from hitting 3 drunks and run into the concrete barrier. The impact of the crash casuing the victim to sustain a serious head injury and lapse into a deep deathlike coma. The suspects proceeds to take the victim to a secluded park and have sexual intercourse with her. The victim eventaully recover and the suspect is charged with kidnapping, sexual assault and attempted murder. How does the drug LSD affect the intoxicated suspect mind frame and how would you rule in this case? [SEP] best_answer: First of WHERE THE HELL did his friend get 10 ML of LSD?\nThe "normal dose" of LSD is about 25‚Äì50 micrograms, Which means that 10 ml contains about 1000 doses. [1]\nEven though it is hard to overdose to DEATH on LSD, such a high dose would lead to a collapse and he would not be raping anyone. \n\nSecondly, the rule for involuntary intoxication -- will usually excuse any actions that would not have been committed if the person was not involuntarily intoxicated.\nThe good way to prove this would be for a man to get evidence that he was drunk before a number of times and never hurt anyone. And therefore it was an IMMENSE dose of LSD that make him do it and not alcohol, and thus he is not responsible.[2]	Politics & Government

question_title: why havent they found medicine against aids or cancer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is NOT YET "cure" for AIDS.  There are several approved drug treatments that seem to slow the growth of the HIV viruses (which causes AIDS), and seem to slow the progress of the AIDS disease.\nSo far, these are imperfect for several reasons; they don't work for everyone, they have serious side effects, and the virus is "learning" to overcome these drugs.\nCancer is actually many different diseases, with many different causes, affecting many different parts of the body, and with many different outcomes.  There are cures for a few types of cancer; effective treatments for many others; but there are still some types that we don't\nhave effective weapons to use against.  \n\nWell..

Imitrex injections when I did get them. \n\nWith all of the new improvements and advancements the combo of Celexa and Topomax daily took me down to having maybe 5-6 a month.

[SEP] question_content: After shaving my legs, I usually end up with red bumps on my foot and legs and they itch like crazy, leaving ugly marks. Can someone plz help me out here, I have tried all sorts of things. [SEP] best_answer: Forget shaving cremes!  I hate them!  One of the nicest things to use on your legs while shaving is baby oil.  Just be very careful and shave slowly because it can be slippery (also put a towel down so none drips on the floor)  After you are done, you're legs will be super smooth.  I've never gone back to shaving creme or soap after trying baby oil.  \n\nAlso, make sure you wash your hands after you put it on your legs (before you try to shave) so you can keep a good grip on the razor.

question_title: I work with someone who has Fredricks Artaxia  what is the life expectency? [SEP] question_content: my patient was told 36 is the life expectancy of this illness she is 34 now does anyone know if this is true she was diagnosed in her early 20's also wonder if it is contagious in anyway to the care givers or family. [SEP] best_answer: Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an inherited, progressive nervous system disorder causing loss of balance and coordination.\n\nThe rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most patients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symptom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility by age 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications is also quite variable.  but may be as late as the mid-sixties.  the particular length of the triple repeat has not been correlated strongly enough with disease progression to allow prediction of the course of the disease on this basis.it is not catching .\nThe gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin. Normal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structures known as mitochondria, where it is thought to be involved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, the frataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with nonsense information known as a "triple repeat." This extra DNA interferes with normal production of frataxin, thereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence may be repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symptoms and severity of FA seems to be associated with the number of repetitions. Patients with more copies have more severe symptomatology. Researchers are still wrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromosome 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggests that FA develops in part because defects in iron transport prevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.\n\nThe nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the spinal cord involved in relaying information between muscles and the brain. Tight control of movement requires complex feedback between the muscles promoting a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. Without this control, movements become uncoordinated, jerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.\n\nits inherted in the genes.	Health

Seeing as I haven't known much different, I can't tell what would be different if I had a less stressful life. Would I have a better memory? Would my weight be different? What are typical changes in our body from stress? [SEP] best_answer: Effects of Stress \n\n\nStress can affect you both immediately (acute stress) and over time (chronic stress).\n\nTension is often the first signal of acute stress. Tense muscles are tight and feel "hard" to the touch. A tense mind makes you feel jumpy, irritable, and unable to concentrate. This could be your signal to do something about stress, both for your immediate comfort and to prevent the long-term effects of stress.\n\nSymptoms of stress\nCommon symptoms of stress include:\n\nRapid heartbeat. \nHeadache. \nStiff neck and/or tight shoulders. \nBackache. \nRapid breathing. \nSweating and sweaty palms. \nUpset stomach, nausea, or diarrhea. \nYou also may notice signs of stress in your thinking, behavior, or mood. You may:\n\nBecome irritable and intolerant of even minor disturbances. \nFeel irritated or frustrated, lose your temper more often, and yell at others for no reason. \nFeel jumpy or exhausted all the time. \nFind it hard to concentrate or focus on tasks. \nWorry too much about insignificant things. \nDoubt your ability to do things. \nImagine negative, worrisome, or terrifying scenes. \nFeel you are missing opportunities because you cannot act quickly.

question_title: What is witch hazel?  Can i use it while on differin and cleocin-t? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Witch-hazel is the common name for a genus of shrubs Hamamelis in the family Hamamelidaceae, with four species, two in North America (H. virginiana and H. vernalis), and one each in Japan (H. japonica) and China (H. mollis). The Persian Ironwood, a closely related tree formerly treated as Hamamelis persica, is now given a genus of its own, as Parrotia persica, as it differs in the flowers not having petals. Other closely allied genera are Parrotiopsis, Fothergilla and Sycopsis (see under Hamamelidaceae). The Witch-Hazel is not closely related to the Common Hazel.\n\nThey are popular garden shrubs, grown for their clusters of rich yellow to orange-red flowers which begin to expand in the autumn before the leaves fall and continue throughout the winter. It is one of the earliest blooming garden plants. The bark and leaves are astringent, the extract, also referred to as Witch Hazel, is used medicinally. Extracts from its bark and leaves are used in aftershave lotions and lotions for treating bruises. The seeds contain a quantity of oil and are edible. The name is derived from the use of the twigs as divining rods, just as hazel twigs were used in England.\n\nHamamelis species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Feathered Thorn.\n\nThe word witch has its origins in Middle English wiche, from the Old English wice, meaning "pliant" or "bendable", and which also gives us Wicker and weak.

Yet, many of us hardly drink ANY water.\n\nTherefore, I assume it is Will Power which will allow us to follow the directions to a "T" and avoid harmful things.  How do YOU increase YOUR Will Power?

You have to let yourself some leeway for messing up, otherwise the first time you actually do mess up you wont want to continue what you are doing because it isn't perfect. \nDont shoot for perfection.

question_title: How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Where do you live?  I have been taking a class called "Core Fusion" for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt).  It is offered at Exhale Spa, which has locations in Boston, New York, Chicago, Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006.  \n\nIf you are not near an Exhale, yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?).  So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring).  \n\nThere are also the old "standbys" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat).  One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries.  \n\nIf you go to the gym, some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines.

question_title: Reflux Pain Gallstones??How do you know??Short Time of Fever and Chills..then goes .odd! Pain comes and goes!?

Not much help there, they told me to go to EMERG. Typical answer.\n\nMy urine is not dark, and I took some Ranitidine with milk as I am totally out of Pantoloc and Pariat. No vomiting or nausea. The pain comes and goes under my right rib area, not in my shoulders. I am constantly rubbing the area, I tried an ice pack, and BEN GAY, that remedy just irrates the area in question. It's a strong nasty pain like someone sticking a knife into you, it comes and goes. Caffeine irrates it too, so do Cheezy's or anything spicey, Bad foods that I eat.

I live in the only modernized city n the world that does NOT have a hospital in the downtown core-Ottawa Canada, very difficult to get to if you dont have a car and live alone. So I suffer at home late at night. [SEP] best_answer: Could very well be gall stones...although gallstones do not usually produce a fever.  Sounds like you have a history of GI problems given the drugs you have available.  It is very possible to have ulcers and/or diverticuli that become infected and cause the type of pain that you describe with fever. The products that are exacerbating the pain would do so with either.  A bad gall bladder will in addition to pain cause flatulence and belching.  You are the right age for either problem.  STOP SMOKING!!!   That is the worst thing you can do if you have stomach problems.  Milk is not good for either gall bladder or ulcerative problems as it increases the production of stomach acid and phlegmy secretions.  Your symptoms do suggest that medical intervention is eminante.  Good luck and God Bless!	Health

question_title: what is xanex used for? What is it in medical terms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Xanax is in the class of drugs called "benzodiazepenes".  It is an anti-anxiety agent effecting GABA production in your brain.  It is not generally useful as an anti-depressant.  Its most effective use if for a biological condition known as Panic Disorder.  People with Panic Disorder may need to take a small daily dose indefinitely in order to function and have a decent quality of life.  When used properly under the guidance of a physician they are actually one of the safer medications on the market as far as lack of bad side-effects, allergies, etc.  Continued use will cause a dependency on the drug, but many people with panic feel that this is a very fair trade-off.

Each time, things cleared up greatly for a few days, then symptoms returned. I know that sometimes you have to take anti-biotics for 4-12 weeks to get better. Does that mean that my symptoms won't improve for a few weeks and I shouldn't be concerned yet? I'm terrified that I have one of those cases of prostatitis that never goes away. I know this happens sometimes but just don't know if I'm overreacting because it's taking some time to get better. I'm miserable! Pain, no sexual function...I'm basically incapacitated. Has anyone had prostatitis that took a long time to clear up? Please help!! I'm only 32!! [SEP] best_answer: One of the most effective treatment protocols for this problem is a combination of frequent vigorous prostatic massage combined with long term antibiotic therapy. The prostate has a poor blood supply and in order to ensure that a sufficient amount of antibiotics get into this gland, proper drainage is required. Regular massage combined with long term antibiotic treatment should solve this problem.\nIt is most important to ensure that your sexual partner be treated as well. If your partner is a woman, any recurrent yeast infections are a definite sign of her being infected with a non-culturable STD organism. The presence of these organisms can be proven with a PCR (DNA) test.\nIf she has this problem, an effective treatment is oral fluconazol combined with a topical antifungal like terconazol together with a prolonged treatment of a newer tetracycline analogue taken orally. Although macrolide antibiotics (long acting erythromycins) work, they can become problematic when combined with  oral antifungal medications.\nIncidentally, the reason why women develop vulval yeast infections 'down there' is because the mucous membranous lining in that area has lost its integrity from an underlying nanobacterial infection. This type of bug cannot be grown in a typical lab. Keep in mind that yeast is everywhere and opportunistic. Conditions have to be just right before it can make a home anywhere on your body.\nThe unfortunate thing is that a lot of healthcare providers aren't aware of this phenomenom so it's often treated erroneously.\nAlthough the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are very effective, minocycline has been proven to be very safe when used long term.

question_title: Can we get sick after kissing? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Missed parties. Postponed exams. Sitting out a season of team sports. And loneliness. These are a few of the ways that scourge of high school and college students known as "mono" can affect your life. \n\nThe disease whose medical name is infectious mononucleosis is most common in people 10 to 35 years old, with its peak incidence in those 15 to 17 years old. Only 50 people out of 100,000 in the general population get mono, but it strikes as many as 2 out of 1,000 teens and twenty-somethings, especially those in high school, college, and the military. While mono is not usually considered a serious illness, it may have serious complications. Without a doubt your lifestyle will change for a few months. \n\nYou've probably heard people call mono the "kissing disease." But if your social life is in a slump, you may wonder, "How did I get this 'kissing disease' when I haven't kissed anyone romantically recently?" \n\nHere's how. Mono is usually transmitted though saliva and mucus--which is where the "kissing disease" nickname comes from. But the kissing or close contact that transmits the disease doesn't happen right before you get sick. The virus that causes mono has a long incubation period: 30 to 50 days from the time you're exposed to it to the time you get sick. In addition, the virus can be transmitted in other ways, such as sipping from the same straw or glass as an infected person--or even being close when the person coughs or sneezes. Also, some people can have the virus in their systems without ever having symptoms and you can still catch it from them. \n\nTwo viruses can cause mono: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Both viruses are in the herpes family, whose other members include viruses responsible for cold sores and chickenpox. \n\nEBV causes 85 percent of mono cases. About half of all children are infected with EBV before they're 5, but at that young age, it usually doesn't cause any symptoms. If you don't become infected with EBV until you're a teen or older, you're more likely to develop mono symptoms. After you're infected, the virus stays with you for life, but usually doesn't cause any additional symptoms. Still, every now and then you may produce viral particles in your saliva that can transmit the virus to other people, even though you feel perfectly fine. By age 40, 85 to 90 percent of Americans have EBV antibodies, indicating they have the virus in their systems and are immune to further EBV infection. \n\nCMV is also a very common virus. About 85 percent of the U.S. population is infected with it by the time they reach adulthood. As with EBV, CMV is frequently symptomless, and mono most often results when infection occurs in the teens and 20s. Sore throat is less common in people who have CMV mono than in those infected with EBV. \n\nAs another one of its nicknames--glandular fever--implies, perhaps the most distinguishing mono symptom is enlarged glands or lymph nodes, especially in the neck, but also in the armpit and groin. \n\nAnother common mono symptom is fever. A temperature as high as 39.5 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) is not uncommon. Other symptoms include a tired achy feeling, appetite loss, white patches on the back of the throat, and tonsillitis. \n\n"My tonsils got so swollen they were touching each other in back," says Heidi Palombo of Annandale, Va., who had mono when she was a senior in college. She recalls her throat being "so hot and swollen that the only thing that felt good was ice water." \n\nCold drinks and frozen desserts are both ways to relieve sore throat symptoms. Doctors also recommend gargling with saltwater (about half a teaspoon salt to 8 ounces of warm water) and sucking on throat lozenges available over the counter in pharmacies and other stores. If throat or tonsils are infected, a throat culture should be taken so the doctor can	Health

question_title: is everyday masturbating a risk for man(not becoming dad or none healthy baby)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: MASTURBATION MYTHS:\nfrom http://www.jackinworld.com/library/myths.html\n\nChances are, of all the things you've heard about masturbation, most of them were absolutely false. For some reason, misinformation surrounds masturbation like virtually no other topic. How do you spot a masturbation myth? One simple method is to ask yourself if the statement is also true of sexual intercourse. When you're masturbating, your body only knows it's getting sexually stimulated; it doesn't know by what means. So, for instance, if the question is whether or not masturbation causes acne, think of it this way: If it did, intercourse would also cause acne. In fact, neither masturbation nor intercourse cause acne.\n\nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes hair to grow on your palms.\nFACT:\nHow many people with hair on their palms have you seen?  \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes hair loss, chronic fatigue, and other problems.\nFACT:\nInternet scam artists have tried to invent a concept called "overmasturbation," insisting that you have to buy their expensive herbal pills in order to counteract the effect of masturbating more than a couple of times per week. But the pills have absolutely no effect ‚Äî and masturbating once or twice a day will not make your hair fall out, or cause anything else they claim.\nMYTH:\nMasturbation is bad for your eyesight. \nFACT:\nMasturbation does not affect eyesight. This myth probably originated because boys often start having to wear glasses at about the same age they start masturbating. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes your penis to stop growing (or) to get bigger. \nFACT:\nMasturbation has no effect on penis size whatsoever. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes your testicles to shrink.\nFACT:\nAbsolutely false! It is true that if you're highly aroused, your testicles become engorged with blood and may appear slightly larger and heavier, and that masturbating will make them revert to normal. But they will absolutely not be any smaller than after the last time you masturbated. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes acne. \nFACT:\nIt doesn't cause acne. Like the eyesight myth, this is a case of two things that happen at the same time, even though one doesn't cause the other. \nMYTH:\nMasturbation causes sexually transmitted diseases. \nFACT:\nHello? "Sexually transmitted" means from one person to another. You can't give yourself a sexually transmitted disease! \nMYTH:\nIf you masturbate too much, you'll run out of semen and become sterile. \nFACT:\nSemen is a fully renewable resource. When you ejaculate semen, your body simply makes more ‚Äî the same way your body makes more saliva after you spit. \nMYTH:\nPeople can tell whether you masturbate by how your penis looks. \nFACT:\nMasturbation does not change the appearance of your penis. (It does tend to cause an erection, but that usually goes away when you're finished.) \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nMasturbation Frequency:\nhttp://www.jackinworld.com/misc/faqtree1.html#mastfreq\n\nHow often does the average male masturbate?\nIt depends on a lot of factors, the most important being age. For an 18-year-old male, a rough average is once a day or so. This is slightly higher for younger teenagers ‚Äî maybe 10 or 12 times a week, and slightly lower for older people. You might be surprised by how often adult men masturbate ‚Äî even happily married men.\n\nI think I'm addicted to masturbation. Is that possible?\nIt is, although many, many people think they're addicted when they're really just doing what comes naturally. For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/addict.html).\n\nHow can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?\nIt's tough; it takes a lot of will power. It can be done, especially if you're driven by very strong religious feelings. However, JackinWorld's position is that it's not worth it. We thin	Health

(I exercise) [SEP] best_answer: The diet is not bad FOR AWHILE, but I'd encourage you to be taking a high quality multivitamin to make sure you are getting the nutrients you need. \n\nI'm a big advocate of a green-source type supplement...something made from fruits and vegetables (no calories...don't worry), rather than a synthetic vitamin. Such supplements provide not only the macronutrients you need, but also the lesser known micronutrients to help with absorption and utilization. There are many types out there. I have used Juice Plus and am now using Nanogreens.\n\nEdit: I encourage you to ignore the answer above mine...you need the calories and nutrition from the shake given how restricted your diet is. Drinking extra water is certainly good however.	Health

I was in a coma for six weeks and rehab for the following six months, every day. \nIt was very difficult, I had to learn how to breathe, hold my head up, open my mouth, make sounds, stand, walk with a walker, walk with crutches, talk, write, count, make coherent sentences, add and subtract numbers - you get the idea.

I've tried googling it, but they're either complete misses or I don't understand a word they say.\n\nMy dentist has recommended that I tell my orthodontist to give me this type of treatment.  She wants to shove my two front teeth up higher to (I assume) help compensate for the bone loss in one of them.\n\nI'd like to know more about the procedure.  I may not be using the word correctly...... [SEP] best_answer: Intruding does exhist, although it is not alway successfull.  FIrst, the source of the bone loss much be discovered, and eliminated.  If it is a brushing/ flossing problem, get the hygienist to teach you the proper method.  If it is a perio pocket, that a toothbrush and floss can not reach, then 3 month dental visits should be sceduled to keep the pocket clean as well an arestin or other antibiotic should be placed into the pocket.  If you are sure the source that caused the origional bone loss is no longer there - then intrusion can provide assistance, but not the solution.  Intrustion is going to make the tooth shorter, and may cause additional bone loss.  It is somewhat unpredictable.   I would talk to an oral surgeon about a bone graft or perio chip to grow new bone.\n\nGood luck!	Health

question_title: Contraception and constant bleeding! Help!? [SEP] question_content: I had the coil put in 6months ago and have bled for most of the time!I'm lucky if I get a break for 1 or 2 weeks, then I bleed for at least another 4 weeks! Docs say just my body getting used to the coil! Also got a smell coming from down there now! Wash regularly, don't sleep around, been checked for bacterial infection, no discharge! Need help! xxx [SEP] best_answer: Birth control is really such a hit and miss.  It can be an unique experience for each person.  The person who posted before me said she is very happy with the Depo shot.  One Depo shot caused me to bleed for six months straight.  It was bad enough that I had to have regular blood tests to check for anemia.  I went back on the pill and did fine. One of my girlfriends has problems on the pill, but she loves her IUD.  Another friend had problems with her IUD, and is now using condoms.  The point is, not every contraception method works for everybody.  Sometimes you have to try them, and if they are not right for you, you try something else.\nIf you feel like your GYN is not taking your concerns seriously, by all means, change doctors.    I am assuming you have researched your particular coil on line.  If you haven't that is a great way to start.  Is this a normal side effect?  Good luck and don't give up.  I know it is frustrating, and a pain in the as*, but eventually you will find a method right for you.....	Health

The muscles are warm and the cardio will seem easier.  I would only do the punching bag on the days I lift for shoulders, back, chest, and arms.

I love to run but I can go for more than a quater mile without feeliing like my head will explode. help! [SEP] best_answer: I used to have the same problem, but while visiting my aunt in Chicago... I was out for a run and was going to meet my mom at the local Starbucks. She noticed how I was breathing and gave me some pointers...make sure that u are breathing IN through your nose and OUT through your mouth. Take big breaths in with your nose and the same amount out with your mouth. If you practice this it will become 2nd nature and you won't even have to worry about it. The reason your head is pounded is because it is not getting enough oxygen so it has to work harder. Make sure that you are getting enough air. also make sure that you aren't running hard. Your goal is to try to not hear much of a sound when your feet touch the ground- it should be a light movement. And with your arms don't swing them in front of your body, and have them cross paths, because this takes more energy. Instead, have your arms swinging to the side in controlled motions this helps break wind resistance and makes it easier to run and it takes less energy enabling you to run faster. And practice all of these techniques so that it becomes easier and you will run faster and farther than ever! Good luck!	Health

question_title: how can you lose weight quick,easy, and not have to do stupid stuff?

They will be your ... "Bible", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n‚Ä¢ Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have "low fat" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n‚Ä¢ About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle "burn". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck	Health

question_title: i have a cousin who is a professional bum-are you? [SEP] question_content: definition: sitting and lying down with some minimal chores, no job,lives at home with parents,eats and lives on their expences. a total freeloader! [SEP] best_answer: "professional bum is an oxymoron" Calling some one a bum because he does'nt work, makes thing worse. There are far more people in the world then there are jobs. You cant expect everyone to have a job, because as soon as somebody gets hired, that job is unavailable for everybody else. Many people feel that not working is immoral, It was,thousands of years ago when everybody in a tribe had to do his share of the work, or they would'nt have enough food, but now a few percent of the population can produce enough food to feed everyone. Its not hard to make enough of something now, the challenge is to sell it. In America most of the real work is done by machines, women, and people who are not U.S. citizens, including people who make things for us overseas. We dont need people to do more work. Most american companies have too many employees, and can increase profits by laying off redundant workers. Yes, there are want ads,and there are jobs available, but they're not going to hire a bum when they can hire someone who gets his work done. If there was a job sharing program where you would share your job with an unemployed person, and you each worked every other day and you each got half of your salary. would you participate? Perhaps "professional bum" is a term that means an unemployed man who will never get a job and does'nt look for one. Bums believe that nobody wants them. They get this idea when they get fired from jobs, and they dont succeed in getting another job. To stop being a bum, a man must believe that he is'nt really a bum, and there is a job somewhere that is easy enough that he can do it, and someone who will want him as an employee. He must believe in himself, or nobody else will. He needs a family that does'nt perceive him as a bum, or acts like they dont.	Health
question_title: Can using a vibrator too much cause it to be harder to climax with a partner? [SEP] question_content: I heard if you use a vibrator to much it makes it harder to acheive climax with manual stimulation. Has anyone experienced this problem? [SEP] best_answer: There has not been any credible research on this phenomenon.  However, we have heard health care professionals "warn their patients" of the horrible dangers of the vibrator, but have been unable to find any evidence based research to back up their words of caution. If a woman misuses a vibrator by holding it directly on the clitoris for an extended period of time, she may temporarily lose sensation (like when your leg falls asleep) but the sensation will return.   Some doctors may recommend that their patients should avoid over-using a vibrator, because they don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the ins and outs of using bedroom accessories for pleasure.  Even after checking with The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, they have not found evidence that vibrators cause nerve damage.\n\nWhat some women may notice is that the use of a vibrator may become monotonous.  Just like with any other pleasurable act, if you do the same thing over and over again it may not be as effective.  Just like when the missionary position may have been enough for you and your partner at the beginning of your relationship, after some time passed you may have wanted to ‚Äúspice things up.‚Äù  If this is the case, maybe try a different type of vibrator.  If you have been using a bullet consistently and it isn‚Äôt having the same effect, try one with different textures, vibrations, or a vibrator that has rotating beads as well.  Maybe pair your vibrator or bullet with a heightener like Ex-T-Cee to add to the sensation you are feeling.  Remember that the human body can get used to a certain sensation or activity, so keep changing things up to maximize your pleasure!	Health
question_title: What's your reason for living? [SEP] question_content: I am depressed(diagnosed with chronic depression whith major depressive episodes).  I have been since I was 12, and while most of the time I don't want to die, I don't really want to live either.  I don't see the point; I have no reason to drag myself out of bed other then sheer stubborness.  So I'm asking all of you folks, what is it that keeps you going?  Maybe it'll help me find my inspiration. [SEP] best_answer: I live for myself and the people I love... Going through most of my life, I never felt love. Oh, I told plenty of people I loved them and of course they said it back. Though I did not feel it, it was like something alien to me... So I fell into a deep depression, barely eating, not talking to anyone, just sort of floating through my life with a glazed look on my face. Then my nephew was born and I ended up having to raise him for a year, myself. I finally felt that love for something other than myself, I loved my nephew so much that it opened the way for me to love others.\n\nGranted, I still don't feel that sort of love from my family but I now love three people. THREE PEOPLE, one of which I am trying to get involved with. So, I suppose I live for love really... As corny as that sounds. I want the chance to be able to love as many people as I can now, within reason. lol	Health

question_title: How do you use a tampon? I'm serious? [SEP] question_content: I've always used pads, but this year I want 2 change. [SEP] best_answer: You may be worried and nervous about using your first tampon. Talk to your mom or a friend who has used tampons. It is important to first learn how to use a tampon and then, just relax! The more you relax, the easier the insertion will be. When you are nervous, your muscles tense up, making insertion even harder. For your first time, you may want to try using a tampon when your menstrual flow is heavy; this should allow the tampon to glide in more easily. Choose the smallest size tampon for the first time. By following these simple guidelines, and those that come with your package of tampons, your first experience with tampons should be easy.\n\nSit or stand in a comfortable position. Some women prefer to place one leg on the toilet seat or tub, while others prefer to squat down. After you find a position that is most comfortable for you, hold the tampon with the fingers that you write with. Hold the middle of the tampon, at the spot where the smaller, inner tube inserts into the larger, outer tube. Make sure the string is visible and pointing away from your body.\n\n\nWith your other hand, open the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) and position the tampon in the vaginal opening.\n\n\nGently push the tampon into the opening, aiming for the small of your back. Stop when your fingers touch your body and the applicator, or outer tube, is completely inside the vagina.\n\n\nOnce the applicator or outer tube is inside of you, use your index finger to push the inner tube (the tube where the removal string is connected) through the outer tube.\n\n\nOnce the inner tube is all the way in, use your thumb and middle finger to remove the applicator or outer tube. Make sure that the string hangs outside of the vaginal opening. Later, when you are ready to remove the tampon, hold the string and gently pull it downward until the entire tampon is out. \nIf the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. If you feel uncomfortable in any way, you may have inserted the tampon incorrectly or the tampon may not be placed far enough into the vagina. If this happens, just remove the tampon and start again with a new tampon. Remember that practice makes perfect. If you don't get it on the first try, your second try will most likely be successful. Instead of getting frustrated and giving up, relax and try again!	Health
question_title: if spasticity is reduced by botox than what are the chances of improvement in coordination of muscular action? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: None.  Botox blocks the neuromuscular junction (the last step in the peripheral nervous system connection to the muscles).  Coordination of muscle action is controlled by the central nervous system, which is not affected by Botox (the real stuff, not the underground stuff).	Health

[SEP] question_content: i don't know why people get married and they hurt themselvs and then end up in divorce. so buddies i would want to know why they do it. do canadain's still get married? [SEP] best_answer: The only real benefit to marriage is tax relief. The government allows for more tax credit for married couples. The government views marriage as a business venture. That's why marriage certificates in most states have the seal of the treasurer on them.\n\nFor the majority of women the benefits are obvious: Child support and alimony. \n\nFor most men, there are no benefits.\n\nIf you really care about some one and truly love them you'll sign a pre-nuptial. It will make sure that the marriage is entered and, if it comes to it, exited on good terms.	Health

question_title: Women, do you hate when you man.........................? [SEP] question_content: I was just wondering if any other women out there have this problem? I have caught my husband on several occasions "releasing" himself. He knows that if he wants some, all he has to do is just come to me. What makes me really upset, is that when we have a night to ourselves, he'd rather do "that'' than make love to his wife(me). I have told him that this hurts my feelings, and that it makes me feel unattractive on several occasions. But again, it continues. Am I the only one? [SEP] best_answer: I've caught my husband doing it frequently also. We had a talk about it though and he told me sometimes he just doesnt feel like sex because he needs release and just wants to get it over with. I actually woke up one night and he was releasing himself while watching a porno on mute. I freaked out about it. I love pleasing him and it offends me too. Although I can kind of relate to why he does it without me sometimes because I do it without him sometimes too. I just dont want to have sex sometimes. it seems though that he doesnt want to have sex with you at all...and if that is what your saying, let him catch you a few times...if it doesnt make him jump your bones right then...I guess the only thing to do is look into couples therapy. Some guys are actually addicted to masterbating.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Women Only!!!!! Need Advice and Tips!!!!? [SEP] question_content: I was talkin to this girl for a year and she decided right before new years to break it up cuz she felt it was gettin boring and she didnt know whut she wanted. The time we were talkin, she would say how much she loved me, and she wanted kids with me, etc. We kept mild contact like a couple phone calls a week, but 3 weeks later, I find out she talkin to another guy. I write a letter to her, but it doesn't seem to affect her cuz she tells me "why am i trying so hard", and "things are different now". I still love her a lot, and I know she still cares some what because her friend likes me more than the new guy and tells me that she thinks of me sometimes. It's been 3 mos. and the situation hasn't changed, but I dont know if I'm doin something wrong. We haven't talked for like 3 weeks. How can I bring the attraction back? the guy shes talkin to is a loser (but i dont show it bothers me)!! doesn't work or go to school!! PLEASE...any advice on how to get her back would help a lot!! [SEP] best_answer: You want her back bro. This is man to man sh*t here. Blow her off. Seriously, just trust my advice and blow her off. Pretend you are on and better off and she will see that and realize you are intriguing to her again and she will start talking to you again. But play semi hard to get with her. Take it like you don't give a damn about nothing and if you 2 ever get together again it doesn't make a differance to you. But try to be exciting around her. Do something you normally wouldn't do. Take a chance and make sure she sees it or knows about it. You can handle it. Woman are complex creatures but once you know how to get through to them, you are golden for life. Well until they catch on to your knowledge of their ways.	Family & Relationships

The basics love, marriage, and children minus the drama, lies, and challenge. We both been through relationships that we love despite of the other person. Well my dilema is that he's in Ghana at the present time. He sent me this sweet email and I responded and I sent one back and the next day which was yesterdayI had more thoughts so I sent another. He has checked both of them and he hasn't responded. Should I just wait or just put as it could of, would of but isn't. [SEP] best_answer: Give him time. Do you know his work schedule and what it is like. He may have checked the email and just not had time to respond to it. Maybe he is gathering his thoughts of what he may want to say to you. Sometimes it is harder for men to express their feelings because they don't want to seem like a pushover, or move to fast. I would wait and give him another day or so. I know that it can be hard when you are filled with anticipation.

question_title: How one can measure  whether one is broad minded or consevative in all aspects ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Broadminded and conservative are mutually exclusive terms.  Conservatives have a set of beliefs that narrow their outlook, and their minds are by nature geared to have a narrow outlook and to want a narrow outlook.  They thrive having their minds restricted by authoritarian ideologies like religion, law-and-order, and other such prescribing dictates.  They are very uncomfortable with personal liberty management, and that is why they fight so constantly to get enforcement of prescribing rules and regulations.  It looks like they want everyone to go by what they believe, and that sure would be fine with them, but what really motivates them is their own need to escape the frightening personal liberty management issues that broadminded people handle well and enjoy.\n\nSo you can tell if you are broadminded or conservative by how well you deal with personal liberty, how threatened you are by non-standard and traditional life-styles, how much liberty you are willing to tolerate other people having.

ALSO get a tape recorder and tape it anytime he threatens you.  Verbal threats are a violation of yet another law. As soon as you have these things take them to the police station and tell them everything and show them your proof.  Be very careful, sometimes these types of people will escalate the bad behavior instead of giving up and going away.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: I want to be the guy at the club that girls notice, but I feel like I blend in the club.How can I stand out? \n\nHow do you decide on who to talk to? [SEP] best_answer: Simply put - self confidence.  And don't be afraid to talk to women.  I don't know how many times I will see a guy look at me (By that, I mean LOOK), but won't say anything.  A lot of women are shy, or were taught that they should not approach a guy - to let him approach you.  (My mother taught that a girl should never call a guy first, or approach him.)  I wish that when guys noticed a girl, they would just come up to us and say something (aside from a lame pickup line).  \n\nOh yeah - and you should talk to whoever you feel a connection with.  If you catch someone looking at you, and they kind of grin and look away, go talk to her!	Family & Relationships

Ya'll need to make your mind and the next thing you know its too late..did that ever happened to one you ladies in here? [SEP] best_answer: I think because the thrill is attracting to women. The thought of doing something "naughty" something they shouldnt be doing.\nBut in the end every women wants a good man that is going to treat them right and that wants the same things out of life as them	Family & Relationships
question_title: Can you think of any ways I can save time. Or reduce stress.? [SEP] question_content: I work 40 hours a week and single parent. [SEP] best_answer: The most important thing you can do is to get up 15-30 minutes a day earlier than normal, and take that brief time for yourself every day to reflect and plan your day out. This may take some of the urgency out of your daily tasks.\n\nReduce caffeine intake; while it may wake you up, it's a false and fleeting source of energy. Eat as well as you can, and take at least 1 hour per week to do something small you enjoy.\n\nYou didn't mention the age of your child/children.

question_title: If both parents are the same  height will the children be the same height, what are your observations? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the human genome, humans have a base height that is added to the height genes. so if both parents have half tall genes and half short genes (lets just say T for tall and t for short), like the mother may have TtTTtt and the father may have ttTtTT, the the child may turn out many ways, for example it could receive all three tall genes from the mother and all three tall genes from the father (TTTTTT) or it could receive all three short genes from the mother and all three short genes from the father (tttttt) or it could be any combination in-between.(TTtTtT, TTtTTT, TtttTt,...).  However, if both the parents are have all short genes (both have tttttt) then the only combination possible for the child is tttttt, and the same goes for the tall genes.  There is one more major possibility, but the parents would not be the same height.  If the mother had all short genes (tttttt) and the father had all tall genes (TTTTTT) then the child would have 3 short genes and 3 tall genes (TtTtTt not necessarily in that order).  Also keep in mind that there are more than 6 genes that control height.  And just to screw things all up, height depends on more that genetics (environment, eating habits, sports, injuries...).  To make things more complicated, other genes indirectly affect height.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I know it is the eternal question from guys. But is 5.25 inches a small penis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely.\n\nWhile there are some girls who truly do like the feeling of a really giant penis inside of them, the vast majority do not.\n\nMen are FAR more concerned with penis size than women are, on the whole.\n\nThe truth is that very few women can reach orgasm from penetration alone, regardless of the size of the penis doing the penetration.  In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.\n\nThe truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind ‚Äì that can be LOTS of fun.\n\nThe truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.  If you can learn how to properly stimulate a girl‚Äôs clitoris, you will be able to satisfy her MUCH more than you can through penetration.\n\nBesides ‚Äì a smaller penis is always easier to swallow than a bigger one.

question_title: Should I dump my girlfriend? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now; we're both 22. She's a sweet girl and all, but recently, she put on a little bit of weight. She used to have a real nice figure. I wouldn't mind so much, but I get a lot of hassle from my male friends and from random people in public places (including other girls). Because of all this hassle, it's getting to the point where I'm a little embarassed to go out with her. I've been pondering for the last month about whether or not I should dump her. There's another girl who's showing tremendous interest in me, and she thinks me and her would be great together. My girlfriend once said that if I ever dumped her, she'd make my life a living hell.\n\nWhat should I do? [SEP] best_answer: i hate men like you, just because your g/f has put on some weight does not mean you have to dump her, who cares what anyone else thinks and says, you dont deserve a gf but its obvious your not intrested in how a women feels or who she is as a person, all your worried about it if she is good looking or not.\nyou are the type of guy that makes men look bad and are only intrested in looks rather then who a person is.

question_title: Move out, or kick out?? [SEP] question_content: Ive been dating my gf for a year, friends with her friends. One is her roommate whom Ive known for almost as long is suddenly fed up with me. Shes one of those people that complain about her problems and makes everything a big problem and no matter how much my gf and I help her, she needs more help the next day. For example, she expects us to greet her when she gets home, but she doesn't even close to the same to us. As this progresses, my gf and I had a secret dislike for her needs.\n\nConversely, she starts disliking us because we're a couple (she's not) and she thinks I'm whiny (the only person to say so in my life) and she feels distant from my gf probably because she isn't constantly taking care of her. As it is, I don't live with my gf, only spend nights there. The roommate is now trying to have me kicked out so she can spend more time with my gf without me, but my gf doesn't want to be with her anymore because of it. Should I get kicked out, gf move out, or kick roomate out?? [SEP] best_answer: Seeing how you and your girlfriend spend the nights together at her place all of the time maybe its time that the two of you get a place together! Leaving the friend roomate to fend for herself!	Family & Relationships

question_title: What would you do? [SEP] question_content: My wife has never cheated on me to my knowledge. I love her dearly. Currently, due to a job promotion, she's in a city 300 miles away. I will join her when our house is sold. \n\nSo she calls me and says after work, people (guys and girls) from her office are gong to a bar for drinks.  Should I be concerned? What would you do?\n\nI know how I feel, but I'd like perspectives from both guys and girls. [SEP] best_answer: From a professional standpoint there are some general concerns about partying after office hours.\nA)Drinking and driving\nB) Maintaining a professional, yet friendly demeanor - that means in the office or out of the office. One can hardly be taken seriously if they are "one way" at the office and a bozo "away" from the office. A restaurant might have been a better choice than just out for "drinks."  Loose lips sink ships. Some people simply cannot keep their mouths shut when they have a couple or more drinks and the dirt starts flying - that is where it can possibly jeopardize careers. Hopefully, she's a very sensible person and will maintain a certain level of decorum while out. \n\nIf your marriage is good, there is very little risk she'll be in the sheets with anyone else.  \n\nMaybe next weekend you could pay her a visit and all of you go out for dinner and meet the group.

question_title: is it  unrespectable if you lie once, bec of bad nightmare during your childhood? [SEP] question_content: i was lie to my boyfried once that i was a virgin, bec. i was molested when i was like 6 years old. it was a big secret of my personality and i kept it for 20 years. somehow he found out im not but he just keep it. i think a lot of times if im gonna open it with him. i decided i have to bec. i feel like he is the right person, whom i can trust. in short  i told him everything. he accept me and now that wer'e married, everytime if we are fighting he ended up by saying dirty words for me. is it my fault? i know i lied once do i deserve to be treated like trash??? [SEP] best_answer: You do not owe him ANY explanation, period...what happened to you is tragic, but it happend before you met him, period. Did he tell you everyone he slept with...and did you really care. Well, except for sympathizing with you, which he certainly should...being molested is not a nice picture, as you well know, he has nothing to stick his nose into here. He is, in my opinion, crossing over a line that cannot be turned back on..in fact, I would seriously consider divorce, and I rarely tell that to anyone here...In fact, I am the first to say work it out...but he is accusing you of something that is a horror story to you. He is an immature, childish boy, not a man. Dump his butt and take all you can get from him. See a lawyer now. It is not going to get better with time. You deserve much better than this.

She was contacted by her son (who lives in Australia) and they've been corresponding ever since.  She was 'forced' to give up her child, and no one knew about him except my MIL and her siblings.  It was a very scary thing for my MIL to 'confess' to her family there was another child before them.  But it's a great weight off her shoulders.  She is happy to know her son had a good life and is not angry with her for giving him up.	Family & Relationships
question_title: i like this one guy but he likes this slut. do i have a chance w/ him.. if so how do i get him 2 like me?? [SEP] question_content: I NEED HELP!!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP] best_answer: First of all, you can't make someone like you.  After saying that, I have found that the best way to get his attention is to be a good Friend.  Be very nice to him, call him, show lots of sympathy, and make him feel like he can be open with you.  Most guys have trouble being open with their feelings, and if you make him feel comfortable then that's your key in to his life.  \n\nDo NOT sleep with him--that never works.  And by the way I am a guy so I know!	Family & Relationships
question_title: How can I get my Ex- girl friend back ? [SEP] question_content: i was the one who broke-up with her...and somehow she is become vocie in my head.....i cant seem drown her out.....what should i do......im willing to dooooooo anything... [SEP] best_answer: You obviously really like this girl, and if you want her back you should tell her. The worst she can say is 'no' but if you never ask her you will never know. I really think you should try talking to her. Be completly honest, first of all ask if you can talk to her for a bit and then explain to her your reasons for why you broke up with her and how you have changed your mind and you would like to go out with her again, say things like she has a really good sense of humor and a great personality. Complement her but don't over do it because she will know you are being false. Hopefully she will listen to what you have to say and reconsider going out with you again. If not, don't worry, try and stay friends with her, tell her you want to be friends. Most importantly, tell her how you feel, if you don't, you will never know her response. Good Luck and have a good day xx	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is anyone tired of the game? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone think the game is a load of crap? I don't mind playing, but after awhile, it seems as if anyone who plays doesn't really care to take it anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about you shouldn't be answering this question. [SEP] best_answer: I believe I know what you're talking about and it's sad that you and other people have to refer to love/romance/sex as "the game".  I don't like playing games when it comes to my heart and I refuse to play them.  That's why I don't follow specific rules when trying to meet people.  I don't waste my time on certain pick up lines.  I try to look good, but I'm not going to change how I like to appear for a woman.  I'm not going to try to act better to impress someone either.  If you are really looking for a relationship with someone, then why do all those stupid things?  Your true self is eventually going to reveal itself in the end anyway and a lot of break-ups happen because people find out months or even years later that they really don't like who the other person "really is".  So yes, I am 28 years old and I've been fed up with the game since I was a little kid.  I started observing B.S. things about relationships and how to start one very early in life.

[SEP] best_answer: Oh my......stop sending him all those things!\n\nYou're coming on too strong I think. His lack of response tells me that he's not quite on the same loop you are, and if he was, he may be backing off because you are flooding him with to much to quickly.\n\nI know you have a lot of wonderful, warm, euphoric feelings for this person, but releasing all upon him like this is not the ay to express it. I know it's real hard NOT to do, but you must try.\n\nI truly don't know why we react that way, but when a woman comes at us full bore like a bull in a china shop we shut right down. Most of us do anyway......\n\nGive him some time to absorb everything. I hate to say it, but he may not feel the way you do. He may only think of you as a friend. You run a great risk of being hurt!  :(\n\nOn the other hand....he may, indeed, feel as you do, but may not know how to respond to being inundated with all your emotions. This is a learning time for him...and you too.\n\nHave you ever heard of people that should channel their anger?\n\nWell...this is no different really. Your emotion is love....and it can come flooding and be overwhelming like anger can. So...try and channel it in the right way. Be gentle.....and try and figure out when the right times are to show it. I know....easier said than done. But try.....talk to him. Spend time with him. Be around him. Don't overdo it.....plant the seeds, and hang around and nurture them so they can blossom into a nice, wonderful love for you, and he.      :)\n\nGood luck to you...I hope it all works out for you!

question_title: What is your worst date? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I dressed up nice in heels and a lil skirt. \n\nHe picks me up in a ute loaded with 7 other guys, all drinking beer. I'm thinking, oh we must be going to a party or something....\n\nWRONG!! Instead, he takes us out into the middle of the bush, that's right I said BUSH (forest, woods, jungle whatever they call it where you live)\nwhere they commenced a full out shot-gun assualt on kangaroos. Yep, shooting kangaroos with real-life shot-guns! All of the guys were DRUNK by the way. \n\nTHEN they skinned the half- alive animals in front of me.\n\nOn the way home, with my ears ringing from the gunshots BUT grateful to be alive still, one of his friend keeps rubbing my leg, and I'm like "Get your hands off me." \nMy date then replies "He won't hurt ya, he's just been isolated from women for so long, he wants to feel some soft skin". The fact that they had 4 or 5 guns stopped me from flipping my lid. \nOh yeah, for the record, me and the guy are no longer together!	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do guys change dramatically? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How do you mean? Sounds like you've had some experience of this. Not all guys change dramatically.

question_title: He's a moody person but did I do something or is it just my imagination? [SEP] question_content: This guy at in one of my classes at school.  He's flirted before and has always been hot and cold with me.  But I feel we finally just became semi-friends.  But I haven't seen him in a while and after not seeing him in a couple of days.  When he saw me I gave him a big smile.  He raised his eyebrows and gave me this really weird look, kind of a grouchy look though.  And then today I saw him going to my car and we caught eyes he already had a grouchy expression on his face.  He looked right at me at then looked away.  I said hello and then he said hi.  I have been getting really good grades lately, and he knows this.  I'm in college, but he also does well.  Could it be a jealousy thing though?  What have I done, or is he just moody and this is all my imagination?  I just feel like sometimes he doesn't want to see me.  All I've ever been is nice to him.  What could it be?

question_title: Best friends or? [SEP] question_content: I have been with my guy now for over four years and i know i love him that is not the issue here..I have never really dated before or have never been in love whatsoever. Now my question is this me and him are best friends i can and do talk to him about whatever is bothering me and he is always there to help me out never judging me or anything. I am bipolar/add and he is my rock if you know what i mean. He is wonderful to me and is the biggest help when im down or if im kinda confused or upset. I have alot of family issues im not going to go into here but he is the one that has helped me get some of them worked out to where im able to function alot better now with all of them. Anyhow, how do you know if what you have is TRUE love or just best friends? I mean i know from all the reading on here and all that when you are IN love with someone it is good to also be best friends with them right? How do you know the difference? If your only best friends or if your in love?  Since they close.. [SEP] best_answer: I think that your perception of love has changed over four years. May be you're craving passion, romance those kind of things that mpvies typically portray as love.\nAnd its perfectly alright to want that kind of excitement. \nNot to be preachy but I think you should value what you have...its very hard to come by this kind of rock-solid support. \nAccording to me there are two things you need to work on: \n1) Learn to appreciate the relationship you have. And try to spice it up. Don't look at your boy friend just as a pillar to lean on and a shoulder to cry on. Treat him like someone you love...shower affection, love and romance. Don't just afflict him with your problems. \n2) I think you should also start working on being more independent. Slowly but steadily, try to start solving your problems yourself. that doesnt mean you keep him out of parts of your life that are difficult... for instance if you[ve had a fight with your mom...you could meet him for coffee to cool off and forget about the fight rather than talk about the fight. Small things like that. \nThese two suggested changes will take atleast 6 months to a year. It will change the equation of your relationship from "damsel in distress and knight in shining armour" to a healthy, balanced one. And if your relationship survives the equation change, then you have found what all of us spend years looking for - true love.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do some men lie to other \npeople about having sex with a \nwoman, Knowing they never did? [SEP] question_content: At my place of employment I have had Three men say that they have had sex with. These are people who I see everyday, and never would I had believe that would make up something like that.  I have never and would not ever think of having sex with someone else while I am in my 13 year relationship.  But it shows me that you can not be friends or socialize yourself with certain people.

question_title: Why is it when you break up with a woman, she gets angry &  want to hurt you in any way she can? [SEP] question_content: I met a girl and visit her @ her home for a couple of months. We had sex only twice, but it wasn't good to me. So I told I jst wanted to be friends. I know I could have worked it out with her, but I like a freak from the start, not one that has to warm up to me first. I just don't like her sexualy. Now she is MAD. She is doing bogas things. I have been nice about it. She don't know about the sex. [SEP] best_answer: OK most guys on here would just tell you that all chicks are bitches. That's only true sometimes. Some girls have been hurt in the past so when they get hurt there just over it so they take all of emotions out on the last person that hurt them. See, if you just told her you wanted to be friends then she will get mad at you, but what you have to do is just talk to her. Explain to her why you told her that you just wanted to be friends. Plus woman go through a lot, just as much as men. Not more always not less always but there always going through stuff just like all guys are. So just apologize to her and tell her that you didn't mean to hurt her you just like different stuff than her. So eventually she will forgive and will be JUST FRIENDS. \n\n\nI'm only 13 years old,but I know what I'm talking about so you can take my advice or somebody else's but anyway you better do somthing soon.\n\n If you have anymore questions or comment then send me an e-mail\n\nI hope it works out with you and your FRIEND, but remember she's going through stuff just like you are so be considerate and listen to her.

question_title: So how do you use these feminie whiles? [SEP] question_content: I keep trying but i can't do it. [SEP] best_answer: What makes you think you cant do it?  It's about feeling attractive and sexy as a woman and subtly letting it show. If you like a man you are trying to seduce him by acting sexy (but not like a slapper!). Try lots of eye contact with seductive smiling,  laughing at his jokes, touch his arm to emphasive a point, offer him a genuine compliment(that one worked for me!) and speak softly. Looking up at him with doe eyes is usually a winner,Just keep showing interest in the man and he will eventually get the message. Most of all though remember to be yourself.	Family & Relationships

question_title: a question for you girls. what would you do to a woman if she was trying to steal your man? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: hmmmm....that's a hard one in a way because it would depend on whether or not you were VERY SURE that that is what she's trying to do....I guess if she was being blatant about it, I would have a talk with the boyfriend and see if he couldn't possibly talk to her and let her know that he's simply IS NOT available...he's with the one he loves but if this is something he won't go for..I say..tell her yourself....you don't have to be overly overbearing or mean about it ..just let her know that your not giving your man up and that there are names for women like her that try to steal someone else's man.....slut.....pure and simple....let her go for someone who isn't in a relationship at the moment...there are plenty of men out there like that....but of course it's not entirely her fault either especially if she's flaunting it and your man is simply going along with it....he needs to be sat down and you need to have a heart to heart with him...letting him know how badly this makes  you feel and how would he like it if you had some guy all over you and your were just going right along with it??   Honesty is the best thing in a situation like this...your boyfriend needs to be a part of the discussion and decision because all three of you are involved.\nGood Luck!	Family & Relationships

question_title: My friend is dating a 17 year old boy and she is only 14 so do ya think it is wrong? [SEP] question_content: So do you think it is wrong and she iz dearly in luv with him and she was telling me this and i was like there is nothing wrong wit that. But then after i was not so sure. So can ya help me even tho this iz not ma problem? [SEP] best_answer: There is nothing wrong with it, in my opinion. Even with the stagitory (sp?) rape situation (which im sure will come up somewhere)at least in some states, is that it has to be atleast a 5 yr. difference, regaurdless if someone is under 16. Some may say that is wrong with the age difference, but love has no boundaries, and love is love either way. As long as no one is being taken advantage of or used, then I see no problem with this. I mean, they could hypathetically going to the same school with each other, IOW, highschool, so what's the problem in that? My parents are remarried, one is 9 years older than their spouse, the other is 5. But when you are dealing with such a young age, the only thing I could think would be an issue is the maturity levels that may differ, but even then, that does not justify this being "wrong". so in my opinion, the answer is not wrong.

question_title: What makes Barca so different from other clubs......? [SEP] question_content: ....... Mes que un club or More than a club, has a really new meaning now when they have a contract with UNICEF........ what do you think about this two new promotional films with UNICEF..... are they doing this just to make more money with selling products, broadcasting ,... or they really want to help all those kids that REALLY need help!!!\n\nhttp://www.fcbarcelona.com/unicef/en/ [SEP] best_answer: those vids are great, tnx for the link. i like it that they're not OA or too self-promotional.\n\nanyway, to your Q. linking up with unicef certainly creates a lot of goodwill for barca, and that‚Äôs obviously good for business.  i think the tie-up is really a master stroke bec. aside from the prestige of unicef,  football which barca is bringing into the partnership is the world game, watched by everyone young and old, rich and poor, and kids all over love it, so it‚Äôs good economics to ride on that and that‚Äôs probably why this idea was conceived in the 1st place.  but then again children‚Äôs causes are really easy to fall into, we all have a soft spot for these things, so maybe the genuine desire to help is really THERE.  bottomline is, whatever barca‚Äôs motivations are, unicef will  stand to benefit a whole lot from these arrangements and that to me is the most impt. thing: financially, there‚Äôs that cash pledge of 1.5 mil euro which is a big help, and promotionally, too, in terms of the linkage itself, unicef gets a leg up --- barca is a hugely popular team and ronaldinho with his inspiring success story and wholesome image sets a good example for evry1, so all these can only help unicef  attract more institutional support for its initiatives in promoting children‚Äôs welfare. it‚Äôs a win-win situation for both parties in terms of exposure but I‚Äôd also like to think that  barca is a club that really wants to  make a difference....

I'm definitely pulling for him to break Sampras' record for most majors won in a career.	Sports

question_title: Was the Lakers trade of Shaq in favor of Kobe one of the biggest sports blunders ever? [SEP] question_content: I mean, look, Shaq virtually guarantees your team will enter the Conference Finals at least. Kobe by himself can't get to the playoffs, Kobe with Phil Jackson can't even make it out of the first round. How could Jerry Buss be so stupid?\n\nI hear all this talk about Shaq wearing down, but the Heat have made it to the Eastern Conference Finals twice. I bet if the Lakers kept him, they would've been serious NBA Finals contenders.\n\nI still don't understand the logic. Shaq has about 2-3 more years left of serious contention. The Lakers gambled for the future and blew that AND the present.\n\nTrade Kobe...I'm telling you Dr. Buss...oh wait, you gave him that contract.\n\nOoops! [SEP] best_answer: I'm a  Laker fan and I can say that trade sucks. No offense, the Lakers need Shaq to win championships. Before, I was a solid Laker fan. Now, I'm like a Spurs fan or a Cavs fan or any team which has great players. I don't hate the Lakers, I'm still a fan, but trading Shaq was not the best idea they ever had. It's going to be a long time since will see again the Lakers as world champs.	Sports

question_title: Do any one pee in pools summer is coming and i think that is gross how many pee in pools? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no way to know.  When people are asked questions about behavior that is widely disapproved of, a large percentage of people lie.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to chemically analyze pool water and get a definitive answer.  That won't work, though, because urine and sweat have almost exactly the same chemical composition.  \n\nYou may take comfort in the fact that urine is sterile when it is passed.  White blood cells roam the surface of your bladder consuming any microbes they encounter.  Although urine is a good medium for bacterial growth, the chlorine in pool water keeps the bacteria from flourishing.  You should be more concerned about not washing your hands before you eat.	Sports

[SEP] question_content: my other backs are leon washington,,jackson,,and lundy ,,my recievers are driver,,coles ,,and chambers,,should i do it? [SEP] best_answer: No way. That trade is pratically T.J. for Gore since Addai is not even worth a roster spot and furry is a nice 4 or 5th receiver. Gore is still one of the top rb's in the game this season. He is your #2 back. Leon washington just a had a huge disappointing week against a weak D. And Lundy still needs to prove he can do that week in and week out. \n\nI still can't believe there are doubters about frank gore. Didn't he prove last week that he is for real. he just ran against the bears for 111 yards. not to mention 90 total yards against the san diego. In both occasions he averaged more than 5 yards per carry. unbeleivable 9.3 yards per carry last week against the great d of the bears. \n\nDon't trade Gore for T.J. He is worth a lot more than him. At this point of the season , I put more value for him than Tiki since tiki is getting all his goaline touches away. With troubles with robinson at goaline , no doubt , frank gore will once again get the carries at the goaline.	Sports

question_title: Do women have a place in men's football? [SEP] question_content: In light of Mike Newell's comments on Saturday about a woman assistant referee, should women be involved in the top leagues in England? [SEP] best_answer: If they really want to do it and put up with the abuse then why not. I think I understand where Newell is coming from but his mistake was making his feelings public.He only invited all the politically correct and womens groups to heap abuse on him so there was nothing to be gained. Maybe it will get the players to watch the language assuming they have any respect for women.	Sports
question_title: Is it realistic? [SEP] question_content: What prompted this is a response I read from someone else regarding a question concerning belt ranking. In his answer, after listing the belts, he goes on to mention the period of time required between them as deemed necessary by his school in order to be tested for advancement to the next which is 4 months. And if you don't earn it, you don't get it and must wait another 4 months. This, I think, is as it should be.  That being said, I'm not sure what to think sometimes when I encounter indviduals who boast of having attained the rank of 2nd degree black and then proceed to tell me that they accomplished this in 2 years or whatever. It just seems wrong. [SEP] best_answer: I have come to a new understanding of black belt vs. someone who can seriously beat some ass or knows the art.\n\nAnyone can get a black belt... just go buy one for 4$  It would be like you getting ready to hire someone for a NASA engineer position... Would you want to hire someone who went through 4 years at a university and then extra for a masters of Physics?  Or would you want to hire someone with a 2 year degree and an on line masters...   Of course there will be other factors that come into play.... But i think that time has a HUGE part to play with rank.  Its like someone boasting that they have a 4 year on line degree from Devry or some other lame on line school.  And then someone who tells you they have a 4 year degree from a University like Washington or Oregon.  I am gonna take the U of W over devry any day!	Sports

question_title: If your team mate somehow catches your punt without it bouncing off the ground, would it be a converstion? [SEP] question_content: or a change of possesion [SEP] best_answer: Once a ball is punted with a snap from the line of scrimmage, the possesion is changed unless touched by the receiving team.  This holds whether the punting team downs the ball after rolling or catches it on the fly.  The only way that the punting team can re-gain possession is (1) if the returner "muffs" the punt (when the ball hits off of him without him catching it) or (2) the ball in-advertently hits another member of the returning team and then gets recovered by the punting team.  \n\nOf course if the returning team tries to block the punt and misses and in the process knocks over the punter, it results in a 15 yard personal foul which brings an automatic first down with it.\n\nIf it is the kickoff (either at the start of a half or after a score) that whoever ends up with the ball at the end of the play has possession of the ball.\n\nExample: On a kickoff, the ball could be kicked deep to the returning team, they catch the ball and get tackled resulting in their first down at that spot.  BUT, If the kick is popped up short and the kicking team catches the ball, it is THEIR ball, 1st down at the spot that they catch it.  The kicking team cannot advance the ball once they gain possession.	Sports

J.J Reddick eew but wutever. \n\n          I do not think they pick rajon rondo. Sixers are my favorite team so i think they do need a power forward who can rebound the ball and play defense cause that is what they were lacking last season. \n\n              I think they go with Cedric Simmons.  He is great at blocking, Plays great defense and is a great rebounder and is decent at getting to the hole. \n\n               Also there is a 50% chance that they will trade Iverson which I will hate because Iverson has been my favorite player since i was six his rookie year. And they would do terrible without him but anyway if they do that they could get Quincy Douby from Ruckers. Who is an amazing amazing shot. Can dribble and is fast and can pass. \n\n          I still would pick Simmons because theyre starting lineup could look like this.   PG Iverson SG  Willie Green SF   Andre Iguodala PF Cedric Simmons  C  Dalembert\nand have Webber as six man even though he would hate it.	Sports

You will get a great deal of coaching, conditioning and training that will make you a more efficient swimmer, which is really what it is all about.  Swimming faster does you no good if you leave too much energy in the water and do not have the power and speed left for the bike and run.\n\nMaking sure that you are not fighting the water but using it to your advantage is key.  Learn to draft off others, make sure that you are swimming "within your tube" and within your target heart rate.  This will leave you fresh for the remainder of the race.\n\nTwo great sources are www.totalimmersion.com, an excellent resource for learning to swim efficiently, and The Swimming HUB, swimmingscience.blogspot.com.  Both of these sites will give you the head start that you need to start winning those races.	Sports

But in his later years, he wore a strange looking headgear. \n\nYears later, Gavaskar's improvised headgear made its way into a London museum. The expert there picked it up and demanded to know which nut had made bold to sport it. Told that it was a batsman who had scored over 10,000 runs in Test cricket, pat came the chilling diagnosis: "The guy is lucky he was never struck by a red-hard cricket ball on this monstrous headgear. The fellow would have dropped dead on the spot." \n\nhttp://www.sta.uwi.edu/media/releases/2006/images/gavaskar.jpg	Sports

question_title: How do you choose your favorite MLB team? [SEP] question_content: I am from Columbus, Ohio and I am having trouble choosing a favorite team. There are the Reds and Indians but I have never really been a fan. Any advice? [SEP] best_answer: Rules for picking your favorite team:\n\n1) You can only have one favorite team.\n2) once selected you can only change your favorite team under extraordinary circumstances. \n\nNow how do you pick your team?\n\nThe easist and most rational method is to support your hometown team.  You live in Columbus, so you don't really have one, but the Reds and Indians, both being from Ohio warrent consideration.  \n\nAlso, in Columbs you have the Clippers which is the AAA afiliate for the Washington Nationals.  This would be a great option because you can start rooting for these players at a reasonable price while they are promising stars on the come.  And then transfer that right into watching MLB games.\n\nA final way is to look around the league and find a franchise that you think is run well and pick them.  Of course if you do this you must remember rule number 2, there is nothing worse than a bandwagon jumper, to truly be a fan you have to stick with them through the bad times, it makes to good times that much better.  Also remember if you go this route don't choose the Yankees, 'cuz that's like rooting for the house in blackjack.	Sports

question_title: Anyone else think that the Steeler's first touchdown last night was total crap? [SEP] question_content: I'm not a fan of either team- not a sports fan period, but I don't think that should have counted. I'm willing to be proved wrong though. What do y'all think? [SEP] best_answer: All that is required to score a touchdown is for the football to break the imaginary plane at the front edge fo the white line that is the goal line.  Although the quarterback's arm obscured the balled somewhat, the replay made it look like the ball DID "break the plane".  The referees on the field were much closer and had a better view, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOn the other hand, I thought the "pushing off" penalty that negated a Seattle touchdown in the first quarter was bogus.  I don't know if that would have shifted momentum to Seattle or not.	Sports

question_title: How to write an argumentative essay? [SEP] question_content: i need to have emotion,effect, and logically. [SEP] best_answer: First of all you need to pick a good topic, one that can be won.   Make sure it is a topic on which it is easy to take a clear stand.   Good ones are usually those on which people have very definite opinions.  Gun control, abortion, capital punishment, right to die, etc. are good topics for argumentative essays - they have emotion built in.\n\nIn your essay you have to do more than state your opinion - you have to support your argument with facts and evidence and research and statistics.  You need to be able to give examples to back up your stand.  An argumentative essay is rather like a debate - you want to persuade others to agree with you.\n\nThese sites should help you.

[SEP] question_content: a) Show that the line x + y = q will intersect the curve x¬≤ - 2x + 2y¬≤ = 3 in two distinct points if q¬≤ is more than 2q + 5.\n\nb) if the line y + 2x = p does not intersect the curve y¬≤ = x + p, find the range of values of p. \n(answer to this question is p is less than -1/24 but i can't figure the solution!) [SEP] best_answer: a) Let x+y = q -----eqn1\n       x¬≤ - 2x + 2y¬≤ = 3 -----eqn2\n\nsub x= q-y into eqn2:\n(q-y)^2 -2(q-y) + 2y^2 =3\n\nq^2 -2qy +y^2 -2q +2y +2y^2 =3\n\ncomparing the coefficients of the eqn with that of a standard quadratic eqn, ax^2 +bx +c, we have\na= 3\nb= -2q+2\nc= q^2 -2q -3\n\nAnd to check for the nature of the roots of this eqn, we need to find the determinant, b^2 -4ac.\n\n(-2q +2)^2 -4(3)(q^2 -2q -3)\n\nsolving this and you will eventually get \nq^2 -2q -5\n\nHowever, given that q^2 > 2q +5, we know that q^2 -2q -5 > 0.\n\nSince the determinant is greater than 0, it shows that there are 2 real and distinct roots of the eqn given.\n\nb) the approach is the same, but you must know that since the two curves dont intersect, we would need to find or show b^2 -4ac < 0, ie the determinant is negative.

question_title: What are BAR codes,ISBN codes,MASS code? How are they read? Are there any other code used by other agencies? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bar codes, UPC codes,  ISBNs and other such codes are like social security numbers, to distinguish different products.  No two people have the same SS number, so no two products have the same bar code. \n\nThe bars in the barcode correspond to a number- a laser run across it can read the bars and translate them into numbers. The only reason people use barcodes is because they can be read just by waving the laser in front- it's easier. Usually, you can get the same information if you know  the numbers the barcode represents, and type in the numbers.\n\nThe numbers encoded are the price the store is charging, and also lets stores keep track of how many of each product they sell. \n\nLibraries often use bar codes to keep track of which patrons have borrowed which book.\n\nThe ISBN is, in fact, not a barcode, but it is a specific number that represents that particular book all over the world. Only books that are exactly alike, (even if they are the same title. like a paperback and hardback version of the same book) have the same ISBN.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is there anyway to back out of a grant given to you by a college? [SEP] question_content: My college offered me a 1000$ grant.  I accepted but no longer wish to go to that college.  My friends said I can't back out of grants...I'm sure you can..what if there is an emergency?  Anyone know what I can do? [SEP] best_answer: Of course you can! These things are almost always non-binding. In fact, most schools will cancel your financial aid automatically when they find out you're not attending.  \n\nIf the grant is a federal grant, the process will be taken care of for you, since one of the fundamental rules of financial aid administration is that you can't disburse funding for a student who isn't attending your school.  As I said, if you told your school that you aren't coming, chances are that they already cancelled your grant.\n\nIf the grant is from the school itself, chances are that the regulations are similar.  No school wants to throw their money away on a student who doesn't go to their school, so they will check and double-check to make sure that you are a student there before they disburse your grant funds.  If you are uncertain, just give them a call to confirm this.	Education & Reference

question_title: are there any colleges that offer a surgery program in Georgia? preferbly near Augusta? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: To become a surgeon, and thus practice surgery, one must first get a four year college degree. Then, you go on to medical school, which is another four year program, followed by several years of residency before you can begin practicing as a surgeon.\n\nThus, if you're interested in becomming a surgeon, and don't yet have a college degree, that is your first step. You will want to find a college that has strong science programs, especially in chemistry and biology, although it is not necessary to major in science in order to apply to medical school.\n\nThere are many great colleges in Georgia. A good place to start your college search is: http://gacollege411.org/  There, you'll find a list of colleges in Georgia, plus information about financial aid, preparing to apply to college, and standardized tests.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about becomming a doctor and surgeon, these three sites are jam packed with information about the process of preparing for and applying to medical school:\n\nhttp://prehealth.uchicago.edu/handbook/toc.html\n\nhttp://www.amherst.edu/~sageorge/health.html\n\nhttp://hpap.syr.edu/intsites.htm\n\nIf you're already enrolled in college, I'd suggest you talk with the pre-med advisor at your college who can give you some specific suggestions regarding which medical school in Georgia might be suitable for you.\n\nGood luck!

question_title: i nid tips for saving water(URGENT)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I can tell you what we did during the water shortage in Santa Barbara a few years back.  One thing was to fill a two liter bottle of water and place it in each toilet.  that way, the 2 liters stayed in the tank, and only the remainder was washed down, same result, less water.\n\nAnother tip was to put wash basins in each sink, and capture the water to be reused until dirty, and then pour it down the toilet for the next use, instead of flush.  (This is not meant to be bathroom humour).  We switched to using disposable plates and tableware, no dishwashing, except cook pots.\n\nOf course, only do laundry when you have a full washer load.  Or better yet, take the laundry to the laundramat.  Join a health club, or YMCA, and take as many of your showers as you can at the club, instead of home.  One favorite suggestion of young people, is shower with someone, for more efficient use of water.\n\nReplace your lawn with a water efficient landscape.	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: You and a friend are looking at the stars. your friend says, "stars must always be shrinking because gravity is constantly pulling their particles together." explain what is wrong with your friends reasoning. [SEP] best_answer: Gravity is only half of the picture.\n\nThe stars gravity does tend to pull the stars material towards the center of the star.\n\nHowever, there is also an expansive force - the force of the nuclear fusion reaction that is taking place inside the start.  This reaction creates light, heat, x-rays, cosmic rays and so on.. but it also pushes against the infalling star material, trying to push it back out.\n\nThe balance between gravity and fusion energy is why the star stays (about) the same size.\n\nSometimes gravity wins, and the star compresses all the way town to a neutron star or even a black hole.\n\nSometimes the nuclear reaction wins and the star explodes in a nova or supernova.\n\nMost stars are stable for a VERY long time (billions of years).

This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid, so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food. As apples were a very common crop, teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students. As wages increased, the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit."\n\nSo I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning.	Education & Reference

Then this resin is sent to a manufacturer that will take this material and mold it. The material typically comes in pellet form or powder. The molding process will take the material and melt it in an extruder where it conveys through a screw and barrel. It can either be extruded or injection molded.

question_title: The nuclear fussion process is clean. So, what is meant by the term "dirty bomb"? [SEP] question_content: To wage war is not a clean thought. To clean up after ANY bomb is a devistating task.But for fussion, or fission to occur, requires the physics and math that cannot be less than exact. In the situation in th Middle East, the term "dirty bomb" is used. What would that define in differences between our enemy's bomb and the ones we dropped on Japan more than 60 years ago? [SEP] best_answer: A "dirty bomb" is one that spreads radiation through a conventional (chemical) explosion, not a nuclear one.  In a dirty bomb, a conventional explosive and fusing mechanism are surrounded by highly radioactive material of some sort.\nIt is difficult, and requires a very high degree of mechanical/electrical skill, to construct a nuclear explosive device.  A nuclear (fission) bomb uses conventional explosives fired all at the exact same time to bring together units of fissile material (usually uranium-235 or some isotope of plutonium; there are others), resulting in a "critical mass," or more correctly "prompt criticality" which results in the almost instantaneous release of large amounts of energy.  Fusion bombs (commonly known as H-bombs) use a fission reaction to create the high temperature necessary to start a fusion chain reaction.\nSo, basically, the difference between a "dirty bomb" and a true nuclear bomb is the reaction that creates the explosion.

question_title: What's the meaning of "If I tell lies-------? [SEP] question_content: What's the meaning of "if I tell lies my nose will become longer" and what's ppl stand for?\n\nthank you [SEP] best_answer: ppl stands for people.\n\nYou see, the phrase is meant to tell people not to lie.  It started off with a story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy.  A fairy came along and cast a spell on him; if he wanted to be a real boy, he would have to do something courageous, however, if he lied, his nose would grow longer and it would be very obvious that he lied.\n\nTherefore, in the same way, the phrase is to tell people that if they lie, it would soon be exposed and there's no good in lying, because it would only make yourself look stupid and embarrassed(imagine yourself with a long nose) in front of other people.  \n\n\nBesides, you can't take back your words.

[SEP] question_content: I know there are a few songs, but does anyone have a long sentence that serves as an acronym or anything of that sort?? Anything will help. Thank you!! [SEP] best_answer: Try walking around your house, or some other place you know well, while you memorize them- walk in a path that you will be able to remember, and try to associate each president, in order, with some place that you know in your house.  Later, when you want to remember them in order, imagine yourself following the same path, and you'll remember the president associated with each location much more easily.\n\nThis is a common technique used by people who memorize things like a deck of cards. It is thought to work because the human brain is very good at memorizing where things are geographically located.	Education & Reference

question_title: when did women suffrage start and end in the usa? [SEP] question_content: what year did women suffrage start and what year did women suffrage end [SEP] best_answer: The struggle for women's suffrage in America began in the 1820s with the writings of Fanny Wright. In her book, Course of Popular Lectures (1829) and in the Free Enquirer Wright not only advocated women being given the vote but the abolition of slavery, free secular education, birth control and more liberal divorce laws. \n\nIn 1893 women got the vote in Colorado, followed by Utah (1896), Idaho (1896), Washington (1910), California (1911), Arizona (1912), Kansas (1912), Oregon (1912), Illinois (1913), Nevada (1914) and Montana (1914). \n\nIn January, 1918, Woodrow Wilson announced that women's suffrage was urgently needed as a "war measure". The House of Representatives passed the federal woman suffrage amendment 274 to 136 but it was opposed in the Senate and was defeated in September 1918. Another attempt in February 1919 also ended in failure. \n\nIn May 1919 the House of Representatives again passed the amendment (304 to 89) and on 4th June 1919 the Senate finally gave in and passed it by 66 to 30. On 26th August 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment was certified by the Secretary of State, when Tennessee, the thirty-sixth and final state needed, signed for ratification.	Education & Reference

What do you think about being a married schoolgirl? [SEP] best_answer: Quite frankly they should wait to get married. This isn't because they aren't able to or aren't mature enough. It is because the pressures that come with a "marriage", even though it is just a piece of paper, could actually split them up. Encourage them to stay together. There is no reason that they can't.

question_title: What is Screening Process in Printing Technology all about;Pls Professionals respond.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Take a magnifying glass and look at a printed picture. You will see a lot of dots. That is how shades of gray are made on a printing press. To see this look at a black and white photo in a newspaper.\nAnd colors are made using only 4 colors of ink: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK). Look closely at a magazine cover for that example. Or more easily seen on color comics in the Sunday paper (heavier screening).\nTo print an image, the picture has to be transfered to a inked metal plate that transfers the image to the paper. There is no way to smear the ink in varying thicknesses. It can only make differences in darkness by using the screening technique, which means making the image into a series of dots (A screen). The distance between the dots determines the apparent darkness of the image. (Close together=darker. Far apart=lighter.) This used to be accomplished in the dark room with a camera and a sheet of film with the appropriate sized dots on it. Now it is done by outputting the image to film from computer which performs this function automatically. \nThe "screen size" is dots per inch (dpi) or lines per inch (lpi). Newpapers have faster, lower quality requirements for their product and typically use screens of around 80-100 dpi, while commercial, high end printshops doing 4 color work may use 1200 dpi, or higher screening.

question_title: please someone who knows logarithms please help.? [SEP] question_content: how in the hell do u do a problem like 3^x+4=5^x-1\n\nand\n\n36^x=6^x^2-3\n\npleas  its logarithms and im gonna fail algebra [SEP] best_answer: Well, your first question is 3^(x+4)=5^(x-1).\nWhen you encounter such a problem, the first thing you should do is to apply logarithms (of base 10) to both sides of the equation! So, lg( 3^(x+4) ) = lg( 5^(x-1) ). Now, you can apply some rules involving logarithms and you'll get (lg3)(x+4)=(lg5)(x-1). Note that lg5 and lg3 are constants, and you can remove the brackets through multiplication, collect all the terms with x on one side of the equation and solve! The answer may not be "nice", but nobody said all answers are!\n\nNow, your second question is 36^(x)= 6^(x^2-3).\nEven though I did suggest using logarithms immediately for the previous question, you should take a closer look at this question to see if you can apply any "nice" results. Observe that 36=6^2, so 36^(x)= 6^(2x). So, the question becomes 6^(2x)= 6^(x^2-3). Since we have a common base of 6, we only need to analyze the powers and we have the quadratic equation (x^2)-3=2x. Can you continue from here?\n\nNOTE: For the first question, it is difficult to adopt the method of "finding a common base and equating powers" (like we did for the second question), so we have to use logarithms instead. With more experience, you should be able to know when each method can be used.	Education & Reference

I know one website is called www.fastweb.com.  It's free and it allows you to select specific groups or areas of interest which you belong to and it customizes your search based on that.  That's only one, but I know that there are tons of scholorships available that not a lot of people know about.  And, judging by your icon, as a black woman there is are probably quite a few foundations willing to support your pursuit of higher education in exchange for, like, an essay and a thank you card.

question_title: Im doing a report on PC vs Mac. I need help on why PC is better? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I chose the PC over the MAC many years ago.  At that time software was my main issue.  I was essentially an experimenter, and was interested in having access to a large number of varied programs.  If you had a PC you could choose from dozens of word processors, spreadsheet, etc.  If you looked to shareware the selection grew exponentially.  On the other hand a MAC had one of each application available.  At the time I would enter a store to buy software and find rack after rack of PC programs and half a shelf dedicated to the MAC.  It was like buying an early Ford  automobile, you could have any color as long as it was black.\n\nNow I stay with the PC because of inertia.  I have experience with the PC so I am in my comfort zone.  I don't see any reason to change at this time.	Education & Reference

question_title: what is the importance of samuel taylor coleridge in literature and what is the special awards he recived.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Coleridge is probably best known for his long narrative poems, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence: its words have given the English language the metaphor of an albatross around one's neck, the (mis)quote of "water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink", and the phrase "a sadder but wiser man". Christabel is known for its musical rhythm and language and its Gothic tale.\n\nKubla Khan, or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment, although shorter, is also widely known and loved. It has strange, dreamy imagery and can be read on many levels. The name of Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu comes from the first line of Kubla Khan. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have additional "romantic" aura because they were never finished. Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their "exquisite metrical movement" and "imaginative phrasing."\n\nColeridge's shorter, meditative "conversation poems," however, proved to be the most influential of his work. These include both quiet poems like This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison and Frost at Midnight and also strongly emotional poems like Dejection and The Pains of Sleep. Wordsworth immediately adopted the model of these poems, and used it to compose several of his major poems. Via Wordsworth, the conversation poem became a standard vehicle for English poetic expression, and perhaps the most common approach among modern poets.\n\nsorry,but even i dont have any idea about the awards he receieved...
