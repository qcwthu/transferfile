question_title: Whats the name of the horror film about big foot terrorising a familly in texas,? [SEP] question_content: It was shown on t.v. in the late 70s or early 80s. and used to scare me witless. I think it was about a big foot, at least it was a monster simmilar to a bigfoot.

It killed the familly dog and chickens. and try'd to get in to the home. I remember the end of the film, where a man -could of been a police man- standing by his car on a road and looking in to the forest/swamp he was wearing a stetson and sunglasses, there was a voice over talking about the horror that tookplace in the forrest.\ncan you help me with this? as for some reason it has been in my mind for the past few months.

question_title: Did anyone watch Nip/Tuck last night? [SEP] question_content: Who was the psychiatrist that Connor was talking to? At first I thought it was Matt because it sounded like him, but then I realized it wasn't. [SEP] best_answer: A figment of Shawn's imagination. Shawn was dreaming about what could go wrong with his relationships with his family. You can tell it is him in the way he turns out rich and successful. His ego came shining through the dream. These wher his worst dreams. Afterall, he pushed for the first hand surgery on Connor. He is afraid that Connor will blame himself for his marriage breaking up the way he blames himself for his father leaving him  and his mother when he was a child. The analyst may be Shawn or may be an analyst Shawn has seen to deal with his problems in the past. My guess is it will cause him to go see Christian's analyst Brooke.	Entertainment & Music

The movie is directed by Bryan Springer who did the first two X-Men movies.  He did not direct the latest and third X-Men film because he was busy with Superman.  Two of his screenwriters from the first two X-Men films wrote the script for the new Superman.  I think that is why X-Men 3 is not as good the first 2 films, because the behind-the-scenes talent left to work on Superman.  So that means that Superman Returns should be one really, really good movie.  I also just learned that there MIGHT be a teaser trailer for next summer's Spider-Man 3 movie played before Superman Returns; if this is true, then going to see Superman will be a great experience for a lot of people.

question_title: Why is Society obsessed with reality TV? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Society ISN'T, but TV executives are. Why?\n\n1. Extremely cheap to make\n2.

question_title: Why is it? [SEP] question_content: That when you rent a movie at the begining it always says...\nThis has been formated to fit you tv screen??? [SEP] best_answer: It doesn't always say that. Have you noticed that movie screens at the theatre are very long and rectangular? And that your television screen is more-or-less square? In order to get that rectangular picture to fit into your square screen, they cut off big chunks on the sides. Videos that have not been reformatted are usually labeled "Widescreen". I think they used to call them letter box editions.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: do u change ur gender when in public chat rooms?...do u lie abt ur age and everything else??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Lying about your gender seems downright creepy.  I don't like to give out my age or other personal information to people I don't know and I don't visit chatrooms anymore as there weren't any interesting conversationalists anyway, just over the hill horny guys sending you skanky naked pics of themselves.   \n\nI think a lot of people do make up information about themselves when they go into chatrooms and they don't consider it lying because they don't ever intend on seeing the person face to face, or they consider it "trying on a new personality".    They don't realize that some people they are communicating with take them as being for real and may hurt a real person's feelings.  \n\nMy personal advice is if you visit a chatroom, look at it as a form of entertainment to pass your time, but don't really think you are going to meet a good friend or soulmate through that venue.  It is hard enough getting to really know someone face-to-face, let alone through an electronic medium.	Entertainment & Music
question_title: What have the TV networks GAINED by putting their logos onscreen during shows? [SEP] question_content: It's been 13 years since Fox started ruining their shows by putting their logo onscreen- first for a couple minutes then eventually all the time.  The other networks followed, with ABC being the last 8 years ago.  As a result, I very rarely watch TV anymore.  I've heard all the reasons for doing this but I don't accept any of them- if there's a logo on the screen for more than 5 seconds, the channel goes off my TV, simple as that.\nThe networks have lost my viewership over this and tarnished their history, yet it still goes on.  What have they GAINED by ruining their picture this way?  I don't want any more theories, only specific FACTS.  Have they made ratings go up, or caused more people to want to watch?\nBonus question- how do the people who work on the shows feel about this?  I know The Simpsons people don't like it.  I would refuse to work for any show unless it was presented logo-free on TV. [SEP] best_answer: Quick, name the first three networks that pop into your head!\n\nIts called "Mind share". Think of your memory as real estate. Each network is trying to take over as much real estate as possible. The more often you see a brand, the more likely you will recall it.\n\nMind share has nothing to do with cost, quality or performance. For example when people were asked to name five automotive companies Ford & Toyota were among the top five and Porsche was only mentioned by about 6% of those polled.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Which is the better team, Justice League of America or the Avengers? [SEP] question_content: Right, now the teams would be the original line-ups:\nJLA - Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, Green Lantern, Black Canary and the Flash\nAvengers - Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Ant-man and Wasp.\nWhich is the better team? [SEP] best_answer: Avengers by a LONG shot.\n\nany one of the big three could take out superman. No correct that, any ONE of the avengers could take out superman. Ant man and wasp, as corny as they are could just fly into his ear and rip him apart from the inside- he is defenseless.\n\nThat leaves green lantern and martian manhunter.\n\nWhile Iron Man's original suit pales in comparison to his power now (he could likely handle the original justice league by himself pretty easily post Extremis storyline), it is made of yellow. Green lantern is ineffective against him.\n\nThat would leave either thor or the hulk to take out martian manhunter, best bet would be to use thor because of his godlike status and hulk could likely be mind controlled to becoming bruce banner, thus taking him out of the fight.\n\nThe flash vs the hulk? The flash is an annoying personality to begin with, what happens when that adds to the fact that the hulk is a no contest match in favor of the hulk to begin with, flash's best bet would be to run away as far and fast as possible and hope hulk doesn't land on him when he jumps after him. \n\nThe last is aqua man and black canary. This is not the aquaman of today, but the aquaman of way back when when basically all he did was talk to fish and black canary,  both of these are a non-issue. leaving wasp or ant man would take out one, and the other marvel heroes would have handily dispatched thier dc counterpart (except possibly thor, because mm can run and hide longer) to handle a human black canary or weakling aquaman.

question_title: Does anyone know the value of a collection of National Geographic Magazines?? [SEP] question_content: I have every issue from January 1964 through November 1970 except for the September 1969 issue, I'm still trying to find it.  The October and November issues are still in their paper mailing wrap, never been opened.  All issues are in great shape and even include various add-in's such as special maps and even a 45 record about going to the moon in a 1968 issue.  There are no bent pages or torn pages, as a matter of fact they look as if they have never been looked at.  I just wonder what kind of value they might have if I decide to sell them. [SEP] best_answer: If they are in such good shape, the value might be considerable.  I would take a few of the most interesting/oldest to a dealer in old magazines, or an antiques and curios store if you don't know a dealer in "ephemera," as they are called.  It might even be worth it to list them on eBay.  I think they are probably well past the flea market level of value, at the very least.\n\nGood luck!	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] question_content: are zebras black with white stripes or white with black stripes? i never really knew the answer and someone i knew asked me and i didn't know. can you guys help me so i could tell her. lol. [SEP] best_answer: According to a biology site:\n\n"It is generally believed that zebras are dark animals with white stripes where the pigmentation is inhibited. The pigment of the hair is found solely in the hair and not in the skin. The reasons for thinking that they were originally pigmented animals are that (1) white horses would not survive well in the African plains or forests; (2) there used to be a fourth species of zebra, the quagga (which was overeaten to extinction in the eighteen hundreds). The quagga had the zebra striping pattern in the front of the animal, but had a dark rump; (3) when the region between the pigmented bands becomes too wide, secondary stripes emerge, as if suppression was weakening."\n\nhttp://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=1&id=5	Entertainment & Music

I don't know if they think that's attractive or something, but if I were a guy, I wouldn't want some stuck-up, snotty, b*tch. I'd want a sweet, nice girl. Not a girl who has her nose in the air. I'm the same way for guys too! I don't care how sexy u r. You'd just better not be a rude, jackass! LOL!\n\nWhat do you think?? Why do u think men like snotty girls? [SEP] best_answer: If by bitchy, you mean a girl who knows her own worth and will not allow anyone to run over her and will tell you when she thinks you have disrespected her, men like this kind of woman because she challenges him to be his best.  He knows that if he wants this better kind of woman, he must be thoughtful of her feelings, work hard for a living because she will not just accept any excuse for a man, have plans for his future (which will not necessarily include her if their plans do not match) and be a man not an excuse for 1.  If you mean a girl who is rude and crude for the heck of it, it is because he is stupid.    By the By, if you feel that you must always agree with your bf or risk losing him, I feel sorry for you	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Does any one know if eminem is ever going to come out with a new album? and when? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes.  Eminem has currently finished work on his new compilation CD, "The Re-Up," a collection of songs by new Shady artists, including a few new tracks of his own.  It will be released this December.\n\nTechnically, however, that's not an "Eminem album," per se.  Rather, it is a hodgepodge of various artists signed to the Shady record label contributing to one CD, in what is best described as a "collaboration album" designed to promote the new artists, and get Eminem back under the spotlight.  I have heard, though, that Eminem IS rumored to be working on a follow-up album to his 1996 independent release, "Infinite," entitled, "Infinite 2."  But to my knowledge, that's still unconfirmed. If in fact he does release it, it should be sometime in late-2007, and it will undoubtedly be his farewell album.	Entertainment & Music

It is really sore but not like pain where i need to cry. My hand is tinglin and is sore too what happend? The doc x rayed and said it is back in place and he said i have rotary cup damage what does that mean? He said i may need surgery why is that? I am supposed to check the circulation in my hand every one in awhile by checking my finger nails why do i have to do that? Do i have to wear the colar and cuff that he gave me? \nIt just mainly hurt whn u move it forward to the side is ok [SEP] best_answer: OK...you have a fresh injury an you're going to feel the consequences of that with sore muscles and pulled ligaments.  the Rotator cuff is what keeps your arm in it's socket and helps it move around, similar to your knee joint.  If you have an injury, on the inside of the joint, you may need surgery.  Checking the circulation by pressing the fingernails indicates if the blood in your injured arm is circulating.  If your fingernails are a blue or black color, then the oxygen in the blood is not circulating properly and you should report this condition asap to your doctor.  Wear the collar and cuff for a few days and mend before you start to worry about the surgery and getting back to normal activities.  Your body uses rest to heal.  So...rest.  Then call your doctor with any other questions.  \n\nGlad you weren't seriously injured.	Health
question_title: Should i get a medicine ball or a toning tube for working out? [SEP] question_content: I bike quite often, but i'd like to help exercise various parts of my body. I'm thinking of getting a medicine ball (or a fitness ball/stability ball). I'm also thinking of getting a toning tube set. What do you think would be best? [SEP] best_answer: I would get the toning tubes first.  The resistance bands are good for working out all parts of your body and you can do many exercises with them.  Next, I'd get the stability ball.  You can use that in combination with the toning tubes and do even more exercises.  A medicine ball is different than a stability ball.  The stability ball is the big inflatable ball that you sit or balance on.  A medicine ball is a smaller weighted ball.  It is good for doing weighted crunches and other weighted ab/core exercises.  I'd get that last just because it has the least uses of the 3.	Health

I am younger than most who need dentures and have been putting this off till I just cant anymore. Doctor says I will get infections in my blood and possibly even my heart because of the teeth that have broken off so far. BUT I AM SO SCARED AT HOW I WILL LOOK!!!! AND I NEED TO HAVE 22 TEETH EXTRACTED FIRST!!! I can go to Tucson, AZ (110 miles away) if I have to to get dentures that will look and fit well and not cost me an arm and a leg. (Financially, not in the position to pay a lot anymore.)  Anyone with any ideas out there??? Please!!!! [SEP] best_answer: I'd say go to Tuscon and have a dentist check it out. Better to have it done now then wait. In phoenix the upper denture cost about $1500.00 and lower partial about $700.----$1200. depending on if you want metal or what they call a "soft partial" made of acrillic.

The area surrounding the top part of the ring is darkening somewhat. Is this normal also? Will the darkness go away or should I start using fade cream? [SEP] best_answer: it will be sore for a few weeks yet or even months, it all depends on your body and how long it takes to heal. the darkened area will prob just be bruising from the piercing. When i had mine done this all happened and had gunk all round it for a while. Get some salt water in an egg cup and soak it for a few mins every day. this will help the healing process.if it starts bleeding or starts worrying you go o the doctors or the place where you got it done just to be sure.x	Health
question_title: Medical test - Calcium vs Corrected Calcium level? [SEP] question_content: What is the difference between Calcium and Corrected Calcium stated in medical test?\nWhat does it means? [SEP] best_answer: albumin binds calcium to a large extent, patients with abnomal albumin content will have abnormal calcium levels for this reason.\n\nThe only (never say only in medicine) active calcium in your body is NOT protein bound.  So what really matters is the ionized version.  Simple formulas based on the ratios of albumin/calcium binding help to estimate the physiologic calcium level.\n\nIonized calcium can be tested for directly, and corrected levels are simply a guess.

question_title: I really can't stand myself...? [SEP] question_content: If I knew somebody who was exactly like me, I would completely hate them. I don't understand how I have any friends. I'm often sarcastic and I hold up my feelings until I have to let them out, so when I do everybody gets sick of me complaining for a while about whatever has been bothering me. I'm also really shy, so it's hard for me to appear friendly to anybody. I can also tell that people are getting tired of my complaining about how I hate my physical appearance. I know I'm not fat, but instead of focusing on how I'm fortunate to be the weight I am, I only think about how much thinner I can be. I don't like anything about myself, really... I don't know what to do. How can I improve myself and my view of myself? [SEP] best_answer: You have just described 95 percent of the women in America.  Everyone has feelings like this.  The media helps make us sarcastic, feel like we don't have things good enough, and are nowhere near thin or pretty enough.  Maybe watching less TV would improve your outlook - it did for me.  \n\nObviously your friends see things that they like in you.  You can always ask them what they like about you. Try to do activities with them when you're together, like sports, playing games, etc., instead of just "hanging out" and talking, so you'll be more likely to be active and have new things to talk about, and less likely to ruminate and complain.\n\nJust a couple suggestions.  But don't think you have some serious disorder or anything - you sound perfectly normal to me.	Health

question_title: can anyone tell me about aortic stenosis in children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a condition where the last valve going out of the heart is not opening wide enough as the blood is being pumped out of the ventricle (the largest chamber of the heart).  AS can be a rather serious condition and if symptomatic, usually manifests in shortness of breath, lack of tolerance to exercise, and chest pain.  It may have no symptoms for many years other than a harsh mumur heard by stethoscope.  \n\nI have known cases where mild or moderate stenosis is monitored for sometime until it progresses to severe and/or becomes symptomatic.  This sometimes takes 20 years or more in an adult.  Regular monitoring via echocardiogram should be done serially (maybe once a year until there's evidence of decline then every 3 months) to gauge the condition's progress.  There is a point where the condition made be stable for some time.  Once it gets critical its time to fix it.  \n\nTo fix the problem an open heart procedure and new valve needs to be implanted.  This is a big surgery and should not be done unless absolutely indicated.  \n\nTwo types of valves exist.  Tissue valves and mechanical valves.  The tissue valves have shorter lives but do not require chronic anticoagulation medication.  Mechanical valves last for a long time and do not wear out but DO require oral anticoagulation medication.  \n\nThere are special issues with children considering the fact that their heart is going to grow and therefore require a different size valve as the heart grows.  I have not direct experience with valve replacement with children but I would imagine you want to delay the surgery for as long as possible until his/her heart is close to adult size if possible (eliminating the need to go in multiple times to replace the valve as it becomes too small).  \n\nYour goals would need to be balanced between watching for symptoms, reducing the need for multiple surgeries, and managing the condition once the surgery has been done with the need for anticoagulation medication or not.

question_title: whats the best way to shave my pubic area? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Snip a few first!Cut the hair down with scissors or clippers to about a quarter of an inch. If this is the first time you've shaved, or the first time in a long while and you are dealing with full growth again, you can do this a few days before you actually start shaving to get used to it. If you've never shaved your pubic hair before, then your skin has been covered by that hair for a very long time. The sensation of clothes and so on rubbing against it is going to be weird at first. \n\nThe first time you shave your pubic area, you may want to shave only a bit, then come back and do more later. This is sensitive skin we're dealing with here. Also, don't shave very often at first. Once a week for the first month is probably best, so your skin can get used to it. \n\nDon't worry about getting an extremely close shave the first few times; you'll get a closer one as you become more adept. \n\nIf you're female, your pubic area may become more sensitive during your period. \n\nSome people like to leave a patch of pubic hair above their penis or over the mons veneris. It may sound ridiculous, but an electric beard and moustache trimmer is perfect for keeping the patch neat. It's an extremely easy way to keep that patch short, even, and neat. In fact, if you want to keep all your pubic hair trimmed but not shaven, the trimmer can be used on the entire area. \n\nWhile shaving, sit (or lie if someone else is doing the shaving) with your legs far apart. This helps keep the skin taut and lessens the chance of the blade snagging a fold of skin. \n\nIf you have teeny little nicks or blood spots, there are a couple reasons why this might be happening. The most common reason is you're going to fast. Either you're shaving too quickly, or you're not allowing enough prep time. Remember: \nSoak the area for at least three minutes in warm water. If you're not going to take a shower or bath, lay a warm wet washcloth over the area for a while first. \nApply shaving gel and let it sit for at least four minutes. \nTake your time shaving. \nLittle blood spots are often the result of shaving over tiny bumps that are naturally there. Soaking and leaving the gel on helps make these bumps softer and smaller so that they're less likely to get nicked. The bumps also may be a result of irritation from a past shave. If this is the case, stop and wait a while before the next shave. \n\nWhen you first start shaving, or if irritation or itchiness is a problem, wear loose underwear and clothing. \n\nAlways remember to keep clean. Your genital hair helped protect from dirt, bacteria, friction and so on, so it's important to take care of yourself. Use soap and water on your outside bits -- your inside parts will keep themselves clean naturally.	Health
question_title: trichmoniasis treatment for a male is what? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How is trichomoniasis treated? \nTrichomoniasis can usually be cured with the prescription drug, metronidazole (also called Flagyl), or with a related drug, tinidazole. Topical medicines, or medicines applied to the skin, may be used in people who are allergic to metronidazole and tinidazole. The topical medicines are less effective and may not cure you. They might, however, ease the symptoms. \n\nAll women and men diagnosed with trichomoniasis should be treated. Even without symptoms, it can be passed to others. Having trichomoniasis also increases a person’s chances of getting HIV. People being treated for trichomoniasis should avoid sex until they and their sex partners complete treatment and have no symptoms. Having trichomoniasis once does not protect a person from getting it again.\n\nBetter if consult and have examination by physician. these drugs are not over the counter.	Health

Nothing has ever come close to me feeling liike one of you regular souls who have the drive to do what you do. I am only 18, and do not have a doctorates degree yet, but I can tel you one thing; all the SSRI's and MAOI's and MOI's and SSNRI's and SNRI's are NOT going to work on me. I believe I have ADD - but only because i took a test on the internet and identified all of my symptoms in a clear voice. What should I say to my doctor? It's only a pediatrition but he gave me paxil once, and that ended me up in the hospital\ni will never ever do that again.\nWhat do you think the chances of him giving me adderol? or any other popular ADD drug without going through another one of those stinking evaluations that takes months to even see a psychiatrist? [SEP] best_answer: Howdy ADD; By your writing I can empathize with your frustration; however, frustration may be a result of an emotional allergic reflex by your understanding and sensing of your inner self which may be harmful to your future emotional welfare.\nAntidepressants do work on many people especially those that suffer anxiety disorders.\nMood Stabilizers (Paxil, Prozac,etc.) also tend to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with ADD.\nI can feel for you if you had an adverse reaction this far into your treatment with psychothropic medicants.\nAt this time and in my limited psyche can only offer a comforting suggestion and that is that you may be a 'hyper-allergic' person.\nHave you had any physical allergy tests to date?\nIt is my opinion that an allergic reaction in the atmosphere may irritate the mind into a distracted state that will make short-term mamory stagnant in neural flow and therefore long-term memory retention impossible.\nRetake your psychological tests again and ask the Psychologist to place the results of both tests side by side for your personal assessment.\nIt is normal to forget the answers that you have provided in the previous test, but it you reapproach this process with a hopeful attitude I am sure that you will be that much closer to your emotional betterment.

His wife considers herself a smart person but instead keeps buying beer for him so he will not be mad.  What to do? [SEP] best_answer: As a 3 year member of Alcoholics Anonymous I'm gonna try to answer this.  Unfortunately as someone else responded to your question I agree that most likely and sadly you can't do much to help him if he doesn't want help.  As we say in AA, AA is not for those who need it but for those who want it.  As for his family you might try honestly, humbly, and lovingly letting his family know how concerned you are and that you don't know what to do.  I don't know if you have any spiritual beliefs but you might try praying for the man, I will.  James S. -Alcoholic Anonymous	Health

[SEP] question_content: whether its oral or regualr intercourse someone let me know [SEP] best_answer: First, get her very, very turned on. Whether orally or otherwise, the more she is excited and the higher her peak of excitement before intercourse, the greater likelihood she will have an orgasm. So don't skimp on foreplay. Being in a hurry here will get you nowhere in the end.\n\nAssuming you've done the above and you both want to assure that she has an excellent orgasm, teach her this little trick (I just hope you're old enough and mature enough to be learning all this). Regardless of the position you use, tell her that you want to touch herself, masturbate, while you are in her. Most women don't get stimulated where they need to be from most forms of male intercourse. The clitoris has to be given friction in some way for orgasm. If she manipulates herself and you do what you can, she will likely have the best orgasm she's every known.\n\nUnfortunately many men don't like to think that they can't make a woman orgasm just by themselves. Sometimes they can, but the way I describe above is almost guaranteed. Some women are too modest or are not used to self-manipulation, and they need to be assured that you want them to do this and will not think less of them for it.\n\nEnjoy. Please practice safe sex.

question_title: What is the prevalence of experiencing a miscarriage with NO SYMPTOMS? (no bleeding, cramping)? [SEP] question_content: I am 29 and I had one miscarriage 10 years ago as a teen.  I've been obsessing and worrying about miscarrying now.  Today, I am 9 weeks pregnant.  I have no symptoms (no morning sickness, no food aversions or cravings, no sensitivity to smell).  We heard a heartbeat at 5 weeks and 6 days, but I keep reading these stories of women who miscarry at about 8 to 10 weeks without even realizing it until their sonogram.  I have been tired lately and my breasts were very tender 2 weeks ago, but they feel fine now.  Thank you for your help. [SEP] best_answer: First calm down. I understand why you are concerned. Losing a baby is very tragic. But just because it happened 10 years ago doesn't mean it is going to happen now. The symptoms you have described for yourself are normal. I didn't have sickness, cravings, sensitivity to smell with my pregnancy either. Count this as a blessing! Being tired and on/off breast tenderness is normal. Try reading "What to expect when expecting" "Girlfriends guide to pregnancy" etc... Stop obsessing about losing this baby and start enjoying him/her. I truly understand the concerns. Make an appt. with your doctor to help ease your mind. As far as having a miscarriage WITH OUT ANY symptoms I don't know about. That is a question for the professionals.	Health
question_title: What are some of the negative side-effects of a high protein low carbohydrate diet e.g. "Dr. Atkins' Diet"?

question_title: For deaf people? [SEP] question_content: I am currectly half deaf (completely deaf out of my right ear). it's not that bad, but i would like my other ear back, as it was. I recently heard of an operation that installs an artifical ear drum (requires the nerve ending in the ear to be still intact). but this system requries a wire coming out behind the ear and to a power source on your belt. so here's my question. dooes anyone know of any alternitive? do you know someone who has it? how is it working for them? thanks [SEP] best_answer: Well, I am in the same boat as you.  I am also completely deaf in my right ear.  I have been like this since I was about 2 years old.  I do use a digital hearing aid. I was fortunate to have one of the best doctors in this area before he retired last year.  Years ago, I told they were doing research on the birds because the little hair behind their ear drum or the nerve endings themselves could regenerate.  I am not sure as to what their progress was because it has been so long.  As far as alternatives, implants aren't the best if you still have partial hearing because you will be hearing two different sound types.  One would be true sound that you hear out the good ear and the other would be a synthesized sound like you would hear a robot talking.  So it would be just best to wait until they come out with something better than Coclier(misspelled) implants.  If you need anything else let me know.	Health

question_title: It is so easy not to start smoking or drinking, so why do so many people do it? [SEP] question_content: I personally believe that it is too easy NOT to begin smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol (and not to mention abusing drugs).  Sure, there is peer pressure and people become stressed.  But each individual is fully capable of managing stress without resorting to such unhealthy habits.   We were made to be able to cope naturally.  Smoking and drinking are simply too dangerous for excuses.  I'm stressed out all the time; in fact, I get stressed out at the drop of a hat.  But I have no desire or need to do these things, even if they are readily available.  They are obviously extremely addictive and put users at much higher risk for cancer and other diseases.  And how many people kill themselves and others while driving drunk?  I would also like to know why exactly 18 year-olds (and younger) consider themselves old enough to drink.  They're not, I'm not.  It's illegal, simple as that.  We underestimate the dangers of these habits.  My main point is:  it's just too easy to avoid them. [SEP] best_answer: It's easy to start, hard to stop, and some people think its cool so they do it to try and impress them to be cool too. So, its generally peer pressure that starts it and then that person finds out the benefits and ignores the long term damages, and keeps doing alcohol or drugs or whichever, until they are so addicted its almost impossible to stop before they die. Thats why when they go through a serious condition (heart attack) and are hospitilized, then told they have to stop its much more likely that they will rather than stopping on their own.	Health

Also, do any other guys get "peegasms", where it feels like you are having an orgasm of greatly reduced intensity when you pee? [SEP] best_answer: Post-micturition convulsion syndrome, which often affects men, occurs toward the end of the urination session and isn't completely understood. Most speculation rather than scientific conclusions have been made regarding the cause(s). It is predominately believed that the shiver is a side effect of interactions between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN). The SNS, in this case is responsible for holding the flow of urine, and the PNS is responsible for releasing urine. Although they are far more common amongst men, women also experience these convulsions	Health

Does the year expiration date mean anything? I assumed they would just loose potancy if anything. Any ideas? Its a brand new unopened perscription. [SEP] best_answer: Technically you shouldn't - they say medicines can alter over time, some lose potency - some get stronger, some go bad.  However, it depends on the condition - I for instance had a urinary tract infection and used left over antibiotics to help  get rid of it.  People do it - but as an EMT - I should be telling you not to.	Health
question_title: On average, how long does it take after acl reconstruction surgery to be able to bend your knee all the way? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The previous answer is not correct. Depending on the type of graft that you choose, you may never fully gain your ROM (range of motion) back. Most doctors will tell you that if you can gain 120 degrees or better, then be happy with that. I was fortunate enough to gain 135. My normal ROM on my other knee was 137. It took me 3 months to gain this back. There are two obstacles that hold you back from bending your knee as far as you want. The first one is the PAIN!!! You body will tell you when it is ready to try a little further. While I was in surgery, my doctor bent my knee all the way back just to make sure that the graft would hold. You don't want him or her to do this while you are awake trust me. The second obstacle that doesn't allow you to bend your knee all the way back is the swelling. Your knee will have swellign in it from anywhere to 6 months up to a couple of years. The swelling limits the range of motion more than the pain itself. When you get the 70 or 80 degree range, you will notice a "tight" feeling in your knee. That is the swelling. \n   Overall, it depends on how much you do your excercises. The best excercise (also the most painful) is the heel-slide. thats where you lay on your back and attempt to bend your knee with your heel staying in constant contact with the floor or mat. Like I said, it hurts worse than any other excercise but it is the most productive.\n\n Good luck.	Health

I've intergrated 2 of my personalities into myself and have 3 left (including me - 4).  Do you mean, I can die and one of the others take over my life?  My core as you say is strong enough now that it won't ever be "beaten down or die" to one of my alts.  However, I have to say, yes, an alternate personality can kill you physically and themselves in the process.  Often alternate personality's feel guilt about 'being there' almost like they caused you to fracture in the first place and take that anger at themselves and misplace it.  By acting in self-destructive manners they can destroy themeselves and you.  Thats why good psychotheraphy is so important, if not critical.  \n\nAs far as the alternate killing the core and 'taking' over, I think your friend watches too many soap operas.	Health

This has more to do with blood flow and related factors than any kind of illness or problem.\n\nHowever, if things are bulging out in the area or the penis as well as some swelling, it could be a sign of an inguinal or lower abdominal hernia and a quick check by the doctor will confirm this or refute it.\n\nWhile it could be normal, it would definitely be wise to get ti checked just in case.

The way you describe your fears sounds like it is more about being left alone, and you may want to talk with a counselor about that issue.  Loss is a big source of pain for all of us.  Perhaps you have lost a beloved relative or friend, and you hate that feeling.  Or maybe you are very attached to an older relative, and you cannot imagine life without him or her.  Talk to a mental health professional about your specific fears and associations with death.  If you are religious, you can also talk to our clergy. This is a VERY COMMON fear.

question_title: worse? cigars or cigs? [SEP] question_content: I smoke 10 cigars a week. (pack of 10 hamlets) how much worse than smoking 10 cigaretees a day is that if at all? [SEP] best_answer: Gee, that's like asking which is worse, being stabbed to death or being beaten to death?  The result is still the same.\n\nPeople often think cigars are safer because you don't (at least, you aren't supposed to) inhale the smoke.  But you are still exposing your lungs to the smoke in the room created by the lit cigar.  You are still burning your tastebuds, dulling your sense of smell and contaminating your mouth, lips, gums, teeth and fingers.  \n\nBy comparison, the cigarette is much smaller, lasts far less time and although it is inhaled directly into the lungs, it is still doing the same number on your mouth, lips, gums, teeth, fingers and tongue.  But even though the amount of time it takes to consume a cigarette may seem more appealing, cigarette smokers tend to smoke their cancer sticks much more frequently than when a cigar smoker lights up.  It's almost as if the cigarette smoker is trying to play catchup to the cigar smoker.  Neither is good for you.  Both can cause ulcers of the mouth and tongue - even if you never develop cancer.

question_title: is there a home remedy to get well water color(minerals and such) out of hair? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I have heard that some people use a vinegar rinse, which we know works on removing mineral deposits on coffee pots and humidifiers. I know it smells awful, but maybe if, after pouring a cup on your hair, leaving it on for about 5 minutes, rinsing then shampooing twice, it might not be so bad. Do this treatment once a month, before perming, or before coloring your hair. I used to have well water, but I used a commercial de-mineralizer to remove the minerals before I dyed or permed my hair. Check with your local hair salon for what they use. I know they're pricey, but it smells better than vinegar. Aussie brand used to have a citrifier, which is a de-mineralizer, but it has been removed from the market (bummer...it worked really good too). I checked on the internet with Aussie and they said they won't be replacing it (bigger bummer). It was very low priced too. Hope this helps. <*)))><	Health

I was on lithium and hated the side effects (was taking paxil too). I talked to my doctor and was switched to Lamictal. As your doctor switches you it is done slowly so your body adjusts, but doesn't take THAT long (I took 6 weeks to completely switch.) \n\nI don't recommend doing it yourself. Without the mood stabilizer you might find you become extremely manic or depressed and start cycling. This is especially true if you stay on the anti-depressent. If you didn't like your doctor before, find a new one and make it clear you want to switch. All the doctors I have gone to were happy to get me off meds I didn't like, especially lithium because it is dangerous. Good Luck!	Health

question_title: What is Pilomatrix Carcinoma? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Pilomatrix Carcinoma:\n\nPilomatrixoma, also known as pilomatricoma, and calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, is an uncommon benign tumor of hair matrix origin.  Malherbe and Cheantais first described the lesion in 1880 and originally believed the lesion was a benign tumor of the sebaceous glands.  The lesions typically occur on the head and neck and are more common in females.  There are two peaks of occurrence with age.  The first is before the third decade, with greater than 60% occurring at this time.  The second is during the sixth and seventh decades (3).  Histologically, pilomatrixomas are characterized by irregularly shaped islands of small basaloid epithelial cells.  The basaloid cells generally have small uniform nuclei and scant cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders surrounded by fibrillary material.  Also often noted are a variable degree of squamous differentiation and sheets of ghost cells that occasionally are mixed with stroma containing multinucleated giant cells.  \n\nCalcifications may or may not be conspicuous.  Pilomatrix carcinoma is an exceedingly rare locally aggressive and destructive tumor that usually arises from a pilomatrixoma.    Bony invasion and occasional distant metastases have been reported (2).  The carcinoma is more common in males than females, with a ratio of 2:1 in a review of 72 cases in the literature (2).  Imaging studies such as MRI or CT may be useful to evaluate pilomatrix carcinoma that does not respond to wide local excision with negative margins.  Histologically, Pilomatrix carcinoma is characterized by more numerous and atypical mitoses, nuclear atypia, tumor necrosis, and infiltration into subcutaneous fat, blood vessels, nerve and muscle.  Aggressive wide local excision is required for treatment.	Health

question_title: Is diabetes reversible? [SEP] question_content: Type 2 [SEP] best_answer: It depends. Mostly on a lot of stuff we only dimily understand. But yes, sometimes, sort of.\n\nIn the case of type 2, the situation is more or less as follows. \n\nThe characteristic problem in type 2 is that most o fhte body's cells have decided, more or less, to stop responding to insulin in its glucose uptake function control role. Why this should be is now somewhat understood (ie, we think we see the mechanisms inside the cell, but not much more), but we don't know why there is so much variation from one patient to another. Some type 2s have only a slightly elevated glucose levels. Some rather more and some are completely out of control. \n\nPart of the reason for the variation appears to be due to the amount of abdominal fat present (around the organs there). This fat, but not it seems thunder thighs, or double chins, or love handles, is very active. It produces a variety (that we've found so far) of signalling chemicals --  to everyone's surprise, and also seems to be characteristically inflammed (ie, the immunological reaction). Losing even a small amount of that fat seems to reduce the severity of the inflammation and often of type 2, especially in less severe patients. Not always of course. And exercise generally helps muscle cells absorb glucose with or without insulin. And reducing the amount of glucose that has to be handled is good too. \n\nSo, if you're a borderline type 2 diabetic, you might be able to go back to something like normal blood glucose control if you exercise, lose enough weight to reduce the amount of fat in and around your abdominal organs, and keep your food intake reasonable. Lots of carbohydrate (sugary soda included) will break down into glucose and be absorbed into the blood, fat in the diet will end up stored in various places around the body, including the abdomen, and so on. \n\nIf your situation is not very severe, and you diet and exercise proeprly, you might be able to get back to normal. But, the underlying condition remains. You may not be able to stay normal no matter what you do, and if you gain weight or stop exercising or stop eating right, it is likely to come back. \n\nWhy all of thsi works the way it does is quite obscure. It's clear there is a strong genetic component to type 2, but it's not enough, for not every one with the genetic background gets type 2. And people with no genetic history in their family do get type 2. Much research is under way attempting to make sense of this, but it's a hard problem.	Health
question_title: How popular is the South Beach diet? [SEP] question_content: Is there some survey or website that talks about which fad diets are the most popular? [SEP] best_answer: One way to judge a diet's popularity is to see how the book sales rank on Amazon.com. You can check out the latest Amazon best-seller inforrmation at \nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/books/all/\n\nHowever, book sales numbers don't mean much, because diets go through fad cycles. An author will sell a zillion copies of his book one month, and then another diet will be the rage the next month. South Beach has gone through that same cycle, and it's not as popular now as it was when it first came out.\n\nIt got a big publicity boost in 2004, when ex-President Clinton lost about 30 pounds on the South Beach Diet. Then it lost some of its appeal a few weeks later when he had to have heart surgery. Some nutritionists think South Beach is healthy.\n\nMake up your own mind after reading some internet forum discussions about the SBD.

Casts also help to prevent or decrease muscle contractions, and are effective at providing immobilization, especially after surgery. \nCasts immobilize the joint above and the joint below the area that is to be kept straight and without motion.

What actions does the killing set in motion, with what possible tragic consequences? [SEP] best_answer: Tybalt's death turns the play to a tragedy.\n\nThings are going great for Romeo. He's just married Juliet, the love of his life. Everything is perfect until about an hour or so after his wedding to Juliet, when he kills Tybalt.\n\nPer the Prince's decree in Act I, Scene i, anyone caught engaging in a civil brawl will be put to death. Romeo should be killed. Instead, Prince Escalus exiles him. Here's where everything starts going wrong.\n\nJuliet gets sad and wants to kill herself. Her daddy wants her to marry Count Paris. Everything sucks. So she goes to see Friar Lawrence, who gives her the potion which will make her appear dead.\n\nUnfortunately, Romeo does not receive the Friar's message that Juliet is just faking her death.

question_title: A car dealership sold me a used car that they misrepresented as new. What should I do. Should I sue?"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Was the car used...or did it have mileage on it from being a "demo" or a "loaner".  You might want to double check to make sure that the car has an MSO "Manufacturer's Statement of Orgin" .  That is the "title" you get from the manufacture.  When you take ownership, after that, you and everyone else that owns the car would get a true title.  If you received an MSO instead of a title the car would still be considered new.  If it had miles on it they might have used it for a demo (owner or manager or even salespeople get to drive the car since they work there)  or they could have some type of event that allowed them to let someone borrow the car for a while.  Oldsmobile used to let officials from the college world series drive new olds while the series was going on.  When they were finished, Oldsmobile would give credit to the dealers so they could sell the car at a discounted price.  The car was still new but.....had some miles on it.	Education & Reference

question_title: if a dice is thrown ten times in how many ways is it possible to have 1,2,3 in the outcome? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Assuming that the 1, 2 and 3 are supposed to be consecutive:\n\nFirstly, for three throws of the die, the probability of throwing 1, 2 and 3 in order is (1/6)^3 = 1/216\n\nIf you throw the die 10 times then there are 8 independent chances of throwing 1, 2, 3. That's because if you have not thrown 1, 2, 3 by the time you get to the 9th throw, you cannot do it because you only have two throws left. \n\nTherefore the chance of throwing 1, 2, 3 with 10 throws of a die are (10 - 2) * (1/216) = 8/216 which is equivalent to 1/27.\n\nIf you prefer to express that as a decimal (not recommended!) then the answer is 0.0370 to 3 s f	Education & Reference

question_title: Use the limit process to find the area between the graph of f(x)=x² and the x-axis over the interval on the x- [SEP] question_content: Use the limit process to find the area between the graph of f(x)=x² and the x-axis over the interval on the x-axis [1,2] [SEP] best_answer: Let's break the area into many vertical rectangular strips between x=1 and x=2, each strip so narrow that we can assume that the top of the strip is horizontal. Thus each strip will be a very narrow and tall rectangle.\n\nLet's say the number of vertical strips we use is n. The first strip will have its left-hand side at x = 1, the next will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + 1/n, the third will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + 2/n, and in general the kth strip will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + (k-1)/n.\n\nNow, what is the y value at each of these x points? Using f(x)=x² we get, for the kth point,\n\ny = (1 + (k-1)/n)² = 1 + 2(k-1)/n + ((k-1)/n)² \n\nNow the area of each strip is equal to its base times its height. The base of each strip is 1/n. So the area of the kth strip is\n\nA = 1/n * (1 + 2(k-1)/n + ((k-1)/n)²)\n\nNow we have to add the areas of all these strips from k = 1 to k = n and rearrange the terms.\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ (1/n + 2(k-1)/n² + (k-1)²/n^3)\n.....k=1   \n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ (1/n + (2k - 2)/n² + (k² - 2k + 1)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\nGiving all fractions the common denominator of n^3,\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ ((n² + 2kn - 2n + k² - 2k + 1)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ ((n² - 2n + 1)/n^3  + (2kn + k² - 2k)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\nThe first term in the summation sign appears n times in the sum, so we can take it out by multiplying it by n. \n\nSum going from k=1 to k=n:\nA =  (n² - 2n + 1)/n² + Σ (2kn + k² - 2k)/n^3\n\nNow let's clear the parentheses in the summation:\n\nSum going from k=1 to k=n:\nA =  (n² - 2n + 1)/n² + Σ 2k/n² + Σ k²/n^3 - Σ 2k/n^3)\n\nThe first summation contains k=1, 2, 3, ... n, so we use the formula for the sum of the arithmetic series:\n\nS = n(n+1)/2\n\nso the first summation becomes\n\nn(n+1)/n² = (n² + n)/n² = 1 + 1/n\n\nThe last summation also contains k=1, 2, 3, ... n, so we use the same formula for the sum of a series, and we get\n\nn(n+1)/n^3 = (n² + n)/n^3 = 1/n + 1/n²\n\nFor the middle summation, we have to compute the sum of k² for k=1, 2, 3, ... n, or that is the sum of 1, 4, 9, 16, ... n².\n\nThe site\n\nhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSum.html\n\ngives the formula for the sum of the squares of a series as\n\nS = (2n^3 + 3n² + n)/6\n\nso the middle summation becomes\n\n1/3 + 1/2n + 1/6n²\n\nNow, we are almost done.\n\nLet's let the number of strips get very large, go to infinity as a limit. Let's see what each term becomes:\n\n(n² - 2n + 1)/n² becomes 1 as n gets very large,\n1 + 1/n becomes 1 as n gets very large,\n1/n + 1/n² becomes 0 as n gets very large, and\n1/3 + 1/2n + 1/6n² becomes 1/3 as n gets very large.\n\nThe area under the curve is 1 + 1 + 1/3, or 7/3.\n\nYou can see why integral calculus was invented. Using integral calculus, this problem can be solved in two steps. The integral of f(x)=x² is x^3/3. Inserting the limits of x=1 and x=2 gives\n\nA = 2^3/3 - 1^3/3 = 7/3	Education & Reference

question_title: history of tal frauenberg castle? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Perhaps this helps...\n\nIn the Altmuehl Valley  there are many castles, and quite a number of them exceed Prunn as to extent, value of equipment or age. Nevertheless, the comparatively small castle of Prunn is one of the best-known castles of Bavaria owing to its unique site and the harmonious combination of natural scenery and architectural performance.\nA document of A.D. 1037 mentions the name of the owner of the castle: Wernher of Prunn. One hundred years later the castle belonged to the family of the barons of Laaber and Breitenbrunn . At that time the oldest preserved parts of the castle were built, above all the mighty tower.\nIn 1338 the knights of Frauenberg bought the castle, and this family retained ownership until 1567. Their heraldic figure is the white horse which was painted on the outer wall of the castle. The most famous member of the family was Jack the Joyous, an experienced warrior whose marble gravestone is in the parish church of Prunn. An heirloom of his was an ornamented manuscript of the Nibelungenlied, the famous medieval German epic. It has been called the "Prunn Godex" and is now a unique specimen in the National Library of Bavaria.\nIn the 16th century the ducal councillor von Koekh remodelled parts of the castle. Two centuries later the Jesuits added rococo ornament to a number of rooms and to the chapel. Since 1822 the castle has been state property.\n\n-or-\n\nFrombork (German: Frauenburg (pronunciation (help·info))) is a town in northern Poland, on the Vistula Lagoon in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodship, in Braniewo County, with a population of 2,528 in 2005.\n\nThe former residence of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, the town and its 700-year old cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war Frombork was meticulously reconstructed and is a popular tourist attraction again.\n\nThe town was founded as a defensive stronghold on an Old Prussian site. In 1224 at Catania Emperor Frederick II declared Prussia as directly subordinate to the church and the empire only and later in 1224 the pope assigned bishop William of Modena as papal legate to Prussia. According to local legend, its inhabitants were baptised by Anselm of Meißen, a priest of the Teutonic Order and the first Bishop of the Bishopric of Warmia which was created in 1242 by William of Modena after the area was conquered by Teutonic Knights, who had received possession of Prussia by the imperial Golden Bull of Rimini.\n\nSupposedly when the stronghold's lord died, his widow Gertruda offered the settlement to the bishop, and in her honor it was named Frauenburg ("woman's or women's castle" in German). This name is not unique in German, but it usually originates in the construction of a fortified chapel, church, or monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary or inhabited by nuns. Several places were thus named Marienburg, like the nearby castle and city (now Malbork).	Education & Reference

Hitler killed 11 million people, including 6 million Jews.  \n\nStalin was by far worse:\n\nJoseph Stalin (1879 - 1953)\n\nOne of the most powerful and murderous dictators in human history, Stalin was the supreme ruler of the Soviet Union for a quarter of a century. His regime of terror caused the death and suffering of tens of millions of his subjects, but he was also in charge of the war machine that played a significant role in the defeat of Hitler's armies during World War II.\n\nA Georgian by birth, Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili grew up in modest circumstances and only learned Russian at school. He studied at a theological seminary but never graduated, instead embarking on a life as a professional revolutionary. This included robbing banks to fill the Bolshevik party chest and spending years in Siberian exile.\n\nStalin was not one of the decisive players in the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, but he soon rose in the ranks. In 1922 he was made General Secretary of the Communist Party, a post which was not considered particularly significant at the time but nevertheless became the base from which he launched his bid for supreme power.\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin promoted himself as his political heir and gradually outmanoeuvred rivals. Unlike Trotsky, Stalin believed that socialism could be introduced in one country without being accompanied by a world revolution. By the late 1920s, Stalin was effectively the dictator of the Soviet Union.\n\nHis forced collectivisation of agriculture cost million of lives, while his industrialisation programme made his country militarily strong but provided little material welfare for its citizens. Moreover, the population suffered immensely during the Great Terror of the 1930s, during which Stalin and his henchmen purged the Party of 'enemies of the people' and sent millions to the Gulag system of slave labour camps.\n\nThe purges severely depleted the Red Army officer corps, and despite many warnings, Stalin was ill prepared for Hitler's massive attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941. His political future hung in the balance, but he recovered to lead his country to victory. As usual with Stalin, the human cost was enormous, but that mattered little to him. His general disregard for human lives included his own family - his eldest son perished in German captivity, his second wife committed suicide, and many in-laws were caught up in the terror.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Union entered the nuclear age and ruled over an empire which included most of Eastern Europe. Increasingly paranoid, Stalin himself became a victim of the fear he had induced in his subjects. Having suffered a stroke at night, he lay helpless on his floor for many hours, because no one dared disturb him. He died on 5 March 1953.\n\nA large part of the Soviet population reacted to his death with hysterical grief, but soon his former comrades-in-arms denounced his policies of terror and persecution. Today, Stalinism is a symbol of totalitarian rule and limitless personal power. His birth home in Gori forms part of the Stalin Museum, a bizarre and somewhat eerie Soviet monument to one of history's most bloodthirsty tyrants.	Education & Reference

question_title: Can someone help me answer the following questions? [SEP] question_content: Summarize the six components of The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975.  Can anyone help me identify the six componets I can't seem to find them anywhere. [SEP] best_answer: The following six main principles of IDEA embody the underlying spirit and intent of IDEA and provide the framework around which special education services are designed and provided to students with disabilities:\n\nFree Appropriate Public Education — IDEA guarantees that each child with a disability, eligible for special education, will be entitled to a free appropriate public education (FAPE).\n\nFree requires that the education of each child with a disability must be provided at public expense and at no cost to the child’s parents. The only exception is that incidental fees normally charged to non-disabled students or their parents as part of the regular education program may also be charged to students with disabilities and their parents.\n\nAppropriate means that each child with a disability is entitled to an education that is “appropriate” for his or her needs. “Appropriate education” is determined on an individual basis and may not be the same for each child with a disability.\n\nPublic refers to the public school system. Children with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of their disabilities, have the same right to attend the public schools as their non-disabled peers. The public school system must educate students with disabilities, respond to their individual needs, and help them plan for their future.\n\nEducation - IDEA is an education act that guarantees that eligible children with disabilities will receive a public education that includes special education and related services as directed by the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP), based on the child's individual needs. \n\nAppropriate Evaluation — IDEA requires that each child suspected of having a disability receive an appropriate evaluation: \nIn all areas of suspected disability. \nBy a team of evaluators knowledgeable and trained in the use of the tests and other evaluation materials they use. \nEmploying a variety of sound evaluation materials and procedures selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. \nWithout subjecting a child to unnecessary tests and assessments. \nIncluding the gathering of relevant information from a variety of sources. \nBased on information that is useful instructionally in planning for the child’s education. \nAn appropriate evaluation provides information to be used to determine the child’s eligibility for special education and related services and the educational needs of the child. \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) — In order to ensure that students with disabilities receive an appropriate and individualized education, IDEA requires that, after drawing upon current evaluation information, the IEP team develop a written document, the IEP, designed to meet the unique educational needs of each student with disabilities. IDEA contains clear language about: \nThe information which the IEP must contain. \nWho develops the IEP. \nThe public agency’s obligation to provide the special education and related services identified in the IEP. \nLeast Restrictive Environment (LRE) — IDEA guarantees that a child with a disability will receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment (LRE) appropriate. This principle reflects IDEA’s strong preference for educating students with disabilities in general education classes with the access to general education curriculum. Placement in the general education classroom is the first placement option the IEP team must consider.\n\nWhen considering placement in the general education classroom, the team is required to explore the range of modifications and supplementary aids and services that are needed to ensure that the student can receive a satisfactory education in the general education classroom. If the IEP team determines that the student can be appropriately educated in the general education classroom using modifications/supplementary aids and services, this is the L	Education & Reference

question_title: why is Ralph Ellison considered a part of southern literature ? [SEP] question_content: need  quick responses [SEP] best_answer: RALPH ELLISON\n\nIn 1936, a few weeks after my arrival in New York City, I was lucky enough to be invited by an old hero and newfound friend, Langston Hughes, to be his guest at what would be my introduction to Broadway theater. I was so delighted and grateful for the invitation that I failed to ask my host the title of the play, and it was not until we arrived at the theater that I learned that it would be Jack Kirkland's dramatization of Erskine Caldwell's famous novel Tobacco Road. No less successful than in its original form, the play was well on its way to a record-breaking seven-and-a-half-year run, and that alone was enough to increase my expectations. And so much so that I failed to note the irony of circumstance that would have as my introduction to New York theater a play with a southern setting and characters that were based upon a type and class of whites whom I had spent the last three years trying to avoid. Had I been more alert, it might have occurred to me that somehow a group of white Alabama farm folk had learned of my presence in New York, thrown together a theatrical troupe, and flown north to haunt me. But being dazzled by the lights, the theatrical atmosphere, the babble of the playgoing crowd, it didn't. And yet that irony arose precisely from the mixture of motives__ practical, educational, and romantic__ that had brought me to the North in the first place.\n\nAmong these was my desire to enjoy a summer free of the South and its problems while meeting the challenge of being on my own for the first time in a great northern city. Fresh out of Alabama, with my junior year at Tuskegee Institute behind me, I was also in New York seeking funds with which to complete my final year as a music major__ a goal at which I was having less success than I had hoped. However, there had been compensations. For between working in the Harlem YMCA cafeteria as a substitute for vacationing waiters and countermen and searching for a more profitable job, I had used my free time exploring the city, making new acquaintances, and enjoying the many forms of social freedom that were unavailable to me in Alabama. The very idea of being in New York was dreamlike, for like many young Negroes of the time, I thought of it as the freest of American cities and considered Harlem as the site and symbol of Afro-American progress and hope. Indeed, I was both young and bookish enough to think of Manhattan as my substitute for Paris and of Harlem as a place of Left Bank excitement.\n\nAnd yet I soon discovered, much to my chagrin, that while I was physically out of the South, I was restrained__ sometimes consciously, sometimes not__ by certain internalized thou-shalt-nots that had structured my public conduct in Alabama. It was as though I had come to the Eden of American culture and found myself indecisive as to which of its fruits were free for my picking. Beyond the borders of Harlem's briar patch__ which seemed familiar because of my racial and cultural identification with the majority of its people and the lingering spell that had been cast nationwide by the music, dance, and literature of the so-called Harlem Renaissance__ I viewed New Yorkers through the overlay of my Alabama experience. Contrasting the whites I encountered with those I had observed in the South, I weighed class against class and compared southern styles with their northern counterparts. I listened to diction and noted dress, and searched for attitudes in inflections, carriage, and manners. And in pursuing this aspect of my extracurricular education, I explored the landscape.\n\nI crossed Manhattan back and forth from river to river and up, down, and around again, from Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Battery, looking and listening and gadding about; rode streetcar and el, subway and bus; took a hint from Edna Millay and spent an evening riding back and forth on the Staten Island Ferry. From the elevated trains I saw my first penthouses with green trees growi	Education & Reference

question_title: Tips for writing compositions? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Here are a couple:\n\nBefore submitting a final draft of anything, double-check spelling, grammar, syntax, and all that.  The spell-check feature in a word processor is useful, but even it can make mistakes (it may misread the context of something and consequently make inappropriate changes), so I highly recommend getting someone to proof-read for you.  Even if you're good about spelling and grammar, it never hurts to get a second set of eyes, as there's a good chance they'll catch something that you wouldn't.\n\nLet's see, what else? Vary your diction.  Using the same words or phrases over and over again can bore a reader.  A thesaurus can be helpful (and if you don't have one, thesaurus.com is just as good).  But don't rely on it too heavily.  Some folks do this, and it really shows.  Their sentences end up sounding really forced, and not natural at all.  Also, the nuances of a word are important, and so it's important to choose a synonym with just the right flavor.  Cultivate your own creativity.\n\nThose are two areas where folks my age, at least, seem to run into problems.  There's lots more to be said on the subject, but if you're just seeking general tips, those two should take you a long way.  If you're writing a scholarly paper, I would suggest you get ahold of an MLA Handbook, if you don't have one already.\n\nhttp://www.mla.org/style\n\nBest of luck to you!	Education & Reference

His early achievements, as composer and performer, show him to be extending the Viennese Classical tradition that he had inherited from Mozart and Haydn. As personal affliction – deafness, and the inability to enter into happy personal relationships – loomed larger, he began to compose in an increasingly individual musical style, and at the end of his life he wrote his most sublime and profound works. From his success at combining tradition and exploration and personal expression, he came to be regarded as the dominant musical figure of the 19th century, and scarcely any significant composer since his time has escaped his influence or failed to acknowledge it. For the respect his works have commanded of musicians, and the popularity they have enjoyed among wider audiences, he is probably the most admired composer in the history of Western music.

question_title: What does yes mean? [SEP] question_content: what does yes mean [SEP] best_answer: YES\nYes is a common English word indicating agreement or acceptance. It is the opposite of no. It is often replaced by "yeah", "yep" (with various spellings, including "yup"), "uh-huh,", "ayuh", (generally used only in Maine) or "aye".\n\nThe word "yes" comes from the Old English gése, gíse, gýse (pronounced with a palatized g which was represented by a yogh), with the literal meaning of so be it!. From géa + sī, the present subjunctive of to be (be it!). Géa, (possibly meaning thus), is from the Proto-Germanic *ja or *je, with the meaning of yes or truly.[1]\n\nThe words "aye" and "yea" are used for "yes" in some contexts. 'Aye' is more common in Scotland and the north of England. It may also be used in meetings: 'All who agree say "aye"'. 'Aye' is also a nautical way of saying 'yes'. 'Aye, Aye' means I hear the command, I understand it, and will obey it. 'Yea' is archaic. The King James Bible always uses 'yea' and never 'yes'.\n\nIn English, "yes" is also used to answer a negative question or statement, an example of "yes" used to disagree with a question or statement is:\n\nThe questions "You don’t want it, do you?" and "Don’t you want it?" can be answered by "yes" if the respondent does want the item, and "no" if he or she does not. However, other words are used when the answer needs to be clearly delineated, as in "Of course I want it," or "No, not at all." Many languages use a different word for this purpose. For example, German has "doch" for this purpose (rather than "ja"), French uses "si" (rather than "oui") and Norwegian uses "jo" or "jau".	Education & Reference

question_title: how to build a fast succesful fire? [SEP] question_content: the title explains it [SEP] best_answer: In a fireplace or outside?  Outside, gas usually get things moving quickly, although, if the wood is wet, gasoline doesn't do much.  When I have started bonfires outside with wet wood, I've made a big pile of wood and put one duraflame log on each side of the pile.  That helped to get things going and the duraflame logs burn long enough to really keep things going.\n\nIn a fire place, you really need to start with small kindling, like pine cones, small dry twigs, medium sized dry sticks, and then let that catch on.  Put large pieces of wood around it, but not big logs.  You have to start small and build up around that.\n\nOther things that work good to get a fire started, you can roll up newspaper, soak it in molten candle wax, then let it dry.  That works out as a good, solid way to get the fire going.  They also sell things in WalMart and places like that that are like Duraflame logs, only much smaller.  Its really just sawdust soaked with wax.  It gets a fire started pretty good too.	Education & Reference

question_title: Dyslexia is Not due to what factors or behaviors? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Dyslexia refers to a different learning style for reading and writing not associated with obvious problems such as bad eyesight, poor hearing, low intelligence or behavioural problems. The term Dyslexia means 'difficulty with the lexicon'. Although it can be caused by brain damage (usually referred to as 'Alexia'), the majority of Dyslexics show no evidence of brain trauma. It is believed that Dyslexia is the result of developmental differences in the brain. Studies have shown that often there are other family members who show and have shown similar difficulties, which suggests a genetic or developmental cause of the condition. Dyslexia, as a condition, can show a pronounced difference between individuals, from being very mild to severe. It is not restricted to childhood but can continue throughout a persons life. Nor is it restricted to one sex. Male Dyslexics, however, may show different symptoms to females. Dyslexics may also show a difference depending on which written language they are using, (for example there may be a difference between a Dyslexic who uses English to one who uses Japanese).\n\nProblems can include a persons difficulty with reading and writing, poor short term memory for sequences, (for example numbers), and a 'confused' use of their hands (for example ambidextrous people often show signs of Dyslexia). In addition, occasionally males will show a slower development of language skills in the early part of their lives. Dyslexias include the inability to name letters, to read words or sentences, or to recognize words directly even though they can be sounded out. Dyslexia is not limited to reversing the order of letters in reading or writing, as is often implied in popular culture; it may, for instance, include unexpected spelling mistakes (including phonetic spelling in English) and unusual syntax, and may be associated with dyscalculia. Most theories focus on nonprimary areas in the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe.[1] Studies have linked several forms of dyslexia to genetic markers[2][3][4].\n\nread more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia\n\nand just to show you what it looks like......( i have been dyslexic for 30 years.....)\n\n\nI cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid Aoccdrnig to rscheearch taem at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae.

The midis are usually free, but you pay extra for the real tones.\n\nWhat is most helpful is the "upload personal files" in the "my locker" section of the "my mixxer" menu. It allows you to select a file from your computer, pick what segment you want to use as your ring-tone and store it in your locker. Then you access their website from your phone to transfer it. \n\nYou need to listen to the file first in some kind of program like Windows media player, or another one of your choice so that you can find out what minute/second marker you want to start your ring-tone at, and where you want to stop it. \n\nI have used it successfully a couple of times with MP3's. \n\nIf you don't need a way to get the files to your phone, you may just need a simple editor. If you already have a CD burner on your computer (Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator came with mine) you might be surprised at all of the different functions it has. Or there are a lot of different shareware and freeware programs that you can download. \n\nCheck out: \nhttp://www.download.com/MP3-Sound-Cutter/3000-2169_4-10242376.html?tag=lst-4-5\n\nThere are tons of others.\n\nHope that helps!

question_title: Differences in pipelines in video cards? [SEP] question_content: 10, 12, 14, etc.\n\nWhat's the deal with "pipelines" when it comes to video cards? How would nVidia's SLI increase, decrease the numbers? [SEP] best_answer: Similar to the way a CPU has a pipeline filled with small stages that each do a single task quickly, so too does the GPU in your video card. \nWhat this does is take a large task, and break it down into smaller stages.  This allows you to do multiple things at once and make your overall clock speed equivalent to the slowest of those stages. \n\nPipelined GPU:\n    * Wash\n    * Wash->Dry\n    * Wash->Dry->Fold\n    * Dry->Fold\n    * Fold\n\nThe more pipelines a video card contains, the faster and better the image will be processed and rendered. Thats why SLI is so efficient.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how can you find our when web page last modified? [SEP] question_content: I have already attempted entering javascript:alert(document.lastModified) in address bar however this reflecting current time and date. [SEP] best_answer: document.lastModified will not work when the page is transmitted from server to client. It reflects the local time because that's the time the page was stored in the "Temporary Internet File" directory. It shows that in javascript, document.lastModified gets only the locally modified time. So, you must manually type time and date each time you modify your web-page. However I think there are some options in server sided scriptings to detect the last modified date in servers. I am not used to it.	Computers & Internet

The claim at that point was that the 1.6 MHz mobile was about the same as a 3.5 MHz P4.  This may have been in PC Magazine or something online.  (Can't find the source quickly.)\n\nThe main thing is that the M chips suck less energy, which is good in laptops, where battery life and heat are more important.	Computers & Internet

If locked you can right click and uncheck the lock taskbar item. I would then lock it back once I got it where I wanted it.

question_title: how can i recover gold from a cpu? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The process of recovering gold from electronics circuits is relatively simple, but also quite expensive to set up.\n\nEquipment required includes a DC power source capable of delivering several amperes of current at approximately 12 to 100 VDC.  ( A DC Arc Welding Power supply will work well here. )\n\nThen the material containing the gold to be extracted must be crushed.  Crushing multi-layer fiberglass circuit boards is difficult, but it must be done to expose as much of the gold as possible.\n\nA solution of water and some Gold Salt should be mixed.  Gold Sulfate is probably the cheapest, but it is STILL very expensive.  The solution should be in the range of 0.5 gram per litre.\n\nObtain a tank or container made of conductive metal.  Copper is best.  Place the crushed material in the tank,\nPour in the Gold Salt solution until crushed material is completely covered. Attach the POSITIVE anode of the power supply to the tank.  Attach the NEGATIVE cathode of the powersupply to a small piece of gold wire or gold goin or jewelry ( Just a seed to get the thing started . ) And immerse this negative lead in the solution, being careful NOT to let it touch the tank or the crushed material.\n\nTurn on the power...And walk way...The Gold from the crushed material will be 'deposited' on the Cathode gradually over time.  The more current you are able to safely supply without burning something up, the faster the process will be.	Computers & Internet

question_title: does anyone know how to delete an operating system (windows xp) from a laptop? [SEP] question_content: I caught a virus on my laptop and had to reinstall windows. the first attempt wiped everything out but I had purchased a faulty disk and it was not complete. I purchased a new disk and it installed beautifully. Now I have two operating systems on my computer at the startup. Do you know how to delete the partial one and leave the whole one? It is on and emachine if that helps. [SEP] best_answer: The best thing to do in this case is for you to reformat like the others have suggested and install a fresh copy of XP but if you have never done this it might throw you at first. With your machine on, stick in your copy of XP in then reboot. Then after it starts to reboot it will ask you "press any key to boot from CD" Press any key at this point and then wait for it to inspect your systems hardware then it will load some common drivers etc. After that it will look to see if you have any previous versions installed. When it shows you those other versions it will ask you if you want to continue installing Windows on this drive or something like that. At this point you want to get rid of the previous versions and any partitions. If you read carefully you can delete any other versions and/ or partitions and then install a fresh copy of XP. Make sure that you have gotten rid of all other OS's and partitions and if you have it will say "to install on this partition press enter" and you should see "new(raw)" and then however many MB's your drive is. At this point press enter and it will ask you "install XP NTFS or install XP NTFS(quick). Use the first one "install XP NTFS" Press enter and it will start to format the drive and then let it install XP and your all set.	Computers & Internet

question_title: why is there no volcanos in canada? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually Canada IS on the Ring of Fire, which circles the Pacific Ocean more or less.\n\nCanada does have volcanoes on its west cost where the Rockies and Cascades continue north out of the United States.  \n\nYou don't have to be on the Ring of Fire to have volcanoes either, just along an active fault typically.  There are volcanoes all over the world where the plates meet.  Canada doesn't have volcanoes over most of its land though because it is spread across a continental plate which is too thick in the middle to have hot spots (like the Pacific plate does where we see the Hawaiian islands).  Where it meets the Pacific and Juan de Fuca plate in the west though there is enough movement to form mountains and strato volcanoes (like Mt. St. Helens which is not far from Canada, in Washington State).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can people all over the world see the "little dipper?"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Little Dipper is near the north celestial pole, and contains Polaris (the North Star). It's only visible by people who live north of the Earth's equator.\n\nMost places on the Earth have some part of the sky that is never visible. The exception being people who live near the equator. \nAs you move away from the equator, you lose the ability to see stars near the far pole (i.e. as you move south you lose the ability to see stars near the north pole), and the further away you go the less of the opposite hemisphere you're able to still see. Once you reach the pole you can only see stars in your hemisphere.\n\nPeople who live south of the equator can't see the stars near the north pole (like the little dipper) and people who live north of the equator can't see the Southern Cross or the Magellanic clouds.\n\nHowever, as long as you don't live at one of the poles you can see some stars in the other hemisphere - just not all of them.

question_title: what is guano, what was it mined for and what is its uses? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: guano is concentrated uric acid crystals (and other nitrogen wastes) of usually BIRDS, but bats too.  It is the white stuff seen on rocks where lots of birds hang out. Very concentrated and smells real strong. It is not bird poop.  It is CONCENTRATED urinary system wastes like our urine, but these organisms need to conserve and reabsorb excretory system water to prevent deydration and to help them weigh less when flying (so as to not store it in a bladder that is too heavy when they're taking off, landing,flying!) and so they "excrete" concentrated, more solid excretory wastes.\n\nSince uric acid crystals have many mineral and organic molecules, they are used as fertilizer.

question_title: Does anyone believe in ghosts? or have u ever seen something paranormall? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For a start, this question doesn't blong in the physics section of this invaluable resource. \n\nsecondly why do people insist on labelling everything. Just because there isn't a hard-to-spell sciency word to describe something do we have to bring in the paranormal to explain it. Back in the dark ages when peasents saw lightening they thought it was the gods playing games or torturing them, but we quite happily believe nowadays that it is a discharge of static charge from the clouds. \n\nJust think in years to come when the flying saucers are explained the people of the future with their aluminium foil hats and flashy gadgets will think of us as idiots for thinking paranormal activities have ghostly ties.\n\nThere is no such things as ghosts because the term is meaningless. a better question is how can i explain this effect better. For example there are loads of unexplained happenings such as the infamous question of just who is voting for Tony Blair at every election, but we don't bring the paranormal in to explain that now do we???\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n\nThere is no such things as ghosts, just lazy physicists	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I was going to write this all out to explain it to you, but this website said exactly what I was going to say, but better and with more detail...\n\n"Base 60 (Sexagesimal) Numbering system\n\nThe Sumerian culture developed the Sexagesimal Numbering system some 4000 to 6000 years ago. This system was developed into a rigorous numbering system. The digits used were symbols which represented syllables instead of letters that were pressed into clay tablets. There were symbols representing ones and tens and were combined to represent the number of each place value.  See the following site for more information about the Sumerian numbering system. http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/index.html\n\nEach place value to the left is equal to 60 times the place value to the right which implies that each place value to the right is equal to the place value to the left divided by 60. It was up to the context of the number to determine where the place values began. Also, the place values may be fractions of base 60 numbers, ie. 1/60, 1/3600, etc.\n\n3600, 60, 1, 1/60, 1/3600 \n\nThe use of 60 as a grouping number was used by many cultures throughout our earth's history. This may be because 60 has many factors, including 12 (which also has many factors) and was convenient to use for trading, counting, etc. because of its divisibility. Our notations of time into 60 seconds and 60 minutes uses a from of this numbering system, but is not as rigorous because of the 24 for hours and the subdivisions of seconds into milliseconds, etc."	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is the meaning of biosphere reserve? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Background and context\n\nBiosphere reserves are areas nominated by national governments and designated under the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Since 1976, UNESCO has designated 356 members of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 90 countries. These include 13 National Nature Reserves (NNRs) in the UK, designated in 1976/77.\n\nAs the intended functions of biosphere reserves have evolved considerably since the late 1970s, many biosphere reserves designated then do not match the current criteria well. These criteria are incorporated in "The Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves" (the Statutory Framework), adopted by the General Assembly of UNESCO in 1995.\n\nArticle 9 of the Statutory Framework requires concerned authorities to submit a report on the status of biosphere reserves under their jurisdiction to the MAB Secretariat every ten years. In 1997, UNESCO requested the UK government to submit such a report with respect to all UK biosphere reserves. To date, the UK government has not submitted this report to UNESCO. This delay is regarded as constructive by the International Advisory Committee for Biosphere Reserves, which recognises the need for governments to undertake thorough reviews of biosphere reserves under their jurisdiction.\n\nObjectives of the study\n\nThis study considers the application of the criteria defined in the Statutory Framework with respect to the UK. Two main objectives were defined in the terms of reference:\n\n   1. to consider the concepts supporting biosphere reserves and provide advice on their relevance and value in the light of other designations across the UK;\n   2. to determine if there is any real wildlife gain (i.e., benefits to wildlife) to be achieved by adopting the designation in the UK and, if so, under what circumstances.\n\nFollowing discussion with DETR, the report takes a wider view of the benefits of biosphere reserves as "sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale", as defined in the Statutory Framework.\n\nEvolution of the biosphere reserve concept\n\nBiosphere reserves have three characteristics that, at least in principle, differentiate them from other ‘protected areas’: they are part of an international network of sites designated by UNESCO, rather than by national governments; their outer boundary is flexible, rather than being legally defined; and the land and water they contain is administered and managed by more than one agency or owner. In fact, only the first of these characteristics defines all biosphere reserves. According to the criteria in the Statutory Framework, they should have three zones: a legally constituted core area(s) devoted to long-term protection, according to the conservation objectives of the biosphere reserve, and of sufficient size to meet these objectives; a buffer zone(s) clearly identified and surrounding or contiguous to the core area or areas, where only activities compatible with the conservation objectives can take place; and an outer transition area where sustainable resource management practices are promoted and developed.\n\nThis scheme has evolved over three decades, reflecting both experiences of practical application and wider trends in the fields of conservation and resource management, particularly the evolution of the concept of sustainable development and the growing recognition of the need to involve local people in the management of protected areas. The emphasis of the biosphere reserve concept has shifted from the promotion of conservation, science, and education to the notion of "sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale" within a global network providing unique opportunities for exchanges of experience and collaborativ	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes anxziety? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The following are all believed to play a role in the occurrence of anxiety disorders:\n\nheredity \nbrain chemistry \npersonality \nlife experiences \nHeredity and anxiety disorders:\nThere is clear evidence that anxiety disorders run in families. Studies show that if one identical twin has an anxiety disorder, the second twin is more likely to have an anxiety disorder than non-identical (fraternal) twins. These findings suggest that a genetic factor, possibly activated in combination with life experiences, predisposes some people to these disorders.\n\nBrain chemistry and anxiety disorders:\nBecause symptoms of anxiety disorders are often relieved by medications that alter levels of chemicals in the brain, scientists believe that brain chemistry appears to play a role in the onset of anxiety disorders.\n\nPersonality and anxiety disorders:\nResearchers believe that personality may play a role in the development of an anxiety disorder, noting that people who have low self-esteem and poor coping skills may be more prone. Conversely, an anxiety disorder that begins in childhood may itself contribute to the development of low self-esteem.\n\nLife experiences and anxiety disorders:\nResearchers believe that the relationship between anxiety disorders and long-term exposure to abuse, violence, or poverty is an important area for further study, as life experiences may affect an individual's susceptibility to these disorders.

question_title: how to use a punett square? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A Punnett Square, for those unaware, is the box used for determing allel (trait) combination in genetics.  A 2x2 box is the most commonly seen.  I'll use this as my example:\nDraw a square. Inside, draw a plus sign, so that you get 4 identical squares inside the larger square.\nNow, we need two 'breeders.'  Let's say Dad has brown hair, with resessive blond; Bb.  Mom is the same way; Bb.\nAt the top of the square, write Dad's alleles (the big and little 'b')...one per column.  On the left side, place Mom's alleles...one per row.\nNow, multiply.\nIn the four squares, you should end up with the following:\n1 BB\n2 Bb\n1 bb\n\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that if Mom and Dad have 4 kids, the odds are they will have 3 with brown hair and one blond.  (Hopefully Dad understands recessive alleles, or Mom might have some explaning to do.)\n\nWill every 4th kid be blond?  No.  But, each kid will have a 1 in 4 chance of being blond, and 3 in 4 chance of being brunette.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: can you give me examples of z test and t test.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "z-test" usually refers to normal distribution.

In practical terms, it means that ,for sample sizes below 100 you use t and for larger samples you use normal	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is preparative thin layer chromatography? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: its a method of seperating individual molecules from a compound by placing samples on a special sheet coated with a material that will allow the molecules to seperate easily.  Then you put the place with samples in a developing chamber that will pull the molecules apart based on polarity.  That's not the best description in scientific terms, but that's pretty much how it works.  You just compare the distance each molecule traveled with the distance known molecules would travel in the same situation and it gives you a pretty good indicator as to what the unknown compound is composed of.

question_title: If molar extinction coefficient is unknown, can concentration still be found in grams rather than moles? [SEP] question_content: Only the absorbance is known (as wel as l) [SEP] best_answer: A=E*d*C\n\n(d=length of the path of the light through the solution)\n\nIf you have only one value of absorbance then obviously there is no way of determining the concentration without the molar extiction coefficient (E).\n\nIn practice even if you know E, you don't use it to find the unknown concentration. Instead you measure the A of standard solutions and do a standard curve. From the equation of that curve (which you find using linear regression) and the value of A of your sample you calculate the unknown amount. \nThe standard curve doesn't need to be A vs mole/lt. It can be A vs anything e.g. g/ml, mg/ml, ppm or even just g, mole, etc. the only thing that changes is what the slope represents.\nFor example for A vs mole/lt the slope corresponds to E*d, for A vs g/lt the slope corresponds to E*d/MW, etc.\n\nIf you  always have the same volume of sample you can do the curve A vs grams directly. Then if V is the volume of the sample, the slope corresponds to E*d*V/MW\n\nEven if your standard curve is expressed in moles/lt you can convert it to grams. You just need the MW of the compound and the volume, not E...	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Taking Amitriptyline and Citalopram (Celexa) at the same time? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend is on Citalopram, and my doctor perscribed me Amitriptyline for sleep (which doesn't work..), but my doctor told me to make sure that she didn't take any Amitriptyline with Citalopram.  We were just wondering why, and what would happen if she did.  I know they are both anti-depressants, I just want to know what exactly will happen.  Also, wanted to know what will happen if she took that with Xanax, but the other question is more important. [SEP] best_answer: The drug literature that the FDA required the manufacture of Celexa to print stated that using Celexia with TCA's (of which amitriptyline is one of that class) should be done with caution.\n\nThere are several reasons for this, and I only mention a few:\n\nThe only drug interaction test done between Celexia was with another TCA given in a single dose, to see if it affected the blood levels of Celexia. It may take several weeks of taking both drugs together for the full effects of changes in blood levels of either drug to be fully known.\n\nThere is no reason to prescibe drugs with common goals, as antidepressants (since the primary use of Amitriptyline is to treat depression, even though side effects of drowsiness sometime promote its use as a sleep aid)\n\nThere are possible additive effects to the side effects of dry mouth, sexual, and impared mental function that would serve no useful purpose.\n\nIf she did develop an unusual condition the doctor would not know which drug was causing it or if it was a drug interaction, or whatever. It makes the job of the doctor more difficult to determine what to do.\n\nAlso, in some people, amitriptyline can cause heart problems, (a good reason to keep the bottle well away from children, and with a safety cap).\n\n\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020822s29lbl.pdf	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what are bees doing in the winter time ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bees stay in their hives. Some die of course but more are produced to replace them. The worker bees exercise their wings and bodies to create enough heat to keep themselves and the queen warm enough to survive.These worker bees consume part of the honey in the nest to replace the energy lost by their activities in grooming the queen, caring for the larvae and keeping warm. They stay very close to the hive during winters.\n\nThis is why beekeepers never remove all the honey from a hive. Honey is the bees' method of laying in a food supply. A very long or very cold winter can kill a lot of the worker bees. The remainder will remain close to the queen to keep her and the larvae alive until the weather warms.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is homology? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Homology is a specific explanation of similarity of form seen in the biological world. Similarities can often be explained by common descent; features are considered homologous if they are shown to be inherited from a common ancestor. For example, although the arms of four-limbed vertebrates externally appear quite different, all have the same basic underlying skeletal and muscular pattern. Such shared patterns are best explained by the inference that they were inherited from a common ancestor that also had this pattern. Proposed homologies are evaluated using comparative anatomy, genetics, development, and behavior.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Did Sir Isaac Newton learn the secrets of gravity through his personal apprentice Rory Emerald? [SEP] question_content: Is this actually a fact or merely an opinion? What kind of relationship did Sir Isaac Newton have with Rory Emerald? Please tell me what you think? Isn't Emerald's discoveries just as important as Newton's? Thank You! [SEP] best_answer: Through a wild set of circumstances that took place in Beverly Hills, California, rumors started spreading that Rory Emerald, the famed celebrity, had aided Isaac Newton in his discovery of gravity.  It all started when a former silent film star, Fig Newton, started wandering the streets of Los Angeles, claiming to be a descendant of the famed scientist.  His delusions were met with skepticism, and he was finally institutionalized. Rory Emerald was doing some background research on his upcoming audition as “Frankie” for “Beach Blanket Bingo” and naturally went to the Sunnyville Mental Institution to interview psychiatric patients.  Rory Emerald was enchanted with Fig Newton and his claims.  After several months of continuous questioning, Rory Emerald began to realize that Fig Newton was not delusional - he was indeed a descendant of the famed scientist.  It all fit after painstaking research. \n\n It was then that Rory Emerald starting corresponding with Oxford University in England to discuss his findings.  He was amazed by his discovery, and anxious to share it with the scientific world.  Somehow, scientists at Oxford misinterpreted Rory’s letters and thought he was claiming to be an apprentice of Isaac Newton, and had come forward in time through a time machine to teach modern science.   Several scientists flew to Los Angeles immediately to meet the weary time traveler. These scientists held press conferences upon their arrival in the Golden State.  The media was shocked to discover that the man who assisted in the landmark discovery of gravity resided in their city in the year 1965.  They believed what they were told by the prestigious Oxford professors, and the news spread like wildfire throughout the city and the world.  \n\nRory Emerald was shocked to discover his name on the front pages of Variety, along with a full story of his time travel.  How did the story get so convoluted?  He was further appalled to learn that he was somehow involved with the discovery of gravity.  When he met the scientists from Oxford, they were naturally embarrassed by the actual story and pleaded with Rory Emerald to go along with them.  They taught him all of the correct scientific jargon and physics of gravity, and even designed a small bogus time machine made from a used dumpster, which appeared authentic.  Their sinister actions, along with Rory Emerald’s naïve compliance, started the biggest hoax perpetrated on the scientific world.  It was only 11 years later, when the hoax was exposed by a dying Oxford delegate.  By this time, Rory Emerald’s bizarre antics were accepted and he took very little flak over this indiscretion.  For the previous decade, Rory Emerald had basked in the role as “the Gravity Guru” and shamelessly exploited his fame to have many sexual encounters.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the effect of soapy water on plants? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If, in a drought crisis, you no longer have\nfresh water to irrigate outdoor plantings, can you\nuse dishwater, bathwater or laundry water\nwithout hurting the plants? \n\nYes, if you use\nreasonable care.\n\nBut, first, a warning: Household wash\nwater-also called "graywater"-contains food\nresidues and other organic matter that may attract\ninsects and rodents. It also may contain bacteria\nand viruses that could cause illness. Public health\nofficials have indicated that it may be used for\nhome irrigation-but only in localities where no\nother water is available for that purpose.\n\nHere are some guidelines: \n\n(1) The safest\nhousehold use of "graywater" is to flush toilets.\n(Don't put it in the tank; pour it directly into the\nbowl.) \n(2) Don't let it touch the edible parts of\nplants. \n(3) Use it only as a temporary measure\nduring a water shortage crisis.\nIn any case, check with your local health and\nbuilding officials before making any use of\n"graywater."\n\nEffects on plants\n\nHousehold wash water is much better for\nplants than no water at all, but there are possible\nproblems. If your home does not have a water\nsoftener, your bathwater and rinse water from\ndishes and laundry are all of good quality for\nirrigation. Soapy wash water from dishes and\nlaundry might better be saved to flush the toilet,\nbut can be used for irrigation if you're careful\nabout certain possible problems. \n\nSee the link below for additional information.

I could swear i did it right, but i dont whats wrong [SEP] best_answer: First use that\ntan^-1(x)=x-(1/3)x^3+(1/5)x^5-+...\nand\nsin(x)=x-(1/6)x^3+(1/120)x^5-+...\n\nPlug in x^7 for x in these to get\ntan^-1(x^7)=x^7-(1/3)x^21+-..\nand\nsin(x^7)=x^7-(1/6)x^21+-...\n\nThen add the two and integrate term by term. When you plug in .4 and subtract what you get when you plug in 0 (which should be 0), you will get your answer.\n\nThe error from stopping at some term will be less than the value of the next term. Since .4^21 is about 4*10^(-9), you will only need the first term to get 5 decimal places of accuracy. I get .00041 for the answer, but check this.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Which is heavier: a kilogram of feathers or a kilogram of lead? [SEP] question_content: Actually I wonder which is heavier: a kilogram of butter or a kilogram of lead?  Explain the solution if you had to demonstrate to your friends arbitrarily say in a middle of the New York City’s Central Park. \nRough ideas are accepted, but please be gentle. \nYou may check this site for information:\nhttp://hypertextbook.com/physics/matter/density/ [SEP] best_answer: If you asked a scientist you might get a different answer than if you asked a layman.  Let's compare a kilogram of lead with a kilogram of aluminum.  You likely would use the same scale to measure both samples.  But, the aluminum is much lighter and would take up far more space than the lead.  The samples would displace different amounts of air and the buoyancy of air would affect the scale readings by a small amount.  Therefore to obtain accurate measurements you must weigh the samples in a vacuum or calculate the buoyancy and compensate the weight measurements.  If this is true for lead and aluminum it is even more true for lead and feathers (or even lead and butter).  Chemists often do have to compensate for air buoyancy when measuring chemicals so that when they react none are left over.	Science & Mathematics

I take atenolol, but it doesn't seem to do much.  Does anyone have any favorite medicine to control them or sleep through them? [SEP] best_answer: Those doctors aren't very helpful sometimes, are they?  (  :\n\nYou're certainly not alone.  If it's serious enough that you can't sleep, then that in itself can be a real problem.  There are medications that MIGHT help, such as beta blockers (like propranolol and metoprolol), but these all have a bunch of other effects which it would be better to avoid if you can.\n\nSo you might want to try some lifestyle changes.  Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exercise can all be triggers that increase the frequency of your arrythmias.  Unfortunately, so can stress - so worrying about whether you can get to sleep will unfortunately only make it harder to get to sleep!\n\nDeep breathing will help you relax, and some people report that magnesium, calcium, and fish oil supplements can help too.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.

question_title: physics question help please!!!!!? [SEP] question_content: will the acceleration of a car be the same when the car travels around a sharp curve at a constant 60km/h as when it travels around a gentlecurve at the same speed? explain \n\nPLEASE!! [SEP] best_answer: Firstly, let me point out to you which answers are wrong and which answers are right. Otherwise you'll be just as confused as you were to begin with.\n\nThe first answer is confused. The second and third answers have no idea of what their talking about. The other answers are correct.\n\nHere's why the first answer is confused:\n\nSpeed and velocity use exactly the same units. \nSo it is perfectly acceptable to say "a car travels around a sharp curve a 60 km/hr". \n\nRestated, what we are saying is that the car moves around a curve at constant speed of 60 km/hr. The statement above does not include directional information. \n\n(However, suppose we said "a car travels around a sharp curve with constant velocity of 60 km/hr". Then, clearly this would be wrong. Velocity does change as it goes around the curve.)\n\nSecondly, let us recall some basic facts of 'Uniform Circular Motion' \nAn object that travels with Uniform Circular Motion has:\n- constant speed \n- changing velocity  \n- acceleration towards the centre\n\nNow, the car in question displays uniform circular motion. This is so even though we are considering a partial circular path.\n\nSo, we can use this import formula (you should memorise it) \n\n    ar = v ^2 /r\n\nThis relates the centripetal acceleration, ar, to the radius of the circle (or in the case of a partial circle, the radius of curvature), r.\n\nFrom the formula you can see that a sharp bend, i.e. a small r, will give a larger value of centripetal acceleration compared to a gentle bend, i.e a large r. \n\nSubstitute v=60 and different values of r into the formula above to verify this.

question_title: tricks for quickly inserting iv lines in ambulatory setting? [SEP] question_content: I'm starting a job at an amb. suregery center in a hospital, where every pt requires an iv. I usuallyenter the vein alright and get blood flashback, but have trouble advancing the catheter and frequently blow the vein.  I'm often able to float the catheter using the iv solution  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? [SEP] best_answer: Starting IV's is an acquired skill that can take a while to really get the hang of. As a medic I have seen many different approaches to getting the stick on the first try. Allot of problems I see when people can't advance the catheter is because it isn't in the vein all the way. After you get flash in the angio chamber drop your angle and advance the catheter just alittle further. Then try advancing it. This will ensure that the catheter is in all the way. Another trick is to not hit the vein from the top. You can try a slight angle and hit it from the side. This will help with troublesome veins that roll on you. Hope this helps.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the proof of the big bang theory??? [SEP] question_content: How do you prove it actually happened or is it like a religion, and something you must have blind faith in? [SEP] best_answer: There is no actual proof as such although the evidence to support the theory is pretty convincing. The first piece of evidence is that the universe is observed to be expanding. Galaxies are observed to be receding from us. This is determined by the shift in their light to the red end of the visible spectrum. It's an effect you can hear with sound; as a vehicle approaches you blowing its horn you will hear the pitch of the sound change from high to low as it then travels away from you. It's called the Doppler effect. It aslo happens with light, only light changes colour from blue (coming towards you) to red (going away from you). The lightwaves are compressed and stretched just like sound.\n\nSince galaxies are moving away from us they must have been concentrated at one point in the distant past. That the singularity of the Big Bang.\n\nThe other piece of evidence is the background radiation of heat left over from the Big Bang. This was predicted to exist by proponents of the Big Bang, and was discovered accidentally in 1963. It's the leftovers of the tremendous heat generated by the explosion, and is 2.93 degrees above absolute zero.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: how many kwh/m2 can solar  cell generate and how much is the cost of one square meter  of it [SEP] best_answer: in North America the average power of the solar radiation lies somewhere between 125 and 375 W/m², between 3 and 9 kWh/m²/day. [3]\n\nIt should be noted that this is the maximum available power, and not the power delivered by solar power technology. For example photovoltaic panels currently have an efficiency of ca. 15% and, hence, a solar panel delivers 19 to 56 W/m² or 0.45-1.35 kWh/m²/day (annual day and night average).\n\n\nGaAs multijunction devices are the most efficient solar cells to date, reaching as high as 39% efficiency[9]. They are also some of the most expensive cells per unit area (up to US$40/cm2).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Weird science question, coming up!? [SEP] question_content: okay if you have a human egg and a animal sperm can the human have a baby? and vice versa? Don't worry I'm not going to try it or anything it's just someone told me it was possible once. [SEP] best_answer: An unfertilized egg and a sperm each contain one half of a parents DNA.  The whole DNA is like a set of helical twisted ladders and the ladders are split down the rungs.  For conception to occur, the sperm and egg contributors must have the same number and length of ladder sections (similar genes) to be combined into new and unique human ladders, unlike either parent.  For example, a frog has far more genes than a human even though they are much smaller creatures.  That is the main reason it is impossible for a Princess to kiss a frog and make a Prince.  DNA must keep that within the realm of fairy tales <G>.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: why organisms of the same specie can be different from one to another? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Mutation generates differences.  Most mutations are deleterious and natural selection tends to eliminate them quickly.  Many are neutral and are retained to some degree because there's nothing weeding them out.  A few are positive and variation is also lost in that case because selection will eliminate the other variations.\n\nThere is a process called frequency dependent selection whereby a trait is advantageous but only if its rare.  For example since hosts adapt to a certain kind of parasite, it is advantageous for a parasite to have rare characteristics.  That way the host is unlikely to have seen that model before and the parasite is likely to be successful.  In that case selection actually favors a lot of versions in a species because as soon as anything become really numerous it becomes deleterious.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How does gravity effect the period of a spring? [SEP] question_content: ok: you have a spring attached to the wall and resting horizontally on a table with a block attached. when you pull the block away and let it go, it undergoes simple harmonic motion.\nNow imagine you move this apparatus to mars, with 1/2 the gravity of earth\nwhat happens to the period of oscillation of the box? [SEP] best_answer: Assuming their is no frictional drag between the table and the block, the only interaction here is between the block (a mass), and the spring, and neither knows nor cares whether they are on Earth, on Mars, or in middle space. The block is a mass to be moved by the restorative force of the stretched or compressed spring, and the spring's restoration force does not depend on where it is, nor does the mass of the block change with location. So the period of motion will remain the same. If this were a problem of vertical motion where the block was being lifted against the force of gravity, then the problem would be different.

question_title: Which came first the DNA or the RNA? [SEP] question_content: The DNA is needed for protein synthesis, and the RNA is much shorter than DNA so it must have been created first. Please help, my profs. won't tell me the answer, they just smile. [SEP] best_answer: DNA, RNA, PNA; stepping backwards in time\n\nAll life on earth appears to share the same origins; except for a few very simple forms,  the business of replication is currently coded on the famous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule, a genotype of great length,  but surprisingly simple structure. The work of transforming the information stored in DNA into the machinery of life is currently carried out by various forms of ribonucleic acid, RNA.   We try to find answers to the mystery of how this all came about by asking questions:\n\nRibonucleic Acid - RNA and its precursors\n\nQ) When did DNA enter the picture and under what chemical circumstances did it develop? \n\nA) There is considerable evidence that there was a period of time on Earth called the RNA world. In this world life existed as RNA as both phenotype and genotype. The RNA life form could have been a single naked strand, a collection of RNAs or RNA accompanied by a suite of cofactors (e.g. peptides, membranes, mineral surfaces, etc.). This process has not yet been fully elaborated, but is at the heart of the field of molecular biology and chemistry. \n\nThe reasons it is believed that there was an RNA world is summarized by NSCORT's Gerald Joyce in the journal Nature, Vol. 338 (1989) pp. 217-224. But it boils down to the following seven reasons: \n\nRNA has a template structure (i.e. Watson/Crick). \nRNA has catalytic properties (the ribozymes of Cech and many others). \nRNA appears in various presumably ancient cellular processes (i.e. ribosome, primer for DNA, etc.). \nRibonucleotides are components of many coenzymes (e.g. CoA, NADH, etc.). \nThe biosynthesis of histidine is uses ATP and PRPP. \nThe biosynthesis of deoxynucleotides is from ribonucleotide diphosphates. \nThe biosynthesis of dTMP is from dUMP. \nSince the RNA in the RNA world is alive, it is assumed that RNA evolved into DNA through some sort of genetic takeover event. In other words, RNA enzymes made DNA, which replaced it in the genome. Proteins were added into the mix at some point. This has never been explained in detail. \n\nThe problem is where did RNA come from? It is a VERY complex and delicate molecule. Some of the problems with RNA are discussed by Antonio Lazcano and Stanley Miller in the journal Cell, Vol. 85 (1996) pp. 793-798. In short, here is the problem: \n\n Ribose is hard to make prebiotically, is in equilibrium with the various anomeric forms, has numerous chiral centers, and decomposes very fast. \n It is very hard to make nucleosides prebiotically. \n It is very hard to prebiotically phosphorylate things (nucleosides). \n It is hard to polymerize activated NTPs with information and reasonable fidelity in a 3’-5’ manner (2’-5’ is more favorable). \n\nIt has thus been assumed that there was a much simpler informational macromolecule than RNA. It has been dubbed preRNA (or pre-RNA). This molecule may have been achiral and may have used bases other than AUGC. An example of an alternative backbone is PNA (P.E. Nielsen (1993) Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere 23:323-327.) Some alternative bases are described by M.P. Robertson and S.L. Miller (1995) Science 268:702-705 and V.M. Kolb, J.P. Dworkin, and S.L. Miller (1994) Journal of Molecular Evolution 38:549-557. PreRNA is alive and its enzymes (prenozymes?) would be able to make the RNA which would replace it. The preRNA may have assembled from the prebiotic environment, or there may have been pre-preRNA around to help. \n\nNow, why couldn’t DNA have been made by preRNA? The 5 of the 7 reasons for the RNA world listed above are based on MODERN biochemistry and reasons 1 and 2 apply to DNA as well as to RNA. Much happened between the origin of life and the last common ancestor, and it is hard to accept extrapolations across such an immense time span.  There are some chemical reasons 2-deoxyribose might be a more likely candidate than ribose as well. \n\nThus to finally answer the question, DNA entered the sc	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does the reversal of the Sun's magnetic field have any effect on the Earth? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Sun has a roughly 11-year sunspot cycle, however, with the ending of each cycle, the polarity of the Sun's magnetic field reverses so that the North magnetic pole becomes the South and vice versa. Every 22 years we end up with the polarity returned to its 'previous' state. There have been many studies of what happens to Earth's weather when these flips occur, but to my knowledge, there has been no conclusive evidence that polarity reversal does much of anything. \nhowever for a given hemisphere, the overall magnetic polarity does not return to its previous polarity for 22 years; the Hale Cycle. It takes the Sun 22 years for the polarity in a given hemisphere to return to the same state.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nGood Luck.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: how many times must the first cell divide in order to form a human? [SEP] question_content: By my calculations, if there are 10 billion cells in the body, then the origional fertalized egg must divide, and then each of the 2 divide etc. But only 35 or so generations should be sufficient to produce 10 billion cells. Averaging pregnancy at 270 days, each cell generation must double itself around every 10 days. This to me seems to be wrong, Anything i am not taking into account? [SEP] best_answer: The first cell "must" divide only once but "may" divide almost without end during the life of a creature.  When the first cell divides its DNA splits like cutting the rungs of several (helical) ladders (genes) and each ladder half then regenerates its missing half in the new cells.  After the split, which is the original cell?  If one of the two "new" cells died prematurely, the remaining cell would likely carry on.  After only a few cell divisions, cells differentiate and become specialized and no longer are capable of producing all the tissue types required.  The original cell is lost for practical purposes.

question_title: when you boil water, why dont all of the bubbles boil out before all of the water is gone? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The bubbles are actually bubbles of steam, not air.  Because of tiny bumps on the bottom of the pan, there are spots where the water gets hotter than in other spots, and it turns to steam bubbles.  These bubbles collect together and float up to the surface, where they "pop" and actually cool the water down a tiny bit.  This cooler (less hot) water sinks to the bottom, gets heated up into steam again, bubbles form, and so on.  So the bubbles won't boil out before the water is gone, because it's the water itself that's making the bubbles.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: > What is the Biological Basis of Consciousness? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: MATTER: THE OTHER NAME FOR ILLUSION\n\nIT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT THE WORLD COMES INTO EXISTENCE IN OUR BRAINS\n\nWe acknowledge that all the individual features of the world are experienced through our sense organs. The information that reaches us through those organs is converted into electrical signals, and the individual parts of our brain analyze and process these signals. After this interpreting process takes place inside our brain, we will, for example, see a book, taste a strawberry, smell a flower, feel the texture of a silk fabric or hear leaves shaking in the wind. \nWe have been taught that we are touching the cloth outside of our body, reading a book that is 30 cm (1 ft) away from us, smelling the trees that are far away from us, or hearing the shaking of the leaves that are far above us. However, this is all in our imagination. All of these things are happening within our brains. \nAt this point we encounter another surprising fact; that there are, in fact, no colors, voices or visions within our brain. All that can be found in our brains are electrical signals. This is not a philosophical speculation. This is simply a scientific description of the functions of our perceptions. In her book Mapping The Mind, Rita Carter explains the way we perceive the world as follows:\n\nEach one [of the sense organs] is intricately adapted to deal with its own type of stimulus: molecules, waves or vibrations. But the answer does not lie here, because despite their wonderful variety, each organ does essentially the same job: it translates its particular type of stimulus into electrical pulses. A pulse is a pulse is a pulse. It is not the colour red, or the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth—it is a bit of electrical energy. Indeed, rather than discriminating one type of sensory input from another, the sense organs actually make them more alike. \nAll sensory stimuli, then enter the brain in more or less undifferentiated form as a stream of electrical pulses created by neurons firing, domino-fashion, along a certain route. This is all that happens. There is no reverse transformer that at some stage turns this electrical activity back into light waves or molecules. What makes one stream into vision and another into smell depends, rather, on which neurons are stimulated.1 \n\nIn other words, all of our feelings and perceptions about the world (smells, visions, tastes etc.) are comprised of the same material, that is, electrical signals. Moreover, our brain is what makes these signals meaningful for us, and interprets these signals as senses of smell, taste, vision, sound or touch. It is a stunning fact that the brain, which is made of wet meat, can know which electrical signal should be interpreted as smell and which one as vision, and can convert the same material into different senses and feelings.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Licking River\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia >>\n\nThe Licking River is formed at Newark in Licking County by the confluence of its north and south forks:\n\nThe North Fork Licking River, about 35 mi (55 km) long, rises in southwestern Morrow County and initially flows generally east-southeastwardly through Knox County, past Centerburg, into Licking County, where at Utica it turns southwardly and flows past St. Louisville. In Licking County the North Fork collects the Otter Fork Licking River, which rises in Knox County and flows past Hartford; the Lake Fork Licking River; and the Clear Fork Licking River. The Lake and Clear forks both flow for their entire lengths in Licking County. \n\nThe South Fork Licking River, about 30 mi (50 km) long, rises in southwestern Licking County and initially flows southeastwardly past Pataskala and Kirkersville and briefly enters Fairfield County, where it turns northeastwardly back into Licking County and flows past Heath.

question_title: Why do certain types of paper turn yellow faster than others? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Paper is made from wood, which is made up mainly of white cellulose. Wood also has a lot of a dark substance in it called lignin, which ends up in the paper, too, along with the cellulose. The exposure of lignin to air and sunlight is what turns paper yellow.\n\nLignin makes wood stiff and trees stand upright. You could say it acts as a glue to bind the cellulose fibers together. It is a polymer, a substance that is formed by the joining of simpler molecules into giant molecules that act differently than the smaller molecules did. Dr. Hou-Min Chang, a professor of wood and paper science at N.C. State University in Raleigh, N.C., compares lignin to the concrete used in buildings, with cellulose as the steel frame. Without lignin, Chang says, a tree could only grow to be about 6 feet tall. Lignin also helps protect the wood from pests and other damage.\n\nNewsprint, which must be produced as economically as possible, has more lignin in it than finer papers. At the mill, the wood that will be turned into newsprint is ground up, lignin and all.\n\nPaper manufacturers utilize the benefits of lignin in some types of paper, though. Brown kraft paper, the dark brown paper used in grocery store bags, and cardboard are stiff and sturdy because they have more lignin in them, and because those kinds of paper aren't treated with bleaching chemicals. It doesn't matter how dark they are because the printing on them is limited.\n\nTo make a fine white paper, the mill puts the wood through a chemical solvent process, which separates and discards the lignin. Pure cellulose is white, and the paper made from it will be white and will resist yellowing.\n\nLignin eventually turns paper yellow because of oxidation. That is, the lignin molecules, when exposed to oxygen in the air, begin to change and become less stable. The lignin will absorb more light, giving off a darker color. Chang says that if newsprint were kept completely out of sunlight and air, it would remain white. After only a few hours of sunlight and oxygen, however, it will start to change color.

Since the condition is the same as the first one, in the second wire also there will be n number of charges flowing through it. \n\nThus if the area of cross section is doubled current is increased or resistance is decreased.\n\nIn a high way there is a bridge which is very narrow; the flow of vehicles will be less.\nIf the bridge is broadened the flow will increase.\n\nHowever the above is an analogy to make the concept some what to understand. But the charge in a wire is different from the vehicle flow.  \n\n\n\n.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does  a gallon of milk weigh more than a gallon of water? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: OH MY !!!\n\nPlease, don't believe the first answer.\n\nA gallon is a volume (physical size)...NOT a weight !\n\nSo, THE ANSWER IS YES, a gallon of milk DOES weigh more than a gallon of water...and this IS because it's density is higher.\n\n(Eg...a gallon of molten steel is heavier than a gallon of water...because it is more dense).\n\n(Eg...a bucket full of molten lead is heavier than a bucket full of pure oxygen...because it is more dense).\n\nCheck out the following link for a really good explanation !\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how does fertilization happen? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The capacitated spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. In mammals, binding of the spermatozoon to the zona pellucida, an extracellular layer surrounding the oocyte, initiates the acrosome reaction. This process releases the enzyme hyaluronidase, which digests the matrix of hyaluronic acid in the vestments surrounding the oocyte. Fusion between the sperm and oocyte plasma membranes follows, allowing the entry of the sperm nucleus, mitochondria, centriole and flagellum into the oocyte. Once the ovum fuses with a single sperm cell, its cell membrane changes, preventing fusion with other sperm.\n\nThis process ultimately leads to the formation of a diploid cell called a zygote. When the zygote reaches the uterus and implants in the endometrium, the female is said to be pregnant.\n\nIf fertilisation takes place, the sperm usually meet the ovum in the fallopian tube, requiring the sperm cells to swim from the upper vagina through the cervix and across the length of the uterus before reaching the fallopian tube—a considerable distance compared to the size of the sperm cell.\n\n\nFertilization in plants\n\nAfter the pistil is pollinated, the pollen grain germinates in a response to a sugary fluid secreted by the mature stigma. From each pollen grain, a pollen tube grows out attempting to travel into the ovary by creating a path. The vegetative and generative nuclei of the pollen grain pass into its respective pollen tube. The growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the vegetative nucleus. Enzymes are secreted to digest the tissue of the stigma a style as the polen tube grows. The pollen tube does not directly reach the ovary in a straight line. It travels near the skin of the style and curls to the bottom of the ovary, then near the receptacle, it breaks through the ovule through the microphyle (an opening in the ovule wall) and reaches the ovum to fertilise it. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs. After being fertilised, the ovary starts to swell and becomes a fruit.\n\nWith multi-seeded fruits, multiple grains of pollen are necessary for syngamy with each ovule. The process is easy to visualise if one looks at maize silk, which is the female flower of corn. Pollen from the tassel (the male flower) falls on the sticky external portion of the silk, and then pollen tubes grow down the silk to the attached ovule. The dried silk remains inside the husk of the ear as the seeds mature; if one carefully removes the husk, the floral structures may be shown. The development of the flesh of the fruit is proportional to the percentage of fertilised ovules. For example, with watermelon, about a thousand grains of pollen must be delivered and spread evenly on the three lobes of the stigma to make a normal sized and shaped fruit.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Hell Creek Formation? [SEP] question_content: Where can I find maps of the Hell Creek Formation. Especially where it crosses into Montana [SEP] best_answer: Montana State University in Bozeman does a significant amount of research on the Hell Creek Formation through the Museum of the Rockies, and Dr. Jack Horner's work.  Makoshika State Park also encompasses portions of the Glendive area of the formation.  The state geologic map shows the surface area, and looking in the southeast corner of the map you'll see the intrusion stretching up from the South Dakota border through to Glendive, as well as the areas south of Miles City.  Hope that helps.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: If you have asthma will it affect your brain because the brain and heart work together? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you think the brain and the heart work together then all organs work together with the Brain.  Asthma is a respiratory disease where the bronchioles shrink and close off restricting the amount of air getting into the air sacs.  If you have a serious attack you will lose consciousness because of the lack of oxygen to your brain, but most medication can prevent this from happening.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is the world really running out of oil? [SEP] question_content: I understand what it does as far as pollution etc. but this is a huge world. Aren't there places that can't be harmed where there is oil to be gotten? [SEP] best_answer: Ok, maybe I would be a better person to ask this question since I actually work in the industry finding the stuff. Seems to me some people have made up they're own minds without much knowledge of the industry.\n\nAs one guy has pointed out, yes as it takes millions of years to from and the amount we have used thus far is greater than that being made naturally. \n\nHowever, what people fail to realise is that its the larger discoveries which for the past decade has been in decine due to the price of oil. As such, oil companies were reluctant to spend money in exploration because of the decreased profit they would make. Since Bush decided to invade Iraq, the oil price shot up and now exploration is booming. More discoveries are being made, and production is up.\n\nAlso as you have mentioned there are places which have yet to be discovered. I recently was working for a company which did an exploration well which they had been planning for 20 years! Long time planning if you ask me, but the reason it took so long was because the techonolgy avaliable was not around at the time to explore it. We can only explore within the capabilities of current techonolgy. Not only that there are vast areas of the world that have yet to even be siesmically survey'ed, for example the Pacific Ocean, big huge expanse of water, how long do you think it would take to map the sub surface geology?\n\nAs for your third part of your question, there is such a thing as extended reach drilling, where (as the name suggests) they drill long sections and could quite easily tap potential reservoirs without damaging sensitive environments. Such drilling goes on in the UK.\n\nAll in all no the oil is not running out, these next few years are going to see and peak in the production of oil since hte industry started.\n\nP.S. Removing the oil from the ground doesnt in any way shape or form cause volcanoes as the guy above me suggested, that is mearly ill' education!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: where can I find low-cost, compact, force transducers for simple laboratory experiment? [SEP] question_content: The transducers are needed for a high-school-level laboratory set-up/experiment.  I need 40 such transducers.  The required frequency response is very low: DC-5Hz.  The transducers need to be simple to operate. [SEP] best_answer: Various springs (flat or helical) deflect linearly with load and resistance of certain wires (nichrome, etc.) varies linearly with length.  If your experiment allows or expects large deflections you may be able to combine the spring/resistors into a circuit that calibrates force/deflection/resistance-reading suitable for measurement on an ohmmeter or perhaps a strip chart recorder.  Good luck.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is FIRE alive?...CLICK HERE for a very convincing argument.? [SEP] question_content: I seem to recall 3 requirements from Biology class to determine if something is 'alive.'\n\n(1)It breathes....fires can even shatter windows trying to get more oxygen.\n\n(2)It moves...fires clearly can consume entire forests by moving from tree to tree.\n\n(3)it reproduces...fires start with only a spark and seemingly have no limit to their size. [SEP] best_answer: No fire itself is not alive (it has no DNA/RNA, it does not perform metabolism, it does not reproduce via mitosis or meiosis, and it is not self sustaining), but fire is essential to life, and without the human abilty to contain and create fire - life as we know it would be quite different.

VERY low in fact.  Has anyone tried stratagene?  By the way, im using tRNA from liver tissue of guinea fowl. [SEP] best_answer: Yes I have worked with RNA before. The main difficulty with all of the procedures is making sure you have gotten rid of the RNAses. They are very tough and stable, so you have to make sure everything has RNAse inhibitors (DEPC). I dont know enought about guinea fowl to know if they use similar polyA tails that humans, etc do. If not, the oligo-dT resin wouldnt have much to bind to. I dont know what your goal is but you could consider a PCR strategy to amplify what you are looking for. If you are looking for some tissue expression, you could look into buying premade mRNA from a company, which we used successfully before. hope that helps!	Science & Mathematics

Prove that G has at least one element of order 5 and at least one subgroup of order 5.\n\n(2) Prove that a non-cyclic group of order 55 has at least one element of order 5 and at least one element of orfer 11. (I think this has something to do with the number of elements in G of a prime order being of the form m(p-1) where m>=0)\n\n\n\nHi guys,  am hoping someone can help me out with these questions for my honours algebra course (exam in 3 weeks!!!) I do have a vague answer sheet for them but I was hoping someone could explain them to me a bit better. Thanks very much. [SEP] best_answer: Both are results of the CAUCHY THEOREM which says that for any prime p and finite group G, if p||G|, then G contains an element of order p.  Now note that for any element a in any group G, {a^j| j is an integer} is ALWAYS a subgroup of G because for any element a^j, its inverse a^(-j) is in this subgroup, it contains the identity element (a^0), it's closed because a^ia^j = a^(i+j) and the integers are closed, and it inherits its associativity from G.  In this case, we have an element a of order p so that a^p = 1 and hence for all integers j, a^j = a^t for some nonnegative t < p.  This is because any integer j can be expressed as mp+r for some integer m and 0 <= r < p so that a^j = a^(mp+r) = a^(mp)a^r = (a^p)^m*a^r = 1^m*a^r = a^r.  Therefore this subgroup will contain the elements, 1,a,a^2,...,a^(p-1) and hence p elements as desired.	Science & Mathematics

Both are great forms of exercise but as several people have mentioned here running can be hard on the body. Cycling also has its down side. There can be loss of bloodflow to the pelvic region from sitting on seat for long periods of time. If you are going for weight loss the best thing to do would be both. Strictly focusing on one or the other will get your body into a routine and after a while you may stop seeing results. Doing both also gives you the option to do something else.	Sports

question_title: What is the quickest/safest/most efficient way to get rid of a small potbelly? [SEP] question_content: I drank/ate too much this winter and have a little belly. I love playing basketball but am interested in other ways I can get rid of my belly. Any ideas aside from diets? [SEP] best_answer: Cut your carbs, my man.  A small potbelly is indicative of a carb belly.  Lay off the beer, and switch to a no-calorie, no sugar vodka or alcoholic beverage.\n\nAs far as a diet change goes, drink lots of water, and be sure to eat breakfast.  You know that saying that it's the most important meal of the day?  Well, it's true.  Breakfast should be your largest meal, and dinner should be your smallest, as your food will not metabolize as quick at night.  Avoid eating after 7pm, too.\n\nAb crunches could help tone your stomach muscles as well, but first you need to lose the gut.\n\nEat sensiblely, and remember to drink a lot of water.  Water is going to help curb your appetite and flush your system.\n\nBest of luck!	Sports

[SEP] best_answer: Ok, the obvious first \n\nStone Cold during Wrestlemania 17 or X7 if you like to call it that.\n\nbut he won it that night so he didn't really change until after he won.\n\nMacho Man before WM 5 he was a face and became a heel so Hogan could win again.\n\nBret Hart during the WM 12 phase when he turned into a crybaby.\n\nThose were the really big ones.  If you are talking about WWF titles.  As for IC and stuff like that, most Champs stayed loyal to their side, it made for better champs.  Even Tag Teams.  Some teams became more popular.  Like the Road Warriors.  But that has more to do with the way they were, not a planned change.\n\nOne notable exception.  \n\nDemolition in the 1988 Survivor Series made the change to face when Mr. Fuji went with the Powers of Pain.\n\nHow is that???

question_title: what are the advantages of the thoroughbred horse? and what are some disadvantages? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on what you're going to use the horse for.  Thoroughbreds as a breed are the most athletic horses, and are great for hunter/jumper competitions.  They can be very good dressage horses, but because of their "hot" temperaments, they need a lot of patient work.  Also, if the Thoroughbred you're contemplating buying is a former racehorse, he/she may have soundness problems ranging from cracked or chipped bones to arthritis to torn ligaments or tendons.  Some of these things can be worked around, but some can't.  \n\nThe Thoroughbreds that I've known as riding horses have ranged from absolutely superb to borderline dangerous.  A lot depends on the quality of the training (or re-training, in the case of ex-racehorses) that they've had.  \n\nTo a very large degree, the kind of horse you want to have depends on what you want to do with it.  A good way to get an idea of the kind of horse you want is to look at horses that are doing what you want your horse to do, and see what kinds do well.\n\nA word to the wise:  a Thoroughbred can be a lot of horse to handle.  One of the quickest ways to get hurt, and hurt badly, around horses is to buy more horse than you can handle.  Horses absolutely do not care how well you think of your horsemanship skills.  A person can lie to other people and lie to themselves about how well they can handle a horse, but they can't lie to the horse.  Know your skill level and be honest about it when you're looking for a horse.  The most dangerous combination, an accident waiting to happen, is the unwary novice on a horse that's too much for his/her level of skill.	Sports
question_title: Howt o become a slugger? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no real answer to this, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, practice - a lot!  When you do, work on keeping your weight on your back foot, transfering that weight forward with a minimal amount of stride.  Keep your hands back (ie don't lead the swing with your hands), start the swing from the bottom up.  What I mean here is transfer the weight from the back foot to the front, rotate the hips sligtly, then bring the bat through the strike zone with a short, compact swing (with a slight upper cut - do not exaggerate this), your head will be the last thing to pull through, allowing you to watch the ball hit the bat.\n\nThe key to slugging, isn't necessarily how big you are - though, increasing your size in a healthy way would be beneficial.  It's more about having a quick bat through the strike zone - the faster the bat, the harder you will hit the ball.  This does not equate to taking a HUGE swing - it's just not needed.\n\nFinally, get yourself playing on a field that has dimensions that are favourable to you.  If you are a lefty, a short right field porch is beneficial, and conversely, a righty will want a short porch in left.\n\nThat's it.  Simple right?  No, but hopefully this is helpful.	Sports

question_title: Why not outlaw the intentional walk? [SEP] question_content: This is one of those excitement killers that will eventually kill baseball.

Besides, isn't it a lot more fun if your pitcher gets him out--achieving something rather than weaseling out of it? [SEP] best_answer: You're right....IW's are a copout...pitch to players like Bonds, Ortiz, and Ramirez....Let the pitcher prove his worth.  If they are that good, then face them and pitch.

A TB may reach its full height sooner, but the joints don't finish closing until around 5 or 6 years.  Lets face it, to race latter would require more years put in to the investment.

T-Mac has a better assist-to-turnover ratio and a few more blocks, while Pierce has been healthier and has more steals. They're comparable field goal shooters, but Pierce is a bit better from long-range and the free throw line, though he commits more fouls.\n\nThe statistical edge goes to T-Mac.

Take them to a college softball game or a good high school game. Tell them to watch the hitters. They will start to mimic the players. Also a good drill to do is to hit volleyballs or basketballs. This forces them to power through the ball. Then when they hit the softball it seems easy. It helps if you deflate the balls a little bit.	Sports

question_title: How much do soccer coaches earn at the UNiversity,High school and Elementary in the U.S.? [SEP] question_content: I'd like to know more about soccer coaches earnings? [SEP] best_answer: University coaches can make a range of salaries, but I would say that division 1 coaches can make at least 50,000.  In cases like UNC's Women's program (with such a winning tradition), I'd say that the number is even higher.  It depends on where in the US you're talking about as well, as the coasts probably pay more. \n\nAs a high school coach, I can tell you that it ranges from about 2000 to 3000 per season (varsity soccer coach).\n\nElementary coaches, which there are few of, because usually elementary schools don't have teams, are probably about the same as high school coaches, or might make a little less.\n\nThe coaches that make money at coaching youth soccer are the club coaches.  They are more specialized, can coach several age groups, and can charge anywhere from 200-2000 per kid per month.  Parents are paying for prestige, but mostly for results (winning teams, and quality players).	Sports
question_title: Who scored the winning goal for England against Germany in the 1966 world cup? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Geoff Hurst - From the Wikipedia entry on the subject.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_World_Cup_1966\n\n"After 12 minutes Helmut Haller had put West Germany ahead, but the score was levelled by Geoff Hurst four minutes later.\n...\nWith the score level at 2-2 at the end of 90 minutes, the game went to extra time. In the 98th minute Hurst found himself on the score sheet again; his shot hit the crossbar, bounced down onto the goal line, and then back into play and was controversially deemed to have crossed the line by the linesman and referee. In the last minute, it was Hurst again to easily sprint through the (then almost empty) German half and net his third, just as the gathered crowd invaded the pitch to celebrate with the team, thus cementing the victory for England. This made Geoff Hurst the only player ever to have scored three times in a World Cup Final."	Sports

Took over 10 minutes and still hadn't made up their minds.\nDhoni had been about to walk off with his batting partner since Dravid had declared  with Dhoni's "dismissal". \nSo Lara told Dhoni it was up to him if he was going to walk or not.\nIt looked like play was about to resume when Lara took the ball from the Pakistani umpire and was giving Mohammed instructions.\nThe umpires were still discussing what to do.\nDravid declared because it looked as if the umpires would stand there the entire day deciding on what to do.\nLater, in the dressing room Dhoni accepted Ganga's word and took his dismissal.\n\nThat was one of the stupidest thigs I've ever seen!!!!!!\nIt was utter crap!

question_title: do you  think  this  is right ?!? [SEP] question_content: We are more interested in making others believe that we are happy than in trying to be happy ourselves??!! [SEP] best_answer: Many people are like that, for several reasons. It could be for intimidation, or just because people don't want to worry family and friends. Normally, people are unhappy because of the everyday problems that arouse as we go on. Things like money, office work, children, social problems, health problems, and many others don't necessarily make one unhappy, but most people faced with these things don't try to appear unhappy.\nBut, on the other hand, many people are not like that. Many people are in love with life and are as happy as can be. they don't need to make others believe that they are happy- they already are! People who don't socialize much might not have as much of a need to make others feel like they are happy, though.\nIt's hard to say whether the statement is right or wrong, but there are different types of people. Let me just say that a lot of times, the superficial reality is different from the truth.	Society & Culture

question_title: who is Babylon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In ancient times, Babylon was a huge metropolitan city of the Sumerian empire.  It was located in modern day Iraq. It survived for thousands of years and was captured by Alexander the Great in 331 BC.  After Alexander's death 323 BC, Babylon soon fell into ruin.\n\nBabylon was a powerful symbol to ancient Jews and early Christians.  The book of Ezekiel describes the Babylonian siege and capture of the city of Jerusalem and the subsequent oppression of its Hebrew inhabitants.  Babylon has since been associated with sin, evil, and debauchery.  In the book of Revelation, Babylon is the name of either a city or a person from that city.  According to the book, this person ("the whore of Babylon") rules over the kings of the earth and rides upon a seven-headed beast. In one of the Bible's most famous cases of numerology, the beast is assigned the identifying number 666.\n\nThere is much debate amongst modern Christians as to who or what Babylon represents in Revelations.  Some scholars maintain that the Apostle John was talking about Emperor Nero of Rome.  Other popular interpretations include the Roman Catholic Church, the cities of San Francisco and New York, the Pope, the United Nations, and all "false" religions.\n\nIn Rastafarianism, Babylon represents the white power structure of colonial Jamaica.

question_title: What is the difference between Mahayana  and Theravada Buddhism? [SEP] question_content: It seems like there are a lot of flavors of Christianity, there are several fashions of Buddhist practices. \n\nWhich ones is best for our times? [SEP] best_answer: http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot02.htm  <<< differences on Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is the same: there is Theravada Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Yogacara Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism but it is all Buddhism and it all has the same taste - the taste of freedom. Buddhism has evolved into different forms so that it can be relevant to the different cultures in which it exists. It has been reinterpreted over the centuries so that it can remain relevant to each new generation. Outwardly, the types of Buddhism may seem very different but at the centre of all of them is the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. All major religions, Buddhism included, have split into schools and sects. But the different sects of Buddhism have never gone to war with each other and to this day, they go to each other's temples and worship together. Such tolerance and understanding is certainly rare. \n\nThe Buddha — the "Awakened One" — called the religion he founded Dhamma-vinaya — "the doctrine and discipline". To provide a social structure supportive of the practice of Dhamma-vinaya (or Dhamma for short [Sanskrit: Dharma]), and to preserve these teachings for posterity, the Buddha established the order of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkhunis (nuns)— the Sangha — which continues to this day to pass his teachings on to subsequent generations of laypeople and monastics, alike. \nAs the Dhamma continued its spread across India after the Buddha's passing, differing interpretations of the original teachings arose, which led to schisms within the Sangha and the emergence of as many as eighteen distinct sects of Buddhism.One of these schools eventually gave rise to a reform movement that called itself Mahayana (the "Greater Vehicle") and that referred to the other schools disparagingly as Hinayana (the "Lesser Vehicle"). What we call Theravada today is the sole survivor of those early non-Mahayana schools. To avoid the pejorative tone implied by the terms Hinayana and Mahayana, it is common today to use more neutral language to distinguish between these two main branches of Buddhism. Because Theravada historically dominated southern Asia, it is sometimes called "Southern" Buddhism, while Mahayana, which migrated northwards from India into China, Tibet, Japan, and Korea, is known as "Northern" Buddhism.\n\nThe main branches:\n1. Theravada / Hinayana (The great tradition or the way of the elders)\n\n2. Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle" : Variants of Mahayana Buddhism:\n-Tibetan Buddhism\n-Zen Buddhism\n-Pure Land Buddhism\n-Nichiren Buddhism\n\nhttp://www.buddhanet.net/worlddir.htm  <<< world buddhist directory (you may want to go to a temple or monastry near you & make enquiries). \nIf for whatever reason Buddhism appeals to you, obviously a bit of reading cannot do any harm. You could try a few introductory books from any tradition to get a closer idea of what Buddhism can mean for you.\n- Try not to get confused with the various traditions: just go for what feels right and ideally do a course. Amazingly, it seems to me that at least 90% of the people stick to the tradition they started in - somehow karma seems to be at work there... Anyway, the biggest differences between the Buddhist traditions are usually more on the surface than in the ideas behind the appearances. Although for example in Zen you will find very little ritual etc., and in Tibetan Buddhism you may be overwhelmed by it, at the core of the practice are the same ideas, just different methods.\n- Once you decide to get involved with a specific tradition, make sure you are not dealing with a controversial/dubious teacher or school; although someone may wear Buddhist robes or calls him/herself a lama, guru or even Acharya, that does not make him or her a saint.... There are unfortunately a fair amount of questionable 'Buddhist' teachers and c	Society & Culture

I guess my faith may be a little\nout of whack, right or wrong? [SEP] best_answer: Understand what gambling is and what prayer is.  Gambling is buying a minute chance to win money.  It is firt of all recreation, paying for the thrill of imagination of winning.  Odds are you wont win, but one can get some excitement out of playing with possibility--even a very small one.  Gamble for the thrill, for he excitement, for the tease of possibility.  Don't gamble to solve money problems.  I don't consider gambling a sin unless you attach unreasonable hope to it and neglect to make other responsible decisions.  \nPrayer is not a tool to manipulate God or providence or a substitute for making responsible decisions.   Unreasonable expectations of prayer can be just as destructive as unreasonable expectations of gambling.  Prayer is the act of conciously putting yourself in the presence of God and finding what God has for you to know and learn. God will give what God will give. I consider the assumption of adequate status to "bargain" with God unreasonable hubris and a detriment to spiritual growth.  \nPray and be open to new understandings of God and yourself.  Gamble if you can spare the money and enjoy the thrill.  (It's no worse than spending money on stuff you dont need.) But. . .dont look to eathre to solve problems tht God intended for you to confront with the wisdom and intelligence you were given.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: because kids are younger and they've learned less, as we get older we know certain ways to do things and its harder to re-learn to do them new ways than to keep doing them our old way, even if the new one is faster. kids are learning these things for the first time so they pick it up faster because they've got more space to put it and no previous experiences. thats why you must walk grandmothers thru even the easiest web-forms even tho they're designed for idiots. in short: adults dont usually like bothering learning new ways to do old things. besides, they know more stuff anyway, and have their lives in places besides home, who needs the internet?

question_title: George W. Bush? [SEP] question_content: For or Against? Why?\n\nThink about this! [SEP] best_answer: I approve of President George W. Bush. He is a man who always TELLS THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT and is a man who has a heart for other people, and understands what it means to be the President of the United States of America. I believe that if the former Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada Pierre Trudeau was still alive today, he would be proud of George W. Bush because both Bush and Trudeau asserted their countries identity to the world just as their country was going thought the worst crises in its history. For the United States, Bush asserted America’s identity to the world just as it was going through its toughest crises in its history on September 11, 2001. For Trudeau, he asserted Canada’s identity to the world when the October Crisis occurred in October 1970 from stopping the FLQ (Front de liberation du Quebec) from getting independence for Quebec.

question_title: Why are muslims so intolerant of christians? [SEP] question_content: Its so easy for them to declare jihad. Should christians retaliate? [SEP] best_answer: Certainly, not all of them are are... \n\nIn the cases they are though, so called Muslims (Muslim: believer, Islam: submission to God), believe that Christians are infidels; as in infidelity towards the religion of God as they see it, since they view Mohammad as the last Prophet. \n\nMost of those intolerant are of the elite ecclesiastical class (Imam: teacher), or the utterly ignorant because they're not even allowed to read the Koran or any other of their Holy books (which includes the Christian Bible) - the Koran is according to itself, another chapter of the continuing book of God, i.e. Bible and Torah are included in the Islamic book of God. \n\nMohammad is supposedly a Prophet like Moses, and His followers consequently have behaved like wise in their time, becoming persecutors/persecuted, but not all Jews were, nor are all Muslims today. (The books of Moses: Old testament, speak of a Prophet to arise in the place and time Mohammad did according to tradition "I shall raise up a Prophet, like unto me, Moses". \n\nThose that are not intolerant remember the sayings, or those like it that Mohammad stated "Anyone who harms a Christian or Jew has harmed me!", or "Be friends with the Christians for they are most like you in the world", or when asked what is this God you believe in, Mohammad said "The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." \n\nAbraham also had the Q'blih "point of adoration", a stone to turn to when praying for those unable to be without an alter, since both were from idol worshipers; as were the Jews before the ten commandments - the commandments Moses received before, He tossed into the water because the people were not ready (a sign of the coming of greater teaching, e.g. with Jesus).\n\nThere's always more to learn and understand. Some Muslims I've met show such Love for Christ that all but two Christians I've met pale by comparison - those two spoke of nothing but the love of God and had no hate for anyone. In generally the Muslims I've met here in the US are every bit as loving toward all, as Christians, and by that standard they are one and the same.	Society & Culture

Eventually, you will feel more confident.\n\nThere is no reason to be so frightened that you don't leave the hostel. Don't let your fears make you a prisoner.

question_title: Another important christians for christians.? [SEP] question_content: "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” [The Bible, Mathew 7:22-24]\n\n \n\nIn the verses quoted above, Jesus (pbuh) said that in his second coming, he would ask the people to depart from him, to get away from him because he wouldn’t know them. Who are these people? The Muslims or the Hindus? The answer is neither Hindus nor Muslims but the Christians, because Muslims or Hindus do not claim to do “Miracles” in the name of Jesus Christ (pbuh) nor do they cast out devils in his name.\nPLZ TELL WHAT CHRISTIANS THINK ABT THIS? [SEP] best_answer: I see where you are going with this, but your logic is faulty.\n\nYes - He is saying that some people will claim to know Him, but as he just got done saying a few verses earlier, they won't have been doing the will of His Father, and which means they don't truly know Him, they only think they do.\n\nTwo observations:\n\n1)  That does not mean that all Christians will not be acknowledged by the Messiah - only that some who claim to be Christians won't.\n\n2)  That does not mean that there are any other ways to God.  Jesus was also very clear about that:\n\n  * John 3:36 "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."\n\n   * John 14:6 "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me"\n\nI see that you honor Jesus as a Prophet, when you write "PBUH" (Peace Be Unto Him) after His name.  How do handle the knowledge that Jesus claimed to: 1) have the authority to forgive sins (something only God can do), 2) said He and the Father were one (John 10:30), and 3) claimed God granted him the authority to lay down his life  - and - take it up again (John 10:17-18).\n\nIgnoring whether or not He proved those things with the Resurrection (and there is evidence He did), these claims are very bold.  I can see two possibilities.  Either 1) These were not true (in which case you should not be saying "Peace Be Unto Him" every time you mention his name, for he was a Blasphemer, or 2) What he said was true, and he was God in human form come to save mankind.\n\nAs a Muslim, how do you handle that?

Your folks probably don't need to know either. Masturbation is a perfectly natural function of the body & humans are not the only ones who do that. What he chooses as stimuli is very personal, as is what he was doing. If you speak to him at all about it, you might just suggest that he be more careful to lock the door before he indulges. Also, you could make a bigger attempt to respect his privacy - but Please, don't tell all his friends - that really would be evil.	Society & Culture

First of all, don't blame me. I didn't create truth, and if what I happen to think is wrong, what's it to you? Is it so far fetched to say that there is a truth out there, and it's bigger than us (humans)? Where do people get the idea that they can come up with something, and the fact that they said so makes it truth? Again, there is truth and there are lies.  What is difficult to understand about that? [SEP] best_answer: The statement that the only absolute truth is that there is no absolute truth isn't a paradox- it's a load of crap.  It conflicts because it's wrong.  I have a tendency to fall back on pedophilia when trying to prove that there MUST be moral absolutes (and that they MUST come from something other than humans if they're absolutes).  If you're willing to say that pedophilia is a-okay as long as the pedophile thinks it's okay, then I can't reason with you.  If, however, you admit that pedophilia is wrong, then you're admitting to a moral absolute.  \n\nI'm with you, nice girl.  You can't create truth.

question_title: What is the history of Fashnaught day? [SEP] question_content: In Pennsylvania this is a big day for the dutch, german culture does anyone know how it got started and what it means? [SEP] best_answer: Fashnaught is a variation of the German "Faschnacht" or "Fastnacht" (literally, "fast night;" conceptually, "night before fasting").  For Catholics and some other Christian denominations its a celebration that precedes Lent, which is, of course, traditionally the period of fasting and moderation that precedes Easter.  Historically, those who observe Lent have had celebrations to be able to enjoy some of the things they liked one last time before giving them up for 40 days.  Shrove Tuesday, Fasching, Faschnachts Day, Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday, and Carnival are some examples of essentially the same celebration.  The German variant of this celebration has been traced back to at least the 13th century.  I've provided you with two links that briefly refer to the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) tradition.

question_title: Would Jesus be a Catholic or a Prodestant? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I really do not feel Jesus would belong to any of our "organized religions".

question_title: What's the best way to hide a dead body? [SEP] question_content: I was just wondering. What's the best way? Not anything that will get someone caught. Just asking. [SEP] best_answer: Don't use lime. A big mistake. It is monitored by law enforcement agencies and after burying the body, after a long period of time, the lime can actually end up preserving the body.\n \nBurial is generally the worst way to go. Decomposition is very slow and soil erosion is something to worry about. Travel the body far away from where you live. Something like a large lake or river is good. The deeper and quicker-moving water is better. Something also needs to weight down the victim. Strap some kind of weight to the body using simple duct tape. Make sure you tape it to the mid-section of the body and not the limbs or head as erosion will eventually result in the loss of the limbs.\n\nThe water life, aquatic bacteria, and constantly moving water will provide the quickest and best for removing all the evidence. Don't be stupid and using trash bags or something to contain the body as this only preserves the body more.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Someone told me that somewhere in Alabama, interracial marriages is against the law.\n\nI think that this is terrible!\nIs this a little known law that was'nt amended or is it hearsay?

Alabama was the last of the 16 states to overturn such laws, which they did in 2000.	Society & Culture

question_title: I am a Christian...? [SEP] question_content: I am a Christian I asked Jesus into my heart when I was 7. Why is it that we have so many people lost (spiritual term) and instead of trying to teach them more a/b the ways of our Lord when we see their either difference in opinion or even small "mindedness" we put them down and tell them they are definatley going to hell. When Jesus would not have done that. He would have taken the time to teach them his good hearted and loving ways. Therefore when the Christians that beat their bibles and demean others they are just making themselves look like hypocrites. Thats the reason why people in our society today call ALL Christians hypocrites. B/c those few that are criticizing others, THEY INDEED are the small minded people! Honestly they are lessening the people that will enter the gates of heaven! Why do that to God's kingdom? [SEP] best_answer: Because the flesh is weak .... People get all hot and bothered and high and mighty they forget what it is to be humble before the Lord in worship and haveing a meek and peaceful heart.  There is a time to stand up and shout (for Christ himself did Yell and holler when the time came ( when he stormed the temple and the money changers))  and there is a time to be meek.  But it is ALWAYS time to respond in Love....  sometime love needs to put it's foot down in someones face... and sometime it needs to Hold on tight to the person ... and sometimes it's to let them go and pray.... \n\nWe need to pray for all our brothers and sisters to spend more time at the feet of their savior in prayer and worship... and pray they would be driven to show him to the world...\n\nMay God bless you lil sis... the Lord guide you and give you peace	Society & Culture
question_title: Who is easier to get rid out of house, a Mormon or Jelovah Witness ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Jehovah's witnesses. Mormons tend to challenge you on your beliefs. In my past experiences, when a Jehovah's witness came to my door, if I told them I was catholic (which I'm not) they would just say "ok" and leave. Mormons, on the other hand, wanted to "compare notes!!" I actually made friends with 4 mormon missionaries, and they really could have gotten into trouble if their superiors knew what they were doing! See, when mormons are going door to door, they aren't allowed to have radios, t.v.'s, or anything else that distracts them from their studies. (this was told to me by these guys.) Well, to make a long story short, they used to come to my house so they could sing karaoke with my girls and me. I have a system set up for home use as well as 2 others that I use for business. We had a good time. :)	Society & Culture

question_title: Man! I want her!? [SEP] question_content: There is this girl that lives down the hall from me.  She's beautiful.  I really want to get to know her.  I really want her.  The thing is, the only time I see her is in passing.  I've never even had a conversation with her.  Everytime I do see her, she's on the way to something, or I'm on my way to something. I don't even know if she's into girls, but I think she is.  Everytime I see her, I try to make eye contact, but she seems like she's nervous and won't look at me.  I could be reading, but the way she acts around me is like when you have a crush on someone, and are nervous about being around them.  I would throw her up against a wall, but I think that may be a little too forward.  What I'm looking for is a way to get close to her.  I need to get to know her, talk to her, but I can't.  Tonight, I'm kicking myself because I was going to go to a gala tonight, but decided not to, so later, I see that she's going.  I could punch a hole in a wall! Someone help me. PLEASE! [SEP] best_answer: the fact dat u not goin to the gala might not be such a bad thing cuz 2morrow wen u see her comming your way then u get to have a reason to stop her by simply sayin hi..how are u..how waz the gala since i didnt go?..then she will tell u about her experience then u tell her about yours and dat how u start to get to kno her and next time you guys could go togeter and just show her a good time and wat u all about!..the key is to just go with the flow dont force any topic into the conversation. i hope it works out!!

question_title: Muslim Prayer? [SEP] question_content: When Muslims pray 5 times a day, what do they pray??  A christian will pray for food, clothing, a job, health problems, money problems, friends, or just to talk to his Father and be happy communing with him.  \nWhen Muslims pray what do they do?? [SEP] best_answer: we pray for what you've listed and also for going to paradise, for god go forgive us, for non-believers to see the truth, to be protected from hell fire..but, the 5 prayer we do is not an exact translation it is called salat and not the exact English meaning for prayers. It is to submit your self to god to show him obedience and so on.\n\nhere this may help:\nSalah (Prayer) \n\nPrayer (Salah), in the sense of worship, is the second pillar of Islam. Prayer is obligatory and must be performed five times a day. These five times are dawn (Fajr), immediately after noon (Dhuhr), mid-afternoon ('Asr), sunset (Maghrib), and early night (Isha'). Ritual cleanliness and ablution are required before prayer, as are clean clothes and location, and the removal of shoes. One may pray individually or communally, at home, outside, virtually in any clean place, as well as in a mosque, though the latter is preferred. Special is the Friday noon prayer, called Jum'ah. It too, is obligatory and is to be done in a mosque, in congregation. It is accompanied by a sermon (Khutbah), and it replaces the normal Dhuhr prayer. \n\nThere is no hierarchical clerical authority in Islam, no priests or ministers. Prayers are led by any learned person who knows the Qur'an and is chosen by the congregation. He (or she, if the congregation is all women) is called the imam. There is also no minimum number of congregates required to hold communal prayers. Prayer consists of verses from the Qur'an and other prayers, accompanied by various bodily postures - standing, bowing, prostrating and sitting. They are said in Arabic, the language of the revelation, though personal supplications (Du'ah) can be offered in one's own language. Worshippers face the Qiblah, the direction of the Ka'bah in the city of Makkah. \n\nThe significance of prayer lies in one's maintaining a continuous link to God five times a day, which helps the worshipper avoid misdeeds if he/she performs the prayers sincerely. In addition it promotes discipline, God-consciousness and placing one's trust in Allah alone, and the importance of striving for the Hereafter. When performed in congregation it also provides a strong sense of community, equality and brotherhood/sisterhood.	Society & Culture
question_title: christians: if you were given proof somehow that god doesn't exist, would you still try to be a moral person? [SEP] question_content: ok, time for a serious question from me. i'm not trying to be inflammitory or rude, so keep an open mind and think before you respond. here goes: if it was somehow proven to you that, after you have died, there is no reward or punishment given for your deeds in life, would you still try to live your life rightously and ethically? is your motivation to be a good person simply the fear of hell? if not, can you accept that a person who is an athiest or otherwise can be a good person anyway? would your god and his son welcome that person into heaven, even though they don't go to church or use conventional prayer methods? [SEP] best_answer: I live the way I live because I have found that it's the best way to live.  I find that based on my experience, living the way God wants me to is the best way to live, which if He doesn't exist, is a rather odd coincidence...	Society & Culture

question_title: Have you seen "Davinci code" film? any comment about the film? [SEP] question_content: There are some facts that is revealed in this film, is it true? which is true, and which is false? [SEP] best_answer: I just saw the film.\n\nThe part about how Christianity took pagan beliefs and mixed them in is correct. The fact that Constantine changed the religion (at least to a degree) is correct.  In fact when he ruled that in order to hold government office you had to be a Christian he managed to turn a bunch of pagans into Christians (in name only) over night.  Their underlying pagan beliefs remained the same, they just changed their title.\n\nThe part about the museum having bathroom windows that can be opened is absolutely false. Nor does the museum have bar soap that you can stick a GPS tracer into, they have liquid soap in the bathrooms.\n\nThe Priory has been pretty much determined to be a fraud. (Discovery Channel ran a series of shows which demonstrated this.) Of course, the paranoid will say that the "fraud" is just a cover story and it is exactly what the Priory wants you to think so that they stay secret.  \n\nThe idea that the "royal bloodline" filters down to one and only one woman in Europe seems pretty unbelievable. The Merovingians had many kids, there would have to be several thousand Merovingians by this point in history.\n\nThe idea that Jesus and Magdelene were married, well, not much proof one way or the other. Even if they were, it is that thing about rising from the dead that still sets things apart.\n\nOne idea that I don't think most people have considered is the possibility that the entire DaVinci Code movie and book might just be designed as a meme (brain virus as it were). Designed to "inject" the concept of this bloodline into the populace. Then, when the time is ripe, "they" will unveil a person who is supposedly the descendant in question whom "they" want to setup as a One World Leader.\n\nFrankly I think there is more "fact" in "The Norman Rockwell Code".

I switched on my TV also and heard the horrifying news that a mother in Ohio has been arrested for cooking her infant in the microwave.  It has made me physically sick. Some people are worse than animals.  Animals would never do something as bad as that.  Do you feel that you must turn the TV off and throw away your newspapers sometimes?  Does it all get to be too much for you?  Maybe I'm weak but, sometimes I can't take it for a while. [SEP] best_answer: First of all, there are animals/insects that eat their young.  Secondly, yes I am horrified and wonder what had become of the human race.  It appears we (humans) have all lost our common sense, our compassion, our hearts.  Something is very wrong with people today and I'm not sure how it happened.  \n\nPeople like to blame video games and rap music (neither of which I am fond of), but I'm not sure they are the problem.  I do know that people want everything instantly (instant coffee, microwaves, internet, emails) and have no patience.  Maybe because no one is patient?  People have become more rude and obnoxious.

question_title: Christians: If Jesus died for our sins, why do we still have to go to hell because of it? [SEP] question_content: If Jesus died for our sins, why do we have to go to hell because of it? For Atheists: pretend God's real, okay? [SEP] best_answer: Nobody knows what happens to us when we die, or this concept of hell or heaven. Well by catholic mythology, i think as long as you live a good life, christian or not, youll go to heaven, or spend a few years in purgatory at the most, because comon, then over half of the world would be going to hell. Heaven would be like some deluxe snob club where only a few members were allowed in.\n\nBut realistically our concept of heaven and hell has grown out of control, its turned into a huge bribe, but hey i guess it works a lot of the time. The jews (the religion christianty evoloved out of) didnt have a strict conept of heaven or hell, they knew to live life good, and that god would punish them in life for unfaithfulness and sometimes the punishment would carry over to those that were close to them. They had some slight concept of bliss and punishment in the afterlife but it didnt consume all the time and thought as it does in christianity. Actually it sounds like it was tampered with somewhat by rulers and writers.\n\nI dont think jesus wants us to suffer, if anything i think hed give us a redo, in a soemwhat reincarntional concept., then again if jesus did exist and was god's son.\n\ndont worry about it so much and just try to live a good life by the golden rule.\n\ndont take naything form the bible literally, most of its to be taken out of context into your own consideration and recieve a message and apply it to your own life.

question_title: If we are suppose to love our brothers and sisters? [SEP] question_content: Then why do we hurt eachother and others all the time? [SEP] best_answer: Lack of love for God, for if you truly love God with your whole heart, mind and strength he gives you the power to love others.\nThat is why it is the first commandment.\nThe First Commandment is the most basic requirement for beginning to understand God’s truth and to fulfill our ultimate purpose. All humanity is warned to put God first, and to avoid false gods. The Being who issued that first and great commandment rephrased it in Matthew 22:37.\n\nNotice: “Jesus said unto him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment.” In this New Testament passage, Christ was essentially quoting words that He inspired in Deuteronomy 4:5.	Society & Culture

question_title: Does he still love me? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months and we love each other like crazy. It was love at first sight. I mean every single day we would say how much we love each other at LEAST 15 times a day. I mean I love him.. i really do. just sometimes it seems like he doesnt love me.... maybe i'm mistaken. the thing is he lives 20 miles away.. so if something happens i wont know about it. i know he would never do anything like that but u know hes 17 and im 16... this guy loves me soo much he's cried for me. but lately we havent been saying i love you as much as we usually do... do you think anythings wrong? should i be worried? =&#92; [SEP] best_answer: Saying I love you isnt as powerful as showing it.

Both girls. \n\nHe goes to college but so do I (my classes are homebased) and I work 5 days a week, still do the laundry, still cooks, still cleans.

It is financially a bad idea for you to allow him to stay at home.\n\nMy fiance went to college and held a full time job just to make sure things at home were taken care of.  I also worked, even throughout my pregnancy.  With three kids, we needed all the money we could.  \n\nI left my ex first for all of the reasons you had listed above.

[SEP] best_answer: I hate to look at things this way, but I'm a factual person. The stats show that ppl who live together before getting married are more likely to get divorced. I waited until I was married to have sex. This brings a real sense of security to our relationship. I could go on about the other benefits, but I'm tired.	Family & Relationships

question_title: state funding? [SEP] question_content: If the state gives so much of are taxes to county program to help people why is it so hard to get help? [SEP] best_answer: Possibly because of past abuse of help program funds, they are overly cautious about giving it out now.  I felt a little daunted by the amount of paperwork for the application process I am now going through, but it was minimal compared to what I got when I looked at financial aid for community college.\n\nGood luck to you and persevere until you get what you need!

question_title: is being gay a sin? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Truthfully, I think that if a person looks hard enough they can find sin in everything and everyone.  The interesting thing is that people who spend their lives looking for sin in others rarely, if ever, find sin within themselves.  Personally I find it important to remember these two things:\nFirst, man not God placed a rating on sin.  In the eyes of God the person who lies is just as much a sinner as the person who murders.  So, in that regard, have we not all sinned?\nSecond there are my two favorite verses from the bible:\nMatthew 7:1-5\nJudge not, that ye be not judged. \nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. \nAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? \nOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \nThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\nLuke 6:37-38\nJudge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: \nGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is it possible to see your period one month after you put to birth while breatfeeding, how to prevent pregnan? [SEP] question_content: That is, to avoid pregnancy using natural control method not artificial. how to count save and unsave days [SEP] best_answer: If you are going to use this method for birth control, prepare for another pregnancy. It does not work, at least not very well. You need to use some form of birth control, either condoms, or the pill. You are MOST fertile, halfway through your cycle, day14, 15 , and 16........but you can STILL get pregnant other days, even while on your period, if you have sex.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Proposed New ABORTION Law? [SEP] question_content: Women can only get abortion if the man agrees, or she is proven to be raped or under age or in the case of saving a life.\n\nIf the father does not agree he must pay the mother an amount during her pregnancy and medical bills and must have full custody of the child after it is born, then the mother must pay child support.\n\nIf no case can be proven and the mother gets an abortion the father can sue for damages for his lost child. [SEP] best_answer: In my opinion it sounds like a good law. Its may be the womans body, but its the mans sperm. If the father wants to take care of his daughter/son then he should be able to. The woman and man created the baby, not just the woman.	Family & Relationships
question_title: how do u know your boy friend really loves you? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Since I don't know your boyfriend personally, it's hard to offer good advice.  I think that some of the following guidelines would show whether or not he loves you:\n\n1)  Does he respect your wishes and morals, or does he try to pressure you into activities and ideas that he knows that you are not in favor of?  A guy who loves you will respect your wishes, even if his wishes are different than yours.  He will not try to pressure you into doing something that you have already said "no" to.\n2)  Does he ever say, "If you loved me, you'd... (fill in the blank)" or something similar?  If he has, he's using you.\n3)  A guy that loves and cares for you will encourage you to be your best self, and look out for your best interests.\n\nHope that helps.	Family & Relationships

He still means it, but is probably hoping you are secure enough in the relationship to know that without him saying it as often.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: for some reason I can't stand my unborn childs father, I mean for the past four months he didn't do a thing for me but all the sudden he calls today and says sorry and he wants to do something for me. well he doesnt understand that i don't want to spend time with him now because everytime he apologizes, i accept and then he changes. Now he says he changed for the good, should I fall for the same thing again or just do thing s for myself? [SEP] best_answer: Nah, get out of this situation.  You have your unborn child to think about now and you don't need all this stress during your pregnancy.  He has learned that he plays up you end it then you take him back, so he'll go on like this.  You and your child deserve so much more.\n\nGet support from friends and family for the upcoming event and afterwards so you are not tempted to go back with him as someone to lean on....'cos trust me you'll only have him for 5 mins. to lean on and he'll be back doing what he always does and leaving you in a mess again.\n\nThis is a new start now for you and your child.....enjoy it!\n\nBest wishes.

I'm A.\nI'm straight and so is C, but B,D,and E are bi. We are all the same gender, obviously. I like nobody in my friends group, and C likes noone, b/c we're straight. B likes C, but C doesn't like her back. D likes B, and here's where the problem is- E likes me. It is REALLY creepy because after I told her I was straight, she kinda flipped out and now she's  harassing me and stroking my body and everything and making me feel uncomfortable. I need help with this- I also need help because after C said she didn't like B back, B has been really depressed and I feel awful and don't know what to do...Thanks so much. [SEP] best_answer: There has to be a mutual agreement among friends. I have lots of strait friends some do attract me, however there is that mutual agreement that I'm bi and there strait so i would never act on those feelings out of respect. If a mutual agreement has not been established you and your friends need to do that in a nice way without hurting each other. Set boundaries. True friends will respect each others feelings. The bi girls should understand this more that any one.	Family & Relationships

question_title: what's the point in having an "OPEN" relationship? [SEP] question_content: i dunno about u, but it seem ironic to be in a COMMITMENT and not have yourself COMMITED to the person u love. [SEP] best_answer: open relationship isnt exactly a relationship of the caliber youa re describing. start with what a relationship is - you to your friend, a teacher, your pet. Everything you come in contact with has some sort of relationship to you, same as the partner you are in an open relationship with. In this situation, one member does not want to hold commitment to anyone, till they are sure they will be with that person for quite a while. go and have fun, and stop worrying about love so much, its nice but it will always happen again, if you put yourself out there.

[SEP] question_content: I was listening to a talk show as I drove in to work, it was about cheating, and reasons why....\n\nmany say the same thing, if needs weren't been met at home etc \n\ndo some of you feel its a cop out, oh sure some people aren't treated the same after the chase is over, .kind of like how great a brand new shiny  car is until you have to make the payments , put gas in it and wash it, oh then its a little work...\n\nand I am not aiming this at any gender.. \n\n do you thing there are just those who are selfish, or their needs aren't normal, the partner has no clue there's problems, they just have a problem with being faithful they may have an issue, with adult web sites yet they wouldnt dare end their relationship but want more than what they have\n\nI think there are many reasons to re evaluate a relationship, and talk things over and maybe end it , but cheating is selfish , \n\nwhat do you all think [SEP] best_answer: Cheating is selfish and cowardly. Cowardly because the person doing the cheating does not have the courage to face his/her partner to tell them how they feel.	Family & Relationships

question_title: How do ask girls out? [SEP] question_content: I am so shy, i can talk over the internet to them, but not face to face. help me out. [SEP] best_answer: You should take the risk and talk to them face to face just like talking to them on the internet. believe me it is experience and trying.. be nice, be smart, funny and strong...shy is not so good most of the time, because you won't be able to know what you should say quick...the only thing to change such behavior is go and talk, and start as friends. and be the center, don't be the corner.  \nI tried that before and I succeeded honestly.  and I can go out with any I interested in..but I'm not interested in many now. just some.. and believe me, if you see some don't want, then just don't try... take it from easiest to easier to difficult.

question_title: at a party.? [SEP] question_content: it was my besties 18th the other night and everyone there was really really drunk when me and my boy turned up. i walked out the back and one of her mates sam started cracking onto me massively even though h knows i have a boyfriend. my boyfriend daniel went rank and completely went off at him. i told him it was nothing... is he over reacting or just being protective??? [SEP] best_answer: I'd have to say he's being protective in this case. If everyone happened to be really drunk as you said and you and your BF were not. He was doing the only thing he knew how to prevent a situation from escalating into something potentially dangerous to you. Just give him a hug and a kiss and tell him thank you for looking out for you. I could only say he was over reacting if Sam were sober and joking around with you and your BF heard the conversation and went off even after knowing Sam was just jesting then it would be over reaction on the BF's part.

question_title: what makes a man who is married and who flirts A LOT with me do it? is his marriage unhappy you think? [SEP] question_content: im just curious to know why a man who is married with kids would flirt to the extent that he does with me? he is married, my doctor, and has kids. the type of flirting is unethical i already know that... but i just wonder why someone that knows that it's wrong professionally and morally would put himself out there on the line the way he does. what do u think? would you say that he is going through a mid life crisis? he is like 50 and his wife is the same. [SEP] best_answer: You hit the nail on the head with "mid-life crisis". He needs validation that his manhood and virility are still intact. This is however, a breach of his professional ethics. His marriage may not be unhappy ... just stale. It happens in the very best of marriages.	Family & Relationships

question_title: How do I cope with this Father's Day? [SEP] question_content: I recently lost my dad whom I was very close to! It's been very hard for my mom, brother and I. Mama and brother are coming to Louisiana to visit this weekend so that we can be together on Father's Day since it will be difficult for us. We believe in God and that's the only way we've survived this. Therefore; I thought it would be good to just celebrate daddy and our Father in Heaven. For those of you who may have lost your dad, how do you handle Father's Day? Thanks for your advice. [SEP] best_answer: The first year after you lose a parent is the hardest ~ the first birthdays, holidays, and other special times you have as a family without them there to share it with you.  We still have our dad, but our mom passed away about 10 years ago.  One of the things we do as a family on Mother's Day to remember our mom is have breakfast together.  We make Mom's favorite breakfast (blueberry coffee cake and hot tea) and talk about our special memories of her.  We look at pictures and laugh and cry ~ it's actually a really great time!  I love your idea of celebrating your father and our Father in Heaven together.  It's a very appropriate way to remember that both of them are watching over you.  Best wishes to you and your family.

question_title: Women (or open minded men), do you enjoy the taste of manly fluids? [SEP] question_content: I do ;) [SEP] best_answer: Let me give you a man's perspective. \n\nMy wife has never swallowed, she won't even taste it, even though it does turn me on when women do drink it down. I used to always get on her case because of this but she wouldn't budge. Now that she is pregnant I have tasted her breast milk and I don't blame her one bit.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Who are Positive People and how can I get them into my life? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Positive people are those who are always optimistic about life. They see the glass as half full versus half empty. Positive people generally have a lot of karma and believe in the philosophy that you get what you give (or "what goes around comes around"). They are always nice to others, never a backstabber, and very pleasant to be around.\n\nTo surround yourself with positive people, you must first become one yourself. This begins with mastering the art of positive thinking. Positive thinking begins with looking at life differently.\n\nIn the beginning stages of becoming a positive thinker, it takes a lot of effort that will soon become habit. Whenever you catch yourself thinking a negative thought ("I can't stand that person"), change it to a positive thought ("This person has some good traits and because I don't know his/her life situation, I won't judge him/her.")\n\nStart to "take time to smell the flowers". Admire the beauty of your surroundings. Start to do good things for others. If you have some extra money, when you go through a drive-through then pay for the bill of the person behind you! Practice doing positive and fulfilling things. Remove yourself from negative influences and vow to always be positive.\n\nThe good news is that as you become more positive then other positive people will be attracted to you! You will be able to more easily identify positive people (once you are one) and start doing nice things for them in order to form a friendship and improve the positive surroundings in your life.\n\nBest of success to you!

[SEP] best_answer: First of all, get some counseling to help you deal with your problems. Why did he have to know right then? Why couldn't he respect the fact that you didn't want to talk about it? You should have the right not to talk about what you don't want to. If he hasn't contacted you again because you wouldn't talk about this, does he really care about you? I'm just saying this because what he did was NOT YOUR FAULT! Perhaps you could have asked to talk about it later, but that didn't happen.\n\nLet's say you find him and still want to apologize...you could simply say, "I'm sorry for hurting your feelings by not talking to you about the problem. I was uncomfortable at the time. I needed some space. I am ready to talk about it now." (Assuming you actually do want to talk about it.) Tell him that sometimes you need time to think. If he can't respect that you deserve better!\n\nAnd, again, get some help from a doctor if you feel like hurting yourself again, please!	Family & Relationships

In the process, they may get the hint.	Family & Relationships
question_title: was this girl a virgin ( R-Rated Details)? [SEP] question_content: I had sex with ex-gf, and she claimed to be a virgin. I asked her if she was ready and she said no, so i jokingly said well how bout anal and she said ok she wanted to try it. Afterwards we slept in the morning i we talked about it and i said well are you ready for vaginal and she said yes.  I have my  doubts she was a virgin  butnever discussed them with her.\n\n She didnt bleed it was tight and she did seem to be in pain for the first couple minutes but after that it was just like any normal girl. She liked it hard and deep. and showed some exsperinece when she was ontop. was eager for different posistions. She came several times, and from then on out for the rest of the relationship sex was a regular thing.  I just always felt like she lied to me. I mean i never used a rubber bc she was on birth control and she would offer take them infront of me so  i wouldnt worry. only came in here a few times.\n\nAll in all you think she was a Virgin. [SEP] best_answer: Personally i don't think she was a vrigin .The reason why is not because she did not bleed coz a lot of girls can losse that in other ways like too much excersice apart from that if she has been mastubating.you see it's her reaction during and after sex that is not rection i will be expecting from a vrigin ,except she has been watching a lot of porn.Anyways just take care that is in the past just look forward ok.it's the present and future that matters not the past, maybe she was just trying to impresses you.

What are some of the ways that I can tell if she's interested in me? I mean I'm worried because the first date ended in a hand shake, and then of course the baby sitter cancelled the following weekend [SEP] best_answer: See if the next date goes as plans.\nIf the sitter is a no show and she cancels, then I would say she is not sure how to tell you she is not interested.\nDon't be offended by the hand shake she might just be a lil nervous, so if you should go out on the second date, you get close to her when you walk her to the door, lean into her body just a tad if she moves towards you a lil that is your signal go for the kiss.\nJust be happy she is not easy, some women like to play hard to get just to see if your really interested in her.  I know women can and are a bit confussing :)	Family & Relationships
question_title: I need to make bachelor party invitations but can't find any ideas. Looked on the internet 5 days now.? [SEP] question_content: I'm looking for a picture to put on the front of the invitations but the ideas I found can't be saved in the JPEG file.  This party is for a guy in his 60's.  He loves pussy. [SEP] best_answer: The reason you can't find them is that bachelor parties traditionally have not involved written invitations. If you really want to do them, you'll probably have to do them yourself.... find a picture you think is suitable, and get some "do it yourself" invitations from Staples or a craft store and print the invitations at home.

question_title: Do yo think we have the power to lower the gas prices? [SEP] question_content: It seem to me, if we organize our daily travels by eliminating those extra unplanned trips we would use less gas,(probably 2/3s less) which would cause the limited reserve storage supply to be over filled and cause that limited storage supply to become over filled and the oil companies would be forced to lower the prices in order to keep the supply moving. \n\nI think we have control. The oil companies are trying to make us think and feel that we don't have control. I believe we can cause the gas price to be what we want them to be by managing our travels (you know those "Oh,I forgot to" trips).   I don't want to pay more than .75 per gallon but, I can't do it alone. I need your help. I think by collectively managing our use of fuel we can make them know that supply and demand really controls price. This is just a different shift in the paradigm of thinking and acting.. Hey! we have control. Pass it on..  What do you think? Yes, I think we waste 2/3s and 1/4 of $3.00 per barrel is .75.

question_title: Does my mom hate me? [SEP] question_content: Their are four kids in our family. My mom treats me and my oldest sister like we are slaves. My other sister and brother, she praises for cleaning up their own messes. I clean the house she says I missed a spot, looks at me like I'm stupid and does it herself. When my midle sisters grades come in, my mom tells her what a good job she has done, keeping her grades up. I have to work hard but my grades are as good as hers, when my grades come in the mail it gets looked over and passed on to me. No word said about my good grades. My oldest sister had pictures developed from a few years ago. My mom flipped through the pictures and commented on my middle sisters hair looked how it was soo short, finished looking at the pictures without saying a word about me or my oldest sister who were also in the pictures and handed them back to me saying she needs to get back to her work. Their are other things that she will let my middle sister do that she wouldn't let my older sister or me do. [SEP] best_answer: no, i am sure that she doesnt hate you.\n\ni get the sense, however, that she is expecting soething from you with isnt fair for her to ask: she wants you to take a back seat to your siblings. i miagine that would be a very hard thing for anyone to do...\n\ni wish that i could give you some sort of magical advice that would fix your problem in one fell swoop, but we both know there is no such answer. the best that i can tell you is that you and your older sister both need to talk to your mother about they way that you feel.\n\nexplain it to her. allow her to ask questions, and maybe vent a little if she needs to. dont approach her with a accusatory manner, and dont give her the feeling she is being ganged up on. simply tell her the way that this treatment make the two of you feel, and i bet she will understand. however, just cuz she understands, does not mean that she will then fix the problem in one fell swoop.\n\nif the above doesnt work the only other advice i could give the two of you is to suck it up, and deal with it, and thank the Lord for what you do have, and for the good in your lives rather than the bad. sometimes people are so set in their ways that they cant even comprehend change, and i pray that mother isnt one of them.\n\nanyway, i wish you both the best of luck, and i hope that this helped you, even if only a little.\n                   \n                        :-)	Business & Finance

question_title: Is it possible to get a loan to purchase your first home if you have bad credit? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: FHA guarantees loans for first time home buyers and can often offer solutions even to people with bad credit.  Shopping around for a good realtor and lender if very important.\n\nAsk friends and family who they have used.  In the market as it currently sits, almost anyone can get a mortgage, everything depends on how much you want to pay and what property you want.\n\nWhen looking for homes, make sure your realtor knows that you are a first time home buyer and interested in FHA loans since only certain houses qualify for them and some will be automatically ruled out.\n\nWhen shopping for a lender (don't JUST go with the one the realtor recommends but DO at least check them out), inquire about FHA loans and what type of points and interest would be available for someone with a credit rating of X.  find out what your credit rating is from the 3 major credit bureaus BEFORE you shop for a lender.  You want to know what they are going to be seeing before they do.\n\nThe more information you have the better.  Don't be afraid to ask questions or to walk away if it isn't what you want.\n\nStandard disclaimer: This is not legal advice nor financial advice.

(Thus creating Summer and Winter)\nSo therefore, the equator faces the sun, because the earth is tilted, and the earth must be faced at an angle. \nAm I right? [SEP] best_answer: The Sun, in its seasonal movement through the sky, passes directly over the equator twice each year on the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes, which occur in March and September (respectively). At the equator, the rays of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth on these dates.\n\nPlaces near the equator experience the quickest rates of sunrise and sunset in the world, taking minutes. Such places also have a relatively constant amount of day/night time on every day throughout the year compared with more northerly or southerly places.	Business & Finance

question_title: fire destroyed my house..what to do? [SEP] question_content: i was renting in CA in 2006. single family home. the AC unit cause a spark in the attic and burnt down my entire house. my cat and dog died in fire. \nthe official fire report states fire was started by AC, it also states we've made several complaints to landlord about weird electrical outages in various parts of the house (he never took any action to fix it). but in the fire report, he says he has fixed it.\nand now, the whole house is non-repairable. \nwe didn't have renters insurance, but landlord has insurance on the house. i think he's fighing insurance for his share of the loss (the ttl loss is around $800,000). he has not even made an attempt to call us since the fire happened 3 months ago.  \ni want to know if we have any hope of getting our losses back by getting legal action again landlord for unsafe living for past year. i just want to get some money so i can start out new again.\nthanks for your input in advance. [SEP] best_answer: There's really not a whole lot that a landlord is responsible for but I can tell you that they are responsible for providing a safe place to live which includes plumbing and electrical.  Even if you don't have any written documents showing you complained about the electrical stability, it will be his word against yours and since he never fixed it, he won't have any receipts.\n\nMy advice is to get a lawyer.  You shouldn't have too much trouble finding one if the house if worth $800,000.  The lawyer should take it on a contingency fee (they get paid when you get paid).  If your claim is less than $5,000 you can take him to small claims court.  If you win you can put a lien against the property until he pays you.  Your winnings will also collect 10% annual interest until paid.  Also, if he tries to sell the property you will get you money before he gets his.	Business & Finance

question_title: what should I do? [SEP] question_content: What should I do after work? Go to the gym, go to the groceries with mommy, watch a movie with a friend (if so, should we watch Lakehouse, or Nacho Libre?), or should I just stay home and play ps2 and sleep? [SEP] best_answer: You should read.  Read a good book, or something so that you can learn.  Going to the gym is good, but not all of the time.  Movies and video games are too, and occasionaly an extra nap - although if you would go to the gym more often you wouldn't need to sleep as much.  Here are some books that I've read that were pretty good:  "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card, along with the other books in the series: "Speaker for the Dead", "Xenocide", and "Children of the Mind".  They were really interesting, and really fun to read.  Then there is the "Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy" series by Douglas Adams.  Really funny:  a lot better than the newer movie:  I read the book before even any trailers came out, and it was really good.  Then, there are some classic books that are pretty good.  Mark Twain is really great; maybe a book of short stories.  Reading is great, man.  If you're not into reading, go to the gym and then play PS2, so you get more than one activity in.

question_title: can i start a business with great ideas but no cash in hand? [SEP] question_content: i want to start a good life within this year [SEP] best_answer: There are many businesses who started with so little yet grew to become good income vehicles down the road. From the article "How to Start a Business with Little Cash" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol30/nocash.htm  here are some tips on how you can start a business and earn more money even if you are short of cash today:\n\n1. Find a business that you can start for little money (e.g. an errand business where your main cost is telephone and gasoline is easier to start than starting a Subway franchise)\n\n2. Consider your time and effort - if you have little cash, you may have to work harder for the money because you will have no resource to outsource or employ others to do certain tasks for you; or you have no money to buy equipment so you can only do certain things the long way\n\n3. Get your creative juices flowing. With no money, the only thing you have is your imagination. Be creative and find ways to get things done \n\n4. Be prepared to do all the work yourself - from doing your business plan, finding financing, writing emails, shipping and handling, marketing or whatever processes your business requires. \n\n5. Be prepared to invite investors - you may need financing help from someone down the road so be prepared to share some of the pie. \n\nOther recommended articles:\nHow to Build a Business from Scratch http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol18/scratch.htm\n10 Rules for Bootstrapping Your Business http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol70/shoestringrules.htm	Business & Finance

question_title: how do you keep pimples from breaking out? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It's impossible to keep pimples from breaking out that's apart of puberty and life, but to prevent them from coming then eat fruits and vegetables drink water, have a healthier way of eating.  Pimples are caused by the pores being clogged and by producing too much oil or sebum from your sebaceous glands that can form either a white head or a black head.  So wash your face with something that has benzol peroxide in it or salic acid, and use an on the spot acne medication, The best stuff to use depends on your face type whether you have dry or oily skin or a combination of both.  So you have to find a cleanser that won't overdry your skin, or make it too oily.  Recommended products Neutrogena on the spot acne cream, only has 2.5 % benzol peroxide so it won't dry your skin too much, and Clearsil daily face wash guarenteed to clear skin in 3 days.  That's the cheap route, and it works.  Other than that you can use an astringent or toner all of them are pretty much the same but some can overdry your skin so you just have to test them to see which ones are best for your facial type, and those are good to use after doing some sweating and with make-up to take it off.  Sometimes having too much make-up on can clog your pores so use a light base so that none of the cosmetics can still be left behind.  Last, wash your face in the shower, and you don't need to use everything morning and night, You'll notice if you need to wash more than once a day, if it overdrys your skin, or if your skin is too oily.  Use the on the spot medication at night only so that your skin won't feel tight and dry all day long.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Because it gives a creditor a "snapshot" of the company's financial health (assets, liabilities, owner's equity). \n\nAlso, at my bank the owner has to sign the F/S stating that it is "true and accurate". If any of the info proves to be otherwise, then the person/company has presented fraudulent/misleading info to a federally insured institution and that opens up a Pandora's box of problems for the person/company including possible "criminal liability".

question_title: How to start a Janitorial Service? [SEP] question_content: My mother and I would like to star a cleaning service in Florida. We dont know where or how to start and how to calculate what to charge.  Anyone with their own Service??? Please give some advice. [SEP] best_answer: First you want to register the business then get bonded and insured. This is a good starting point and are a plus when your pitching to a potential customer. It says "we are safe to let into your home and you will be compensated if something gets broken".  As far as charges go call some of the local cleaning companies and pose as a potential client and get their rates. Then go below them at least at first. Once you get a customer or two and if you do a good job  word should spread. Word of mouth is very vital as far as gaining new clients. Good Luck!	Business & Finance

question_title: what is the difference between writing on admitted and non admitted paper in the insurance world? [SEP] question_content: underwriting property [SEP] best_answer: A couple of things.  "Admitted" carriers are licensed to do business in your state - and subject to the rules and regulations, and SUPERVISION, of your state insurance department.  So if you have any problems, complaints, etc, you can write to the insurance department, and they will intervene.  Their policy forms have also been approved (or are on file) with the same insurance department. \n\nPolicies issued through non-admitted companies are subject to a state tax and stamping fee, and frequently an inspection/audit fee, as well.  \n\nHOWEVER.  Nonadmitted companies have more flexibility, and are more willing to be "creative" in their underwriting.   They will frequently write higher risk accounts, such as a demolition contractor or lead paint abatement company.  \n\nIf you're buying insurance, and considering a nonadmitted carrier, be very careful to check www.ambest.com for the financial rating - you do NOT want to buy insurance from a company that is rated lower than A-, or smaller than a V.  \n\nThere are some very, very good non-admitted companies out there - Scottsdale comes immediately to mind.  So don't write them off just because they aren't admitted - you really need to compare costs and coverages as well.	Business & Finance

question_title: Can a server be held responsible for guest walkouts? [SEP] question_content: I'm a server in Arizona, and this weekend I had a two guests walk out on a $30 bill.  They were very nice older ladies, so I don't think it was intentional.  The owner told me that I am responsible for the bill, but people have told me that it is illegal for him to do that, and also uncommon in the restaurant industry.  Does anyone know for sure? [SEP] best_answer: I have worked in restaurants and bars since 1975 and yes, servers are responsible for walk-outs.  The attitude of the establishment is that once you have rung in the order, you just purchased it and therefore must collect it from the customer.  I think it is totally unfair but I have never seen an establishment that takes responsibility. Keep a close eye on your tables, I have had to chase people outside on many occasions.  I think that if the server has to pay it, it should be based on the ACTUAL cost of the product not the consumer cost...but they don't seem to see it that way.  I hope this helps you.

Try scheduling a ride along with the local pd to see what it's like and if that might be the route you want to go.

question_title: what is facism? [SEP] question_content: i know kinda how it works but how does it work in the big picture? [SEP] best_answer: In the bigger picture when a country's economy is in danger tehn fascism comes to play. The equation is a bt complicated. It is generally beleived that a country is run by a govt but the capitalist lobbist and top officials are the actual show runners. In a situation when the industries of a country have gone into so much profit making that the general people on the streets have run out of purchasing power, political forces have to be bred that will divert the people away from analysing this. One of the proven solutions is to wage a war as that gets the military running and hiring and whatever problems people have, they shut up under the name of patriotism. Keep in mind the post war economy and the massive recruitment in the army for this. Sometimes before waging external wars redistribution of resources in the country solves the problem before a larger war. In effect rulers come up and resort to zenophobia or community pride or something similiar to whip up popular emotions. Thus jews resources were distributed and then in order to live the patriotism hitler waged war. This is how fascism works in the bigger picture.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why is President Bush a really great president? [SEP] question_content: Tell me why you think our president is doing a great job, and deserves more credit than he gets.  \n\nGO BUSH !!!! [SEP] best_answer: How fickle people are, these polls out today are a joke. I would like to see this question posed...what don't you like about Bush, factually, not just off the cuff running your mouth...give me facts.\n\nIsn't it interesting that some 96% of the US population approved of the war in Iraq 4 years ago?  Yet, they don't approve now, sorry folks, you don't just change your mind about war in midstream.  It doesn't work that way.  We didn't have it easy during many wars, and didn't give up and pull out, eventually the tables turned and we were very successful.  I think of the Revolutionary war, WW1 and  WWII.  People seem to forget that we activly fought WWII for 4 years (after it was already in progress for 3 years).  It was awful, it was tough, but we got dragged into it by Japan, just like the terrorists draged us into this one.\n\nSo why is Bush great?  Number one, he has named his priorities and goals and stuck with them.  The economy is very strong, growing so fast the Feds can't raise interest rates fast enough.  I can't see what it is that Americans can blame Bush for when it comes to the economy, most of the damage was done by the terrorists on 9/11.  Bush said he belived in tax cuts, he didn't want new taxes and he wanted Americans to have more money in their pockets so they spent more.  All of the above happened.  I didn't see anyone complaining when they got their $300.00 a few years ago.  The democrats are dying to use taxes to lower the deficit...okay, that means our money folks, you okay with that?\nThere is a time a place for everything, raising taxes during war is not the way to go.\n\nWe have not had another attack on American soil.  If you want to keep the terrorists from attacking innocent Americans, send the military to the terrorists, keep them occupied and kick their asses somewhere else.  The men in the military are all for being out there kicking terrorism in the butt.  That is their job, they signed up for it and trained for it.  They don't just want Americans support they want success, that means letting them finish the job.  Some of these men and women are on their 4th and 5th tours, and wanting to go back for more.\n\nBush tells it like it is.  If he screws up he acknowledges it.  He doesn't mess around with anything.  He gets to the point and moves on.  You can tell how much he learned from his dad and President Regan.  Sometimes he so reminds me of Regan it's astonishing.  \n\nI'm sorry but when Hurricane Katrina came and Bush got the report on the dykes a few days before landfall..what was he going to do about them?  Send peple out to dump dirt on them?  It was too late to rebuild, it was not feasable to get everyone out of the City, hell that shouldn't even be the governments job to do that.  We have been through 3 direct Hurricane landfalls in 2 years where I live in Ft. Pierce, FL (not to mention the 4 indirect storms and depressions) and we took care of ourselves.  This is the land of the elderly.  If we had waited for the government we would have been standing in waist deep water for weeks.   Bush came and saw us, he gave us support, it's more emotional than anything else.  That is what we needed, when you dont' have TV, radio, phone, you feel very isolated.  Having your President come to see you is a great moral booster.  He is very good at that.\n\nBush has reached the point where he really doesn't care what everyone thinks about him.  He is out for doing what he thinks is best for America, not whats best for the social circle.  So if the other countries don't like it well, I'm sorry, but that is the way it is.  As soon as everyone begins to wake up and realize that we are all targets, we will be better off as a nation and a world.  If your President doesn't look after you first, then what good is he?  It's like having a dead beat dad...no thanks, I'll take GW!	Politics & Government

question_title: What are liberals Smoking? [SEP] question_content: Man something must be clogging thier brains, I was thinking pot, but I have met potheads with more common sense then the liberals of today. I sure do wish they wouldn't be so hard on fetuses and soft on terrorists. What a bunch of D-bags. [SEP] best_answer: It's not what they're smoking -- Libs just NEED to feel good about themselves.   I use to be a Democrat and somewhat liberal.  It made me feel good to be on the side of the party of the "common man."  It made me feel good to trash the "rich" Republicans.  It made me feel good to be for peace.  It made me feel good to be for equality.  It made me feel good to support social welfare programs.  Then I started reading and listening and thinking and I concluded that today's Democrats are not the Democrats that my parents and grandparents supported (and therefore I supported). They are more like Socialist who want the CENTRALIZED CONTROL OF AMERICA and a political-economic policy that boarders on communism.   The Socialist programs of the New Deal and The Great Society have failed for the most part and are destroying our country.  Now I am much more conservative, and a great deal worried.

question_title: WHY DOES THE BUSH FAMILY HAVE A HISTORY OF MAKING MILLlONS FROM AMERICA'S ENEMIES? [SEP] question_content: BEGINNING WITH PRESCOTT BUSH MAKING MILLIONS FROM THE NAZI'S TO GEORGE H.W.

IS THE BUSH FAMILY AN AMERICAN ENEMY ALSO?  THE FRIEND OF MY ENEMY IS NOT MY FRIEND. [SEP] best_answer: Because America's enemies are not Bush's enemies. Bush is oil, always has been, and always will be.  The oil industry transcends politics, because the money to be made in oil can literally make or break any countries economy.  Dont think for one second that Bush and Cheney have not gotten richer 10 fold because of this war.	Politics & Government

question_title: why would my brother need a guardian ad litem when he has a lawyer representing him in an estate claim? [SEP] question_content: He has been left a certain percentage but his mother now wishes to be his guardian ad litern any one know what benefit this would be for him or her [SEP] best_answer: A guardian ad litem (GAL) is an independent attorney or guardian appointed by the court to ensure that the interests of a minor or an incompetent person are being fully protected in a legal proceeding.  The court will appoint a GAL regardless of the fact that the minor or incompetent (called a ward) may have already retained legal representation on his or her own.  This is to ensure the ward is not unduly influenced to make a decision which doesn't really benefit him or herself. It doesn't end the realtionship between your brother and hs current attorney.  \n\nOnce the legal proceeding concludes, the GAL usually ceases in this capacity.  \n\nNext time your brother appears in court, tell him to ask the judge why he or she is appointing a GAL.  The judge will be glad to explain the whole process and answer any of his questions.  His lawyer should be able to explain it in more detail as well.  That's what he's being paid for.

[SEP] best_answer: The Navy does not have it within Basic Training, but we do have another program during "A" school that can lead to an honor promotion.\n\nIts called AAP, Accelerated Advancement Program.  If a student does exceptionally well, performs above and beyond what is expected of them, and passes a board of experienced sailors, he or she can reach their first command as an (E4) Third Class Petty Officer.\n\nSo, yes, the Navy has something close to that.

question_title: how much notice is a landlord required to give prior to entering an apartment according to North Carolina law? [SEP] question_content: my sister has an apartment in an upscale college complex, but recently came home to find that her apartment had been gone through, and they had found evidence of a pet on the property. They hung a "removal of pet" notice on her door. We understand that she was in breach of the contract, but we want to know if they unlawfully entered her apartment, and if there is anything we can do about it. She has a roommate that  doesnt actually live there, and sometimes this roommate's mother will come stay in her room, and we think that perhaps that is who complained about the pet. Her and the roommate do not get along. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I am not sure how N.C. law works exactly...but I can tell you how this would be resolved in Pa.  They probably aren;t that different regardless.  In Pa. a land lord is required to give 24 hours notice unless there is an emergency situation.  I do not see how a pet constitutes an emergency.  I'd also check your contract/lease, although I am sure that this is probably not listed.  As for the pet....your land lord has NO RIGHT to remove a pet of yours from the building.  None.  That is completely outrageous.  He can evict you for violating the lease.  He can ask you to remove the pet.  But he has absolutely no right at all to remove a pet from an apartment.  I'd sue.

[SEP] best_answer: Go to court. Wear a suit.  You can win if the officer who wrote the ticket doesn't show up. \n\nIf they do, you then just explain the facts.  REHEARSE this many times, get the sequence down right so it's clear, don't talk about irrelevant matters such as paint quality, get comfortable with the facts so when you suddenly realize where you are it doesn't matter.  Think about their questions "But part of your car WAS outside the space?"  and your answer "Your Honor, my car is a Toyota, with a wheelbase of x inches. The average midsize has a y inch wheelbase.  The space in question is Z inches, and the average space is Q.

question_title: Why does't America attack North Korea? [SEP] question_content: America attacked Iraq just because they possessed weapons of mass destruction.\nBut there were nothing. Then Bush have changed the reason of the war to liberating Iraqi from Saddam.\nAs you know, North Korea is making nuke weapons and Kim Jong-il oppresses people.\nActually many people has died from starvation.\nHow do you explain this kind of double standards. [SEP] best_answer: Well, considering that both North and South Korea still have their weapons aimed at each other, the window of opportunity just isn't there.  The terrain is god aweful, it's extremely cold and hot as hell.  The US forces alreay stationed there would take a huge hit and the capital of South Korea would cease to exist.  So lets hope no one gets too cavalier and lets diplomacy work things out.  If we're applauled by the loss of life with the war on terror, wait and see what happens if the Korean war resumes.  A little side not, the Korea's are technically still at war.  They have been under a cease fire for about fifty years, hence their weapons are still aimed at each other.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? [SEP] question_content: In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? [SEP] best_answer: By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at "SoundPolitics.com")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: "the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . "  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure "conspired" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that "there must be something to it".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this "conspiracy" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a "bubble" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much 	Politics & Government

The one Arab character in Altneuland, Reshid Bey, is very grateful to his Jewish neighbors for improving the economic condition of Palestine and sees no cause for conflict.\nThe name of Tel Aviv is the title given to the Hebrew translation of Altneuland by the translator, Nahum Sokolov. This name, which comes from Ezekiel 3:15, means tell — an ancient mound formed when a town is built on its own debris for thousands of years — of spring. The name was later applied to the new town built outside of Jaffa, which went on to become the second-largest city in Israel. Nearby is Herzliya, named in honor of Herzl.	Politics & Government

question_title: Does your gov't release immigrant convicted murderers, rapists and sex offenders back into your communities. [SEP] question_content: I live in good old England where our government has let a load of immigrant murderers and rapists loose on our streets (probably to reoffend) without once considering deportation to the sewers that they came from. I know Bush has got a marshmellow for a brain but even he isn't that stupid is he?? [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately yes, he is that stupid. Recently in Boston, MA we have a CONVICTED sex offender (raped school aged children) released for a weekend pass, go to FLORIDA, molested some other kids, came back to BOSTON and was fitted with a homing device so that they could finally track him while he lives in a house somewhere in my state. There are plenty of cases where they have constantly ignored the signs of a mentally ill person and only take action when they finally KILL someone but release them again when they feel they have paid their debts to society and they believe there is a chance that they will not re-offend. \n\nThanks alot for letting it be realized that this doesn't only happen in the U.S. I was starting to feel like maybe there is a good reason to hate this country.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: anyone who thinks that the world is overproducing food is just plain not paying attention. The current practices of food production in the world give us (or any living thing) about 40-80 more years of soil left for which to grow food in. If the practices of today's farmers are authenticated, then we can start "turning the clock back." To answer your question, the point was about 1940 when we overtook the earth's ability to provide for us. (think baby boomers). If we do things right, we can provide a healthy life for a pop'n of over 8 billion. Right now,only about 750 million people get adequately clean food and water.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: The Government has created a portal to help individuals who need benefits because of life events. Visit http://www.govbenefits.gov\n\nUse the drop down button\nDO YOU NEED BENEFITS BECAUSE OF A LIFE EVENT?\nChoose the life situation best applicable to you and then see if you qualify for the available government assistance.\n\nForget grant money - there's hardly any money for individuals. You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html	Politics & Government

question_title: Is it legal to  to place a dead body on ice in a coffin in an unsealed vault (think a vault was used) in N.C? [SEP] question_content: I heard someone died and was put on ice to keep while a grave was dug and a coffin made.And that the body was not embalmed but put in a pine box without a secure lid, (possibly in a vault that also was not sealed.)  Iam not sure if it truely happened or if I is just a hoax of some kind.  So is or was it legal to do?  I don't think it is. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know about putting a body on ice. But, it is not required that bodies be embalmed if they are buried within a certain amount of time, and if they are not taken across state lines. There is no requirement for a sealed vault (or, actually, any vault in a private cemetary; vaults really only exist to keep the weight of the soil from collapsing the coffin). There is no requirement for a sealed coffin for immediate burial; seals really don't serve any purpose except to make the deceased's family members feel better. When you're dead you decompose whether in a sealed or unsealed coffin.	Politics & Government

The position of Speaker is established in the U.S. Constitution and is the most senior officer of the House of Representatives (and the third most senior official in the entire federal government.) Institutionally, the Speaker holds broad-ranging powers and presides over debate in the House, makes rulings on points of order, has priority right of recognition on the floor, and sets the agenda by deciding what and when legislation comes before the House. In addition, the Speaker appoints task forces and commissions and oversees the management of support functions to the House. Finally, by modern practice, the Speaker serves as the primary spokesperson for his congressional party.\nSee also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\nHouse Majority Leader.

Their platform is where they stand on the issues, like abortion, federal spending, defense, etc.\n\nPolitical parties are also the vehicle for raising money for the candidates.

question_title: Why do people tend to support McCain when it comes to pork barrel spending? Explain use some logic? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Spending works during an econicmic depression. Try to use the depression and WWII and Roosevelts new deal program as an example. \n\nThe govt. built damns in Tenn and Hwys across the country, those projects gave jobs to people, the jobs gave them disposable income (money to sepnd on stuff you dont need) and it generated taxes to repay what the govt invested.\n\nThats why the govt builds bridges to nowhere, or may be they are just trying to rack up a few bucks for their contractor friends. \n\nThe point is that its justified if it serves a purpouse for the public and that the investment can be returned to the govt.\n\n\nIf this doesnt answer, be specific.

question_title: Doesn't the constitution teaches freedom OF religion, not freedom FROM religion? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For the ignorant, in the section:\n\n"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."\n\nThe word "respecting" DOES NOT mean reverence.  It means "with regard to", or "referring to".  Now read it again:\n\n"Congress shall make no law with regard to an establishment of religion," etc.\n\nIt means the government will not make laws establishing a religion.  How, unless one is disingenuous, dishonest, and a "liar for jeezus", can this infer that one religion is preferred over another, or that HAVING a religion is preferred to not having one at all?\n\nAdditional:\n\nLet me return the favour to "The_Dark_Knight" and say this:  To anyone who wants religion in government or schools, you can have it on one condition.  \n\nIt can be any religion EXCEPT your own.  Meaning, christians can't advocate christianity, it has to be something else - hinduism, buddhism, islam, etc.  \n\nThe problem is, the religious do not have the honesty or courage to say what they really mean.  When one says, "We should have religion in schools," what they mean is "We should have MY religion in schools".\n\nThe religious live under the delusion - or deliberate lie - that a secular state means an atheist state.  Wrong.  The most open and advanced countries (socially and scientifically) in history had both a religious population and a secular state.	Politics & Government
