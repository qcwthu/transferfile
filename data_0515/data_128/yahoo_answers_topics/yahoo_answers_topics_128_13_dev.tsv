question_title: why do women want big breasts? [SEP] question_content: men dont like fake rubber breasts, they are not attractive. ewww... cant even think about it [SEP] best_answer: They don't necessarily, but there's this idea out there that big ones are more attractive to men.  Yes, to some men, they are, but not all of us.  And to those of us who've had the unique clinical experience of showing a new mother now to nurse her infant, the sight of big ones tells us we're going to spend a bit more time with this young lady - it's harder for well-endowed girls to nurse than for those whose attributes are, shall we say, a touch more modest.  But even the most richly blessed girls can learn to nurse their babies successfully - it just demands more time and patience  to teach 'em.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I have watched this video and although it is very well put together, I do not believe any of it. Honestly people! Think about how much planning and people would have to be involved in what happened. Do you really think that in the year that Bush had been president his administration could have coordinated something like that?

question_title: Who gets to decide what's an extraordinary claim? [SEP] question_content: If extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, who gets to decide which claims are ordinary and which are extraordinary? [SEP] best_answer: Well. pretty much as a rule, the whole of humanity decides what's ordinary and what isn't. Technically if you want it written in stone you'll have to do a world-wide poll, including every living person. That's not really feasible, though.\n\nEdit: I disagree. You have to be reasonable, you can't expect everything to be perfect, you really can't. You have to declare something sensibly "ordinary" or "extraordinary" and realise that no matter what there's always going to be those few  who are going to disagree, no matter what. By the standard of perfect, everything is "meaningless" because nothing is perfect.	Society & Culture

The church I was raised in teaches that Jesus is the son of God, while other religions believe he was a prophet.  Some believe Mary, being the mother of Jesus more important than others.

question_title: Catholics say Peter was the first Pope? [SEP] question_content: Why do Catholics not follow after Peter's teachings if he indeed was their first Pope? Or is it just a matter of...that being history and time has passed and things have changed and you don't have to follow his teachings anymore?\n\nPeter said everyone needs to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nNot all catholics have the Holy Ghost, because tongues is given as proof to that and they don't speak in tongues.\nAlso, from what I know they don't baptize in Jesus name...but Peter said to baptize that way.\n\nNot only that, but again...from what I've heard, Catholics pray to Mary and...other various dead people. Why? "Have no other God's before me" and other scriptures say that same thing, yet Catholics PRAY to dead people!\nI know any catholic I've talked to in person cannot describe why they "believe" the way they believe, but they cannot be the first church as they say cuz they don't follow the ways of the first church in the bible. [SEP] best_answer: Well  to start off with NO man other than Jesus had primacy over the Christian   Congregation   as Acts  15:1-29  brings out  when a disagreement over the issue of circumcission  arose they didnt say lets see  what peter has to say   but the matter was brought to the Apostles and older men and they discussed and prayed over the matter and then  announced THEIR   DECISSION  for the Congregations     also  the Bible  clearly says   that there is ONE  MEDIATOR  BETWEEN  GOD  AND MAN   CHRIST  JESUS  .....!!!!!!!  1st Tim 2:5   and why would any one pray to dead people to start with  as the Bible plainly says   that is  futile   Ecc9:5,10   and Ezekiel  18:4   the whole idea of some pope  did  not exhist in the Christian  Congregation   and it was some 4-500   years   after the death of peter and the other Apostles     and then there is the matter of all the statues and  immages , puictures that people pray to  why when the Bible cleary condems such   un Christian practices    Ex 20:1-17,  Lev   26:1  2nd Cor 6:16,    1st John 5:21   Isa 44:13-19   Jer  10:14,15,   Ps  115: 4-8   Deut   4:25,26  1st Cor 10:14,19-22    Rev 21 :8  really sums it up    and as a bit of icing on the proverbial cake  we have Matt 23 :5-9   hope this helps    best wishes   Gorbalizer	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: my wife and i took a meal to an elderly woman that basically lives at a bus stop at the local shopping center. i was'nt really aware of this person until my wife suggest that we take a meal to her on Thanksgiving Day. so we took her a meal and i gave her twenty dollars. but ican't stop thinking that there has to be more that we could do. we are by no means wealthy people, is there any place that we could call to help this poor woman? [SEP] best_answer: I've always thought, maybe, if they are willing, to have help to find a way to get training to be a live-in nanny or caregiver... they could get a room to live in, a home to share, and an income at a relatively easy job.  I've hired caregivers imported from eastern Europe and from Philippines, and there are other households who need this service too, so why not develop this idea to help the homeless people get a decent place to stay and a beginner's job back in the workforce.  In the long run, they could gather self-confidences and respect, and employment skills and save money and if they want, develop some further career.	Society & Culture

question_title: One stupid question? [SEP] question_content: If something is \n"total price of the item including discount " does that mean that it includes the discount, or that the discount has been  subtracted? [SEP] best_answer: In accounting, the discount would be written with a minus sign in fron of it, meaning that the discount is negative, because it is designed to reduce the price.  With me so far?  When you add all the numbers together, the negative ones do not add but actually subtract.  Simple rules of arithmetics.  Plus (+) and minus (-) become minus (-), minus (-) and minus (-) become plus.  \n\nBut generally, whenever someone says something is included, think of it that whatever action had to be taken, was already taken with respect to that item.

question_title: What would happen if Christians followed the whole Bible? [SEP] question_content: Is there so many denominations because Christians pick different parts of the Bible to follow while ignoring others? How does one determine which parts to ignore? [SEP] best_answer: It isn't that they 'follow' certain parts of the bible as much as apply the blessings promised in the bible.\nToday, christians rarely trouble themselves with what requirements are involved when desiring god's gifts. Rather, they arbitrarily 'save themselves' through a false hope that all they need is 'faith'.\n But as I have observed time and again on this forum, their is little to no substance to the claims of salvation.\nIf one expects to receive the blessings of everlasting life, but disregards the effort of studying the word of god to find out what is acceptable to him, than, it is ludicrous to think that god will just somehow toss aside his own requirements to accommodate all the lazy people with their unrealistic expectations.\nThe simple truth? denominations are proof of deceitful men drawing men to follow themselves, thus putting a stumbling block in the path of weak minded persons to full of apathy as regards their own wish for eternal life.

I think I need to get out more.Anyways my question is What can I do to keep my mind off of shit like this? please someone help. [SEP] best_answer: Maybe ur jealous of her. If ur b/f  ares about u and wants to be with u, then I don't think he would leave u, I guess u got a try and trust ur b/f. If u call her then its just gonna make u look bad. Probably sound better if ur b/f ask her him self to stop flirting with him. But don't start forcing ur b/f to tell her to leave him alone. I dunno how u stop being jealous of people.

question_title: what is the controversy about The Da Vinci Code all About ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Ok, the book is about a 2000 year old secret that the church hid.  The secret is that Jesus was Married to Marry Magdaline, and the church made her out to be a prostitute to slander her image.  The book (and thereby the movie) is fiction, but it's based on the claims and theories of prominant historians and Biblical scholars.  The story gives you some interesting food for thought.  The reason that it's so contraversial is Christians find the whole idea of Jesus being a sexual person with a wife and children appalling, yet they can't disprove the claims.  The claims and theories may be true or they may be false, but the idea that the church has been lying for nearly 2000 years frightens some people and outrages others.  'If the church was lying about that,' they think 'what else could they have lied about?'  This frighten's the church authority.  If people stop beliving in the authority of the church, many church authorities will soon be out of a job.  Others belive that without a church authority to look up to, people will begin behaving like animals.  Most people just look at it as a great book (movie) with topics that may or may not be true.

question_title: Why is China so heavily populated? [SEP] question_content: Why do they have so many kids in such a small country? It's kinda sad! [SEP] best_answer: Before there was birth control, it was normal when you had lots of children (5,7,9,10...). But in the previous century the Chinese government introduced birth control because there were getting too much Chinese: you couldn't get more then one child. For each child "extra" you have to pay more taxes.	Society & Culture
question_title: Which is correct? [SEP] question_content: One: How long after you date a man, he is allowed to kiss you.\nTwo: After How long you date a man, he is allowed to kiss you. [SEP] best_answer: The clause "how long after you date a man" is the correct one, however, as several people pointed out, the second part should be in question form: "is he allowed to kiss you?"\n\nHowever, at least according to dating behaviour in my culture (I'm Canadian, Catholic but not especially religious--I've also been with my husband for years), it doesn't make much sense. The question implies that you and the man have one date, and then at some point after that one date (the question is asking how long after) he is allowed to kiss you. Presumably the idea is really: "How long after you start dating a man".\n\nNow, if you are the one doing the allowing (as opposed to, for example, your parents or a chaperone), it would be better to ask "do you allow him to kiss you?"--but again, that may depend on your culture.\n\nSo in the end: How long after you start dating a man, is he allowed to kiss you?\n\nOr else: How long after you start dating a man, do you allow him to kiss you?

question_title: Where would we be without stupid people? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Stupid people have long been a part of society and will continue to be so until human engineering erases stupidity from the human genome (unlikely anytime soon).  So, without stupid people, the world would be a much more boring place.  For example, there would be much fewer funny videos on the internet without stupid people.  Furthermore, we would not have such a diverse society in the United States without stupid people.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, without stupid people, it would be close to impossible for anyone to get into a good college.	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: Respond as if you were the person they are looking for. If your number is mistaken for a pizza delivery number, then take their order, and, of course, never deliver it. If they call you again for their pizza, tell them they have the wrong number.\n\nOr if your number is mistaken for a home number, and they ask to talk with someone, say that person is not at home but you can take the message for them. When they spend hours waiting for the person to call back, they'll learn they had the wrong number.	Society & Culture
question_title: If it were indisputably proven that people are born gay, would you re-examine your beliefs about god? [SEP] question_content: This is obviously directed at those who claim homosexuality is a choice because their god allegedly disapproves of it. [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure where it is "in God's word" that states homosexuality is a choice.  I laugh when people want to stand on the Bible as their grounds for spouting nonsense or uneducated "answers" which we are supposed to then accept as factual.  Some of the answers to your question thus far seem to fit into the "nonsense and uneducated" category.  I was born gay, and I've had to re-evaluate my own beliefs about God.  I had a sister to die suddenly, and I've had to re-visit and re-structure my relationship with God.  I lost a job because I'm gay (don't know how they found that out), and I then had to re-examine my trust in God.	Society & Culture

question_title: 6th sense info? [SEP] question_content: Can anybody here tell me  what  the signs of somebody having the 6th sense are?oh and is there any sight that talks about a persong and the 6th sense? [SEP] best_answer: I believe a lot of people are very aware of their sixth sense.  (It's not the ability to see ghost as the movie implies).  A sixth sense is an awareness of something that isn't right or can be very right - I usually refer to it as my Holy spirit warning since I am a Christian (and not just the go to church type - even though I do - and tout it as a religious symbol of what a great person I am - because I'm only saved by the grace of God - it's not anything I've done on my own).

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Basically saying that Jesus was married and had a child with Mary Magdalene...that's the big "secret."

And they say that the Holy Grail is not a cup...but rather it is the tomb of Mary Magdalene herself.	Society & Culture

question_title: Will he think I am a crazy girl? [SEP] question_content: He was 29, I was 16. My mom found out and turned him in. It has been 15 yrs. and when I see him in public he looks like he wants to talk to me or he would like to run for his life. I am not sure which. I wrote him a letter apologizing for any grief that I have caused him in his life. I sent it via his brother, he is married now and I do not want to cause problems there. I left no return address or phone number. I am not looking to speak to him, I just needed some closure. [SEP] best_answer: What, did he rape you? If not, who cares? 16 year olds don't look much different than 18 year olds, it's a little wierd but not pedo. In some places (yes, even in this country, I believe) it's legal to have sex at 16. If he didn't rape you and you were a willing participant in laying the guy, it's your mom that caused him grief. \n\nHe might still have a love for you, just afraid. He might not think you're crazy or any such thing, and he might even send something back. As long as his wife doesn't find the letter, he should be fine.\n\nBy the way, why did your mom bother to have him arrested? I would have just let it lie. It was probably a bunch of stress and trouble for no reason. Ah well. Good luck, girl.	Society & Culture
question_title: Before eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, A&E didn't know the difference, so how could they sin [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Every human person is endowed with a spiritual soul, with intellect and with free will. Man is rational and therefore like God; he is created with free will and is master over his acts. \n\nGod created man in his image and established him in his friendship. A spiritual creature, man can live this friendship only in free submission to God. The prohibition against eating "of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" spells this out: "for in the day that you eat of it, you shall die." The "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" symbolically evokes the insurmountable limits that man, being a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust. Man is dependent on his Creator, and subject to the laws of creation and to the moral norms that govern the use of freedom. \n\nAlthough set by God in a state of rectitude man, enticed by the evil one, abused his freedom at the very start of history. Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his heart and, abusing his freedom, disobeyed God's command. He lifted himself up against God, and sought to attain his goal apart from him. By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings.	Society & Culture

question_title: Possible for a human to go thru life without ever? [SEP] question_content: masturbating? [SEP] best_answer: Biologically, it's certainly possible.\n\nPsychologically, it's not as feasible.  An adult can be disciplined enough to abstain from such behavior (though this is difficult), but trying to get a teenager or pubescent youth to refrain from such activity is unreasonable.  There are too many hormonal changes occuring, and the feelings / experiences are too new.  I'd say if people are honest, the percentage of the human race that's ever gone their whole lives into adulthood without masturbating would be 1-2%, at best.	Society & Culture

Matthew 18:19-20 \n\n"And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.

I was also asking myself if what I am doing was right cause I don't want to get into numerology and the like. \nYou can do a google search of "GEMATRIA" and you will find a lot of resources dealing with that matter. Now my focus is on Heaven, the angels and God's kingdom. I have found an incredible website www.angelfocus.com. I now understand how God is the mastermind of Government and Organization.

question_title: Why is there less racism in other countries than   in the United States ? [SEP] question_content: People in Europe seem to enjoy every gift of life. [SEP] best_answer: What makes you think that?  In France, the streets are full of protesters who think that the French laws discriminate against arabs, and other foreigners.  The fact that the US confronts it's racism, even imperfectly, is better than the French hiding their collective heads in the sand.\nAnd, have you ever observed how black are received, and treated, in Germany?\n\nTravel in europe, and if you get away from the tourist traps, you will see that there is greater racism and predjudice in Europe, against Albanians, Serbs, africans, and anyone who is not 'European'.  And in Germany, the backlash against East Germans is growing.  \nIt is very similar to the Latin workers in America, except the most countries in Europe do not have the explicit ant-discrimination laws that are in force in the US.\nBe careful when painting with a broad brush.  The situation in the US is not perfect, but at least we talk about it.	Society & Culture
question_title: Does accepting God require a leap of faith? [SEP] question_content: I've been struggling with this issue for years now. It seems to me that blind acceptance of God only cheapens the spiritual relationship because it removes independent thought from the process. However, taking a leap of faith and accepting God without really believing is equally disingenuous. I want to have more faith, but I don't know how to get there.\n\nPS: I'm not interested in being talked out of religion, my athiest family tried that for 30 years and I doubt there's an angle I haven't heard. [SEP] best_answer: well, faith is all about being able to believe in something without physical proof of it existing. logically, that doesnt make sense. but, thats what faith is about. anyone can have faith in something when its right in front of you with the answers spelled out. but to be realistic, the bible doesnt explain everything. and it contradicts what we know is scientifically proven. but thats just it, you've independantly thought about this, and questioned it, you obviously werent brainwashed into anything. and if you want to believe in it, it sounds like you're ready. if you decide not to, thats cool too. i can understand that.\n\nto me, faith is about saying "i believe theres more to existence than what we understand right now".

question_title: Why when I say I am a christian do you hear I am saying I am a saint? [SEP] question_content: I am a christian....meaning I believe and accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior. I pray to God in Jesus name to help me do the things that he would have me to do to be the best mother daughter wife and friend.  me saying I am a christian does not mean I am saying i am perfect nor a saint. It does not mean I am in the church everytime the doors are open and never have any fun. It means just as I said before. I have known many people who do not believe and they are very nice people who don't kill babies cats or virgins. Not all Christians look down there noses at others...judging them for their sleeping arangments.  NO ONE IS SO PERFECT THAT THEY CAN JUDGE OTHERS!!! I have done things in my 34 years that if I were a catholic...I would have some serious Hail Mary's to do! Not perfect...just forgiven. [SEP] best_answer: it tis the christians themselves who try to give people the perception of being perfect so blame them.	Society & Culture
question_title: Question for everyone in here, what ideas of science/religion do we agree on, the users of y/a religion sectio [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Murder is heinous, and unless you are doing so in self defense it is against every one of our basic tenets is this country.\n\nThe thought that it is acceptable under any other circumstance is just another erosion of our society, that Satan is using to bring us down to his level.  Abortion, the death penalty, battered wife syndrome.  All deceptions of the fact that life taken is murder.  There is a more excellent way to achieve the same results for all of the above issues.  Birth control, adoption, life imprisonment or restitution, education and domestic abuse awareness and programs and housing.  \n\nMurder starts way back at a lack of control, and hatred.  We need to look at those things before the are taken to the level of murder.  There are actual steps, levels of self deception in a way, that lead to murder.\n\nThinking that an eye for an eye, will somehow ease the pain of those left behind.  Thinking that you may pay with your life, has yet to be effective in controlling capital crimes.  Thinking an abortion solves the issues, usually it only starts more issues.  I am in agreement, murder is wrong.\n\nIf you do not want to debate science in the faith and religious aspects of those, then do not enter this category.  It amazes me everyday, that ppl do not see God in science, as He created everything.  There are many things in this universe that can not be explained in evolutionary terms, many!  Denying that science can't answer all the questions, is just wrong.  Faith based individuals say that of course we can't answer all the questions, that is how God set things up so we have to look to Him for the real answers.\n\nBy the way, best question you have ever asked Mr Darwin.

I may be wrong, but my perception is, it gives them a false sense of "power" for the moment they speak it out during anger.  Your thoughts? [SEP] best_answer: That's exactly it.  It gives them a false sense of power.  Calling upon the Creator of the universe's Son to damn what you damn is really what they're doing.  That's why it's called taking His name in vein.  Because you're using His name to damn something that's (most likely) not damned.  Make sense?	Society & Culture

Luckily for Moses, his Egyptian wife Zipporah "took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.

question_title: What is the difference between Evangelical Christians and standard Christians? I was told they are different.? [SEP] question_content: Does the Evengelical faith base itself on something other then the Bible?  If it does then I can understand it being a cult as I have been told and even read.  But I would like more details about what exactly is the difference. [SEP] best_answer: "Traditional" christians are usually quieter in expressing their faith....they are less outspoken, and just live their lives according to their beliefs. They do not tend to "share" their faith. This does not mean they are less devoted than "evangelical" christians who are more expressive, and who do believe in sharing the faith with others. Both can be equally devout, and believe in the same doctrines, but just express in different ways. Cults are typically complete deviations from accepted doctrines.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why is anti catholic hate speech tolerated.? [SEP] question_content: Why is it politically correct to slander the Catholic church in movies, television, the press and on the web when the same hate speech would not be tolerated against any other group? [SEP] best_answer: Other religions are bashed all the time, don't feel singled out.  It is true that christians are bashed alot, but that is because the general public feels that christians are the most repressive of other religions.  Pagans(so called heathens), Afgani's religion ( so called towl heads), even buddists catch crud.  Most especially pagans, even over christians.  So don't feel bad, and don't feel like it's only christians, everyone else gets it too, even in movies.  The best way to be, is a accepting, caring, good christian, and not let it get to you.  Everyone has free speach, even people you don't want to listen to, and freedom of religion applies to all religion, so get used to it.	Society & Culture

question_title: Has anyone heard of a band called, "The Walkmen"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Walkmen are an indie rock band from New York City. The band formed with three members from Jonathan Fire Eater which had recently disbanded and two members from The Recoys in 2000. The group comprises of Hamilton Leithauser (vocals, guitar), Paul Maroon (guitar, piano), Walter Martin (organ), Peter Bauer (bass) and Matt Barrick (drums). Their sound is made unique with the use of vintage musical instruments, most famously the clangy upright piano, and through the use of their self-designed recording studio Marcata Recording, which uses analog recording equipment.\n\nThe 2002 debut album Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone was well received by critics for its experimental approach and progressive sound. The track "We've Been Had" from Everyone Who Pretended... was used on a television commercial for the Saturn Ion. The follow up album Bows and Arrows, was released in 2004 and was listed by many critics as one of the year's best albums while embracing a less whimsical, experimental sound than the previous album. Several songs were featured on the Fox television program The O.C., including "What's in It for Me?", "The Rat" and "Little House of Savages".\n\nBows and Arrows was released on the Record Collection label from Warner Bros, in contrast to the independent label Startime that released Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone.\n\nTheir next album, A Hundred Miles Off, will be released in the US on May 23rd. The band premiered most of the new songs on a tour of the Northeast in early 2006. Confirmed song titles for the upcoming album include "Good for You's Good for Me," "All Hands and the Cook," "Lost in Boston," and "This Job Is Killing Me."\n\n2006 may also see the release of another full-length offering by the Walkmen: a re-recording of Harry Nilsson and John Lennon's drug-fueled Pussy Cats album from 1974.

question_title: Only for Beatles' connoisseurs; who can "Boob" be? [SEP] question_content: I recently bought a strange Russian CD called "The Alternate Yellow Submarine" which has some strange and previously unreleased versions, not only from Yellow Submarine album. There is one very strange version of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" which starts being sung in a very weird voice. All the information the CD provides about it is " Unreleased version, first verse is sung by Boob, different lyrics".\n I'll appreciate serious answers, thank you. [SEP] best_answer: The Alternate Yellow Submarine is most likely a direct clone of a album of the same title that was published by a company called Pear. As you probably know already, it is a bootleg with unofficial recordings. As is often the case with Pear (and thus all direct clones), the material they offer is not of the best available quality. But we take what we get... \n\nAnyway, as for the Lucy in the Sky you speak of, it is RM20, i.e. a mono mix of take 20. It is indeed an alternate take that was to be used in the Yellow Submarine motion picture, nevertheless, it was never used. The first verse was supposed to be sung by the character Nowhere Man (or, as they call him, Boob) from the film (the blue-greyish little creature, remember?) and hence, the hilarious voice with the manic laugh.

question_title: Where can I get a copy of the theme and bumper musics from Whoopi Goldberg's early-nineties talk show? [SEP] question_content: For about a year in the early 1990's, Whoopi Goldberg had her own half-hour talk show for about a season.  The show never had a studio audience, and it always focused on a single guest for each half-hour.\n\nThe opening and bumper musics were these jazzy numbers, and I believe the credits said that they were created by Robbie Robertson.  However, I have yet to find copies of these pieces anywhere, and even the die-hard Whoopi Goldberg fans I've contacted have no idea what the pieces were titled, or where to get copies of them.\n\nIdeally I'd like to buy a CD with the pieces on them, but if the mp3s are out there and they're the only way to get copies of the music, I'll take what I can get.

question_title: How can handwarmers be made at home? [SEP] question_content: There are handwarmers for sale at places like walmart during the winter months that advertise being made entirely of natural compounds. They heat up to about 120F average and last for around 6 hours. How would someone go about making this at home so as to create something like a shoe insert that heats up? [SEP] best_answer: You could fill a sock with rice or buckwheat, heat it in the microwave for 90 seconds or so and it should provide nice heat for one to two hours.  It's not a chemical handwarmer if that's what you wanted, but it would work. You could react muriatic acid (available in hardware stores) with lye (some oven cleaners) and it would warm up, but I wouldn't recommend it, as you're dealing with HCl and NaOH, both caustic chemicals that will burn you if not careful.  But when they are mixed, it is a pretty exothermic reaction, but not really nontoxic per se.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Wat happens inside SCR when it goes frm forward block 2 on state,wat is d physics behind this? [SEP] question_content: I want actually to know how depletion regions r being affected because of d regenerative process of increasin alphas that leads to d increase in anode current and this process continues to happen until thyristor is driven to the on state. [SEP] best_answer: I have been taught by my old-timer physics teacher that an SCR is a diode with an insulating space between the P and N layers.  This insulating space is the gate.  An electric field exists when no voltage is applied to the gate, keeping the forward-biased diode from conducting.  But a small current injected into the gate breaks down the field keeping the diode off.  An avalanche between the P and N junctions then commences and the SCR is ON.  The feild cannot reestablish itself until the SCR is REVERSE biased and the gate current is brought to Zero.	Science & Mathematics

It is the ratio of two lengths such that the ratio between the longer and the shorter length is the same as the ratio between the whole and the longer length.\n\nIf a rectangle is constructed with these ratio's, it can be iteratively subdivided into smaller and smaller golden rectangles, forming an arithmetic spiral. This spiral, when copied and rotated 180 degrees, is the shape that all spiral galaxies take.\n\nPhi is related to the fibonacci sequence. 99% of sunflowers have a fibonnoci number of seeds arranged in this spiral shape.\n\nPhi is approximately the ratio between the lengths of one bone in the finger and the next.\n\nThe list goes on... too tired right now to remember more\n\nEdit - holy crap, I didn't know that about the bees. Mind so blown right now.\n\nAlso Edit - Gardener's book deals mostly with very loose claims that certain peices of ancient archetecture incorporates knowledge of the number Phi. His points are well thought out and thorough, and have discredited many specious claims about Phi's use in this area. However, the physical manifestations of Phi are very real and undeniable.

question_title: what is the meaning of remote sensing? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is a fascinating subject that is rarely discussed.  I have read supposedly legitimate reports that both the United States and the Soviet Union have employed people with so-called "remote sensing" capabilities to locate distant people and places.\n\nFor example, the government is looking for a new chemical factory.  One program I saw showed a dramatization in which the "remote seers" were put in a room, and hour by hour they would come closer and closer to pinpointing the exact location of what was being sought.\n\nDouble blind tests were done, and if the reports are true, remote sensing is a legitimate psychic phenomena.  When the remote seers located the desired person or object, the amount of detail provided by them was amazing.  These psychics claim the ability to actually see in their mind's eye the object of the search.  They produced drawings, sometimes showing very concrete details that could not be racked up to coincidence.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: A circular can is to hold 60 cubic inches. Find the dimensions of the can that minimize amount of metal used.? [SEP] question_content: please also state the variables and the givens. Thank you. [SEP] best_answer: Circular cans cannot hold any cubic inches because a circle is a two dimensional object, and cubic inches require three dimensions to exist.  However, this already minimizes the amount of metal used, because all metals are three dimensional objects, so a circular can would also not contain any metal.\n\nWhat you need is a cylindrical can.

question_title: how is it that living things(ie. clams and penguins) have been carbon-dated as being thousands of years old? [SEP] question_content: i have heard these examples used in arguments contesting the accuracy of carbon-14 dating. if this dating method is truly inaccutate then why are we teaching it to our children? [SEP] best_answer: Carbon dating works because carbon decays at a constant speed (half life) and it is a very important science for our kids to learn. Any radioactive element in the world decays under this principle, Plutonium etc.\n\nThe way it works is that every living being, clam or human is made of carbon and generates it through life. When we die, our production stops. This creates an accurate start point. If we are found in 4006, scientists knowing the half life of C-14 and the carbon present in our body, can calculate that our body is 'roughly' 2000 years old. That is as accurate as archilogists need to be.\n\nSo, accuracy is relative. Believe it or not, when an archiologists states that a 'clam' is 5,000 years old plus or minus 200 years, this is considered extremely accurate. Are you saying that clams and penguins were not around thousands of years ago? :)\n\nHope this helps.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is a Sable an antelope ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Sable Antelope (Hippotragus niger) is an antelope that inhabits wooded savannah in East Africa south of Kenya, and in Southern Africa. There are two subspecies: H. n. niger which is considered low risk conservation dependent and the Giant Sable Antelope (H. n. varani) of central Angola which is classified as critically endangered.\n\nThe Sable Antelope stands 120 to 140 centimetres at the shoulder and weigh 200 to 270 kilograms, males being larger than females. Female Sable Antelope are chestnut to dark brown darkening as they mature while males are very distinctively black. Both sexes have a white underbelly, white cheeks and a white chin. They have a shaggy mane on the back of their neck. Sable antelope have ringed horns which arch backward, in females these can reach a meter, but in males they can reach over one and a half meters.\n\nSable Antelope live in wooded savannah where they eat mid-length grass and leaves. They are diurnal but are less active during the heat of the day. Sable Antelope form herds of ten to thirty females and calves led by a single male. Sable Antelope males will fight among themselves; they drop to their knees and use their horns.\n\nThe sable antelope was one of the national emblems of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).\n\nThe sable antelope was also introduced into Texas as game in private ranches	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why are sharks such fast swimmers? (no stupid answers/people please.)? [SEP] question_content: its for my homework. lol. [SEP] best_answer: The answer is a combination of several factors.\n\nThe skin is designed so as to limit "wrinkling" while swimming. (hydrodynamics) If u look at the skin closely, they consist of placoid scales which r smooth in one direction (swimming direction), and rough in the other direction.\n\nSharks r seriously buffed up, which aids in generating work.\n\nFins stabilise the body to prevent it from swimming upside down or in a circle\n\nThey belong to the chondrichthyes... cartilaginous fishes. This skeletal system is lighter than boney frames and allows for greater flexibility. Both characteristics COULD help in swimming. (There r, however, many fast marine animals with boney frames such as the dolphin or swordfish).\n\nThe tail is the main propulsion force. Which works in coordination with it's respiratory and circulatory system. As water passes over the gills, the lamellae r oxygenated, and at the same time release waste products (co2). So, if the shark swims slowly, the respiration rate decreases... and if he doesn't swim at all, he suffocates. I guess sharks swim fast because they have to. Haha. I hope that's helpful.

question_title: Cloudy fish tank? [SEP] question_content: I have two goldfish and an algea eater in a 30 gallon tank.  After 3 years the water has turned cloudy and no matter what I do it stays cloudy.  Up until a few weeks ago it was always crystal clear. [SEP] best_answer: I recommend getting a suction tube to clean out the rocks. These are inexpensive plastic tubes that you can use to remove sediment from the rocks. Remove as much sediment as you want, while trying to avoid disturbing the rest of the tank, or stir up sediment into the water.\n\nAlso, I recommend a weekly 10% water change. Make sure that the new water is the same temperature and hardness as the existing water.\n\nSince your tank's water is overly dirty, you may want to perform additional water changes. However, changing too high a % of water at one time can be detrimental to the fishs' health. Perhaps 10% daily water changes can be recommended at the most.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: where do tears came from and how are they made? [SEP] question_content: i know they came from eyes but is it from the front back underneith [SEP] best_answer: Tears partly come from a gland that is located above your eyeball and towards your ear in each eye.  It is called the lacrimal gland.  This gland creates the water part of your tears.  It is this gland that gets activated when something irritates your eye or when you are emotionally "revved up" enough to start crying.  It is simply a system of nerves connected to the gland that cause it to start forming tears.  \n\nThere is what is called a tear film that is constantly covering your eye.  The film is not just made of water - oil and mucus are also part of the tear film.  The mucus' job is to keep the water "stuck" to the front of your eye, and the oil's job is to keep the water from evaporating off of your eye.  When people's eyes start to water excessively, the eye is only creating an excess of the watery part of that tear layer, as explained above.  Hope this helps!	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how scientists get power from atoms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: By power, i assume you mean "energy over time"\nWhen an atom such as uranium is 'split' by bombarding the nucleus with high energy neutrons, it forms two nuclei with lower masses than the uranium. There is, however, a mass defect - a "missing mass" that gives rise to an energy output via\nE = mc^2\nBy harnessing this energy, scientists can use it to generate electricity, a bit like in a regular coal-fired power station.\n\nThere! you finally know how to use Einstein's famous equation!!

question_title: DO you believe in the Big Crunch? [SEP] question_content: The Big Crunch theory proposes that the universe, that began expanding with the Big Bang, will collapse in on itself with increasing speed. According to the theory, this collapse of the universe will continue until the universe has lost all its mass and turned into a single point of infinite density.\nScientists believe the creation of the universe began with a huge explosion. From this point, the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists say that when the mass of the universe has reached a sufficient level, this expansion will come to an end because of gravity, causing the universe to collapse in on itself. \nIt is also believed that the contracting universe will end in a fierce heat and contraction known as the "Big Crunch." This would lead to the end of all forms of life as we know them. [SEP] best_answer: it would seem logical that it would.  everyting in nature seems to go in cycles, wouldn't this be the ultimate in recycling?  everything back to where it begun?  it makes sense to me , but sadly not yet backed up by empirical evidence, not yet anyway...

question_title: what is a mosfet(electronic component) n what it does? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor.  It's the basic component of most electronic circuits and all digital ones.  It's the breakthrough that made computers so cheap, small and popular.  A transistor, you know, acts as an electrical "gate," acting on a smaller input voltage to allow a larger voltage to pass through.  So a transistor can act as an amplifier, by using a smaller current to control a larger current.  Used in a circuit called a "flip-flop," it makes up the basic circuit for computers and other digital electronics.\n\nThere are many kinds of transistors, dating all the way back to vacuum tubes; the reason MOSFETs are such a big deal is because they are made by "printing," in huge quantities and on extremely small scales, directly onto microchips.

question_title: how do sponges carry out essientail fuctions? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Within a sponge, there is an intriguing body structure. While the sponge functions as a unified organism, each cell is a division of its own mini-organism. Essentially, a sponge is a combination of billions of cells that function together. Within the body of the sponge, several processes occur which are vital to its welfare. Most importantly, sponges conduct the processes of respiration, digestion, protection, development, and reproduction. \n\nAll of these processes are generated by the consistent filtration of the water encompassing it. Through an intricate system of incurrent and afferent ducts, it processes food, oxygen, and other useful materials. The exterior layer of skin is covered in pinacocytes, which open the afferent ducts. In addition, the afferent ducts allow water to be transferred through the porocytes. The functions of the afferent ducts are regulated by the myocytes, muscular cells that permit them to open and close. After this the water travels through the incurrent ducts. \n\nWithin the system of incurrent ducts, water is processed for useful materials. The interior layer of tissue forces the water through the ostioles into chambers lined with choanae and flagellates. Eventually, water is directed towards the atrial cavity. After the water is processed through the atrial cavity and removed of a sufficient amount of oxygen, it is released through the osculum. The osculum is a relatively maximized opening in the body of the sponge. At this point in filtration, waste water will be ejected.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How did the first life forms know light existed and the need to develope light sensitive organs: eyes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No life form "knew" that there was any need to develop eyes. At some point after life first appeared on Earth, an accidental mutation in some organism caused certain nerve endings to become light sensitive. This new trait increased the survival probability for this species which means it produced more copies of itself than other species without the mutation. Over a very long period of time, this first primitive "eye" mutated even more, gradually evolving into the modern eye.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why respiratory alkalosis do not occur in children in cases of aspirin poisoning? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I'm an MD...\nACUTE aspirin overdose causes acid-base imbalance in two ways.  To understand this, you need to have a basic understanding of acidosis/alkilosis in the body.  (skip this if you allready know it!)\nI'll keep it simple - there are two places in the body that affect your acid-base balance, your kidneys and your lungs.  \nYour kidney can increase/decrease the amount of bicarbonate (a natural base) produced or reabsorbed over the course of hours-days.  When this goes haywire, its called a METABOLIC acidosis (decreased bicarb) or alkilosis (increased bicarb).\nYour lungs can increase/decrease the amount of carbon dioxide (a natural acid when dissolved) that you get rid of in ventilation.  By increasing or decreasing your breathing rate, you therefor adjust your body's pH in a matter of minutes.  When this goes haywire, its called a RESPIRATORY acidosis (decreased or hypo-ventilation) or alkilosis (increased or hyper-ventilation).\nWhen either of these two goes wrong, the body tries to use the other to compensate.  So when you have kidney failure, causing a primary metabolic acidosis, the respiratory center  in the medulla makes you HYPOventilate to breath off less CO2 to help compensate.  This compensation is fast over a matter of minutes.  Vice versa can also occur when the kidney compensate for the lungs, but this takes longer, of a matter of hours-days.\n\nOK! Back to aspirin.  Aspirin is unique for a couple reasons.  First of all it has an entirely different effect if it is one large acute overdose vs a chronicly high level.  Secondly, in an acute overdose, aspirin causes an acidosis by TWO mechanisms - a primary metabolic AND primary respiratory acidosis.  How?  Aspirin causes metabolic acidosis and simultaneously inhibites the medulla's respiratory drive center causing respiratory acidosis.  This is seen in adults as well as children.  Children should use tylenol instead of aspirin, however, due to its loose association with a terrible desease known as Reye's Sydrome.\n\nBOTTOM LINE - Aspirin blocks compensatory respiratory alkalosis in children and adults by suppressing our medullary respiratory drive center.\n\nAcute Aspirin Toxicity:\n    * Uncompensated Respiratory Acidosis\n    * Cause: Huge amout of Aspirin causes medullary inhibition --> Hypoventilaion --> increase of Serum CO2 --> respiratory acidosis\n    * Moreover, the kidneys are normally excreting bicarbonate products (alkali in nature) --> more acidosis (metabolic now).\n    * This leads to severe uncompensated acidosis\n\nChronic Aspirin Toxicity:\n    * Compensated Respiratory Alkalosis\n    * Cause: Mild accumulation of Aspirin over time causes medullary stimulation > hyperpnea --> excretion of more CO2 --> decrease of Serum CO2 --> respiratory alkalosis\n    * However, the kidneys are normally excreting bicarbonate products (alkali in nature) --> neutralization of the present alkalosis (compensation) --> pH back to normal\n\nHope this helps.........

question_title: y=(x^5-3x^3)cos(2+3x-5x^7) --- Derivative? [SEP] question_content: A little confused on this one. [SEP] best_answer: It's a product:\n\nif f(x) = a*b\nthen f'(x) = a*(b') + b*(a')\n\nAlso, you must multiply by the derivative of "what's inside."  For this problem, you must take the derivative of "what's inside" the cosine parentheses (2 + 3x - 5x^7).\n\nSo for this one, a = x^5 - 3x^3 and b = cos(2 + 3x - 5x^7).  "What's inside" is (2 + 3x - 5x^7).  Therefore:\n\n--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---- ---- --- "what's inside"\nf'(x) = ( (x^5 - 3x^3)(-sin(2 + 3x - 5x^7)*(3 - 35x^6)) + (cos(2 + 3x - 5x^7)*(5x^4 - 9x^2))	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the principle of the barometer and how it works? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are several way in which a barometer work.  The most common is a needle attached to a spring and a tensioning device which expands and contracts based upon the amount of atmospheric pressure it is exposed to.  \nThe second type is what is called Galileo's barometer.  Globes are filled with a number of\nliquids of different specific gravities (this is the density of the liquid with respect to the density of water).  As the air pressure changes, these different globes will either float or sink based upon the changes in air pressure.   The third type is the electronic barometer.  It uses a pressure transducer, which causes changes in electric current bases upon changes in air pressure.  These changes are converted into either an analog (needle meter) or digital display of the value of the air pressure.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What causes the "rainbow" to have an arc,to it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What makes the bow?\nA question like this calls for a proper physical answer. We will discuss the formation of a rainbow by raindrops. It is a problem in optics that was first clearly discussed by Rene Descartes in 1637. An interesting historical account of this is to be found in Carl Boyer's book, The Rainbow From Myth to Mathematics. Descartes simplified the study of the rainbow by reducing it to a study of one water droplet and how it interacts with light falling upon it. \nHe writes:"Considering that this bow appears not only in the sky, but also in the air near us, whenever there are drops of water illuminated by the sun, as we can see in certain fountains, I readily decided that it arose only from the way in which the rays of light act on these drops and pass from them to our eyes. Further, knowing that the drops are round, as has been formerly proved, and seeing that whether they are larger or smaller, the appearance of the bow is not changed in any way, I had the idea of making a very large one, so that I could examine it better. \n\nDescarte describes how he held up a large sphere in the sunlight and looked at the sunlight reflected in it. He wrote "I found that if the sunlight came, for example, from the part of the sky which is marked AFZ  \n\nand my eye was at the point E, when I put the globe in position BCD, its part D appeared all red, and much more brilliant than the rest of it; and that whether I approached it or receded from it, or put it on my right or my left, or even turned it round about my head, provided that the line DE always made an angle of about forty-two degrees with the line EM, which we are to think of as drawn from the center of the sun to the eye, the part D appeared always similarly red; but that as soon as I made this angle DEM even a little larger, the red color disappeared; and if I made the angle a little smaller, the color did not disappear all at once, but divided itself first as if into two parts, less brilliant, and in which I could see yellow, blue, and other colors ... When I examined more particularly, in the globe BCD, what it was which made the part D appear red, I found that it was the rays of the sun which, coming from A to B, bend on entering the water at the point B, and to pass to C, where they are reflected to D, and bending there again as they pass out of the water, proceed to the point ". \n\nThis quotation illustrates how the shape of the rainbow is explained. To simplify the analysis, consider the path of a ray of monochromatic light through a single spherical raindrop. Imagine how light is refracted as it enters the raindrop, then how it is reflected by the internal, curved, mirror-like surface of the raindrop, and finally how it is refracted as it emerges from the drop. If we then apply the results for a single raindrop to a whole collection of raindrops in the sky, we can visualize the shape of the bow. \n\nThe traditional diagram to illustrate this is shown here as adapted from Humphreys, Physics of the Air.  It represents the path of one light ray incident on a water droplet from the direction SA. As the light beam enters the surface of the drop at A, it is bent (refracted) a little and strikes the inside wall of the drop at B, where it is reflected back to C. As it emerges from the drop it is refracted (bent) again into the direction CE. The angle D represents a measure of the deviation of the emergent ray from its original direction. Descartes calculated this deviation for a ray of red light to be about 180 - 42 or 138 degrees. \n\nThe ray drawn here is significant because it represents the ray that has the smallest angle of deviation of all the rays incident upon the raindrop. It is called the Descarte or rainbow ray and much of the sunlight as it is refracted and reflected through the raindrop is focused along this ray. Thus the reflected light is diffuse and weaker except near the direction of this rainbow ray. It is this concentration of ray	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the explaination for seashells found on the top of a mountain? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It is quite simple really. There is no 'theory' as some of the posts have indicated. The earth is composed of a number of large plates, which move constantly (the Pacific Ocean today is spreading at 4-5 cm per year). As these plates move, they sometimes slide under one another. As this happens, the upper plate is lifted. This moves rock that was deposited in an ocean environment slowly upwards and often to the top of mountains. The process takes millions of years, so it is likely the rocks that contain the shells on the top of the mountain your husband refers to are tens of millions of years old, or older. \n\nA perfect example is Mount Everest, which has carbonate rocks (with shells) at the peak. Other examples are many parts of the Rocky Mountains in North America, and the Alps in Europe. The Sierra's in California also contain carbonate rocks in many places that did in fact originate in what is now the Pacific Ocean. It is not rare and not mysterious or theoretical. \n\nThe names of these processes, in case you want to learn more, are plate tectonics (previously called continental drift), subduction (one plate under another), orogeny (mountain building), and carbonate sedimentology( deposition of carbonate rocks).

question_title: Why does 4s orbital's energy is lower than 3d orbital? [SEP] question_content: Acording which formula the amount of this orbitals' energy is calculated? [SEP] best_answer: This is true in isolated atoms.\n\nIf we put them into the electric fields generated by nearby atoms, especially those of water of crystallisation, the energy levels can change and rearrange the electron orbitals.\n\nTo explain this to our satisfaction would mean solving the equations and getting the answers.  Unfortunately this is known as a many bodied problem and only the simplest of them can be solved.\n\nTake heart in the fact that the energy levels are so close together that we can glibly announce the fact and move on quickly to the next topic!

question_title: as secondary growth proceeds in a dicot stem,the thickness of................................................. [SEP] question_content: a)both sapwood and heartwood remains the same\nb)both sapwood and heart wood increases\nc)heartwood increases\nd)sapwood increases [SEP] best_answer: a) is correct.\nIn vascular plants, secondary growth or, perhaps more accurately, secondary thickening is the result of the activity of the vascular cambium. The latter is a meristem that divides off cells: the cells on the inside of the meristem (the adaxial side) will become secondary xylem, while the cells on the outside (the abaxial side) will become the secondary phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length, hence the phrase "secondary thickening". As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout. If this is kept up over many years, this process produces wood.Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also may have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How can I find and measure magnetic monopoles? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You can't find magnetic monopoles they are hypothetical\n\nIn physics, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle that may be loosely described as "a magnet with only one pole" (see electromagnetic theory for more on magnetic poles). In more accurate terms, it would have net magnetic charge. Interest in the concept stems from particle theories, notably Grand Unified Theories and superstring theories that predict either the existence or the possibility of magnetic monopoles.

[SEP] best_answer: Isn't it sad when people with Autism are considered to be partially and, in the case of your country, lumped in the same group as people with mental retardation?  I have yet to meet a child with Autism that is not VERY bright.  They all seem to ahve a high intellect, but lack the ability to communicate this.\n\nAt an rate, Autism is a HUGE spectrum, so to give a lifetime prognosis is difficult, and would have to be done on an individual basis.  Every person is SO different.  The best treatment that I have seen is the Applied behavioral Analysis (ABA) program.  It seems to have an amazing affect on almost every individual that goes through it.  best of luck!!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why is the weather more cold when there is no cloud cover? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Another individual stated that the clouds act as a blanked and keept the earth warm.  That is an accurate answer. So, let's look a little deeper.\n\nFirst, clouds are the formations of moisture.  The thicker the clouds, the more moisture that is in them. \n\nNext, remember that heat rises.  During the day, the earth is warmed.  It cools at night.  The heat rises into the air.\n\nWater has a high specific heat, meaning a large amount of energy is needed to heat the water.  Likewise, it take a long period of time to cool the water.\n\nAs the clouds cover the earth, they are insulating the land.  Thus when the heat rises, it hits the clouds creating a barrier.  Thus the rate of cooling is slower than when there is not any cloud cover.\n\nPlease note there are exceptions to the rule.  We've all seen or heard of snowstorms coming in and the air is cooling very quickly.  But the general rule is that on a cloudy winter night, the temperature will not drop as low as if there were no clouds.  And you are less likely to scrape frost from your windshield.

question_title: When I click print, nothing happens? [SEP] question_content: I'm using some sort of a Canon printer and the lights on it keep blinking on and off in green. I can't turn it off either because it won't work. When I click print, it goes on the printing queue as "Deleting - Printing" (I dunno if it's normal?) and the document disappears off of the list after a short time..\n\nHelp appreciated... Thanks!! [SEP] best_answer: Can you print a demo page from the printer? That is always the best first step in diagnosing a printer problem! If you can, you know the printer will print, so we can move on to the connections.\n\nEnsure your connections are sound. Unplug and reattatch all your cables, including your power cable. (If you can't shut off your Printer using its own power button, that may signal that there is a serious problem with the printer.) OK, once all the cables are back in place, try to print again. NOTHING?\n\nNext, uninstall and reinstall your printer. Ensure that you completly uninstall your printer from your PC, don't just update the drivers. The installed drivers may be corrupt. Also, if you allow windows to reinstall the drivers and the printer continues to have the same issue, you may need to download a new driver from the manufacturers web site. If the windows version of the driver didn't work, uninstall and reinstall using this downloaded driver instead.\n\nIf that doesn't work...here is where can get pricey!\n\nFirst, if you have a friend with a accessable PC, take your printer there, hook it up as you would at home and see what happens. If it has the same issue there, then you have narrowed down the problem to being either the printer or the cable connecting the printer to the PC.\n\nSecond step would be to replace the printer cable. (Mind you, this may not be your issue, it could still be the printer and you may waste your money) A good solution is if that same friend uses the same type of cable you do, use that one and see if your printer works. If none of that works, it is time to put that printer out to pasture and buy a new one!	Computers & Internet

question_title: Multithreaded Swing Applications ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Swing components are not inherently thread safe, and as a general rule, after Swing components have been made visible on the screen, you can only safely modify their data from the event thread. If you modify Swing component data from any thread other than the event dispatching thread, you must take precautions to ensure data integrity. An exception to this rule is the setText method on a JTextComponent or any of its subclasses, or any Swing component method whose documentation explicitly states it is thread safe. \n\nSometimes, you cannot avoid modifying Swing component data from outside the event dispatching thread after it has been made visible. An example is spawning a thread to handle a long operation such as reading or writing a large file over the net. The advantage to spawning a new thread is that the user interface is made available to the user for other operations during the long file operation. The spawned thread is a new thread, and therefore, not on the event dispatching thread even if it is spawned by an event dispatching thread method. \n\nThis article explains how to use the InvokeLater method and synchronize keyword to ensure data integrity when modifying data in Swing components. If you are new to multi-threaded programming, see Creating a Threaded Slide Show Applet for an introduction to the threaded applications. \n\nFor furthur info please visit:\nhttp://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Threads/swing/	Computers & Internet

question_title: the purpose of the special keys on the keyboard, and list the most frequently used pointing devices.? [SEP] question_content: the purpose of the special keys on the keyboard, and list the most frequently used pointing devices. [SEP] best_answer: Special keys are either shortcuts to frequently used features or commands of the computer system.\nIn PC's for instance, the key with the Windows logo opens the "start menu". In a Mac there is the Apple key that brings up the Apple menu. \nOther special keys, such as the Ctrl key, allow for extending the number of commands or instructions available to the user through the keyboarde.g.: pressing at the same time ctrl and "c" whatever text is selected on screen moves to a temporary storage (process called copy) and can be inserted on another text by pressing together ctrl and "v" (called paste).\nThe most common pointing device is the mouse (for desktop PC), next are the Touchpad (surface where you slide your fingertip to move the cursor) usually for laptops/notebooks and the stylus, a pen-like device that requires a touch-enabled screen or a special pad.

question_title: What is the difference between AGP and PCI graphics cards? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: AGP or Accelerated Graphics Port succeeded PCI or Peripheral Component Interconnect as a technology to connect graphics cards to a computer's motherboard. PCI is still used to connect other devices like ethernet and sound cards.\n\nAGP slots provide a dedicated link between the card and the CPU and thus providing faster communication between them.  There are other enhancements as well.  See the source for more.  But the bottom line is that AGP cards perform much better.\n\nBut now AGP is getting phased in favor of PCIe or PCI Express which is even faster and can be used as the bus for all the devices in a machine.

[SEP] question_content: i need details idea about what could i do with " Remote Desktop Connections " . i know IP of my office computer i use , so thru Remote Desktop Connection  could I connect to my office  pc,stayin  at home?

question_title: Moving files from my Hard drive  in my computer to my external hard drive? [SEP] question_content: I am trying to move files from my computer to my external hard drive , which has way more memory, but I can't seem to move Windows , obviously I am new to this .. frustrating ..but I ain't gonna give up   HELP ....IS  THERE A "MAGIC bUTTON THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT [SEP] best_answer: If you're moving Windows files it sounds like you're trying to copy everything from your hard drive to the external disk drive (EDD).\n\nThis is fine if you're making a back-up of everything but you can't run Windows from your EDD.  You can put your other files on the EDD but Windows needs to run from your computer hard-drive.\n\nOn the basis that you're making a back up of everything...\n\nThe problem with doing this is that you can't easily copy files that are being used by your computer and with Windows running there will be several files that are in use.\n\nThere's a couple of things that you can do.  The first is to get a program that does everything for you.  A good one is Norton Ghost, not only will it make a complete back up but in future it will keep making backups - whenever files change or are added to your computer Ghost will copy them to your EDD, that way you always have a mirror of your computer hard-drive and you can forget about manually backing things up.\n\nThe other option is to not have Windows running but this means backing up using XCOPY straight from the command prompt in DOS and if you've got XP then you won't have DOS. In other words, this method works only with older versions of Windows.\n\nThere's a couple of articles here that may help - the first uses the DOS approach... http://www.csulb.edu/~murdock/xcopy.html and the second is a technical response... http://www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/hd/cpyhd/index.html \n\nPersonally, I'd get Norton Ghost - pop it in your CD Drive and let it do all the work for you.  You can download it direct from Symantec... http://www.symantec.com/index.htm	Computers & Internet

question_title: which is better , ATI Radeon x 1650 or nvidia geforce fx5200? [SEP] question_content: i want to purchase a video card for gaming that is better than the one which i got before (geforce fx5200 ) ,it stopped functioning well after 1 year + it made me a lot of problems considering that it's 128 mb and whenever i want to play a big game such as war craft or general or condition zero the vga causes the whole system to fail . i think it was not the original because it was cheap , but now i'm planning to bye an original ATI card . thanks for answering. [SEP] best_answer: the X1650 is one of the latest cards around and is Vista safe.\nit is *NOT*, though, a fast card; a 9800(XT) will outrun it most common benchmarks.\nit will only run (properly) on a newer motherboard, either with PCI-E or AGP8; you will have trouble getting the card to run properly on any older motherboard only supporting AGP4.\nthus, if you have one of those, the Nv5200 (or a 2nd hand 9800XT) should be your preferred choice. none of those will run Vista to its fullest, though	Computers & Internet

[SEP] question_content: How much time taking the administrator to know the region of hacker, and Can I find any software to help me because I'M beginner administrator. THANKS FOR ANYONE ANSWERING ME. [SEP] best_answer: Truly it's not that hard to find where the origin of a hacking attack came from. With the right knowledge and perhaps a little trick up your sleeve, you can narrow down the origin within a matter of minutes. \n\nIf the hacker is more sophisticated and knows how to cover their tracks somewhat, that may take longer. \n\nDo yourself a favor, take some courses and learn the basics before diving into the world of Administration. You will get much more out of it by taking the right classes rather than trying to do it the easy way. Oh, and in this business - there is no easy way. \n\nHave fun!	Computers & Internet

question_title: External Hard Drive? [SEP] question_content: What are the differences in  the two types of external hard drives that are: 7200 rpm or a 2.0 usb.  Is one faster than the other?  More efficient?  tell me what you can.  thanks. [SEP] best_answer: It really doesn't matter much.  Get the best deal you can on a good quality external drive.  Read some reviews and choose something with a warranty of at least 1 year.\n\nUSB 2.0 is faster than 1.1, but you won't be able to use it anyway unless your computer has the appropriate motherboard or usb card installed.  And unless you're going to be transferring huge files, the difference in transfer speed won't really be noticeable.\n\nAs far as the rpm of the hard drive, that's even less important.\n\nSince an external hard drive is used for achive purposes you should consider the quality of the drive more important than anything else because if it fails, it'll end up being an over-priced paperweight.

question_title: Anyone know why one Gigabyte is 1024MB and not 1000 even? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Computers run on base-2 arithmetic, since a bit in the computer can only be on or off (positive or negative charge) and thus has only two distinct states.  Since this is true, the amount of memory is also expressed in powers of 2, rather than in decimal (base 10) numbers.\n\n1024 is a power of 2 (2 raised to the 10th power):\n\n2 x 2 = 4 (two of the 2s)\n4 x 2 = 8 (#3)\n8 x 2 = 16 (#4)\n16 x 2 = 32 (#5)\n32 x 2 = 64 (#6)\n64 x 2 = 128 (#7)\n128 x 2 = 256 (#8)\n256 x 2 = 512 (#9)\n512 x 2 = 1024 (#10)	Computers & Internet

[SEP] best_answer: Well, accessing the ms access database directly from j2me might be very dificult.\n\nWhat i would suggest is that you interface the two with a web scripting language (ASP, PHP, ASP .NET or JSP).  ASP and ASP .NET might be easier since they are also created by microsoft. I tried that myself also.\n\nSo, after interfacing the Webpage with the Access, you can access the Access data using your cellular phone by connecting to the web page.  Use the HttpConnection Class of J2ME in accessing the webpage.\n\nGood Luck!	Computers & Internet

Is it using memory in back up ?\nRam...I checked my ram..thanks to answers intructions..yes I am low..have ordered 250 from local pc shop.Will there be a point when I have used all my ram and cannot buy any more ?What exactly is it that uses your memory ?Do I waste memory by downloading silly things I dont need then uninstalling them? I thought that when I uninstalled some thing it took it out of memory and I went back to where I was before.\nWhat exactly does it mean when you say "you are running too many programmes at once ? Do you mean at start up?If I take them of start up where do they go ?Can I get them back ?what do you recommend minimum at start up..I only use my computer for fun...Confused OAP but learning fast [SEP] best_answer: I have never used reg cleaner, but I do use ccleaner, which can do similar tasks to reg cleaner ( http://www.ccleaner.com ).  The backup to your reg is simply so, IF something goes wrong after the "cleaning" you can restore your registry values to a time when everything was working ok - and yes the backup file will be using memory up.\n\nIF you download, AND install things (means you have loaded a programme to your computer rather than just downloading a picture file for example), then if you think they are no longer needed you can just uninstall them again.  Go to "CONTROL PANEL" and then to "ADD OR REMOVE PROGRAMS".  Here you can see all the programmes you have installed.  You can remove programmes you don't want by selecting it and then clicking the "REMOVE" button.  But, don't uninstall anything that you're not sure about, as it may be a vital programme!!!\n\nOk ... the start up programmes .....\n\nIf you click START then RUN, and type "msconfig" (without the quotes) and then click OK.  Select the STARTUP tab, and it will show a list of all items which currently load when you start your computer.  Be careful with this, as you don't want to stop something from loading if it is important.\n\nVisit here http://www.sysinfo.org/startupinfo.html as there is a lot of info, AND a list of every start up item with advice on whether to leave it running or not.  But, like I say ... be careful.\n\nI hope this has helped, message me if you want some more help!	Computers & Internet
question_title: plz tell me the least mebabytes the movie file of 1GB be compressed!!? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no way to answer this question as most modern compression algorithms use tokenization. The extent of tokenization possible is dependent on the data being tokenized. It is POSSIBLE that a handpicked special instance of a 1GB file could be reduced to 50MB or so.\nIt is also important to know what format the movie already is in (wma,mpg,avi,rm) as if it is already compressed further techniques will have minimal effect.

[SEP] question_content: This is a question which refers to filling in forms and using forms in Form View in the Microsoft Access 2003 software for creating databases instead of using Microsoft Excel. [SEP] best_answer: The form has to be based on an existing table in order for you to be able to enter data.  You should have a table with the various fields (or columns) ready to go.  You can create a form based on that table, and you can pick which fields will be filled in via the form.\n\nForm view simply refers to the form itself, ready to use, as opposed to Design view, where you're setting up the look of the form (i.e. spacing, size of the boxes, etc.).

question_title: difference between 64bit and 128bit video cards? [SEP] question_content: Please tell me the difference between 64bit and 128bit video cards  (like Nvidia) and if each requires a different connection; for example does 64 bit card fit in the same slot as 128 bit? Also is 128 bit better? Thank you, I appreciate your help. [SEP] best_answer: I would think the difference is that a 64bit would have a 64bit GPU and a 128bit would have a 128bit GPU.  The GPU is the graphical processing unit (the video card's own on-board processor), it's what allows video cards to do things like do your 3D graphics so your computer doesn't have to.  The 128bit probably would be better, but it might not be since bit-rate isn't the only factor in speed.\nLook at the following things:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-rate	Computers & Internet

[SEP] question_content: I'm trying to reduce red eye in some photo's with Adobe photoshop cs and cant find the button anywhere. can someone point me in the right direction [SEP] best_answer: Photoshop's tool bar contains more than just the buttons you see. By left clicking and holding down the mouse on a tool button that has a small arrow in its corner, a list box appears that gives you more boxes to pick from.\n\nThat is why you don't see the red eye button.

question_title: once i forget passwrd of win-xp admin, no other user avilable in user account then how i log in as admin? [SEP] question_content: once in windows-xp i forget my password i usually login as adminstrator no other user avilable in the user account then i have to format my computer then how can i recover my system in such condition without formating. [SEP] best_answer: I assume that if the PC allows you to log in as administrator you must be using XP Pro. When you log in as admin, rather than checking "users" in the Control Panel, go into Administrative Tools instead, then into Computer Management. There is a section on the left called "Local Users and Groups", and if you go into Users you should see any other account created on that PC. Right-click on the one you've forgotten the password to, and choose "Set Password." Once you've reset the password, log out (or just reboot), then log in as that user.\n\n(Edit: I may have misunderstood your question.

question_title: If you have a dialup connection whichis better, faster and safer Firefox or IE? [SEP] question_content: I live in a rural area and don't have a ton of money so I'm stuck with dial up. The best connection I get is 26400 whatever. I use aol as isp for now. Which works better under these circumstances Firefox or Ie? [SEP] best_answer: As between these two, Firefox, without doubt. IE has been, and continues to be, riddled with security problems. So safety goes to Firefox (properly configured). Make sure you've gone through every menu and setting under Tools, and made good choices, before you use it. Poorly configured Firefox is not all that secure. Of course, even optimally configured IE has lots of problems, so there isn't much choice. \n\nOn the faster front, things are less clear. some have reported IE (one version or another) to be faster than Firefox (one version or another). Let's look at some details. Firefox allows you to adjust your settings more easily than IE. And so you can tell Firefox not to download popup or popunder windows (makes things faster, less garbage traffic) and you can tell Firefox not to download images unless you ask (less data unless needed, so faster).  And so on. There's a Firefox extension called FasterFox which automatically loads stuff in the background when you're inactive for a moment, and it can speed things up a good bit. It also requires configuration and probably  experimentation to find the fastest settings in your situation. And there are several other firefox extensions which filter out other detritus and trash and so don;t use the limited bandwidth you have. Things will seem to load faster. So for the faster question, I think it's Firefox, properly configured, and perhaps with the right extensions. \n\nAs for better, if it's safer and faster, where's the doubt?\n\n======\n\ncaveats\n\nMicrosoft is in the midst of rewriting substantial parts of IE, so it is said. if so, the next version of IE may be better than past version have been. But Firefox sets a high standard, so IE has a considerable ways to go. Due out sometime early next year, and only for Windows, naturally.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is a "script monkey"? [SEP] question_content: Is the term "script monkey" a common used term? [SEP] best_answer: "Script monkey" is a well-deserved derogatory term for people, usually doing telephone support, that are incapable or unwilling to properly diagnose a problem.  This means they go through a pre-written script of questions, which are essentially put into a flow-chart, and they follow it until it reaches the pre-fabricated reply.  If you're lucky, the people who wrote the script did it well enough that your script monkey was able to able to get you both to the proper conclusion.\n\nBefore I wander too far, it's a somewhat common term.  I doubt it's common in call centers filled with know-nothing "engineers" and "technicians", but it's common enough with people who have to call the so-called "technicians" or "engineers".

question_title: Hard drives? [SEP] question_content: When you save a picture or a song or mpeg ect does it get saved to your hard drive or can it be deleted and never recovered if ur using Windows XP [SEP] best_answer: If you are concerned about data security there is a program called TrueCrypt that lets you mount a "virtual" drive that is very secure. It is a virutal drive in the since that the OS treats it like a real drive, but it need not be. You can actually just have it as an existing file on your system. The contents of the drive are scrambled using a very strong symmetric cipher. You can even give it some random data as a salt to combine with your password, so that it will be less vulnerable to dictionary attacks. TrueCrypt has several advantages, first you don't have to delete the file to be secure. It is cross platform you can open a true crypt "drive" on Windows or Linux and soon the Mac. It offers plausable deniability. You can secondarily encrypt part of the drive with a different passphrase so that you can appear to cooperate with any information requests, while still restricting access.\n\nIf you are getting rid of the data there is a program called "Boot and Nuke" it is basically a bootable Linux CD that has an application that allows you to securely wipe the drive. You should have it make 12-15 passes or 30 if you are paranoid, and then you can feel pretty secure that no one can recover the contents of the drive.	Computers & Internet

If this is on a local machine, it should be possible to get it to work. If it's on a hosted machine on the Internet, you're better off switching to a Linux hosting plan, as these are more likely to include MySQL. Some hosts have banned phpBB altogether due to its poor security track record, so you may wish to consider an alternate, such as YaBB.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Why do people every six minutes have to ask which came first the chicken or the egg? [SEP] question_content: The answer is always the egg.  Thats the correct answer anyway. [SEP] best_answer: 1) Because they can? :^)\n\n2) Because they like to stir up debates between creationists and evolutionists.\n\n3) Because they think it is an unanswerable riddle when it isn't.\n\nIt is an interesting question but people really don't think it through enough to show just how interesting it is.  How you answer the question reflects on your belief system, your powers of deductive reasoning, and/or your sense of humor.\n\nIf you subscribe to evolution (as I do), then it's very simple -- eggs existed long before chickens ever did.  Fish lay eggs.  Amphibians lay eggs.  Reptiles lay eggs.  Dinosaurs layed eggs.  Prototypical birds layed eggs.  Early mammals layed eggs.  (Even current mammals called monotremes lay eggs).  So obviously eggs came before chickens by this line of reasoning.\n\nFollowing evolutionary theory, genetics, and the development of embryos, one might argue that again, the egg came before the chicken because the first chicken is a genetic mutation of two chicken like parents.  So, from this line of reasoning, you might, again argue the egg if you are talking about first chicken relative to the egg.  For the first chicken had to develop inside the egg as the offspring of two chicken-like parents.\n\nBut then I realized "Hey, how did the first zygotic chicken (fertilized ovum) get inside the egg in the first place?"  If the ovum was inside an egg shell with yoke and rooster sperm is added afterward, then the egg comes first.  But what if the the ovum is fertilized first, then encased in an egg shell?  Then would not the zygotic chicken come before the egg?\n\nA quick look on Wikipedia for bird reproduction indicates that the eggs are fertilized with sperm during the descent from the ovaries through the cloaca.  If this is the case, then, again, the egg comes before the chicken.\n\nSo, I forgot to add one reason people ask this question every six minutes:\n\n4) Because they have too much time on their hands. :^)	Business & Finance

I'm a convicted felon,been to prison twice and have never had a problem gaining employment.Honesty is the best policy.You'll be respected for it!

question_title: job application and immigration? [SEP] question_content: A friend of mine is qualified for a job being advertised that starts late next year.  the thing is that although he has the right to work in the UK, he won't get indefinite leave to remain in the UK till about 2 months before the job is due to begin.\n \nAnd on the application form they ask for indefinite leave to remain.\n\nIf he tells the truth, he won't be able to apply for the job- even though he would have the leave to remain by the time the job is due to begin. So should he fudge the truth and explain why he did so if he gets an interview? [SEP] best_answer: I say Yes, for the following reasons:\nFirst, suppose the worst thing happens, and they get pissed at him and he ends up not getting the job. Wouldn't that be exactly the same as not applying to begin with (or being automatically rejected for this clause)? \nBut more importantly, we're talking about people, not machines.\nAnd if your friend is good at what he does, that's the thing they're going to care about.\n\nIf it's really just a matter of weeks between the time the job starts and the time he gets the undefinite leave to remain, I think he should go for it.

question_title: Do you have any good business ideas for a teenager? [SEP] question_content: I'm seventeen and a junior in high school. I'm looking for a great business idea that could grow into something large, but of course still be something I could start on my own. I already have strong business background from school (DECA/Academy of Finance) and know a lot about how to run a business, I just don't know what type of business would be good. I've already ran an electronics store on eBay, as well as a t-shirt company on CafePress.com. Both had unseen disadvantages. [SEP] best_answer: The nature of a successful small business is that it is driven by the passion of its owner.\n\nWe could give you a ton of good ideas, but you'd probably fail in your business venture because your lack of passion in the product will cause you to be put off by the natural stress involved in running a business.\n\nIn short, if you want to start a business, you first need to identify your passions, then produce a product or service that incorporates that idea.  Then you'll have the drive to see it through.	Business & Finance

question_title: I am a 14 year old looking for a job? [SEP] question_content: I am from Worcs. in England and need a summer job. I am fairly intelligent and look older than 14, I haven't got much experience except for an unnoficial job as paper boy which was under my brothers name  but I did it and he gave the money to me. I don't want to be exploited because of my age can anyone suggest a (or more) good place to try. (10 points for best answer) [SEP] best_answer: The best job you could ever ask for is babysitting. It's easy and fun, especially if you can tolerate children. It pays a lot of money, too - often much more than store or restaurant jobs. You could be a full-time or part-time job, and the nice thing is, there are no taxes, so you'll be getting every penny you earn.\nNo experience? No problem. Just mention that in your ad, and offer to have a couple free training days. But usually "experience" is relative term. If you're babysitting babies, then you need it. But if they're like 5 or 6, then you just have to play with them.\nAfraid your friends will make fun of you? Oh well. See who'll be laughing when you have money and they don't.\n\nDon't like children at all? You can also be a house-sitter, although that's harder to find. You can be an assistant to the elderly. Or you can be a pet-sitter. All of these are slightly harder to find, but it's the same general concept. \n\nIf you like dogs, start your own small doggy daycare or something. \n\nHope this helps!

question_title: what models can be used to teach   business education? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One of the best models I have ever seen is the CANSLIM model of successful stocks built by William J. O'Neil.\n\nIn this model, Mr. O'Neil tracks 100's of datapoints for the most successful stocks over the past decades. He then isolated the following seven charateristics of winning stocks.\n\nC - Current EPS growth over 25%, past two quarters\nA - Annual EPS growth over 25%, past five years\nN - New - New His, New Company, New Management, New Product\nS - Supply - Look for strong volume and small float.\nL - Leaders - The most powerful stocks lead the market.\nI - Insitutional Sponsorship - Successful institutional ownership increasing their holdings.\nM - 3 our of 4 stocks decline in bear markets. O'Neil teaches how to indentify rallies.\n\nO'Neil himself details how he turned his savings into a seat on the New York Stock Exchange by the time he was 30.\n\nThere are numerous stories of people who have based entire careers on the teachings of O'Neil. Many of the most successful traders in the United States cite William O'Neil as the best stock market educator.\n\nYou can buy his book How to Make Money in Stocks in any bookstore for about $20. If you subscribe to his paper, you are not hit up for $10,000 seminars. William O'Neil and Company operate with more integrity than any company I have ever encountered.	Business & Finance

You'd have to sell a very large block of stock to move the price on most shares and then if you were successful in lowering the price, the fact that you were buying a larger block than you sold may move the price back up making your trade a loser.

Try researching the different markets in different demographics. Find out where the peoples wants are.  Most people will cater to their wants rather than their needs.  That is why ther is money to be made in fashion, trends and other like interests.  Target people's disposable incomes and what they're spending it on.  Look at differnet trends such as hot sneakers, new jeans, etc.  You can make investments in the companies stocks and rake it in.

question_title: how to figure interest rates if your paying 3.99? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: That is correct, but if you want to know how to figure that rate for each month it is the % rate divided by 12 months (3.99/12).  It is also important to know how it it compounded (some figure interest daily, and you pay more interest.  soem figure monthly), because it can mean a big difference in the interest paid by the end of year, even if it is the same interest rate.

[SEP] question_content: I have a presentation to do and I need to tell my class what they should do to stay on topic.  I need to possibly give them some internet sites that can help.  This presentation must be in class and I need to make myself clear. [SEP] best_answer: Stay on Top-ic\nHow would you like to prepare a presentation in half the time and with better results? Do you think this is possible?\n\nIt's all a question of getting organized, even for a one page paper, or a 10 minute presentation. There is a basic technique which works well for the preparation of many presentations, reports or articles:\n\nChoice of topic, brainstorming, research on the Internet and in libraries etc., sorting, table of contents with chapter headings; key words for the chapters; writing the chapters; conclusion; thinking of more interesting headings or a better title. \n\nThis principle is valid for the preparation of both, spoken and written presentations.\n\n1 The Topic\nFirst you need a topic. If the topic is not given, you can use a working topic at first and find a more attractive one later, e.g., working topic,  How One Can Use a Towel.\n\n2 Brainstorming and Research\nWrite down all ideas for the topic which come to your mind, without judging them. Have fun with it, be inventive, creative, even silly. E.g. for drying skin, body, ink; for making a sun roof; for cleaning the floor, the car, the sofa; for carrying laundry or other things in it; for playing a trick on the teacher; for making a jacket; for filtering water, etc. Research all possible sources, make notes.\n\n3 Sort\nSort out the ideas from your research notes and your brainstorming you want to consider, e.g. drying things; carrying things etc. You may not want "playing a trick on the teacher." You may want to limit your ideas to very few examples, if you want to write a brief report or article.\n\n4 Make a Table of Contents\nThe general order is:\nA Introduction, \nB Main chapters or main paragraphs,\nC Conclusions. \n\nNote down in key words the thoughts, ideas and facts you want to place in each section of the table of contents. This helps you to avoid unnecessary repetitions. Do not start to write the introduction or the chapters, before you have the table of contents.\n\nExample: I once saw a book with excellent material, but the writer had not made a table of contents before he started writing. The result was that he repeated the same thoughts in different words all over his book, which is boring to the reader. To repair the repetitions, when the book is done, is hard, hard work and sometimes impossible. It is much easier and better to do the table of contents and then start writing. When writing books, the table of contents may sometimes change in sequence while writing the chapters.\n\n5 Introduction\nE.g. ask a thought provoking question as introduction for a report: Is a towel merely good for drying the skin? Yet, do not give the real answer here, but later. Or give a funny answer. \n\nOr state a problem you have come across, e.g.: There are people having too many towels, these could serve others, who need them, in many ways. \n\nIn the introduction, you have to get the attention of your audience or readers! Be thought provoking, funny or original: Today, I wanted to tell you about my towel I wore on my head (everybody may wonder what this is all about).\n\n6 Main Chapters or Main Paragraphs, Headings\nChapter 1 - Towels in the House\nChapter 2 - Towels on the Beach\nChapter 3 - Towels on Boats\nChapter 4 - Towels in Space Crafts\netc. \nE.g. you want to cover the towel colors in Chapter 2, the quality of towels in Chapter 3, and the size of towels in Chapter 4, instead of a more tiring approach to cover all three thoughts in every chapter.\n\nRethink Topic\nIn the end, you may sometimes want to formulate the headings for these chapters or paragraphs with more variations. Instead of saying "Towels in....," "Towels on....," you may say, "Beach Towels," or, "Is there Space for Towels in Space Crafts?"\n\n7 Conclusions\nHere you summarize what you found and elaborate on it, or you state what you feel is further interesting, e.g. the space for towels in space crafts, if you have not	Business & Finance

question_title: In simpile terms what is a cd (personal)in a bank? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A "CD" is a Certificate of Deposit.  It amounts to a promise by a bank that if you give them a certain amount of money, they will give you back a little more after an agreed-upon amount of time.  You can get your money back sooner, but there's usually a penalty/loss of interest.\n\nAn example might be a 12-month CD paying 6% interest. If you buy one for $100 on Jan 1 of this year, it "matures" or becomes payable next Jan 1, and will pay you back $106. (Party!)\n\nCD's are generally a very safe, very low-yielding form of saving, most appropriate for people who cannot tolerate a lot of risk with their savings.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: i am unemployed with no money in the bank to invest. i cannot drive anymore and need to work with my computer some way shape or form to pay my bills does anyone know of anything i can do [SEP] best_answer: Because so many 'work at home' opportunities are scams, frauds, or designed to make money - for the plan operators, not you - it's a good idea that before you invest time and especially money on any home-based business offers, you educate yourself on the different types of home work based schemes there are out there, and what to look for - and what to look out for - before making any commitment\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission offers several advisories about home-based business opportunities and network marketing (MLM) schemes.

question_title: what is the differences between network marketing and pramidal systems? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Look for a book named "The Business School" by Robert Kiyosaki.

It's mean whoever join first, will be always have higher pin or level than the person join under him/her.\n2.  There is no entrance fee for Network marketing.  you only need to pay a little amount to be a member.  But in pryamid marketing you will need to pay certain amount to join it and your upline will earn some from that amount.

question_title: Can a printer legally print 10% over or under the original order? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: yes they can. 10% is normal. i have had several 4 color prints ran in the thousands count. usually you'll get an overprint as the printer wants you happy and to return as a customer, but they have to say + or - the % cause no one is going to sit and count every print. just no worth it. it should be on your contract as well.

question_title: what websites can you go to to get info on grants for starting a small business? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html \n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html	Business & Finance
question_title: Do you attend work/classes on snow days? [SEP] question_content: If you have a very strict boss or teacher, would you still attend work/class when the weather is so bad that even the weatherman advises you to stay home? [SEP] best_answer: Yes.\n\nEven though the weatherman says its bad, your city probably did a good enough job cleaning up to warrant a trip to work/school.\n\nRemember, when you don't go to work, others have to pick up the slack for you, and they had to drive in the same conditions you would have.\n\nAs for class, if the school is closed, don't go. If it is open, go. Easy as that.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: -what "group" you put urself in in highschool : Skaters\n\n-How old you are: 28\n\n-What your GPA was on average:  3.8  (just cuz I was a skater, I was no slacker!)\n\n-What job you are doing now:  Homemaker\n\n-How much money you make/year  $0\n\n\n- I was much more liberal in HS and since graduation & getting married and starting a family, I have become far more conservative.\n\nSo I would say that the group I was with in HS had nothing to do with who I am today.

So far I am using careerbuilder.com, hotjobs.com, monster.com, hirediversity.com, michiganworks.com, and a couple other misc websites.  I've also searched out lists of companies in Michigan (things like Top 100 to work for in MI, Biggest Companies in MI, Fastest Growing Companies in MI, etc), and I've gone to each companies individual corporate website and searched for jobs.

Here's what I have so far:\n> France has plenty of backyard birds.\n> The majority of our current customers fall into the age range that is most populous in France  (15-64 years: 65.3%)\n> Canada is a French-speaking country (23.2%)\n\n\nI'm drawing a blank.........help! [SEP] best_answer: Yes, we do have lovely songbirds here but bird feeders are readily available already so you need to think of some sort of characteristic that your bird feeder has that the ones that we have do not have. You need a selling point.\n\nYour selling point should not be protection against squirrels because we don't have the American gray squirrel. The little red ones that we have don't live near people, they are very shy and do not attack bird feeders.\n\nMaybe they are easier to load, or hold more seeds without spoilage or maybe your feeder has a design that prevents wastage of seed falling to the ground. I haven't seen your feeder so I don't know how to sell it.\n\nYou can see the kind of feeders that we use on the web site of the LPO (League pour la Protection des Oiseaux).\n\nIf you can send me a picture of your feeder, maybe I can think of some more ideas.\n\n\nOh, yes, Thank you, Mr. Curious for your helpful comments.

question_title: With outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, what do you think the future holds for the US economy? [SEP] question_content: How will the typical American be affected? Will our standard of living suffer? [SEP] best_answer: You know, services are already being outsourced by developed countries due to the obvious cost advantages. Next in line are manufacturing jobs. \nIn short, any country which outsources intelligently has a very bright future. As economists say, resources are limited, so smart countries should invest their resources in  sectors of the future such as IT, space, biotechnology, etc. where the main input is human intelligence, where there is maximum value addition and maximum profits (and minimum pollution). \nManufacturing on the other hand is not as profitable as it once was compared to the "knowledge" sectors.

question_title: Can creditors from like cell phone companys really make your credit score go down ??? [SEP] question_content: The Mobile Solution cell phone dealers are big liers and dishonest.I had a cell phone plan with them, then I wanted to change my number over to another carrier but keep att with a new number so att canceled the account then restarted just for number change.Now the mobile solution sent me a letter from United finacial service that I have to pay over 250 for breach of contract etc...and the creditor is saying that they will make my credit score go down if I dont pay.Can they really make my credit bad?what can I do about this should I contact the mobile solution corporate office? Instead of going to the mall and talking to a manager?? [SEP] best_answer: They can impact your credit score, although it's hard to say how much.  If you normally pay everything else on time, you won't be hurt as much by one bad account.  However, if you are late on a lot of accounts or don't have a good record with anyone, then you'll see a much larger impact.\n\nIf United Financial is calling you with that threat, they are probably a collection agency.  They may have bought your old debt for a very small percentage of what you owe.  If you are really concerned about your credit but can't afford the $250, you can probably get them to settle for a lot less.  If you tell them you can't afford the entire amount but you want to settle the debt, they may offer you a deal - like $100 to call it even.	Business & Finance

question_title: What is a good personal rate of return? [SEP] question_content: On a 401K plan? [SEP] best_answer: 18% in one year? That's really good.\n\nKeep in mind we're talking just one year, and we haven't begun to factor in losses from time to time cutting into that rate of return. \n\nOver a long period of time your rate of return for the typical balanced fund should settle around the historical 6-8% return. \n\nConsidering it's the end of the year and about time to think about taxes, now would be a good time to evaluate your portfolio and figure out a good way to lock in some of those gains in your retirement portfolio, which includes your 401k.\n\nI would rebalance my portfolio so that some of my gains are transferred over into underperforming parts of my account, as well as consider whether those underperformers still provide balance in your overall investment strategy. Just because some portion lost money doesn't mean that, one day, they won't provide support when those high-flyers take a hit.\n\nI'm no professional, so my experience is all personal. But I can at least say I pay enough attention to my investments w/o being obcessed by it. And they've been doing pretty nicely, even through the rough spots a few years ago.	Business & Finance

question_title: How long should you wait before refinancing on your home? [SEP] question_content: We have only been living in the house from a couple of months. I understand about waiting to see if the rates are lower than our original but do we need more equity in the home? Or do you just need the rates to be lower? And how much of a difference would it make if say there was a 1/2 of a point difference? Thanks for the help in advance [SEP] best_answer: You do not give much detail so it is hard to answer your question with 100 accuracy. I will give you the numbers I am using so you will have a better understanding. \n\nFirst... does 1/2 pt make a difference.  Yes.\nHow much.... useing 100k as a number and 6.0 and 6.5 so you see the difference in .5     599.55 for 6.0  632.07 for 6.5 ... Now STOP I know what you are thinking.. oh thats only 32 dollars. But we are not done. Over the life of a 30 year note or 360 months that will save you......11700.20 .. Yes I said eleven thousand seven hundred dollars and twenty cents. But dont run our yet. There is still more. That 11k is nothing if you play your cards right. Are you ready for some real money???\n\nTry it this way.... Add 100 extra to your monthly payment. By the way... your interest per day is about 17dollars at the begining of this loan so only 90dollars is going to the principal. Adding that extra 100 even to the first month will take you from month one to month three. \n\nTo put it simply.... after your first payment (using 100k @ 6.5 since you didnt give me the real numbers to use) you will have paid an extra months principal plus part of a day. Now instead of charging you interest on that 100 dollars you save that 63 cents. I know that doesnt seem like much.. BUT you have to remember this is over the life of the loan. So you save 63 cents the second month... thru the 360th. That would be 226.80 savings just for 100 dollars. Do it twice in a row ie first and second month and you will save 452.97 three times 678.51.. thats more than the monthly payment and it only cost you 300 dollars. \n\nI wont go into ALL the math but you get the idea. If you do this right.. ie 100 a month extra. You will cut several... are you sitting down?  YEARS off your loan. \n\nSo do not waste your time doing a refi. I mean if it drops a few points sure, but if it is less than 3 points Im not moving.	Business & Finance

question_title: how to deal w/ harassmnt by a car for an hr on a lonely stretch of rd. I called 911, they said can't help. [SEP] question_content: 911 said they can't do anything about "tailgating", but the car was riding 1 foot away from me for an hour at 65 mph. I stopped to let it pass, and it wouldn't - it pulled up behind me. I went very fast and it sped up too. When I called 911, they said they couldn't help w/out a car description or license plate. I intentionally overshot my street (i didn't want them following me home), kept going til I got to town, and maneuvered behind it to get the license and make of car. I told 911 but they said they still wouldn't do anything about it, even though I said the car had majorly endangered me (if a deer had run out of the road, the car would have hit me and we could have gone over the cliffs). Plus it could have been a weirdo with horrible intentions to make me crash -- and then what?... Can I do anything to prevent this person from harassing others? It was an extremely stressful drive home (at midnight) with an erratic, crazy driver behind me, not knowing his intentions. [SEP] best_answer: You should have called your local police department instead of 911. Go to your police department and give them a description of the car w/ license plate # and tell them what happened. Sounds like a case of road rage, but who knows. Probably should never pull over if you suspect someone is following you.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: He said that he did not cheat on me yet, but I do not trust him because the girl is prety and alot younger than me. He works with her every day.

When women withold sex from their partners they will seek what they want elsewhere. if you have no solid evidance of him cheating,  stop looking for him to cheat and make his time with you extra special.\n\nIf he offers it to you and you do not want it, he may give it to someone else.

question_title: How do you buy property for the first time? [SEP] question_content: My rental contract expires in June, and I would like to buy a place of my own if possible (a condo probably). What steps should I take to do this? Where would I look for property that is up for sale? Do I need a realtor? How much credit do I need? What's the typical down payment? How do I get a mortage? Etc and so forth. [SEP] best_answer: Here is what I would sugest for you to do:\n\nGather up your last 2 months bank statements for all accounts, your last 2 pay stubs, last years w-s, 1099, or tax returns.\n\nThen go to a mortgage company and tell them you want to prequal. They will pull your credit and then use the documents you brought in to figure out how much house you can afford at what interst rate, and how they will need to structure the loan. \n\nOnce you have this information, I would sugest obtaining a Real Estate Agent. The reason is this .. the buyer pays nothing for having an agent ... the agent gets paid by the seller once the house is sold. So it is in your best interest to have one. Tell the agent what you qualify for, and what you are looking for. They will pull up properties in MLS and then you can choose the ones you want to see. The other benifit of having a Real estate Agent is that they will look out for your best interest in regards to the REPC, and typically will not let you get hosed by the lender either. This is important if you are new to all of this.\n\nIf you have a good lender and a good Agent then you should not have anything to worry about. Ask lots of questions to the lender, you can learn alot about the process.	Business & Finance

question_title: I just started as a Realtor, How do I get a job as sales associate with developers /house builders? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The best way to obtain builders is face to face!  The first impression he gets of you will also be the first impression of prospective buyers and this is very important to him and you!  Drop by his office first thing in the morning with donuts and coffee and your business card attached to the donut box.  Introduce yourself and with a firm handshake you should have made a great impression!  Follow-up is very important!  After your first meeting, follow up with the builder via e-mail, phone or personal visit once every 8-10 days until he either asks you to stop or until you can reach an agreement.  Patience is the key, if he notices professionalism and determination chances are, he'll choose you!	Business & Finance

question_title: what should i wear to a modeling interview? [SEP] question_content: what should i do to increase my chances of being picked by an agency?  what should i wear to the interview?  how should i go in? model walking? [SEP] best_answer: You should dress in a way that shows your figure.  Most girls wear slim jeans and a tank top (layer a skinny sweater over the tank if it's cold right now).  Go for solid colors (white or off-white for your top is best) and NO sparkles, shimmers, stripes or other small prints that might look weird in a photo.  Choose flat shoes so that the agency can accurately see your size.  Bring a duffle bag with you so that you can carry cute heels, a bikini and a simple dress (in a non-wrinkly material) and change into that if necessary.  Go in with a VERY natural face (absolute bare minimum makeup) and cleansing wipes in case they ask you to remove your makeup for the photos.  Leave your hair down but bring a plain elastic to pull it back if they ask you to.\n\nBasically, show that you:\n\n- are prepared\n- are a natural beauty\n- understand what they're looking for in a model	Business & Finance

question_title: I want to buy a stock. What is a good stock for beginners? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A great stock for beginners, and for 75 + % of all investors, is:VFINX. Okay, it's not really one single stock, but rather a collection of stocks; an Index Fund. This index fund buys all the stocks in the SP 500 according to their individual weightings. This is a great first investment because the investor gets exposure to all stocks in the SP 500 in one purchase. The other perk to owning index funds is that the fees associated with them are extremely low compared to mutual funds. This is because mutual fund managers select any stocks they want, as opposed to the strict rules of index funds, which, in the case, is concentrated in the SP 500. This sounds like a disadvantage; however, the numbers don't lie - mutual funds underpreform the SP 500 by 1-1.5 % over time. An index is a better choice than a single stock because your money does not ride on the prospects of one single company. In fact, this investment in VFINX will probably rise between 8-12 % annually for the next ten plus years. I recommend an index fund to most investors, not just beginners, because again, historically, index funds have returned a higher annual rate, AFTER EXPENSES, than mutual funds. In fact, VFINX has beaten 75 % of the other funds available, BEFORE EXPENSES, during the last 10 years. After expenses, VFINX has beaten over 90 % of all funds. Finally, you don't have to "actively manage" this purchase (aka look at the stock market everyday - although you could!) because, again, you own a small percentage of 500 of the best companies in the US. All this adds up to a relitively safe, solid long-term investment.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: First, there is no procedure that the bill says the jail has to follow to request the money from you. They must develop a form that they use to determine your financial ability to pay them and then they can charge you. If you refuse to pay, they can then file a lawsuit within 12 months of your release in civil court requiring you to pay. If they do not do so within 12 months, their bill will be unenforceable, but otherwise, they did nothing illegal.	Politics & Government

I need those who are still "virgins" in the political and economical worlds.

question_title: is there a way to protect a muslim women that wishes to change her religion?is there an international law? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It would be really helpful in answering to know where the woman is, as the world is a big and varied place.\n\nThe International convention on human rights enshrines freedom of religion - which means that all countries should allow people freedom to worship or not worship as they please, including changing their religion. Enforcing it is left up to individual governments though.\n\nPersecution for changing your religion is grounds for claiming asylum in Europe or North America, among othrs - the problem is getting the immigration authorities to believe that someone would really be at risk, that the authorities of the home country wouldn't protect the convert, and that they hadn't just made up the story in order to get asylum. In UK at least, the authorities seem programmed to disbelieve any claim not backed by strong evidence.\n\nEven in the West, a woman can be at risk from her family and community for changing religion or otherwise "disrespecting" and "dishonouring" her family. This does not only apply to Muslims. \n\nPeople in this situation need sensitive help, rather than people using them to score points against a religion. \n\nIn Islam, people can be killed for turning away from Islam. In practice, even in Iran, what people do privately is up to them, but converting publicly and evangelising would get you into serious problems; and if a woman's family chose to take their own measures, even if that was against the law, it's unlikely that the authorities would help he at all.\n\nMuslims are often criticised unjustly, but this aspect of it is hard to defend; in fact many Muslims do not agree with killing "apostates", even though the rulings on it seem unambiguous.\n\nBest wishes to the woman concerned, she needs to be careful and given understanding and all support.

question_title: Right wingers, left wingers, moderates: What do you dislike the most about W? [SEP] question_content: Please identify your party. I'm curious to know what all sides think on this one. [SEP] best_answer: Social moderate, economic conservative, Republican but not in line with Bush who is a social conservative and economic moderate.\n\nI appreciate the supply side actions that have kept this economy afloat remarkably well despite plenty of things that should have destabilized it (911, hurricanes)  The stock market remains strong.  Interest rates are still remarkably low.\n\nI am disappointed over the huge deficits that mounted, but it is not unusual to incur deficit spending during war.\n\nBush has taken so much flack over the Iraqi conflict - this is not uncommon during a time of war.  Lincoln, though thought of as a visionary president now, was second guessed and criticized plenty during the time of war.  The American people wanted action in response to 911.  So we have gotten involved in a place that breeds hatred of the West and supported cells of terror.  Although most of you want out of Iraq yesterday, I have confidence that if we continue with the plan, Iraq will have a stable democracy that will be a huge improvement from Sadaam. \n\nI am glad there is a dialog about alternative energies.  I wouldn't mind more emphasis along these lines.\n\nI am disappointed that a revamping of the social security program was shot down.  I think we as a people will live to regret not having done something about this earlier.  The issue will return, though next time with more urgency.\n\nI am happy with Bush about his leadership regarding the illegal immigrant issue.  I think we should have some avenue (not an easy one) for illegals to eventually obtain citizenship.  If those people think the steps are too hard then they are free to return to the country they immigrated from.\n\nHis administration has made some serious tactial errors for nominations and appointments to positions.  This has been an embarrassment for his administration several times.\n\nAlthough he takes plenty of criticism over this matter, I am glad W does not drift with the wind over current popular opinion on various matters.  The American people can be very reactionary over things...you can't really govern that way.  I want him to do what he believes is right, not what will make him the most popular.	Politics & Government

question_title: Thursday is Thanksgiving , do you know the true story behind it? It was clebrating genocide against Indians? [SEP] question_content: In 1641, the Dutch governor of Manhattan offered the first scalp bounty; a\ncommon practice in many European countries. This was broadened by the\nPuritans to include a bounty for Natives fit to be sold for slavery. The\nDutch and Puritans joined forces to exterminate all Natives from New\nEngland, and village after village fell. Following an especially successful raid against the Pequot in what is now Stamford, Connecticut, the churches of\nManhattan announced a day of "thanksgiving" to celebrate victory over the\nheathen savages. This was the 2nd Thanksgiving. During the feasting, the\nhacked off heads of Natives were kicked through the streets of Manhattan\nlike soccer balls.\n\nThe killing took on a frenzy, with days of thanksgiving being held after\neach successful massacre.

question_title: CFR Making Moves on American Sovereignty? [SEP] question_content: http://www.americanfreepress.net/html/cfr_making_moves.html\n\nHas anyone heard anything about this?  How do we as citizens of the United States address such actions in a productive and useful way to put a stop to such?\n\nPresident Bush’s publicity stunt pretending to protect our borders is worse than a transparent ploy.\n\nWashington bureaucrats, backed by prominent think tanks, are now proposing the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP), which will give you “a safer and more prosperous North America” with “freedom, economic opportunity, and strong democratic institutions.” That’s what the neo-cons promised they’d do to Iraq.\n\nThe SPP “trilateral effort to increase security and enhance prosperity” they have planned for us is even worse than what they’ve done for Iraq. Sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the SPP is the blueprint to drive the last nail into what once was a sovereign constitutional republic. It is NAFTA on steroids.\n\n(more info at link) [SEP] best_answer: It is unclear how much of this is going forward.  It is clear that the Bush administration, who are globalists, did try to have discussion continue without public scrutiny.  For example, when Congressman Tancredo recently called for public hearings to find out what is going on, the press was told that the names of Americans on the working groups were not being given out 'so they wouldn't be distracted by the public'.  Compare this to Canada where the names of the people on the working groups are on the government web page.\n\nBush thinks it would be dandy to have free immigration here from Mexico for cheap labor for employees, only screening for security.  The Senate Immigration bill which contained elements having us buy and give to Mexico equipment and training for patrolling their SOUTHERN border is possibly part of this - so Bush could ease up restrictions on their northern, our southern, border.\n\nWe don't know what is going on, and some of what is guessed is probably wrong.  However, it is disturbing that these discussions have been going on for more than a year and we know so little about it.\n\nI don't know if an 'Amero' is in the works.  However, the overall idea might work with a generally equal economy like Canada.  With Mexico it would flood our services including education.  Middle class tax payers would foot the bill while corporate employers benefit from cheap labor.	Politics & Government

question_title: Who do you think start wars, governments or ordinary people? So who do you think can stop them either? [SEP] question_content: Who do you think start wars, governments or ordinary people? So who do you think can stop them either? [SEP] best_answer: I agree w/FreeBird, there are lots of forces working behind the scenes for wars. As has been so painfully shown in this current one, I mean if you believe what the admin is saying that we invaded Iraq to "Protect our country" and "Foster Democracy". Then;\nA) Like the elusive WMDs, there never were any terrorists in Iraq...oh yeah TILL WE INVADED!\nB) What about Iran, N. Korea, or a multitude of other countries that have said outright,"We HATE America, we ARE developing WMDs, and WE WANT TO KILL YOU!"? \nC) Why right after 9/11 after saying "Our #1 priority is capturing or killing Bin Laden.." did "Dubya" not even 4 months later say,"We don't know where Bin Laden is, & we honestly don't care, Iraq is our main focus now..."?\n\nThink about how much $$ the defense industry, Haliburton, Big Oil, etc, has made & continues to make from this war.\nThis war was orchestrated as "pay back" for Bush's backers.\nTo keep our focus away while Bush dismantled 40 years of environmental protections, gave billions in tax cuts to the ultra rich, "outted" government whistleblowers who disagreed with his devious plans, and tried to rewrite future legislation to patronize his "base".\nWell beginning today most of that will be just a bad memory.\nDon't get me wrong, with the exception of the environment I think both parties are essentially the same. But just like the Dems before 94 with their complete control of the last 6 years, the old adage rang true,"Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely". The Republican party had become what they promised they would fight, we came out of the fog & sent them a message yesterday. Democracy works best when there is balance, right & left, Liberal & Conservative. That is what our founders sought to achieve. May the investigations begin!	Politics & Government
question_title: When was the last time that a tie occured in the Electoral College in a Presidential Election? [SEP] question_content: I need a date, and which main canidates were running, plus who won, and what was the tie ? like was it 222-222 or like 335-335 [SEP] best_answer: There has never been an exact tie in the Electoral College. To win, you must get a majority of all votes (curently 270 of the 538 Electors). The last time a candidate failed to do so was in 1824 with John Quincy Adams, who, because of the fragmented politics of the time, got only 84 of the 261 electoral votes. The election was then refered to the House of Representatives. Each state was allowed one vote, and Adams was elected over Andrew Jackson. The only time it has ever been even close to a tie was in 1876 when Rutherford Hayes beat Samuel Tilden 185 to 184.\n\nIn response to the two above answers, there is an even number of electors, 538, and the Senate chooses the Vice President in the event of a tie, not the president	Politics & Government

He was hanged on Friday, 3 Nov 2006. \n\nI believe he raped her and to shut her up he killed her.	Politics & Government

He has made enough rich people richer that he keeps getting away with such atrocities as opening up our roadless forests to mining and gas companies, giving away huge tax breaks to the Oil Industry giants, giving tax breaks to companies who move their base of operations out of the U.S. so hundreds of thousands of people lose their good paying jobs, close friends and working with top CEO's of Enron to give them tax breaks and let Enron run Pennsylvania's energy industry before that flopped, to lying to americans and congress about Iraq, war profiteering and the list just goes on and on. Does anyone wonder why Clinton was impeached for lying about sex? And no one questions why Bush has NOT been impeached for war crimes and illegaly wiretapping americans without a warrant?

question_title: So the people running our government AREN'T Neocons.  They AREN'T Conservatives.  They AREN'T True Republican? [SEP] question_content: Do I have that about right?  So, who the hell are they and why are half of you still supporting them?\n\nWho is "cut-and-run"ning now? [SEP] best_answer: You silly thing.  We support the IDEALS of the conservative movement.  Less government involvement, free trade, family values and less taxes followed by a strong national defense.  Just because we got a bad lot that lots of us agree probably got what they deserved doesn't mean our ideals of the conservative movement has changed.\n\nPart of making your party stronger is finding the problem and correcting it.  Is that cut-and-running? or is evolution? (thru you off there didn't I).  \n\nSo, at the end of the day why wouldn't I support those who have the same ideals and values as me?  Pelosi doesn't represent my ideals anymore than Delay does one stands for many things I completely disagree with and one is a complete fraud who I cannot support because my values dictate that I cannot.  \n\nThis wasn't an election to PROVE that conservative movement is dead.  It was an election about getting rid of those who didn't do their jobs either by a large number of democrats voting and a large number of republicans not voting or switching their votes in defiance.\n\nPelosi fixes the world still won't change what our values and ideals are that's just silly.

The west of Texas. It's pretty close to California. In more ways than Washington, D.C., is close to California." \n\n"Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?" \n\n"What I am against is quotas. I am against hard quotas, quotas they basically delineate based upon whatever. However they delineate, quotas, I think, vulcanize society. So I don't know how that fits into what everybody else is saying, their relative positions, but that's my position." \n\n"It's clearly a budget.

[SEP] best_answer: I don't really think Big Brother is listening to all our phone calls. Big Brother just doesn't have that much time and help.\n\nNot smoking? Here in FL people pretty much can't smoke indoors anymore, except in bars. That was a law passed by the voters. As a non smoker, even though I did not vote for it, it sure doesn't bother me to sit in a restaurant and not breathe in second hand smoke.\n\nI'm also all for the seat belt law. Aside from it protecting children, it also protects other people in the car from the 200 pound projectiles that morons become in an accident when they don't want to buckle up.\n\nBottom line (IMHO)-\nI don't really think that not wearing a seat belt is a right, as driving is a privilege. And since secondhand smoke has been proven harmful, I don't think people should be forced to be exposed to it.\n\nThe phone calls- that's something else. I do think there should be just cause for listening in on private conversations.	Politics & Government

I feel they could have gone about the issue a diffrent way, but i still dont see any changes in our country today because of yesterday. I dotn support what they are doing or why they are doing it, but why couldnt they have done it differently? Not going to work never solved problems for anyone.

question_title: At airports, is there a limit as to how much cash you can carry? [SEP] question_content: A customer at work asked me this question and I had no idea.  He said that a friend of his told him that a maximum of $10,000 (U.S. dollars) can be carried at the airport because of added security from drug dealers.  Is this true? [SEP] best_answer: You could carry as much as you want at the airport, in trash bags if you like. Carrying it onto an airplane that is leaving the country is where it gets tricky.\n\nThe US Customs service says that you can only take $10,000 without declaring it. Actually, if you declare it, in theory you could take any amount out of the country. \n\nSome countries actually do have limits as to how much money you can take into their borders, so you have to be careful at both ends of the trip.\n\nHere are the facts straight from the Customs Bureau:\n\nIt is legal to transport any amount of currency or other monetary instruments into or out of the United States.  However, if you transport, attempt to transport, or cause to be transported currency or other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 (or its foreign  equivalent) at one time from the United States to any foreign place, or into the United States from any foreign place, you must file a report with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  This report is called the Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments, FinCEN Form 105 (http://www.fincen.gov/forms/fin105_cmir.pdf).  These forms can be obtained at all U.S. ports of entry and departure.  You may continue to use a Customs Form 4790, the predecessor of FinCEN Form 105, to file the report until such forms are exhausted.  \n\nIn addition to the above requirement, if you as an individual or on behalf of an entity recognized as legal personalities (i.e. a company, corporation, partnership, etc.) sends, mails or ships monetary instruments to the United States from a foreign country valued at $10,000 or more, you are required to file a report with CBP before sending the monetary instruments to the recipient in the foreign country or in the United States.  If you or a legal personality you are affiliated with in the United States receives monetary instruments valued at $10,000 or more, sent via mail, ship, or express courier, you are also required to report to CBP.  You are required to file the report within 15 days upon receipt of the monetary instruments.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: The only evil I see is from those who want to force their beliefs on everyone else.\n\nWhat do you mean by "let him in our schools?" What are you referring to?\n\nPrayer in school?

(http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/pledge)\n\n...well, I just can't see how one would want to force young and impressionable children to "pledge" themselves to anything, let alone under a god they or their parents might not even believe in.\n\nTheists often think that just because they're the majority, they're the only ones who matter.

question_title: Do you think the U.S. military is better or worse since the changes enacted by Donald Rumsfeld? [SEP] question_content: I think the military of our nation is too small and unable to mobilize in sufficient numbers to be successful in a war situation. We needed three-times the hundred-thousand troops to be successful in Iraq, but the military leaders say they would be hard pressed to get an additional 20,000 troops. I believe we need a bigger, stronger military if we want to fight terrorism. Donald Rumsfeld's inept policies have left us vulnerable. What do you think? [SEP] best_answer: I would like to see a larger army as well. But our troops are the best\nthere are any where.	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: I would appreciate any legal information on the subject and would prefer to have a court case cited.

If you tell what state/jurisdiction are you from the answer can be made more specific.\nIn general a few things may happen:\n1. You jurisdiction treats engagement ring as a unconditional gift -- then woman keeps it.\n2. You jurisdiction treats engagement ring as a gift CONDITIONED on marriage going through.\nThere are 2 sub cases:\n2a. If the condition does not obtain for whatever reason --  woman has to give it back\n2b. If the condition does not obtain because of the fault of the gift giver(the man calls it of himself) then the woman may keep it.\n\nOnce again i cannot tell you for sure unless you tell us where are you from.

question_title: What are your thoughts re: limiting the number of consecutive terms our elected representatives can serve....? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I am very much in favor of term limits.  Our congress saw fit to limit the term of the presidency.  I strongly feel the same limits should applied to all elected offices at all levels. Yes, even the dog catcher if he is elected.  This will be the only way we can ever eleminate the professional politician.  Look at the mess we are now in because of these people.  Examples: Byrd of West Virginia, Kennedy of Mass., Graham of Florida, and last but not least Harry Ried.  They have been there so long that they think it is their right.  They have made our congress their Kingdoms.  We are, in essence, being held hostage by uncompromising professional politicians who never say "I support this issue because that is what my constiruents wish me to do." No it is "I feel that" or in "MY" opinion, or "I" this or that.  Why are they hollering about the national debt and actively seeking a pay raise for themselves. No one holding elective office should be allowed to receive a pay rasie during the term they were elected for.  They knew what the pay was before they campaigned for the job.  I have got a little of the subject of limiting the terms of office.  However, we must clean our government if we are to survive.  The initial step should to throw out the lot now there and institute a system that will not allow them back and will instead put people there who are everyday people with the disire to help everyday people.  What we now have is a very exclusive club which only admits the "haves" and continues to develope methods and means to exclude the "have nots."  Three things describe our current legislators. to many, to much, to long.	Politics & Government
question_title: What is your best plan for laying an ambush? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: On the turn of the mountain road when enemy motorcade approaches take out the first and last tanks, this will paralyze them. And with RPGs take out other cars/tanks/etc methodically. Against man force use sniper rifles. \nIn a city, most terrorists in Israel prefer laying ambushes against police patrols or simple suicide bombs. But there is another option - to attack arriving ambulances when everybody thinks operation is over.\nAccording to Sun-Tzu the surprise is a guarantee of success, because with this one defeats enemy's will to resist and subjugates him.\nAt all - I hate violence.

question_title: Does anyone here like  to go to jury duty? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I've never been called to be on a jury.\n\nMost people I've talked to who have been called to a jury have stated that it was just a waste of their time.\n\nThe concept of a jury is a good one, though, and the purpose it serves is valuable. Having a jury could mean the difference in civil suits where a plaintiff does or does not get the relief they seek. Juries in criminal cases are required since so much of the criminal law has to do with "what was reasonable" and other intangibles that should be left for the "every day man or woman to decide."\n\nTorts cases (and, boy, are there a lot) benefit from juries because the elements of "reasonableness" are present. \n\nJuries, in theory, protect the innocent from being prosecuted unfairly and help to insure that plaintiffs who had been wronged get the damages they are seeking. Juries, however, aren't perfect because they are so often comprised of un-educated people who often let their biases get in the way of justice (only 1/4 of America's adult population is undergraduate college-educated; less than 10% of the adult population has some sort of graduate or professional schooling).

If so, the story was not real and is based on the future.  \n\nSince it isn't true, that answers your next question, no, there is no celebration of this man as he never existed.\n\nYes, I saw the movie yesterday afternoon and really enjoyed it.  It is a long movie but it moved so quickly that I didn't realize how long it was until I exited the theatre.\n\nThe movie, Vengeance, by Stephen Speilberg is based on the Mossad killing perpretators of the Munich Olympics and I don't think it  has been released yet.

The lawyer will give him the best advise, but if the charge is possession and he possessed it then guilt is pretty much assured.

[SEP] best_answer: It won't "hurt" you, but it will make you miserable and less likely to be able to function at your top form at work. I would call your doctor's office and tell them of your predicament. Some doctors are kind enough to give you enough samples to get you by until your insurance kicks in and some drug companies have patient assistance programs where you can get the drugs for free. The nurse or doctor at the office can get this information for you from their reps that come in the office. Don't be shy- speak up and maybe you can make it through this tough time without having to give up your meds.	Health

An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: \neating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances \na sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating) \nRecurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. \nThe binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least twice a week for 3 months. \nSelf-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. \nThe disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa. \nSpecify type:\nPurging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas \nNonpurging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has used other inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as fasting or excessive exercise, but has not regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\nAnorexia Nervosa; Binge-Eating/Purging Type; Kleine-Levin syndrome; Major Depressive Disorder, With Atypical Features; Borderline Personality Disorder.

question_title: How can I just shut-up? [SEP] question_content: I mean I notice some people work through their problems inside and talk about it later. But I  always seem to talk my problems out and later wish I kept it to myself. i can' t stop, when I have a problem it is like an uncontrolable urge to talk to someone to help sort it out... How can I just shut-up when I feel out of control, like a baloon about to explode until I talk it out? [SEP] best_answer: I understand your dilemma, because I used to be this way myself. I would find myself talking about things in my life that should have been private to almost anyone, and occasionally, I still do.  I am not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, so basically, this is just coming from my experience and opinions.  I think the reason that you tell others about your problems is that either 1. you don't trust yourself to solve them or 2. you don't want to take the responsibility of solving them yourself, in case you don't make the right decision.  You look to others' opinions and suggestions, even though you probably already know how you should handle the situation.\nIf you do this because of the 1st reason I mentioned, you don't trust yourself to solve your problems on your own, it is most likely due to a lack of self-esteem.  You don't value your own opinion enough to believe that you are capable of managing your own life. In this case, you need to learn to believe in yourself. Counseling/therapy, support groups, or even a self-help book may be somethings to try, maybe even all of them. But, if self-esteem is the case, I'm sure that this is not the only are of your life being affected.\nIf it is the 2nd reason, you don't want to take the responsibility of solving your problems yourself, in case you don't make the right decision, you have to acknowledge that this is what you are doing, and consciously make an effort to make these decisions and take the responsibility.  It is easier to blame someone else if something goes wrong, "It's not my fault, I was just following their advice".  The only problem with that is that it IS still your fault anyway.....you are the one who made the decision to take THAT advice!  At least if you make the decisions yourself, you will have some things to rely on that are better than other people's opinions, like your gut feeling, your thoughts and experiences, and your conscience to help you make the decisions that YOU believe are right.......and at least you'll have that to fall back on.

question_title: Does anybody know if penis size can be incresead? in large and width? [SEP] question_content: Is there a method that really works for penis enlargement and wich is? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, it can be increased in both length and girth in both the flaccid and erect states by use of the Andro Penis medical traction device to permanently expand the blood-carrying chambers (the largest being the corpus cavernosa) of the penis.\n\nUse the Andro Penis device 4-9 hours per day for 3-6 months. You will have time-linear flaccid and erect gains in length and some girth gains as well. The flaccid gains appear first. If you want additional girth gains than what you get with the Andro, you should use a PowerJelq device for 10-15 minutes a day to supplement it.\n\nI've gained permanently 1.75" length and 1" girth since June 2005 through the use of the Andro Penis and (very occassionally) PowerJelq for exercises. I'm very pleased with these results. Try it, and you will be happy to see serious gains after 3-6 months usage.\n\nThere is some information about extenders in general and on proven jelqing techniques on a website called the men's forum. (in regards to jelqing, 15 minutes of PowerJelq device equals 2 hours of manual exercise). This is a commercial website with a forum, and they relabel their extender product Size Genetics. I'm not sure if they use the JES extender or the Andro. However, in any case the Andro is the best extender product because of the more comfortable silicon band design which is not present on other brand extenders. The site forum discusses common issues with the product, the most common are 1) how to make wearing the product more comfortable 2) how to effectively secure the product 3) when and how long you can use the product. Generally the answers to these 3 issues are: 1) use the padding band over your glans before putting it in the silicone band 2) use some padding or other material to prevent slippage of the glans out of the band 3) have a rest period every 2 hours at least, and massage yourself during that time to ensure good blood flow. Don't use the device while sleeping (you won't have the required massage break every 2 hrs). The manual that comes with the Andro has adequate information on what to do and what not to do.\n\nSide note about purchasing this item: you can usually buy this item on Ebay for about 1/2 the cost of other websites. Make sure to shop for the best price. I paid $150. My package included pills, but I never used the pills and I've still gained 1.75", 1" girth in 7 months.\n\nSee the link for a study on men using the device. It indicates an average growth per month of around .47 cm in length. Also, after six months, a "median minimum gain" of 2.8 cm.\n\nAlso, I believe it is helpful to perform PC (kegel) exercises to strengthen the PC muscle. You will be enlarging yourself quite significantly and you want to maintain very strong erection strength and stamina which are controlled by the pubococcyl muscle.\n\nIf you need more information let me know.

When I asked him about it, he said yes, there seems 2 b a pattern & that he gets blisters there too. He also said he heard it's the body's way of healing itself and is a "mini-version" of what happens when u get septum damage. (He isn't a heavy or reg user and is keen to have breaks from it, as he doesn't want to make the soreness worse.)\n\nCan anyone point me to some medical websites that give some info on this? I think it's really interesting.\n\nNOTE: Answers that just give a generic "cocaine is for losers" or "I hope he goes to prison" will be ignored. This isn't a moral question. I'm inviting well-informed answers on a possible, specific physical effect.\n\nPlease be kind to me, as this is the first time I've properly participated in Yahoo Answers after lurking 4 ages!

question_title: what to eat after workout in the evening? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You must eat after working out, and it all depends what your going for. I'm guessing your working out to stay in shape or lose weight.  So for this reason I suggest you eat a light meal high in protein and medium to low in carbohydrates.  Your body is trying to recover what you just put it threw and if it doesn't have the right nutrients to heal properly then you are wasting your time or hurting yourself.  Eat about 45 minutes after you workout, take a hot shower to relax your muscles and let the blood flow throughout the body.  Eating to quickly after a work out and all the blood that is flowing and feeding your muscles will go to digest the food.  Lean meats. canned tuna, a piece of fruit, protein shake, broccoli, one of the best dishes to eat after a work out is chicken broccoli and pasta dish it has alot of power pack nutrients for the muscle.

In the meantime you could take Evening Primrose Oil, 1 capsule 3 times a day, you should be able to find it at any health food store, or anyplace that sells natural supplements. I have Polycystic Ovarian Disease, and I found that this was the best treatment for the pain.( if you find it doesn't work, have your GP prescribe Anaprox, it's also a very good pain reliever)\n\n\n Good Luck to you and I hope you feel better.

question_title: When should my Period Start? [SEP] question_content: I had an IUD(Minera) put in on September 19th and started Spotting that same day. Then on September 25th I started bleeding like a normal period flow. And that lasted like a normal period flow till October 23rd. Then I spotted for a couple days then done. And then Spotting again for about a week and a half. And now I'm just lightly spotting off and on. I would think that my period should be here again by now but nothing. Anyone know when I should expect it. I'm not entirely sure because how long i had AF for before. I have also had one more period sense having my son. I had Post Pardum bleeding from 4 1/2 weeks then stopped bleeding till i was 6 1/2 week Post pardum. then on Aug 31st started AF Till September 9th. I'm lost....I just want to know when to expect my period. I would have assumed it should have been here a couple days ago or something.\n\nI am Also Breast Feeding almost 100%...But still got a normal Period before getting the IUD put in. [SEP] best_answer: Its normal to have abnormal bleeding during the 1st year of the IUD. I had mine put in 4 wks post partum and breastfed 100% until my son was 1 year old. I can tell you I spotted more the 1st 3 months I was on the Mirena and then it stopped and now 3 yrs later I have no period and no spotting. The cramping might be due to the breastfeeding. Your uterus does contract while breastfeeding. Did you have it checked out after insertion to verify its positioning? If so I wouldn't really worry it may take anywhere from 3months to 1 year for your body to fully adjust to the IUD.\nCONGRATS on the baby and on Breastfeeding 100%!!!!!\nGood luck	Health

question_title: anyone know a healthy and/or natural way to reduce and ultimately get rid of cellulite? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I use to work in the beauty industry and I can tell you those topical products will only reduce the appearance, not get rid of it. Plus you have to continue using them. They are not a permanent fix. Cellulite has more to do with heredity and your skin than how fit you are. Even the most fit athletic people have body fat but it only shows on your skin if you have thin and/or fair skin (like me :)). Skin damage, like from the sun, only will make it worse so don't think you you can disguise it by making your skin darker with tanning beds or sun exposure. You will only damage your skin further and cause even worse problems like spider veins, freckles, or even a melanoma. My best advice is just eat healthy and exercise and embrace your body the way God created it. It is a miraculous machine that is perfection in itself even if those airbrushed fashion magazines try to convine you otherwise.	Health

There's no reason to do countless amounts of warm up sets in the gym before each exercise.	Health
question_title: Advice on neck and shoulder pain where to seek treament? [SEP] question_content: For past 3 weeks painful right side neck. Now pain on right and left and down through shoulders. No relief from sleep or neck exercises and cold packs. [SEP] best_answer: Go see your doctor.  He can run tests to diagnose the cause of the pain and then make appropriate recommendations.  He can prescribe pain meds and/or muscle relaxers if needed.  Also, he may recommend physical therapy, chiropractic care, or massage therapy as options to improve your condition.\n\nThe type of pain you have will dictate treatment.  Is is a muscle spasm?  You may want to try hot pack.  Is it sharp, shooting pain?  Stick with the ice.  Is there numbnesss or tingling involved?  This may be due to a nerve problem.\n\nWhat time of day is your pain worst?  In the AM would indicate chemical changes in your body (arthritis, inflammation).  In the PM would indicate your pain is mechanical in nature - meaning your posture or body mechanics (think office ergonomics!) could be the problem.	Health

question_title: I need to lose 15-20 pounds in the next 5 weeks. What's the quickest way to do it? [SEP] question_content: MY MAIN PROBLEM IS MY WAIST/STOMACH AREA. I NEED TO KNOW THE QUICKEST, MOST EFFECTIVE AB WORKOUT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS! MY FIANCE DECIDED AT THE VERY LST MINUTE HE WANTS TO GO TO A HIGH SCHOOL REUNION AND I WANT TO LOOK GREAT! [SEP] best_answer: The quickest way isn't always the best way or the right way for you. Here are 3 different approaches that work:\n\n1) The quickest by far is surgery, of course. Liposuction is fast and works wonders- but actual stomach reductions (stapling, bypass etc) have not only been proven effective for weightloss but also in reducing the chances you'll develop adult onset diabetes.\n\n2) Next fastest is to eat a diet of 80% natural fats and 20% protein, in 5 small portions, with a target of 1000 calories a day. This is like eating a 2 oz bag of macadamia nuts, or 2 oz of egg salad or tuna salad as a complete meal, every meal. It works- and for any significant amount of weight it's better than starvation. More importantly the high fat content of the diet ensures that your body continues to produce the hormones you need to retain muscle tissue- so you lose fat pounds and not muscle pounds.\n\n3) Probably the best long term solution to lose weight and improve your health is to follow a light excercise routine several times per week, and to eat a diet that is high in fiber and has a low glycemic index (that is- eat foods that are low in processed sugar and grains, preferring when you eat carbohydrates to try whole grains and natural sugars).

question_title: Why the first things that medical doctor do in the hospital is measuring temperature and blood pressure? [SEP] question_content: is the body temperature and blood pressure determine the person's health? [SEP] best_answer: They are both very good indicators of whether something is wrong. They are the basic vital signs of the body. An elevated temperature can indicate that there is an infection, as your body fights whatever is going on it causes your temp. to go up. Then there are times that a person body temp. goes down. The whole purpose though is so that they have a baseline to work with. They continue to monitor those things and so they will know whether it has gone up or down. The blood pressure is very important. It can tell them alot. Again it is very important to have a baseline to go by. They do indicate if there is a problem. although it doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong. They just need to have an initial reading so that they have something to go by.	Health

Sorry Ladies but If u Know anything U can also Answer. [SEP] best_answer: There is nothing especially right or wrong about most anything we do, as long as we do not hurt ourselves or another.  Know that almost the entire male population does this, so there is no problem, if that is the way we are made, and it is.  Moderation is the key.  One side note, the more you use it, like exercise, it keeps working, so this is good for health overall.  Soap is not especially good because it dries skin.  Better, consider Johnson's baby oil.  The number of times a guy does this varies among everyone, and a guy does it more some times and less other times.  That is the way it is.  You cannot do it too much, or too little.  You will do this whenever it is right for you.  No two of us are the same, so what is 3 times a week or one guy, might be 3 times a day for another or once a month for another.  There is a wide variety here, and all of this is normal.	Health

question_title: hi i want to lose 15 kilos in 2 to 3 months.how can i do that?its emergency? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The quickest way is to cut out red meats, starches, breads, sugars, alcohal, and sodas.\n\nEat veggies (salads are good), soups, and drink TONS of water. If you get hungry between a meal, drink water to fill up.\n\nIn moderation eat white meats, and fruits (fruits contain natural sugars, and that can put on weight)\n\nPractice portion control. Yes, you'll feel hungry at first, but think of your goal, and soon your stomach will start shrinking and you won't have that feeling anymore.\n\nEat 5 times a day. A small breakfast. A mid-morning snack, such as an apple. A small lunch. A mid-afternoon snack, such as carrots. A lite dinner. Do not eat any later than 7pm (6pm is better.)\n\nGo exercise for at least an hour a day, incorporating weight training. Weight training builds muscle. Muscle burns fat. You get the idea. It also gives tone and definition. \n\nGood luck!!	Health

[SEP] question_content: I have never felt 'in my body' and have always felt like I am in my own world - I interact and I am functional (great job etc) from the 'outside' but I'm feeling more and more like a fraud human!\nI was molested and abused a bit when I was younger (though compared to some people, its quite minimal) and I just feel that I never got a chance to connect with my body. I've been struggling with anorexia and bulimia for 10 years now. I felt happiest when I was anorexic (still in recovery) because I looked exactly how I felt. I want to be ana again. \n\nI look at people in the street and think 'what the hell? how are they living? I look at people I have known my whole life and think 'who are you?!' I feel like they are almost strangers and I've been sleepwalking my whole life!\nHow can I 'wake up', how can I 'heal' and start to feel like I am alive? [SEP] best_answer: This is a tough one.\n\nTo feel completely separated from your sense of Self and your body goes hand-in-hand with eating disorders. Do you self-injure, too?\n\nAn eating disorder is actually a means of someone asserting control over their life when they feel they have very little. It is rarely a symptom of someone who wants to be thin, though it's very common that someone w/an eating disorder hates themself and wants to do themself harm.\n\nBulimia is a very common disease with successful, charismatic women who endure a lot of stress at work or in life in general.\n\nI had to come at my bulimia and self-harm from a few different angles. Firstly, I got myself a good book -- The Secret Language of Eating Disorders by Peggy Claude-Pierre. I read it and took note of the things she said that resonated with me most.\n\nI saw a therapist once a week for two years. It was pricey but completely necessary. It helped more than I can describe. Just telling someone about how awful you feel and how alienated you think you are, and having them console you and validate your feelings, is powerfully healing.\n\nStart to write down things you like about yourself. Keep track of details  during the day that make you feel connected to yourself. Treat yourself to things throughout the day -- a positive thought, an inside joke with yourself, a cup of tea, anything.\n\nI can relate to wanted to go back to your eating disorder. It feels safe and consistent and when you look at yourself and see your body as the result of your own control, well, it feels great. A therapist will help you with this. find a support group and meet with the people there. The strengths of others are extremely powerful during times like these.	Health

Note,  dont wanna hear people say everbody is different only serious answer here ok!! [SEP] best_answer: Implanon contains progestin which carries the risk of some very serious side effects:\n- suppress production of natural progesterone in the body.\n- disrupt the steroid hormone pathways, which can cause both immediate and/or insidious undermining of both adrenal and gonadal function. Since a steroid hormone pathway is fundamental to energy and vitality, these drugs are usually a prescription for chronic fatigue (and probably fibromyalgia).\n- depression\n- anxiety, nervousness\n- fatigue, leading to chronic fatigue over time\n- fluid retention and breast tenderness, weight gain\n- migraine\n- angina, palpitations\n- menstrual irregularities, spotting\n- glucose intolerance; promotes insulin resistance\n- general edema\n- nausea\n- insomnia, sleepiness\n- skin rashes, acne\n- hair loss on scalp, facial hair growth\n- Coronary artery spasm - This is most significant: 90% of men who have heart attacks have atherosclerosis or obstruction of coronary arteries, but only 30% of women do. The majority of women who have heart attacks do so because of coronary artery spasm.\n- Stroke\n- Pulmonary embolism\n- Implicated in causing breast cancer\n- sudden or partial loss of vision\n- liver disease\n- Increases the risk of birth defects\n- Gall bladder disease\n\nThe 2001 PDR states this about progestins: "The effect of prolonged use of this drug on pituitary, ovarian, adrenal, hepatic or uterine functions is unknown".\n\n\nAnd who knows if Implanon users will incur the numerous problems -- such as injury upon removal -- that forced Wyeth to pull Norplant from the market six years ago in the face of numerous health-related lawsuits.

question_title: What are some snacks you can have while on the Atkins diet? Not any of that Atkins brand stuff, other stuff.? [SEP] question_content: My fiance is on the atkins diet and has been for two weeks today.  He is having some trouble only eating meat and cheese and is trying to find some other things he can eat that don't have any carbs.  We found that jello and whipped creme I believe it is, don't have any carbs so I made him a bunch of that but I am wondering what else is out there.\n\nAre there any other food you know of that don't have any carbs or <1g of carbs?  \n\nI know they have that Atkins brand food, but I know there has to be something out there, "regular food" that he could eat besides buying that expensive food.\n\nAfter two weeks he is allowed to have 24g of carbs a day, but obviously less is better.\n\nThanks so much! [SEP] best_answer: it really pays to become acquainted with the rest of the diet.  Just meat and cheese is not required at any stage, but after week two you get a lot more flexibility.  As a guy I think he can go quite a bit higher during stage 2..check the book or website again.\n\ngreat snacks, not all under 1 net carb (you need to understand carb from net carb because net carbs are the only ones that count..see the web links below)\n\ndeviled eggs\nsliced ham with cream cheese spread on the inside and rolled up\npork rinds\nI forget the name but there's a company out there that makes crackers out of cheese and they are good..check lowcarbluxury.com\n\nnuts\nstrawberries\nbeef jerky\nroasted soy nuts\nsugar free jello \ncarbsmart creamsicles (these are my favorite snack and they ARE 0 carbs!)\nlow carb ice cream\nlow carb yogurt (and I read a recent report that suggest the residual carbs in yogurt don't have to be counted because they are pre-digested)\npork rinds (can be dipped into any low carb dip or salsa)\n\nIt also pays to learn to cook as there are thousands of great recipes out there, even recipes for cookies and cakes!  Cooking is also the best way to control what's really in your food.\n\nThere are also good products that taste a lot better than the Atkins brand stuff.  Keto makes good stuff, and the Pure Delight Chocolates (Walmart had them, World Market still does) are better than most other chocolates.\n\nThe warnings - Some of the sweetners in sugar free and low carb sweets can have a laxative effect on some.  If you're sensitive to them, they will give you gas that will peel paint!\n\nAlso...adding snacks is good, but at no time on atkins are you supposed to eat yourself silly.  Even though all you are counting is carbs, he tells you to eat only until satisfied.  You can still overeat and sabotage the diet.  What's more the whole point is that you learn new habits, so snacking all the time is not a good idea.	Health
question_title: What meals can i cook up to clear up my acne? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Refined carbs/sugar = more insulin = more hormones = more sebum (oil) = more bacteria = more acne\n\nWe're always being told that a diet of pizza and chocolate doesn't cause acne, which may be true to a certain extent, but certain foods can aggravate acne. Simply by cutting down on the foods that can aggravate acne and eating more foods that can help alleviate acne your skin condition will improve.\n\nPeople with skin that is susceptible to acne can benefit from eating a wide range of fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds. These foods have been found to be beneficial in helping reduce acne.\n\nFor good skin health, you need plenty of antioxidants (vitamin A (mainly from beta-carotene), vitamins C and E and selenium), B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, chloride, magnesium, zinc, iron and sodium. A diet high in beta-carotene and zinc can be especially beneficial to acne. Men with acne can also benefit from extra selenium. Having plenty of the right minerals and vitamins will also help your skin by speeding up the healing process and spots and scarring will fade more quickly. \n\nDrink at least 2 litres of still mineral water daily. Drinking plenty of water helps reduce acne by flushing toxins out of your system and keeping your kidneys, liver and bowel functioning effectively. A sluggish digestive system is often linked to acne. Drinking plenty of water and eating lots of fibre in the form of fruit and vegetables will keep your insides healthy. Water will also help keep your skin supple and hydrated. Dehydrated skin can become dry and flaky, the skin's natural exfoliation slows down and pores become blocked which in turn can cause spots.

question_title: How do I be more social? I am quite the hermit and this is really impacting me emotionally.? [SEP] question_content: How do I meet new people when I am very reserved?\nRecently all of my friends moved and now I have no one.I also have not had a boyfriend for almost 3 years. (I tell myself the reason for not having a boyfriend was because I was so busy going to school and work) \nMy friend came and visited me this weekend and told me I have to stop keeping myself in my shell and get out and meet people and that she is really worried for me. I am very reserved and have a hard time opening up to people..even my close friends. I am worried too!However I hate going out to bars. How can I meet new people from scratch? This is very hard for me. It's like I want to reach out to people however I feel it is easier to turn inward and become a hermit. I am very lonely and spend almost every waking alone. Help! I am only 27!!! [SEP] best_answer: To be more social on a regular basis, a person has to take themselves out of their shell. You probably like it in your shell because that's where you're comfortable, You've been there so long and it's nice and cozy. What is not often realized is that when you do something that's outside of your comfort zone enough times, it becomes your new comfort zone! Adaptation.. Improvisation.. but your weakness is not your technique. Go out on a regular basis and make a note of it to just say hi to people. Then when the situation arises and you think you'll live through it, Talk to people when waiting in the checkout line or in any type of waiting situation. Talk about anything, weather, something they're wearing, something you like about them. Keep it positive! After a while of this you'll eventually realize, wow, I'm so much more outgoing than I used to be. And it will be good.	Health
question_title: I need weight loss help!!!!!!? [SEP] question_content: I am 26 years old and have had five children in nine years. I am currently my heaviest I have ever been. I weigh 225 lbs. My twin boys are going to be 1 year old next month. My husband hasn't touched me in almost three months. I stay at home and I have a YMCA membership, but I don't know what to do for my size.  I need serious answers here. [SEP] best_answer: 3 years ago I weighed 230 so I totally understand what you are going through. The hardest thing is you cant actually lose weight until you are truly happy with yourself.\nI did the Subway diet for the first year. I would have 1 foot-long everyday with a small breakfast and snack. I would eat a 6inch for lunch and dinner. You can have any of the under 6grams of fat sandwiches with no mayo. (They're all delicious my favorite is Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki) \nBreakfast ideas are oatmeal or oatmeal with one piece of whole wheat bread. Whole grain cereal, An egg on a piece of whole wheat toast and some salsa. Also for a snack or lunch you Can have Lean Cuisines (which are actually delicious) and of course vegetables and fruit are always a great snack. I really like sliced up apples with a lil bit of peanut butter on top. \nThere is alot of different things you can have. You want to make sure you eat 6 small portions a day, even if you arn't hungry still eat small portions so you don't accidentally over eat. \nI personally count calories. The average women can have 2,000 calories a day so if you start eating 1,700 calories instead you will lose about 2 lbs. a week. Also you should walk for at least 30 minutes a day. \nIt also helps to have a friend to talk with about your weight struggles because it is so hard. \nFeel free to contact me back. =o)	Health

question_title: sun allergy? [SEP] question_content: in the summer i get these awful bumps on my face, this only happens at summer any other time my face is fine. Does anyone else suffer this and know of a good cream. No matter how high the factor is on my sun block they still manage to show up every year, and take monthe to go away. [SEP] best_answer: There is such a thing as Sun allergy (photo-sensitivity)\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nA sun allergy is an immune system reaction to sunlight, most often, an itchy red rash. The most common locations include the "V" of the neck, the back of the hands, the outside surface of the arms and the lower legs. In rare cases, the skin reaction may be more severe, producing hives or small blisters that may even spread to skin in clothed areas.\n\nSun allergies are triggered by changes that occur in sun-exposed skin. It is not clear why the body develops this reaction. However, the immune system recognizes some components of the sun-altered skin as "foreign," and the body activates its immune defenses against them. This produces an allergic reaction that takes the form of a rash, tiny blisters or, rarely, some other type of skin eruption.\n\nSun allergies occur only in certain sensitive people, and in some cases, they can be triggered by only a few brief moments of sun exposure. Scientists do not know exactly why some people develop a sun allergy and others do not. There is evidence, however, that some forms of sun allergy are inherited.\n\nA few of the most common types of sun allergy are:\n\nPolymorphous light eruption (PMLE) — PMLE, which usually appears as an itchy rash on sun-exposed skin, is the second most common sun-related skin problem seen by doctors, after common sunburn. It occurs in an estimated 10% to 15% of the U.S. population, affecting people of all races and ethnic backgrounds. Women are affected by PMLE more often than men, and symptoms typically begin during young adult life. In temperate climates, PMLE is usually rare in the winter, but common during the spring and summer months. In many cases, the PMLE rash returns every spring, immediately after the person begins spending more time outside. As spring turns into summer, repeated sun exposure may cause the person to become less sensitive to sunlight, and the PMLE rash either may disappear totally or gradually become less severe. Although the effects of this desensitisation process, called "hardening," usually last through the end of the summer, the PMLE rash often returns at full intensity the following spring.\n\n\nActinic prurigo (hereditary PMLE) — This inherited form of PMLE occurs in people of American Indian background, including the American Indian populations of North, South and Central America. Its symptoms are usually more intense than those of classic PMLE, and they often begin earlier, during childhood or adolescence. Several generations of the same family may have a history of the problem.\n\n\nPhoto allergic eruption — In this form of sun allergy, a skin reaction is triggered by the effect of sunlight on a chemical that has been applied to the skin (often an ingredient in sunscreen, fragrances, cosmetics or antibiotic ointments) or ingested in a drug (often a prescription medicine). Common prescription medicines that can cause a photo allergic eruption include antibiotics (especially tetracyclines and sulfonamides), phenothiazines used to treat psychiatric illness, diuretics for high blood pressure and heart failure, and certain oral contraceptives. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has linked some cases of photo allergic reaction to the nonprescription pain relievers ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Naprosyn and others).\n\n\nSolar urticaria — This form of sun allergy produces hives (large, itchy, red bumps) on sun-exposed skin. It is a rare condition that most often affects young women.\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms vary, depending on the specific type of sun allergy:\n\nPMLE — PMLE typically produces an itchy or burning rash within the first two hours after sun exposure. The rash usually appears on sun-exposed portions of the neck, upper chest, arms and lower legs. In addition, there may be one to two hours of chills, headache, nausea and malaise (a general sick feeling). In rare case	Health

Outside of bed he is very sweet and kind to me. He seems happy to be home at the end of the day. He raps his arms around me while we dance to great music and have candle light dinners. He kisses me good bye in the morning.\nBut when we go to bed, he doesn't want me to touch him. Even in a non sexual way. He make no advances towards me either. When he is in the mood he will nudge me. He wants me to start things off with oral sex. When he's ready he'll get on top to finish. I've tried to talk about it, but he say his body tempature is to hot from just getting out of the shower or he's had to much beer, or he's to tired, or he'll actually push me away. I know he loves me or I wouldn't be here. But if he's not going to talk about it and admitt their is a problem what can I do to help? [SEP] best_answer: It could be he is stressed out about his work,or overly tired,you should really sit down and try to have a conversation with him,and see if there is anything going on in his life that he hasnt been able to express to you.Different people have Different sex drives as well,you really need to work it out with him and compromise.Let him know how your feeling.Also I reccomend that you consider marriage,sometimes the guilt people feel shacking up affects the sex drive.No offense!

question_title: Prescription Advice? [SEP] question_content: I'm trying to get a new drug that just came out prescribed to me, but I don't have insurance.

I'm not cheap, just broke.\nJust FYI, it's not pot. It's a legit drug that I need and am currently taking in pill form. I would like to try the injectable.\nThank you for your advice. [SEP] best_answer: If you are currently taking the pill form, that must mean that you do have a personal physician? - the one that prescribed it to you?\nWhy don't you call his/her office, ask them to have his nurse phone you when she has time that day, and have her check to see if the Dr. would consider the injectable.  You may still have to ssee him in person, but at least you would know if he is comfortable enough to prescribe this for you.	Health
question_title: Prior to the other question about my "issues"? [SEP] question_content: I have a really heavy flow and instead of having my period every month, i skip one or even two. I'm looking for something that can control i.e a birth control pill that isn't strong. [SEP] best_answer: There are tablets which you can take which aren't hormone based but which help to decrease the flow and the pain.\n\nMefenamic Acid is an anti-prostaglandin (prostaglandins cause the pain during your period) and you take it for a few days before your period is due and for the first couple of days of your period. It help reduce the pain, and also over time reduces the amount of blood loss.\n\nTranexamic acid is an anti-fibrinolytic and is used to reduce blood flow. \n\nBoth tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid can be used together to reduce blood flow during a period. However, the best thing really is to go onto the birth control pill - it dramatically reduces bleeding and pain.\n\nAlso, since your periods are irregular, it may be worth speaking to your doctor about having blood tests done, or possibly an ultrasound to see whether you may have something like PCOS.

question_title: Is antiperspirant a cause of breast cancer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no good scientific evidence to support this claim. The American Cancer Society is not aware of any strong epidemiologic studies reporting a statistical association between breast cancer risk and antiperspirant use. \n\nTo the contrary, a carefully-designed epidemiologic study of this issue published in 2002 compared 813 women with breast cancer and 793 women without the disease found no relationship between breast cancer risk and antiperspirant use, deodorant use, or underarm shaving. Likewise, we are not aware of any evidence that aluminum or any of the other chemicals in antiperspirants are mutagenic (cause DNA damage that can lead to cancer). Products such as antiperspirants are rigorously tested and evaluated by the FDA before they can be marketed. \n\nAnother study published in 2003 reported that women who used underarm antiperspirant and shaved their underarms tended to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age than women who do not. However, the study design did not include a control group of women without breast cancer and has been criticized by experts as not relevant to the safety of these underarm hygiene practices. It is likely that in general, young women are more likely than elderly women to shave their underarms, regardless of whether they later develop breast cancer. This is a more likely explanation of the researchersÂ’ findings than the suggestion that these practices cause cancer.	Health

question_title: My boyfriend has a bad habit? [SEP] question_content: Ok so on Yahoo 360 ( I asked about this subject yesterday-but this is a differnet question) There are a lot of nude women and men with their chests out. My BF loves to look and laugh and sometimes gaze at the nude people. Sometimes looking at the women while at my house is a bit annoying. I know that its all in fun, but I just feel he should do that at home, when I am not around. I am not so sure why I feel really uncomfortable with it, because we have watched movies with nude people and sometimes I even laugh at the people on Yahoo 360. But yesterday when I told him about my feelings, he said I was being jealous and then tried to say that he doesnt like the people or want them, and most of them live out of state. I am not so sure why I dont like it.  I am not a jealous person and do not really feel a threat or maybe I do in a way. This did not result in a huge arguement but I dont want my guy thinking I am some crazy girl. What do you all think? [SEP] best_answer: It is okay to look at others, but a person should have respect not to do it so obviously in front of his girlfriend.\n\nI don't think he will do anything with the other girls.  But every girl likes to feel that the boyfriend only has eyes for her.  He is insensitive to this issue.\n\nI think you are right.  If he continues to do it, do it on his own time.  If this doesn't slow down, it might be time for a new boyfriend.  One that respect you.	Family & Relationships

Remember this is work, they need to be taught a good work ethic, and not taught that all work will be exciting and fun.  Just my opinion, but my kids do it regardless of what it is and they are learning very well!	Family & Relationships

question_title: ladies how do i make my wife happier? [SEP] question_content: we are happy and have a great marriage i just want some tips on making her even happier and adding a little more spark [SEP] best_answer: Awww, that's so sweet. I definitely agree with the person who suggested doing something unexpected - and it really doesn't have to be big. I love it when my hubby brings me flowers - even if I know they cost him under $5. Sometimes he even picks them himself from a field or roadside, and that is even more special than buying them. \n\nHelping with the cleaning is always nice - if you have kids, taking them out so your wife can have some alone time can really be a special treat. \n\nIntimate things like rubbing her feet, brushing her hair, putting lotion on her back, etc. are always nice. \n\nAnd you know...since you're such a nice guy and obviously want to make her happy - you could always ask her what she would like. Especially when it comes to the more intimate stuff in the bedroom - you want to woo her, not offend her.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Why can't I get healthcare for my mother? [SEP] question_content: When gay groups have cried loud enough, their (sexual) dometic partners were granted healthcare benefits, as if they were married (laugh).  Now if my mother is living in the same home, under the same roof, why can't I claim her on my insurance?  She is relation to me by blood.  Perhaps if I claim incest type of relationship it will work for her getting insurance.  Give me your thoughts.

question_title: Should we celebrate my birthday or break up? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year now.  When we are together, things are great but when we are apart, I question why we are together.  \n\nHe has been searching for apartments for us to live in, yet he is relcutant to sign a lease.  When I question him about it, he says he feels pressured.  And he's worried about his finances.\n\nI told him that I feel as though he has been pushing me away and that he doesn't want to be with me.  His response is, "what do you want to do".  I asked if this was his way of getting me to break up with him.  He claims that he isn't pushing me away and isn't trying to get me to break up with him.  \n\nMy birthday is in a few days and he wants me to go to his place for a fun night full of suprises.  We got in a fight today and I said that I feel as though I am at the end of my rope and asked why I should see him.  He says "because you should want to spend your time with me.  We'll have fun and I love you and want to be with you." [SEP] best_answer: Hon, you said something very important..when he is around you you want to be with him but when he is not around you then you question why you are together.........this means that some way or another he is munipulating the situation.

question_title: what is love? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: That is a complicated question.  You will never know unless you find out for yourself.  Otherwise you can find the English definition, the bible verse, etc. describing love.  But love is more than just the words that describes it.  It is a feeling.  It is knowing that the person you love is trustworthy and worth caring for.  Love is also making sacrifices for someone.  Love is the smile on your face or the tear in your eye from a perfect memory of you and your loved one.  Whether it is a family member, spouse, or best friend, love is unconditional.  There are not enough words to write in this text box to say what love is.  So find out, and I grant you a good luck along your journey on the mystery road of love.	Family & Relationships
question_title: I want to get in contact with my ex? [SEP] question_content: Ok, here's the situation. Two weeks ago today I broke up with my boyfriend of six months. It was actually a mutual breakup though, since he had no objections. He and I had been fighting a lot during the last several weeks of the relationship. Before that, we were getting along pretty well, and were in love. He treated me very well before all the really bad fighting started. Two days after the breakup I sent him an email asking for forgiveness since I ended the relationship so abruptly and while his parents were still in town. (I met them a few days prior) He never replied to that email, though. Yesterday I really had the urge to talk to him, so I called him up and left a voicemail saying hi and that I'd like to still be friends if he wants to as well. So far he hasn't called me back. I'm having a really hard time letting go and moving on. I guess I still have some feelings for him. I think I'd feel so much if he'd contact me so we could talk. Anyone else going thru this? [SEP] best_answer: I can relate to your situation. I too had a relationship to where we were so "in love" in the first part of our 8 month relationship. It usually is happy during the first couple of months because of the excitement and the part of getting to know each other. Then for some it continues over because of good communication/trust and relating to each other. For some it ends up the opposite way. Insecurities play a major role in this. That's the reason for the fights. Ask yourself are you fighting over things that are small that somehow leads to big fights? Or does the fight continue like a broken record. There are issues revolving around the person that brings them up. Also ask yourself this. Do you miss his old self or do you miss the fights? If he doesn't make an attempt to return any of your calls, give him some time to heal or maybe it's time to move on. The problem could be him not being mature enough to handle a break up. I hope this help. Take care of yourself. you'll eventually meet someone who can be both your friend and your boyfriend.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Should I say it is okay for my ex-husband to move to Ireland? [SEP] question_content: This is sort of a an interesting situation. My ex-husband and his new wife are thinking about moving to Ireland and they want to know if I will let the kids visit them out there. I am a little concerned about them not letting the kids return, but the kids are 12 and 9 so I think it would be okay. My biggest concern is child support and health insurance. I had child support issues in the past.  He spent a couple of nights in jail and has has been better since, but in Ireland it will be harder to regulate and make him pay if he doesn't want to.  Also, Ireland apparently has public health care so he would have to get individual coverage for the kids (since I don't have group) which is not as good of coverage and there is also the issue of me having a harder time enforcing the divorce decree with him out of the country. What would you do? Does anybody know anything about Ireland as it pertaints to this situation? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure I would be willing to risk losing my children in the event that he decided to keep them.  And Ireland is way too far away for me to send my kids.  \n\nMaybe you should tell your ex that it's in the kids best interest for him to remain close for the next 9 years.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Hi, I am getting married very soon and I would like know what present to get my husband to be.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Honestly, he is already leaving the wedding with the best present he could ever ask for, you!  At least that is how I feel about my upcoming wedding (5 days from today :D:D:D ).  As far as gifts, get him something that will show him just exactly how you feel about him.  Although guys do nto often show it, we like the little romantic gestures every once in a while too.  For me though, all my fiance has to give me is those two words at the alter and I am happy.  After all, the gift I am gettign that way will last for a lifetime, anything els that you give will be temporary.  I would suggest though, if you are going to give him a gift, make it kind of a combination of things.\n\n1) Write him a little not telling him that you love him and teasing him for the night after the wedding (you knwo what I mean)\n\n2) give him a serious gift, maybe a nice watch or something like that that you know he will appreciate.  Just pick something you know that hw is into, or maybe something he can use for the wedding.\n\n3) give him a not so serious gift like something in there with a note telling him to look forward to you modeling it for him, or (even funnier) put a bag in there with nothing in it and a note on the outside saying that you are going to model in what is in that bag, he will get the idea.\n\nTo me, things like that that will both show how much you love him, care for him, and respect him along with things taht show how much you really do look forward to being with him for the rest of your life will be a wonderful gift to give on your wedding day.  Just be a little creative.  The joke things will lighten the mood and maybe ward off some of the pre-wedding jitters and the serious stuff will show him how you feel about him.  Hope this helps.

question_title: do u believe that there are spirits out there.? [SEP] question_content: hi there i just wanted to ask how many of u believe that there are really spirits out there who can help us when we need it. for example my grandmother i firmly believe that when i need help in my life and dont know where else to turn all i have to do is start talking to her as if she were here, and then all of a sudden she appears before me in spirit form and we talk and then within a week all my issues i was having stopped or got better. does anyone agree this kind of thing can happen or do u think i am looney...? [SEP] best_answer: You are not looney.  I believe in them as well.  I recently lost a good friend to cancer and I know she is with me.  I had been begging her to let me know that she was ok and that she loved me, and she came to me.  There is a book - The Idiots Guide to Communicating with the Spirits - the title is goofy, but one of the authors is a well known Artist Medium - her name is Rita Berkowitz.  It teaches you about how to get in touch with your "life guides", meditate, etc.  You should look into it.	Family & Relationships

question_title: How do you deal with parents who do not like you husband? [SEP] question_content: How do you deal with parents who do not like you husband?\nMy husband and I want to reconcile, but my family can't get over what he has done to me. He is changing and now he wants to start over. I want to start fresh, too. \n\nYou can't answer your own question. [SEP] best_answer: If you both want to reconcile then do it - it doesn't matter if anyone approves.  What matters here is you, your husband, and your marriage.  Your family will learn in time to forgive him.  You need to also tell them that you have forgiven him and you expect them to forgive also AND treat him with respect.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: Apart from confessing my attraction for and want to be with you for everyone to see on Yahoo Answers? Probably it was this-when i was 3 i was sitting up on my Dads's chest and he was really tired. He kept drifting off to sleep but i wanted to play, so i had a biscuit in my hand. So, to wake him up and get his attention i said "Daddy, eat this" and with that plunged the half eaten jegged edge of the bisbuit DEEP into his eye, half blinding him. He did recover but i think the point is-i got his attention.\nWhose attention you after-an alien's, a leprechaun's. MMm?	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: depends on the situation. do the two of them have children together? if so then yes, but only if the call concerns the children. if they do not have children they don't have a permanent link to each other so there is no reason for her to be calling your husband, he's moved on and so should she.

question_title: My husband prefers his exercise schedule over me.?

Like maybe a 'household business meeting' once a week, a 'social hour' a few times a few times a week, AND ... don't leave out scheduling romance.\n\nWhen married people expect communication, caring, and romance to "just happen" or "be spontaneous" ... that is a recipe for NO communication, caring, or romance. These things happen when you plan for them and make them happen. \n\nDoes a great dinner appear on the table spontaneously? Of course not, you have to plan the menu, plan the shopping. Just give him a day-planner or calendar and ask him to go over his schedule with you. Point out (nicely, without nagging) that he isn't scheduling any time for his marital responsibilities.

question_title: what is a crush for you? [SEP] question_content: Hi what is for you guys a crusch on someone? Is more then be attractive to someone? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, I feel that a crush is more than being attracted to someone.  One can be attracted to a lot of people, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have crushes on all of these people.\n\nA crush, in my opinion, is when your heart beats faster at the thought that you will be with that person shortly; it means you take twice as long to groom yourself when you know you will see him; it means you can't keep your eyes off of him; it means you wait and wait sometimes for hours for him to call, and when the phone finally rings, your heart stops beating for a couple of seconds; it means you get jealous just at the thought that he may find another girl attractive, etc. etc. etc.\n\nA crush is not true love.  Most people have many crushes on people in their lifetime.  However, true love usually only comes around once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nBest of luck to you!!!!!	Family & Relationships

question_title: Losing a close friend because I fell in love with her...? [SEP] question_content: Recently I made the mistake of falling in love with a close friend of mine that I had known for years and been attracted to all the while. However, it was only recently that she became available and I took my chance, went out on a limb and told her how I felt. She wasn't interested in that kind of relationship with me, even though she had been giving me mixed signals from the very start. I woefully agreed. We then grew even closer as friends and she began "hanging of my arm." A day wouldn't go by where I wouldn't see her or she wouldn't call me. I approached her saying that this is proof that it could work between us. She dissagreed, but still continued the behavior. For the next six months I, in a sense, became her "emotional boyfriend." I was still hopelessly in love with her until recently we got into an argument that was totally unrelated to all of this. Since then we've gone from seeing eachother every day to 3 months of total non-communication. What should I do, leave it be? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, leave it be.  She is obviously unstable and whatever the outcome, it won't be fair to you.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What do you think about dating out of your race? [SEP] question_content: This was the response to a question someone posted on yahoo answers:\n\n"...Black guys catch hell from black women around them and especially in their family. Black women hate seeing black guys dating white girls." \n\nMy question is:\n\nIs this statment (answer) true? \nWhat if an Afican American man dates other races like hispanics, Asians, Jews, or Indian. Is it the same or diffrent? \n\nI am just curious. Please give an extensive explination so that I may understand why people think this way. God bless you. [SEP] best_answer: Some black women have a hard time dealing with black men dating white women because they believe that there is a shortage of good black men and that the white women are stealing their men.  Being a white woman who has dated black men, I have experienced this.  But racism is certainly not limited to black women; I am Italian and my family is totally against interracial dating.  I believe that people should be free to date anyone they want; what matters is that they like each other and treat one another with respect.  Most people who oppose interracial dating do so because they fear that which they do not know.  The only way to improve the situation and stop the hatred is to just forge ahead and date whomever you want, no matter what people say.  Only love is real; the rest is superficial.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think you should analyze your opinion on what love is. Is it love, or are you trying to make yourself believe it's love.

question_title: How far would you go to get a guy? (Older women, please help!!)? [SEP] question_content: I like this guy, we've been friends for 3 months, but the only type of girl he goes for are the ones he can't get - i.e. engaged, married, or already has a boyfriend.  Man!!  And it doesn't even matter if they're pretty or not.  He just goes for them, whether they are skinny/fat/pretty/plain/tall/short, as long as they are "taken."  He thinks those kinds of girls are special, because why else would they already be with a bf/fiance/husband?  He doesn't even LOOK at me because I have nobody.  \n\nSo, here is my proposal:  I pretend to be engaged!  That'll get his attention, then maybe finally (finally!!!!) he'll see me as more than just a friend!  Is this a good plan?  Please, please help me... [SEP] best_answer: But...but...but...why would you want someone like that?  Once he's with you, he might still be attracted to those "taken women" still?!

question_title: Help!  I always pick up the wrong kind of man!  How do I attract the type that I want? [SEP] question_content: Seriously, the type of man that is attracted to me is not at all what I enjoy.  Whenever I meet a man, he is uber-clingy, and I can't stand that.  I always meet the kind of guy that wants to talk on the phone five times a day, and gets upset when I want to be with my friends or just be alone.  I am an independant person and I hate feeling like someone is all over me.  I like someone who wants to watch football on sundays, and I always attract the ones who have never watched a sporting event in their lives.  I like the normal, all-american type of man, but they are not attracted to me at all.  What can I do to get the kind of man that I want, because nothing is working for me? [SEP] best_answer: Do you dress well? Work in an office setting? You seem to be attracting the professional types. I'd say put on some blue jeans, t-shirt w/e and go out with a few friends and hit some blue collar type pubs with one or more tv's on a sports channel and see what happens. I've never had trouble attracting the all american type going to places like that.\n\nGood luck, take care .. Buh bye.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: I run a swingers resort, it's a very gentle place for upmarket people, doctors, lawyers, business people etc. I went to a site in Uk for swingers and when i tried to join they said that my email address was banned. No reasons, no trial, no way to ask them why. Can you be found guilty without trial here on the net? Mine is the cleanest and most gentle hedonistic resort inthe world. No explid photos, nothing to upset anyone but the meanest bigots. You could call my resort a meeting place for lovers and lovers of love, It really is a nice place, nothing hard about it, soft and gentle. I really cannot understand how the hell the most un-porn, anti-nasty place of its kind in the world could upset anybody, especially those sites like the one i tried to enter, sites that have nasty pictures and harp on and on about teen girls. We are nice i only look on swingers sites for soft swingers that may want to come here and i offer free holidays to the right people. Tony, depressed and resortcaroline [SEP] best_answer: Well have you done anything on the internet you arn't suppose to? Or are you a threat to their "club". Usually what happens is that if yo have done something on the internet you shouldn't have, your IP address can be stored and sent out to the web saying you did something bad. They also could find that your email address was invalid and does not alow for correction. But really this should be in the programmers section.\n\nAlso, try opening a new email account and go to a different computer and try there.	Family & Relationships

question_title: would you cheat on your husband and would you tell him? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Ok there are many people who are aghast at the idea of cheating let alone telling......\n\nI will share my personal experience and you (Asker) and the rest of the folks can then determine what you all think is right, best etc.. for your own lives.\n\nIn THEORY, we were supposed to take our marriage vows to mean that we stated before God (or however you believe) that you would Love, Honor etc.. NOT CHEAT!  AGREED, those were the vows I took.\n\nNext we have REALITY.. we have both partners working 40-70 hours a week, if you have children, that diminishes your alone time more than that and IF you had a 'perfect life' which hey, guess what - doesn't exist.. and HOW is it possible to meet each other's needs - physcially or emotionally in a RELATIVELY decent timely manner?  It isn't.. and most marriages would say 'it's really hard'.  That isn't an excuse - it's fact.  Look at our divorce rate/cheating rate!\n\nI had an open marriage, and the agreement was that I could see other people with some very basic ground rules.. that I respected throughout the marriage and we divorced and remain friends today.  Do I *AGREE* with what I did - and the 'righteousness' of it all?  No, I do not.  If presented with the same scenario again in my life, would I exercise that freedom, No, I would not... HOWEVER..to make this crystal clear - not ONCE did I LIE to my Ex-hubby about what I was doing or with whom.  It's not right in God's eyes in the 'marriage' contract, but at the end of the day, I felt I did that with the BEST dignity possible toward my mate.. if it had to be that way (and he was pushing me to do it), then the least I could do was be honest/honorable about it.\n\n50% of marriages have a cheating partner, and I think that in order for us all to recognize that, we have to get off our 'soap boxes' about the holier than thou attitudes because guaranteed, one of you is probably getting cheated on who answered this post.  It is a very REAL problem and almost as many women as men are out there cheating today!\n\nWhen the Asker asked - would you tell him?  I believe that if she wants that marriage to work....... YES she needs to tell him. HE IS OWED THAT HONESTY/RESPECT! They need to be honest with each other to have the opportunity to rebuild their marriage...and she cannot do that 'holding this in'.  Guilt eats at your very soul, and while yes it will hurt him and them, if they have any hope of fixing it, she needs to fess up.  If it's broken for good, she's probably prepared for that, as she knows that 'she screwed up' by doing what she did, and SHE ALONE has the guilt and forgiveness to ask for from both spouse and her God.  \n\nI do believe I did the best I could do at the time and I am not proud of myself in certain areas, and I did learn some valuable lessons.. that maybe weren't conventional lessons, but nonetheless hard lessons, that I hope to pass on to other people in situations before they 'go there' or to 'offer the I have been there' part and help them heal, versus passing the judgement.  People feel bad enough, they don't need the morality crap thrown at them.  That's my 2 copper, feel free to sling the immoral and hate mail my way.. /shrug..	Family & Relationships

It happens when you haven't worked out for a long time and your muscles are just trying to get use to it.

[SEP] best_answer: I've been there several times as I lived nearby for six years. You can rent kayaks, snorkel, and dive in several places along the keys. I went snorkeling off of Key Largo and there's plenty to see. If you are interested in seeing sharks I recommend getting a kayak and go to Cudjoe Key which is a few miles up from Key West. Expect to see black tip reef and nurse sharks, sting rays are plenty. If you snorkel, watch for jellies, they will leave you itching. \n\nI don't know of any camping on the keys but if you have the time I believe you can overnight at the Dry Tortugas which is off the coast of Key West therefore only accessible by plane or boat, this former military fort site has excellent snorkeling.  Best place to get a sunrise/sunset pic is there and another good sunset pic would be from Mallory Square in Key West. Be sure to catch the Sunset Celebration every night at Mallory Square, too! Sunrise pics are best from the east side of any island. There are plenty of web sites you can get info from. Don't forget sunscreen!!!	Sports

question_title: I think Lennox Lewis is greatest champ ever, whay do you yhink? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I agree with you completely. Lennox Lewis is the greatest champion and the greatest boxer in the history of this sport. First he had an excellent amateur career that he crowned with an Olympic gold medal in 1988, and as a professional he was in my opinion the greatest heavyweight champion ever to step foot in a boxing ring. He defeated every opponent he ever faced in his career (McCall and Rahman by a way of rematch) and he had all the attributes that a perfect heavyweight boxer is supposed to have - starting from basic height, weight and strenght advantage in almost every match to perfect technique, awesome knockout power and most importantly unprecedented boxing talent that he has been showing throughout his career.\nAli, Fraiser, Liston, Foreman, Holyfield, Tyson, Klitschko brothers and so on are all great heavyweight boxing champions but none of them is a match for Lennox in my opinion.

I'll search EBay for a simaler item and use that as a guide.  Ebay prices are typicaly lower than you may recieve in a local sale.  Good Luck!!	Sports

question_title: in softball what is the uniform for softball? [SEP] question_content: do you where pants and a shirt and a cap and the other stuff or is it shirt and shorts, i want to know the uniform for A.P.Gianninni Middle School in San Francisco, Oretega street [SEP] best_answer: A typical softball uniform consists of a short-sleeved or sleeveless jersey supplied by the organization, shorts or sliding pants, and stirrup or other high socks.  Anything goes, really; jerseys vary from cotton tees to polyester baseball-styled ones.  Pants can be full-length or cropped below the knee to show your socks.  Shorts come in a huge variety of fabrics, but polyester, mesh, or nylon are the most common.  In colder climates, long-sleeved shirts are often worn under jerseys.  Most teams wear visors as well.  In addition to the uniform, many girls wear sliding shorts to prevent abrasion to the hip and a slider to keep your legs from being cut.  Cleats are worn by most players.  If you want to learn more, you can try looking at products on www.softball.com- they have equipment and clothing.	Sports
question_title: Is highschool wrestling dangerous? [SEP] question_content: im in highschool, and i wanted to do wrestling. my parents refused cuz my older brother got a concussion and changed his eating habits. they also say all wrestlers are short cuz it's bad for your growth plates (picking up your opponent), and they are all fat/bulky. i disagree. [SEP] best_answer: My son wrestled in Junior high and High school 7 years. And yes you do get injured sometimes. And it does not matter if you follow the safety guidelines. Things happen he has had concussions, seperated ribs, broken fingers and more. Also depends on your coach. My sons coach was a jerk who only wanted trophys and nothing less. So my sons eating habits changed and so did his attitude. I was glad when he got out of school just because of the things that happened. If you want to wrestle look into it more do some research on your coaches and the school wrestling team. Personally I think it is a great sport if it is taught right. But be aware you can and will be injured wrestiling. Sit down and have a heart to heart with your parents but do what they say. You will look back as you get older and thank them. Besides maybe there is a local boys and girls club that you can wrestle at?? But this is my personal experience with wrestling. I can tell you a lot about junior high and high school wrestling. At least what happened with my son.	Sports

question_title: is tiki barber's early announcement for retirement the reason why the giants are struggling? [SEP] question_content: It has been noted that the Giants lack "leadership" how can you be a good leader when you say you are quitting on your team in the middle of the season? [SEP] best_answer: Injuries are the reason (though that's a cop out, the chargers D is worse off, and they're still winning).  You also have to put some of it on Eli, and some of it on bad play calling.  Eli has never been great, and lately he's been looking Leaf-esqe, and that has alot to do with it.  Also, sticking with the pass when it's obviously not working is killing them, they need to be treating Manning like a struggling young QB and have him hand the ball off to Barber and make short confidence passes, they're putting too much on his shoulders and he isn't good enough to win games for them.  Barber's retirement doesn't have anything to do with it.  When they suck next year, that's when you can blame it on Barber.	Sports

This is a definate question for your parents, because Yahoo Answers doesn't know your parents motives. So you should go ask them and try to see things their way, unless they are way wrong. You should have some good strong points to bring up with evidence backing it. Don't just scream and be hateful because that will get you no where.

[SEP] question_content: I am trying to figure out what size generator i need my camper is 50 amp with 2 air conditioners, mircowave,refrigator [SEP] best_answer: Most generators are rated in watts. If you have a 50 amp circuit, then 110 volts x 50 amps = 5500 watts. You do not want to run the generator past 80% of its duty cycle, so a 6000 watt gen should be the best.\nHope the formula helps\nYou can also figure out how many watts a microwave will need.

Bushido only covers middleweight and lightweight division. There are some outstanding fighters there like Dan Henderson, Murilo Bustamante, Paolo Filho, Takanori Gomi, Joachim Hansen, Tatsuya Kawajiri and so on, and they put on excellent fights but I just think that PRIDE's heavyweights and lightheavyweights are more fun to watch.\n\nP.

question_title: What do you think of Gerhard Berger's reputation as the paddock prankster throughout his career? [SEP] question_content: He always said about his friendship with Senna: "He taught me a lot about the sport. I taught him TO LAUGH."\nSome of his pranks were: throwing Ayrton's briefcase out of a hovering helicopter, claiming to have filled his room with snakes and frogs or changing his passport photo in order to resemble... other bits of the body; or ruining a computer by soaking it in water and so on. He was a funny presence in the paddock if you could avoid being on the receiving end of his jokes.\nThankfully, now I haven't heard about any new pranks since he has become the boss at Toro Rosso. But what do you think? [SEP] best_answer: As a prankster myself, I'm all for him.  He also gave me an insight into living life that I use just about every day.  A reporter asked him how he felt about Senna's death, and he said that it affected him (obviously) in a bad way and he started to think about racing in a different formula or other cars and then he says "And then I said no, either you do it or you don't do it".  Just so simple and wise I thought.  No dancing around.	Sports

question_title: Where is James Buster Douglas now? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "Recent Events and Current Status:\n\nOn August 8, 2006, Douglas pleaded not guilty to a charge of allowing his brother to use his identity to apply for a motorcycle license. Douglas was formally charged with a misdemeanor count of complicity in June as the result of William Douglas III's, his 36-year-old brother, attempt to use his name and identity to obtain the license for him. William Douglas III pleaded not guilty to a falsification charge on August 8, 2006. Each charge carries a maximum of six months in jail upon conviction.\n\nOhio Bureau of Motor Vehicles investigators said on June 8 that Buster Douglas waited in a car outside a BMV office in Columbus while his brother got a license for him. A clerk challenged William Douglas' identity, BMV spokesman Fred Stratmann said after the charges were filed.[1]\n\nAccording to public court filings, Douglas currently resides on the far east side of Columbus.\n\n\n[edit] Trivia\nMade his feature film acting debut in the Artie Knapp science fiction comedy film Pluto's Plight. \nDouglas was the star of the video game "James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing" for the Sega Master System and Sega Genesis. This game is considered as a response to Nintendo's Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, especially since Tyson lost to Douglas, which Sega took advantage in order to promote their early Genesis does what Nintendon't advertisements. The game turned out to be a huge disappoinment while its competition remains a classic to this day. \nA week and a half after defeating Mike Tyson, Douglas replaced him as special guest referee for the Hulk Hogan vs. Randy Savage match at WWF's The Main Event III. After the conclusion of the match, Douglas knocked Savage to the canvas with two punches. After the match, the media had a field day ridiculing Douglas' involvement with the WWF, raising the question of why it took the heavyweight champion of boxing two punches to knock out a wrestler. \nDouglas is one of the few non-students to be honored by The Ohio State University with the opportunity to dot the "i" during the performance of Script Ohio.

Basically "the basics". [SEP] best_answer: i looked a little for ya, it is a confusing and vast subject, but This link may help with the ammunition;\n\nhttp://members.aol.com/vaquero760/ammo/amain.htm\n\nas for the guns them selves, as basic as it gets,\n\nshotguns = bird or deer hunting as well as "skeet/sport" shooting. There are 3 different types, "side by side" (2 barrels next to each other) "over-under" (2 barrels 1 on top of the other) and a "single barrel", this can be in "pump" (like in movies they manually pull the fore-grip back to re-load) or semi-auto (as a bullet is fired the gun re-loads itself. There are many "gauges" today typically they are 12ga. 16ga. & 20ga. (gauge is just a different term for the size of the bullet) They fire slugs (solid bullet) or "shot" (this is where it gets it's name, think of it as a bunch of BBs they come in different size as well)\n\nrifles= target, hunting, most any game other than birds. basically the bigger the caliber (or bullet size) the bigger the target i.e. deer vs brown bear.\n\nhandguns = personal defense, hunting, target. Basics, 2 types "revolver" (re-loads as you pull the trigger) this is your "cowboy" type gun, typically 6 bullets & \n"semi-auto" (re-loads it's self after each bullet) these are the firearms most police dept carry, and are used in most movies, they offer larger capacity, some up to 15 bullets typically these are easier to shoot for "first time shooters" calibers range just as rifles, different size for different job\n\nHope I didn't overwhelm you.

In my opinion to be ranked high u should have at least beaten a good team. Air Force? Navy? Army? Michigan State? North Carolina? Out of those 5 teams only 1 team (navy) had a winning record. But when it came time to play to play the good teams, the choked and were blown out.\nThey have the big time players but once again they just couldn't always play to their potential. Brady Quinn did good this year and single-handedly carried Notre Dame in the USC game. Darius Walker was a good running back but he never really came through in the clutch situations, such as fumbling ast the 7 yard line in the USC game.\nI personally think that for once just because they met qualifications to be in the BCS doesnt mean the should be there. many other teams should be there but wont get to because Notre Dame is the media's golden team and they willl get in.

[SEP] question_content: What Contribution did the Navajo Code Talkers give to the WW2 [SEP] best_answer: The Japanese were expert code breakers.  The Navajo or "Dine" language is unlike any other language on the planet.  it's characteristics are unique and not based on other languages, and not spoken commonly outside of the Navajo community.  Because of this, the Japanese were unable to "break the code" of the Navajo language.  The Navajo, because of this were able to speak freely to one another over the radio, without fear of having their conversations translated.  Nonetheless, the Navajo had to learn specific "code words", as there were no such words for "tank" or "airplane" in the language.  Because of this in part, America was able to win WWII.

question_title: What do you do about the teacher's at a school who don't do their jobs? [SEP] question_content: I recently checked my daughter's homework, and found out something really astonishing! She had left her questions for the book they were reading at school, but remembered the first and last question, so she answered those. The other 3 she wrote in " don't have the questions, so I will tomorrow" The teacher marked it all as "right"and gave her full marks for it. I couldn't believe it!!! And we wonder why our children are passing grades, but still can't add, write, or read. What can be done about this? We also recently found out the class average is only 38%, for the whole class!!! Either the teacher is a really crappy teacher, or every kid in the class is stupid!!! And i don't think that the kids are stupid!!! Your opinion and suggestions would be apprieciated. [SEP] best_answer: Please do talk to the teacher first, so you will have gone through steps.  Principals may ignore you if you haven't at least spoken with the teacher.  Please be as diplomatic as possible so you don't get labeled as a problem parent and then ignored.  Then, very soon, take your concern to the principal.  He/she will probably want a meeting with you and the teacher.  Come with documentation, but be sure to continue to be diplomatic.  Make appointments to observe your daughter (not the teacher) in class.  Be sure to keep every piece of paper you have that might show incompetance.  For all you know, the principal and school board are already working on getting rid of her.  It takes about three years to get rid of a poor teacher if people are trying.  Unfortunately, good teachers can also be hounded out of jobs by incompetant administrators, so do make sure that this wasn't a fluke, or a case where she was overwhelmed with grading and just took it as a completion grade (not checked for accuracy).  If you are in an elementary school, you can lobby to have your child transfered to another class, but you will never be able to do that again, and will be labeled as a problem parent.  If you are in a middle or high school, make friends with the counselor so that your child is not placed in that teacher's class again.\nThe class average of 38%--do you know what this means?  38% passed a national standardized test?  38% of them have a C average or better in class?  The class has a 38% on all their work?  \nGood luck	Education & Reference

You know of course this means that the y value is irrelevent and the equation you get is x=2.  for anycombination of x and y values you put together they will come up on this line since x will always be two, and y can be any number you want.

question_title: Why must kids learn spanish in school? [SEP] question_content: I don't think it's important to learn any language unless you want to learn one.  It ticks me off that the schools push learning spanish!!!  I don't care if my son gets bad grades in this class because it isn't important. [SEP] best_answer: I feel that anytime a class like that is offered you should allow your child to take it.  Any additonal free classes like that will only help in the long run.  For example; college admission; better jobs.  My daughter was introduced to several languages in our school system when she was smaller.  She is now finishing her 4th year and will receive an Advanced Diploma when she graduates from High School in 2007.(and will have 5 years of Spanish)  Most colleges look for a secondary language or require it for admission.  But clearly if your child truly does not like the class I agree that something else should be offered to those students.  (Choir, Art, Self Defense)  Maybe you could approach your local school board with these questions or start with the teachers/principals.  I really wished that I had parental and educational guidance when I was her age, to send me or even encourage me to try something new.  I would be making more money with another language today, if I had taken spanish.  Good luck.	Education & Reference

question_title: what's best self-study course for AmericanEnglish for both life&prepare to get TOEFL ibt prepration course? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I find the Longman books good, but you have to buy a lot of them--a book and then an answer book and then the CDs and then this and that--I inderstand it's even worse for the IBT than it was for previous TOEFL types. But they're very thorough and cover "life" as well as the TOEFL.\n\nFor the TOEFL alone, I recommend the Princeton Review book. You could combine that with a more general ESL book--I recommend The Advanced Grammar Book (sorry, don't have the authors' names), but judging by the errors in your question, it may be above your level. (THE best course/"for both life" could be better expressed/you TAKE a test rather than "get" one) Of course, it's just one question and doesn't really tell me much about your English proficiency.

What marks do you need for a scholership? What types of jobs can you get with this degree? [SEP] best_answer: I'm a Civil Engineer and the answer to your question depends on the type of engineering that you want to pursue.  Most types will require math and possibly science courses.  You need to choose the type first (civil, mechanical, electrical, etc.) then within those types you also need to consider what you want to do - do you want to do design, research, construction, etc.  If you like office work and are good mathmatically you may want to look towards design whereas if you like being outside and seeing engineering in practice you may go down a different path.  Set you path to your abilities and your interests.  If you enjoy something you will do better at it and this is a lifetime choice so think wisely.	Education & Reference

Its mission is to promote economic integration. It was founded to achieve "collective self-sufficiency" for the member states by means of economic and monetary union creating a single large trading bloc. The very slow progress towards this aim meant that the treaty was revised in Cotonou on 24 July 1993 towards a looser collaboration. The ECOWAS Secretariat and the Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development are its two main institutions to implement policies. The ECOWAS Fund was transformed into the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development in 2001	Education & Reference

question_title: Why is green the color associated with envy/jealousy? [SEP] question_content: i need this for my homework [SEP] best_answer: Jealousy is often known as the green-eyed monster. The phase appears to have been coined by Skakespeare and used in the Merchant of Venice.\n\nPortia: ' How all the other passions fleet to air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair, And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love, Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy, In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess. I feel too much thy blessing: make it less, For fear I surfeit.'\n\nHe used the allusion again in Othello:\n\nIago: 'O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, ye \n\nGreen was traditionally a colour associated with sickness as many sick people have a greenish tinge. Shakespeare was arguing that people are sick with jealousy thus affecting their reason.	Education & Reference

question_title: Creaming of the Well, the person who drinks from the well first is guaranteed what?

I can see where the first water drawn from a well each day will probably be the best - the well is probably stirred up whenever water is taken out, then settles overnight.\n\nThe superstition is that the first unmarried lass who gets water from the well on Hogmanay (Scottish New Years) will be married within the year, and if she brings water to a guy, he will be her husband.\n\nForetelling who will a maid marry has to be one of the most common forms of superstition.

question_title: What did benjerman Franklin Invent? [SEP] question_content: Please leave links [SEP] best_answer: Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston on January 17, 1706. He was the tenth son of soap maker, Josiah Franklin. Benjamin's mother was Abiah Folger, the second wife of Josiah. In all, Josiah would father 17 children.\n\nJosiah intended for Benjamin to enter into the clergy. However, Josiah could only afford to send his son to school for one year and clergymen needed years of schooling. But, as young Benjamin loved to read he had him apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer. After helping James compose pamphlets and set type which was grueling work, 12-year-old Benjamin would sell their products in the streets.\n\nApprentice Printer\nWhen Benjamin was 15 his brother started The New England Courant the first "newspaper" in Boston. Though there were two papers in the city before James's Courant, they only reprinted news from abroad. James's paper carried articles, opinion pieces written by James's friends, advertisements, and news of ship schedules.\n\nBenjamin wanted to write for the paper too, but he knew that James would never let him. After all, Benjamin was just a lowly apprentice. So Ben began writing letters at night and signing them with the name of a fictional widow, Silence Dogood. Dogood was filled with advice and very critical of the world around her, particularly concerning the issue of how women were treated. Ben would sneak the letters under the print shop door at night so no one knew who was writing the pieces. They were a smash hit, and everyone wanted to know who was the real "Silence Dogood."\n\nAfter 16 letters, Ben confessed that he had been writing the letters all along. While James's friends thought Ben was quite precocious and funny, James scolded his brother and was very jealous of the attention paid to him.\n\nBefore long the Franklins found themselves at odds with Boston's powerful Puritan preachers, the Mathers. Smallpox was a deadly disease in those times, and the Mathers supported inoculation; the Franklins' believed inoculation only made people sicker. And while most Bostonians agreed with the Franklins, they did not like the way James made fun of the clergy, during the debate. Ultimately, James was thrown in jail for his views, and Benjamin was left to run the paper for several issues.\n\nUpon release from jail, James was not grateful to Ben for keeping the paper going. Instead he kept harassing his younger brother and administering beatings from time to time. Ben could not take it and decided to run away in 1723.\n\nEscape to Philadelphia\n\nRunning away was illegal. In early America, people all had to have a place in society and runaways did not fit in anywhere. Regardless Ben took a boat to New York where he hoped to find work as a printer. He didn't, and walked across New Jersey, finally arriving in Philadelphia via a boat ride. After debarking, he used the last of his money to buy some rolls. He was wet, disheveled, and messy when his future wife, Deborah Read, saw him on that day, October, 6, 1723. She thought him odd-looking, never dreaming that seven years later they would be married.\n\nFranklin found work as an apprentice printer. He did so well that the governor of Pennsylvania promised to set him up in business for himself if young Franklin would just go to London to buy fonts and printing equipment. Franklin did go to London, but the governor reneged on his promise and Benjamin was forced to spend several months in England doing print work.\n\nBenjamin had been living with the Read family before he left for London. Deborah Read, the very same girl who had seen young Benjamin arrive in Philadelphia, started talking marriage, with the young printer. But Ben did not think he was ready. While he was gone, she married another man.\n\nUpon returning to Philadelphia, Franklin tried his hand at helping to run a shop, but soon went back to being a printer's helper. Franklin was a better printer than the man he was working for, so 	Education & Reference
