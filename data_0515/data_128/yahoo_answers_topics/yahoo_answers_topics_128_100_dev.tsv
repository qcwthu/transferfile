question_title: How would approach graphing a linear constrint .x1>=.2(x1+x2)? [SEP] question_content: if the result had to be in the format suitable for solving by simultaneous equation? example ax1+bx2=c [SEP] best_answer: x1 >= .2(x1 + x2)\nx1 >= .2x1 + .2x2\nSubtract .2x1 from each side\n.8x1 >= .2x2\nDivide both sides by .2\n4x1 >= x2\nx2 <= 4x1\nNow, assuming x1 is on the horizontal axis (x) and x2 is the vertical axis (y), then\n1) Place a dot at (0,0).  This is the y-intercept.\n2) The slope is 4.  Starting at the point (0,0), move up 4 and to the right by 1.  Place a dot there.\n3) Connect the two points with a straight line.\n4) The graph will be shaded below the line.\nI found this by picking any point that is not on the line.\nFor instance, the point (1,0) is not on the line.\n(1,0) means x1 = 1 and x2 = 0\nx2 <= 4x1\n0 <= 4  Since this is true, you shade the side of the line where this point lies.

question_title: calculus optimaization question please help NOW!? [SEP] question_content: if 1200 cm^2 of material is available to make a box with a square base and an open top, find the largest possible volume of the box. \n\nThe correct answer is 4000cm^3. show all work thanks [SEP] best_answer: I'll leave you to do some of it.\n\nLet the length of the base be x cm, the height h cm.  \n\nThe total area of base and sides is\nx^2 + 4*h, and since we are told this is 1200 sq cm, we write\nx^2 + 4h = 1200, which allows us to express h in terms of x.  [You can do that.]\n\nNow volume\nV = (x^2)*h, and if you replace h by the expression you just found, you have V as a function of x only.  I expect you've already done the mechanics of differentiation and finding max val, so I'll leave you to finish it yourself or copy from others who will post the complete working here or you can email  h_chalker@yahoo.com.au	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the story behind the asteroid, Europa? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: 52 Europa, diameter 289 km, was discovered on February 4, 1858 by H. Goldschmidt. It is named after Europa, one of Zeus's conquests in Greek mythology.\n\nEuropa may be the seventh largest known asteroid (it cannot currently be ranked relative to 3 Juno) and is very dark in color. It belongs to the Hygiea asteroid family.\n\nIt should not be confused with Jupiter's moon Europa.\n\nNasa is preparing plans for a possible mission to Europa ( the MOON) that would put a lander on the surface. It has even been suggested that a mission could be devised that would drill through the ice layer and release a probe into the liquid underment. This is the "hydrobot" concept.\n\nWater or ice? Liquid or slushy or frozen solid? Ever since the Voyager spacecraft missions flew through the Jupiter system in 1979, planetary scientists have wondered about the layer of ice surrounding the second moon of Jupiter.\n\nEuropa's ice surface makes it one of the brightest, and smoothest, objects in our solar system.\n\nRecent Galileo spacecraft images have provided evidence that Europa had a liquid ocean underneath the frozen crust sometime in its history, but it is not clear if this ocean still exists. Of the various explanations proposed by scientists, most scenarios of Europa's evolution have the water layer freezing solid earlier in its history. The moon's surface is -260° F, which could freeze an ocean over several million years. But scientists think that the warming caused by a tidal tug of war with Jupiter and neighboring moons could be keeping large parts of the ocean liquid.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Why is "Pythagorean Theorem" a Theorem and not a law.  It always works 100 % of the time? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You are getting confused between the language in science and mathematics, I suspect. \n\nScience and mathematics are two different domains. They have their own terminology and cultures. Mathematicians want to call themselves scientists sometimes (although often not since that sounds too dirty and applied), but they are not. Scientists use mathematics, and sometimes the most theoretical scientists might even call themselves mathematicians, but they are not. Having worked in both mathematics and science, with plenty of each, I can definitely tell you that mathematicians are NOT scientists, and vice-versa. \n\nIn mathematics you can actually prove things. In science you cannot. You can have things that have a lot of evidence behind them in science, but no absolute proof like you can in mathematics. \n\nIn mathematics you have a set number of axioms that you agree on before hand (the rules of the game). In science you make assumptions sometimes, but it is often not as formal. \n\nIn science you have data from experiments. In mathematics you don't really have data, but you have calculations. \n\nIn science you have theories, and also in math you have theories, but they are not the same. Just like the meaning of theory in general use is not the same (much to the consternation and confusion of creationists, who just don't seem to get it, or at least want to get it). \n\nA mathematical theory like Group Theory will never be discarded because somehow someone has proved some new theorem and it is all obselete now. In science, the Theory of Gravity will eventually be replaced by something better that fits more of the data, although the previous theories might still be useful in some restricted domain.\n\nIn science you have models, which are somewhat like statistical models. Real mathematicians by and large will not touch a field as filthy as statistics. In science, statistics is just another tool.\n\nLaws are really something from science, not mathematics (although there is a cosine law in trigonometry; it probably should be called something else). And even the laws in science are not really set in stone like they are in mathematics. What science CALLS mathematical laws are really just models that sorta fit the data, kind of. More filthy statistics. However, I did find a few papers on the internet that did not call it the Pythagorean Theorem, but the Pythagorean Law. Hooke's laws, the Laws of Thermodynamics and the Law of Gravity are really not near as solid as the Pythagorean Law. Newton's Law of Gravity was replaced, and I am fairly sure that General Relativity will be replaced in turn, at least once more if not multiple times as more data accumulates. The meaning of the term "law" in common parlance is different yet again, just as it is in the case of theory. \n\nOne could continue with all manner of terms that sort of overlap between these fields, like lemma and corollary and hypothesis and conjecture and fact and error and converge and problem and experiment and prediction and data and so on. However, I think this serves to alert the careful reader to the fact that there are some linguistic and cultural minefields that have to be navigated with care.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: How a Na atom ans S atom became ions.? [SEP] question_content: the types and numbers of positive protons, electrons, and neutrons that effect the charge on the ion. [SEP] best_answer: The sodium atom has the atomic number of 11.  This means that it has 11 protons in the nucleus and 11 electrons in the space around it.\nThe most abundant isotope of sodium has an atomic weight of 23, this means that there are (23 - 11 = 12) 12 neutrons also in the nucleus.\nThe sodium atom has 11 protons, 12 neutrons and 11 electrons.\nThe sodium ion has a positive charge by loosing one of its electrons.  So the ion has 11 protons, 12 neutrons and 10 electrons.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes aurora borealis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The polar aurora is a glow observed in the night sky in the polar zone. It is also known as "northern lights" or "aurora borealis," Latin for "northern dawn" since (in Europe especially) it often appears as a reddish glow on the northern horizon, as if the sun were rising from an unusual direction. Aurora borealis most often occurs from September to October and March to April. Its southern counterpart "aurora australis," has identical properties, so scientists prefer "polar aurora" (or "aurora polaris").\n\nAurora is now known to be caused by electrons of typical energy of 1-15 keV, i.e. the energy obtained by the electrons passing through a voltage difference of 1000-15,000 volts. The light is produced when they collide with atoms of the upper atmosphere, typically at altitudes of 80-150 km. It tends to be dominated by emissions of atomic oxygen--the greenish line at 5577 A and (especially with electrons of lower energy and higher altitude) the dark-red line at 6300 A. Both these represent "forbidden" transitions of atomic oxygen from energy levels which (in absence of collisions) persist for a long time, accounting for the slow brightening and fading (0.5-1 sec) of auroral rays. Many other lines can also be observed, especially those of molecular nitrogen, and these vary much faster, revealing the true dynamic nature of the aurora.\n\nFrom Wikipedia.

question_title: Where do water tornados come from? [SEP] question_content: Over this last summer, I spent a lot of time on a nearby lake.  I heard of water tornadoes but wasn't sure of the risk of being attacked by one.  Where do they come from and what can I do to protect myself?  \nAlso, I have a science project coming up soon and since this is such a strong interest of mine, I would like to recreate one.  Any ideas on how to recreate a water tornado? [SEP] best_answer: Water Tornadoes as you call them are usually referred to a Water Spouts, they are born the same way as a regular tornado, the only thing that makes them water spouts is that they occur when a tornado is over a body of water.  Instead of picking up houses, dirt, and debris, they pick up the only thing around.... WATER!\n\nTo recreate one you would have to have a clear column of plexiglass tube about 12 inches in diam, some plywood, to build a base from,  and a VERY strong fan to create the updraft.  You need to space the bottom of the plexiglass up about 2 inches from a block of wood and place some "fins" in that space and angle them so they help to start the rotation of the air as it enters the column.  \n\nMount the fan on the top of the column so that it pulls the air trough the cylinder.  and place a plan of water in the middle of base.  if your creative you can cut a hole in the base so that the pan of water drops in.  This will take a lot of wind, so you might be better just using steam or smoke.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Are Evolutionits saying that the purpose of Evolution is to evolve to die? [SEP] question_content: Any Encouragement on the theory about Eternal Life? Is there any one who can make any sense out of it? [SEP] best_answer: No, they are not saying that.  All living organism including the ape and man die.  I think what they are saying is that the nearly perfect man came from the simpler imperfect protozoans and apes, and that the general direction is toward excellence and superiority.\n\nOn the othe hand, I don't believe we came from the apes. I believe otherwise.  We came from perfection to our present near-ape nature.  I don't see man moving in the general direction of excellence.  Generally, I see the weakening human specie.  However, the direction toward perfection is always possible by virtue of the Law of Polarity.  I just hope that there will be more of us who would rather "close their eyes and think" (Einstien) than "open their eyes and see" (Aristotle).	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Statistics? [SEP] question_content: There are 11 patients with tumors. They are normally distributed with a mean of 1.8cm and a standard deviation of .5.

[SEP] best_answer: If the data are normally distributed, all the measures of position can be found without using any given quartiles. To obtain 20th percentile, just use the table of areas under normal curve. find the z-score whose area to the left is 0.20 (20th percentile) and 0.7 (7th decile).\nNote: Different books might use different approach in using the table of areas under normal curve.\n\nz (for 0.2) = -0.84\nz (for 0.7) = 0.525\n\nCalculating the value of the data itself using\nx = x(bar) + sz\n\nx (for 0.2) = 1.8 + (-0.84)(0.5) = 1.38\nx (for 0.2) = 1.8 + (0.525)(0.5) = 2.0625\n\nTherefore the 20th percentile is 1.38cm and the 7th decile is 2.0625 cm.\nI'm expecting these answer because the 20th percentile must be lower than first quartile and the 7th decile must fall between the 2nd and 3rd quartle.\nInform me if I'm not correct.\nTY	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Why does burr happen when cutting and treating metal & how can I avoid it to happen? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Burrs form when a cutting tool leaves a ductile workpiece.  A cutting tool is not perfectly sharp so it ends up plowing some material over the edge as it leaves a surface.  If you want to avoid burrs, you will have to change something; either the design of the part, the material or the cutting process.\nAn example of a design change is to bevel the surface at a shallow angle or radius the edge where the cutter leaves the part.  A material change might be changing to a different alloy that is a bit more brittle and makes small chips.  For instance, pure aluminum produces horrible burrs, but more machinable alloys make nice parts.  You could harden the part prior to machining and cut it with carbide tools.  Perhaps a change in your feed or cutting speed will produce good results (that is probably the best place to start since it doesn't cost much to try).  Burrs are a big issue with many manufacturers.  There are processes for removing burrs if you cannot avoid them.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: -Oviparous\n-Ovoviviparous\n-Viviparous\n-Parthenogenic [SEP] best_answer: I saw that someone answered that tarantulas are omnivores (meaning that they eat both animal and plant matter).  This is incorrect.  Most tarantulas are insectivores (they eat insects).  Some are considered carniverous however because they are large enough and do attack small mamals and birds.  Tarantulas really couldn't be omnivores because of their mouth structure.  It would be implausible for them to eat plant matter.  They are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs.  They lay the eggs in a cacoon-like egg sack which the female will carry with her in most species.  The eggs usually hatch in 4-6 weeks, depending on the species.  Hope this answered your question.

question_title: about metal detectors? [SEP] question_content: how is the effect(result)for working with a metal detector in winter,when the ground is wet???\nwhat about summer???\nwhich one gives more better result???? [SEP] best_answer: Using a metal detector on saturated ground can yield different results. Wet ground allows for the magnetic field produced by the metal detector to penetrate deeper. This may allow you to find deeper items that wouldn't be able to be found if the condition of the ground was dry.\n\nMetallic items will corrode while in a wet environment. This may cause items to appear larger than they really are while detecting.  Silver may corrode a little, while gold will not corrode at all. Metals that will corrode the most are iron and steel. Corroded metals can cause for a large amount of false signals. Metal Detectors that feature Ground Effect Rejection can help eliminate these annoying false signals.\n\nWhile you may think metal detecting in wet conditions may be not worth the time, more treasures that are deeper in the Earth can possibly be found\n\nThe reverse can be said for dry ground (Summer).

This is because hydrogen is less dense than helium. \nUse Avogadro's hypothesis to explain why hydrogen is less dense than helium. \n\nHow does Avogadro's hypothesis explain why hydrogen is less dense than helium? [SEP] best_answer: Avogadro's hypothesis states that all gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure have an equal number of molecules. Thus a given volume of Hydrogen will have just as many molecules as the same volume of Helium. \n\nBut Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table with an atomic density of 0.08987 at 0 degrees C. Helium at the same temperature has an atomic density of 0.1785. \n\nSince all gases have an equal number of molecules in a given volume, the density of hydrogen will be lesser than Helium.\n\nPeace.

This type of system is similar to HPLC, but is lower pressure (100 bar) and instead of separation by Polarity, this particular column will separate by molecular mass; with the larger molecules having the shortest elution time, and the smaller molecules having the longer elution time.  This works best if used with a Refractive index detector.	Science & Mathematics

However, in extremely dense environments, hydrogen can be metallic. Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe. It is present in water, all organic compounds (rare exceptions exist, such as buckminsterfullerene) and in all living organisms. Hydrogen is able to react chemically with most other elements.\n\nDiscovery : H2 was first produced by Theophrastus Bombastus              von Hohenheim (1493–1541)—also known as                    Paracelsus—by mixing metals with acids.\n\n  In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize H2 as a discrete substance\n\n         Antoine Lavoisier gave the element its name\n\nMany other physical properties are there.

question_title: what happens to someone if anthrax gets to them? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Anthrax is rare in the civilized world. Unless you are a high-profile world leader or a farmer in India or Africa, I would not be worried about anthrax.\n\nAnthrax is caused by a bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. I stores itself as a tough spore and hides in dirt. These spores are so tough that only fire will destroy them. That's why if you have an anthrax outbreak in a cattle herd, the cattle carcasses have to be burned.\n\nIf you get anthrax spores on your skin, they can germinate and form an infectious wound. This is called cutaneous anthrax.\n\nIf you inhale the spores (they don't need to be weapons grade for this to happen), then the spores can germinate in your lungs. this is called inhalation anthrax. This is the deadlier form of anthrax.\n\nAnthrax is a very serious disease because it progresses rapidly (in a matter of days) and becomes so severe so quickly that it has a high case-fatality rate (up to 20%). Luckily, if caught quickly, anthrax can be treated with antibiotics. With treatment, deaths seldom occur.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does cold flow from the ice to your hand? [SEP] question_content: If you hold one end of a metal nail against a piece of ice, the end of your hands soon becomes cold. Expain [SEP] best_answer: There is actually no such thing as "cold". What we mean by cold is really the "absence of heat". The heat is what is flowing out of your hand and into the ice, causing the ice to melt. Cold does not flow because cold does not exist. \nWhen I was in college we decided that it would be fun to invent the "electric dark bulb". It would shine darkness out in all directions, leaving well lit shadows behind objects that got in the way of the dark rays. But try as we might, we could never get a bulb that would shine dark rays. Cold is like that. I wish Arnold Schwartzenegger had known this when he decided to attack Gotham City with his freeze ray. It was doomed from the start, whether Batman showed up or not.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is cause of gray hair? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: stress and old age. \n\nHair typically turns gray as a result of aging. Pigment in the hair shaft comes from special cells at the root (base) of the hair. These cells are genetically programmed to make a certain amount of pigment (melanin) at specific ages. At some point in the aging process, these cells make less and less pigment until the hair has very little pigment. White hair has no pigment, and gray hair has some but not as much as a red, black or brown hair.\n\nNot all hairs respond in the same way or at the same time. So the graying process usually is gradual. You can't prevent graying. Some people start graying in their 30s, and some not until their 60s. Genetics likely play a strong role in graying.\n\nPeople rarely go gray overnight. If they do, it's typically due to alopecia areata. This condition causes the thicker, darker hairs to stop growing before it affects the growth of gray hairs — giving the impression of graying overnight. Alopecia areata eventually causes roundish patches of hair loss or complete loss of hair on the head or body. Its cause isn't known.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: can any one explain the workings of a zener diode to me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: First of all my english is not very good so I will surly use some expressions that are different in english literature. Well a zener diode works in the so called reverse leakage. You could find a very good diagram which shows the exact characteristics of a zener diode at http://sound.westhost.com/appnotes/an008.htm (there is a good explanation of it`s working princips too). So as I sad the zener works in the reverse regime wich means that you have to polarize it inversly, which is OK you would do it with an ordinary diode if you don`t want it to conduct. But in this case you`ll polarize it inversly with a so big voltage that it will simply breakdown. If you have done this with an ordinary diode you could throw it out, but a zener is designed to work in this regime so it will work just fine. The point of doing all this, is that if you look carefully at the diagram you`ll see that if you polarize the zener inversly(how it should be), then increasing the voltage on the zener won`t effect the current(it will be nearly zero) right until it reaches the breakdown voltage. But at that point the current will "jump" and the dioide will start to conduct. So the summary is, that the zener will behave like a dielectric just until the inverese voltage reaches the breakdown value, but at that moment the zener will become a very good conductor. This makes the zener a very good tool for controlling voltage. Because it won`t condact nearly at all right until it`s voltage reaches the breakdown value, but at that moment it really quickly changes to a quite nice conductor. \n\n\nYou could say of corse that this could be done with an ordinary diode polarized directly. That`s true, but if you look at the characteristics of a normal diode closly, you will see that the treshold voltage of a normal diode is much smaller in absolute value than the breakdown value of a zener. So it means that a zener would "cut off" much more voltage than a normal dioide. Besides that the characteristic(diagram) of a zener in reverse regime is much closer to 90 degrees than a normal diodes in direct regime, what means that it`s "turn over" into conductor is much quicker.\n\nI don`t know if I was clear or not but I hope it will help you at least a little	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Pressure relief valves are valves designed to open at a certain pressure, usually to protect equipment from rupturing due to high pressure.\n\nMost industrial pressure relief valves are spring loaded devices that will pop open at the pre-set pressure, and then re-seat after the pressure has fallen low enough.\n\nIf you have a hot water tank in your home, it probably has a pressure relief valve, designed to blow off some water if the pressure gets high in the tank, to prevent the tank from exploding dangerously.

It has 3 components: meiosis - which is a small pupil; ptosis - which is drooping of the eyelid; and anhydrosis - which is the absence of sweating.\n\nIt can occur in benign, meaning non-life threatening issues such as cluster headaches where there is transient dysfunction of the parasympatheic nerves\n\nIt can occur in emergeny situations such as dissection of the carotid artery. The nerves travel along that artery and tearing of the artery affects those nerves.\n\nThe most common circumstance is in lung cancer. Many lung cancers start at the apex - the top of the lung - these same parasympathetic nerves travel out from the spinal cord onto the nerves just on top of the lungs leaving them vulnerable to compression by tumor.

[SEP] best_answer: Not sure what you mean: a transparent substance that, when cut/sliced/whatever, will display coloration?\n\nDue to a chemical reaction with the atmosphere? Try a gelatinous material with a fugitive acid and phenolphtalein. As the acid evaporates, the pH will rise beyond the equilibrium of phenolphtalein. (Or some other indicator changing from colorless to colored, closer to neutral.)\n\n\nSometimes coloration can result from surface structure rather than dyes: the brilliant blue butterfly wings of some South-American species result from nano-structures eliminating all non-blue light. Assuming that your substance  is connected by a liquid of similar refractory index, the surface effect will only occur once the surface is hurt and the liquid is allowed to dry away.

question_title: Do you believe in evolution or creationism? Why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I believe in creation, because I believe there is more scientific evidence to support it. The theory of evolution goes against all known science that we have accepted so far, such as the second law of thermodynamics. Try doing some open minded research on that one, it's pretty clear that evolution can't happen. Also, every evolutionist that I have ever talked to about evolution could not just sit down and discus their theory like true scientists. Instead, I have been called names such as "extremist" and "fundamentalist Christian" (I never meantioned religion or my beliefs, it was assumed), I have also been made fun of, and so on. But I have never been given the chance to really examen the theory. I really believe it's because there is not as much evidence as they say there is. I also believe there is a lot of evidence to support creation. I mean, come on, half of the evidence gathered for evolution could just as eaisly be interpreted to support creation, but that goes against mainstream science, so it is rejected. Trust me, I can't even begin to go into all the reasons I don't believe in evolution here, there are too many. But my suggestion to you is to do some research, and be open minded about it. If evolution has more evidence, go with it, and the same with creation. If God created the world, there will be evidence, we just need to find it. So do some research, there are a lot of good books and websites on the topic (watch out, there are a lot of really bad ones too that say nothing but lies on both sides). Two good ones are www.talkorigins.org (for evolution) and www.trueorigin.org (for creation, and some great responses to talkorigins.com). Good luck, and have fun:)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Has anyone had a doctor that removed a good appendix? [SEP] question_content: hay\nim doing an assigment about the appendix and was wondering if anyone has had an operation and the doctor has removed the appendix and than found out that it was a good one? what has happend to the doctor? if anyone has hurd or had SIMALAR experiances can you plaese reply\nthanks xoxo [SEP] best_answer: It is actually fairly common that doctors remove normal appendixes. I remember from med school that a good doctor removes diseased appendixes only around 84% of the time. A doctor who is correct with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis 100% of the time is bound to miss a few cases. And believe me, a ruptured appendix is a helluva prolem, causing peritonitis and eventual death. Not all patients with AP present with all classical findings. Thus, a surgeon has to weigh his impressions and it is generally to the patient's greatest benefit that his/her normal appendix be removed so that in the future, the diagnosis of AP can be easily ruled out.

question_title: Moon landing by USA in 1969 was real or fake.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely real! The couple of boobs who made accusations saying it was fake are complete idiots! Neither of the two who started this rumor had any technical background to support their claims! Find some old movie clips and see for yourself. The actions of the astronauts could not possibly be mimicked here on Earth! So now we have a paradox, in order to fake the moon landing you would have to go to the nearest object  to us in space which would be......you guessed it! The moon! Give Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin cudos for being the brave men they were and leave it rest! I remember watching it in awe live in my classroom at the ripe old age of 16! The onboard computers they used were no where near as powerful as your basic dell 300 dollar desktop.....they didnt have any more than 32 kilobits of ram and were totally programmed in binary. These men came dangerously close to not making it on their lunar landing.\nP.S. Nikis answer below explains why romania is still a third world, uneducated country.

Are all the professors and PhDs and Nobel prize winners who believe that evolution is a viable theory, at universities and research institutions, insane or dishonest or stupid or liars? Are they just evil and minions of the devil?\n\n2. If evolution was so fake and phoney, why would so many rational and reasonable and learned people subscribe to it? Did they all get fooled?\n\n3. Do you really believe that your religious leader(s) knows God's mind and how God might have chosen to produce life and the species we observe? \n\n4. If evolution is so worthless, how can it make so many useful predictions? Why do commercial interests insist on it being taught in schools and universities? \n\n5. Are the courts just evil by trying to block the obvious truth of creationism from the secular school science classrooms?\n\n6. Pope John Paul II saw no conflict between evolution and religion. Was the Pope evil? Deluded? Crazy?

question_title: why does a tyre appear to spin backwards at a certain speed? [SEP] question_content: or even in fans or helicopter blades if u observe them for a while [SEP] best_answer: Think of how animation works.  You see a picture, then a short time later, you see a slightly different one.  If the time between pictures is short enough, your brain interprets this as a moving picture.  (Why your brain does this has traditionally been attributed to the phenomenon of "persistence of vision", but it is likely much more complicated than that."  )  \n\nNow imagine a tire (sorry, I'm American, so I'll stick to our spelling) that has a white letter M (for Michelin) on it's sidewall.  The tire is spinning, so the letter M moves in a cirle, so that you see the white M at the top of the circle, then a short time later see it at the top of the circle, then a short time later at the top of the circle again, etc.  Because of the way the brain processes information, at a certain speed the brain will interpret this successive sightings of the M at the top of the circle as the M remaining stationary.  \n\nNow imagine the tire spinning a little slower, so that the M doesn't quite make it all the way around the circle before it is perceived again. The M started at the top of the circle, then the next time it was perceived it was located at say 11 o'clock, then the next time at  10 o'clock, etc.  Now, your brain will interpret the succesive pictures of the M as the M moving backwards.\n\nThis effect is even more pronounced in movies and TV, where the technology forces us to see motion split up into successive frames.  It is also the principle behind the timing light used to tune auto engines, for example.  A light that strobes on and off at a set frequency allows the mechanic to determine how fast the engine is turning by observing the motion, and adjusting the frequency so that the engine appears to be motionless.

question_title: Do anilmals in the wild get fat. In other words do some have an overeating problem? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If animals in the wild could get fat, they certainly would.  Very few wild animals are able to find enough food to get fat though.  Bears preparing for the winter pack on as much high fat food as they can, to put on their winter weight to survive the lean periods of the winter.\n\nWild animals that do gain access to excess food, such as squirrels in many park environments, or pigeons in many cities can certainly become 'overweight'.\n\nIt's a natural reaction of any animal to an excess of food.  In order to survive, you put away as much high quality food as you can because you can't be sure when or if you'll ever get any more.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: why is 4-methoxybenzoic acid less acidic than 4-fluorobenzoic acid? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Okay, first picture a benzene ring - six carbons, flat topology thanks to its aromaticity.  By definition, the benzene carbon with the carboxylic acid group attached is carbon #1.  So, you have two cases here, both with a ring substituent "para" (or directly opposite) the carboxylic acid.  Everybody on the same page?\n\nNow, acidity is defined, in simple terms, as the willingness of a molecule to give up a proton, aka an H+ ion.  The more easily it will part with that H+, the more acidic a compound is.  So, the question, really, is what makes a proton stay stuck to an acid?\n\nA carboxylic acid anion (COO-) has a large electron density delocalized between its two oxygen atoms.  A hydrogen ion will tend to stay stuck to this negatively charged group to balance out it's negative charge.  In layman's terms, a carboxylic acid is more comfortable with a positively charged bit hanging around to make all those nonbonding electrons on the oxygens less unwieldy.  \n\nWith your two compounds, the difference between them is the substituent in the 4 position.  Remember that an aromatic system like this has a flat electron cloud above and below the ring, and this electron cloud will interact directly with any ring substituents.  \n\nThe methoxy group is an electron donor.  It is not, overall, very electronegative, so it will tend to "push" its electron density into the benzene ring, and that will tend to prevent the  carboxylate group from sharing its negative charge density with the aromatic system.  With the negative charge localized to the carboxylate, it will be difficult for the hydrogen ion to dissociate, and 4-methoxybenzoic acid will be very weak.  \n\nFluorine, on the other hand, is an excellent  electron sink; it is one of the most electronegative substituents you can put on a benzene ring.  It will tend to draw electron density towards itself, allowing the carboxylate to push some of its negative charge into the aromatic ring.  The negative charge, then, will be more delocalized, making it easier for the acidic proton to dissociate from the carboxylate group.  4-fluorobenzoic acid will, therefore, be a stronger acid than 4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nDoes that make sense?  I hope this helps.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is the Importance of the order of Authors in scientific papers? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The order in scientific publications is indeed important.  The most important positions on a paper are first or last author.  Unless indicated differently, the first author is responsible for the study; she or he has done most of the work and written the paper.  The last author is usually the scientist who is the leader of the lab in which author number 1 works, or the one scientist who heads the collaboration of the different labs if more than one group is involved.  As such, the last author is not necessarily a bad position to be in.  The place people try to avoid is somewhere in the middle...    \n\nBut yooperpooper is right, in case of papers with more than two authors the first one is the one who is formally recognized most.

question_title: on what continent did dinosaurs first appear? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It is said that  when dinosaurs first appeared, the Earth was made up of one big continent. All the landmasses were joined together. This big continent is known as Pangaea.As time went by, Pangaea gradually broke apart into the landmasses we know today. First it separated into a northern and a southern continent. The southern continent, which included Australia, was known as Gondwana. During the Cretaceous Period, Gondwana gradually broke up into the present landmasses of Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia. Antarctica and Australia were the last continents to separate, starting about 100 million years ago. \n\nThe Antarctic was at the Earth's equator during the Cambrian period, roughly 500 million years ago. As the continents drifted atop the more liquid interior layers of the Earth, the Antarctic drifted south during the time of the dinosaurs (the Mesozoic Era) when it was attached to Australia. During that time, it had no glaciers, and housed many animals, including some dinosaurs. Over the millennia, Antarctica drifted farther south, separated completely from Australia, and is now located at the South Pole of the Earth. The fossils of first dinosaur were said to be found in Antartica.\n\nPaleontologists in Brazil reported of finding the oldest dinosaur so if that is the case, the first dinosaur could have first appeared in South America.\n\nBased on what has been described that the earth was just one continent, who will know which present continent it first appeared? It appeared and moved from here to there so fossils discovery in a certain place do not tell that such dinosaurs appeared in there as they were not confined in specific place.☺	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the difference between partly sunny and mostly cloudy? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The difference between a glass being half empty and half full.\n\nThe following terms are all which are necessary, none of which are confusing:\n\nSunny - no significant amount of cloudiness.\nMainly sunny - some clouds, but to a large extent sunny.\nMainly cloudy - some clearing, but to a large extent cloudy.\nCloudy - no significant amount of clearing.\nVariable cloudiness - some periods cloudy, some sunny, and a rather even mix of each (else it is mainly sunny or mainly cloudy).\nIncreasing or decreasing cloudiness for when there's a trend.\n\nIf there's a day for which you expect a cloudy or predoiminately cloudy morning then clearing and a sunny or predominately sunny afternoon, it is better to say something like "cloudy during morning, then midday clearing and a mainly sunny afternoon" rather than use the blanket term partly cloudy or partly sunny. Variable cloudiness wouldn't be right for that either, because there is a clear trend instead of variability. If the trend is not so abrupt, the term increasing or decreasing cloudiness can be used.\n\nOf course if you are Australian, you can just say "fine" :)	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: Key Facts About Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) and Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus\nE-mail this page\nPrinter-friendly version\nWhat You Should Know About Avian Flu\nKey Facts\nInfections in Humans\nQuestions & Answers\nCurrent Situation\nThis fact sheet provides general information about avian influenza (bird flu) and information about one type of bird flu, called avian influenza A (H5N1), that has caused infections in birds in Asia and Europe and in humans in Asia. Also see Questions and Answers on the CDC website and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the World Health Organization (WHO) website.\n\nAvian Influenza (Bird Flu)\nAvian influenza in birds\nAvian influenza is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them.\n\nInfected birds shed influenza virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with contaminated secretions or excretions or with surfaces that are contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza virus through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry, or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or feed) that have been contaminated with the virus.\n\nInfection with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry causes two main forms of disease that are distinguished by low and high extremes of virulence. The “low pathogenic” form may go undetected and usually causes only mild symptoms (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production). However, the highly pathogenic form spreads more rapidly through flocks of poultry. This form may cause disease that affects multiple internal organs and has a mortality rate that can reach 90-100% often within 48 hours.\n\nHuman infection with avian influenza viruses\nThere are many different subtypes of type A influenza viruses. These subtypes differ because of changes in certain proteins on the surface of the influenza A virus (hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA] proteins). There are 16 known HA subtypes and 9 known NA subtypes of influenza A viruses. Many different combinations of HA and NA proteins are possible. Each combination represents a different subtype. All known subtypes of influenza A viruses can be found in birds.\n\nUsually, “avian influenza virus” refers to influenza A viruses found chiefly in birds, but infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk from avian influenza is generally low to most people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza infection have been reported since 1997. Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (e.g., domesticated chicken, ducks, and turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion/excretions from infected birds. The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and transmission has not been observed to continue beyond one person.\n\n“Human influenza virus” usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans. It is likely that some genetic parts of current human influenza A viruses came from birds originally. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans.\n\nDuring an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have contact with infected birds or surfaces that 	Science & Mathematics

The two couples leave simultaneously and drive for 2.50 hrs. in the directions show (the gave me a pic- looks like a triangle). Car 1 has a speed of 90 km/h. If the cars drive simultaneously at the lake, what is the speed of car 2? \n\nhow would I find the speed of car 2 if car 1 is 90 km/h.... would I do Vy=gt... but it doesn't make sense...? [SEP] best_answer: Since car 1 drove for 2.5 hours at 90 km/h, car 1 went 225 km.  So it's clear that L is not on the line between A and B, and that the distance from A to L is 225 km.  The distance from A to B is 80 km.  There must be something in the picture that tells you one additional piece of information about the triangle ALB, that will allow you to calculate the distance from B to L.  That distance, divided by 2.5 hours, is the speed of car 2.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What does momentum mean? [SEP] question_content: Is it related to impetus? [SEP] best_answer: Imagine someone hit you with a ball. How much would it hurt? Depends doesn't it. If they threw a nerf ball at you really fast you would hardly feel it. If they threw a baseball at you at a much slower speed the impact would be much greater. The nerf ball has less mass than the baseball but was thrown at a greater velocity. Velocity is speed in a particular direction. How much you feel it in this case is due to the ball's momentum. Since momentum depends on both the mass and velocity of a moving object we express momentum in the following formula: Momentum equals mass times velocity or mom = m x v. Impetus is a less specific word. It is defined as the quality described by the mass of an object and its motion. Impetus is less specific (less to the point, vague) than momentum because it depends upon motion rather than velocity.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Is there any evidence that Dinosaurs may be still alive? [SEP] question_content: Is it possible that some prehistoric creatures survived? [SEP] best_answer: Birds are the direct descendents of dinosaurs.  Many scientists will say they *are* dinosaurs.  As such, they are alive, so dinosaurs are alive.\n\nWhile it remains possible that some dinosaurs proper have survived, it is extremely unlikely at this point.  There is no physical evidence for it.\n\nYour second question is difficult to answer.  Are there prehistoric creatures that have survived?  Sure!  Pretty much every species on earth today (even humans!) is older than history, that makes it prehistoric!  Defining prehistoric any other way would essentially make prehistoric mean "not surviving today", so the answer would be no.\n\nWhat you mean, of course, is creatures to have survived from truly ancient times, such as from the Mesozoic (age of dinosaurs) or older, but again, it's difficult to answer.  There probably aren't any actual species that old, but it's difficult to tell if something in the fossil record is actually the same species as something alive today.  Consider, lions and tigers look and act very different alive and are certainly two different species, but it is very difficult to tell their skeletons apart.\n\nA lot of so-called "living fossils" really aren't.  For instance, we have no fossils of the Coelacanth.  It's closest relatives in the fossil record are in another family (as different as cats and dogs).  Cockroaches are often said to have been unchanged for millions of years, but it's not the case as the fossil record records them evolving continuously.  The first fossil cockroaches had three pairs of wings!\n\nBut some things have survived nearly unchanged for millions of years.  Six-gill and Port Jackson sharks are very much like they were in the age of dinosaurs.  The Tuatara is surprisingly like it's Mesozoic relatives.\n\nBut the king of living fossils is the Lingula brachiopod.  It looks like a clam and lives by filter feeding, but don't let it's calm appearance fool you.  These little guys are survivors.  They've been living in Earth's oceans almost unchanged for 550 million years!  That's almost as long as we have animal fossils at all!  Dinosaurs are hardly teenagers by comparison!\n\nAddenda:  The Komodo Dragon is NOT believed to be a dinosaur, at least not by scientists.  It is just a large monitor lizard.  Dinosaurs are not lizards, being classed among the Archosaurs with the crocodiles, pterosaurs and birds.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: I found this amusing  Do people still have a sense of humor??  dry wit!? [SEP] question_content: Most people don't know, back in 1912, Hellmann's mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great shi p after its stop in New York.    \n\nThis would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.  \n\nThe people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day. \n\nThe National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo .

question_title: why female graduates are difficult to get the job compared than male graduate in Malaysia? [SEP] question_content: what make the female graduates are difficult to get the job compared than male graduate? [SEP] best_answer: I agree with the answer above, but specifucally in Malaysa it is more difficult because of the cultural influence.  A majority of Malaysia is Muslim and most women have several children and marry young.  Most women have to work a "second shift" after their daytime/full time job.  The "second shift" being working at home, cooking, cleaning, working with kids.  This all has to do with the difficulty of women graduates not getting selected over male graduates.

question_title: details about cnc turning machine? [SEP] question_content: why ballscrew is used today?\nwhat is lm guide?\nwhy cnc is used today? [SEP] best_answer: First Question:\n\nBallscrews offer better precision in CNC machines which makes production faster and less downtime.\n\nSecond Question:\n\nLM Guide such as ultra-high rigidity and load capacity, are suitable for installation in machine tools such as lathes, grinding machines and compact CNC machining centres, where space is often an issue. LM Guide’s compact dimensions allow for additional construction around the unit. This provides greater stiffness, improving rigidity of the machine, while ensuring the designated machine area remains the same.\n\nThird Question:\n\nThe first benefit offered by all forms of CNC machine tools is improved automation. The operator intervention related to producing workpieces can be reduced or eliminated. Many CNC machines can run unattended during their entire machining cycle, freeing the operator to do other tasks. This gives the CNC user several side benefits including reduced operator fatigue, fewer mistakes caused by human error, and consistent and predictable machining time for each workpiece. Since the machine will be running under program control, the skill level required of the CNC operator (related to basic machining practice) is also reduced as compared to a machinist producing workpieces with conventional machine tools.\n\nThe second major benefit of CNC technology is consistent and accurate workpieces. Today's CNC machines boast almost unbelievable accuracy and repeatability specifications. This means that once a program is verified, two, ten, or one thousand identical workpieces can be easily produced with precision and consistency.\n\nA third benefit offered by most forms of CNC machine tools is flexibility. Since these machines are run from programs, running a different workpiece is almost as easy as loading a different program. Once a program has been verified and executed for one production run, it can be easily recalled the next time the workpiece is to be run. This leads to yet another benefit, fast change-overs. Since these machines are very easy to setup and run, and since programs can be easily loaded, they allow very short setup time. This is imperative with today's Just-In-Time product requirements.

question_title: how do i write a personal statement for social work with no experience? [SEP] question_content: I am applying for social work this year and have just finished a degree in psychology but have absolutely no eperience.  I went straight from school into my degree and just finished it in may.it seems like u have no chance if you have no experience. [SEP] best_answer: I have a Master's of Social Work from a very good university.  What they are looking for is your personal experience with hardship -- either with yourself or others.  \n\nSocial Work is about helping other people.  It is a job that is difficult but can be very rewarding -- unfortunately, it is not high paid.  \n\nYour "personal" statement should be just that -- personal.  Draw from any adverse experiences you have had or known about.  Maybe you know someone who has a mental illness and you helped them, or just experienced the repercussions of their illness -- if you are a friend, for instance, to someone suffering from schizophrenia, and you have seen the dire effects first-hand.\n\nOr if you come from a broken home, or a good friend does -- what does that mean to you?  How would you work with people who need to have their lives put back together?  Surely you must know some people who have problems -- that is probably why you got into psychology in the first place.\n\nThe programs are generally not looking for people with social work experience, but rather with life experience -- in hardships -- either your own or someone you know.  How does that impact you, what have you learned from it, how could that help you to help others in the future?  That is what they are looking for -- a thoughtful essay about troubles you have seen and how you have the capacity for empathy and caring to help others.\n\nSocial work is really about helping broken lives.  You try to put the pieces of the puzzle back together.  Surely, you have had some instances in your life where you faced problems, and had to find a way to live through them.  They want to know how you handle problems, can you handle the stress of dealing with other people's problems, and can you be there and be supportive to those in need.\n\nYour personal statement should be that:  personal.  It is not about work-related topics, it is not about "experience," because experience comes in many forms -- not just a job or school.  You've probably heard the expression, "he learned through the school of hard knocks."  That sums it up.  They want to know what your personal experience with hardship has been -- and how did you help yourself or someone through that hardship?\n\nThink about it.  You may need to apply to several universities, because it is competitive, however, if you are determined, you can do it!\n\nGood luck!	Education & Reference

question_title: How do I color dry macaroni with food coloring? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It seems you would make a strong solution of water and food coloring. Dip the macaroni into it.  Let it set for a moment or two, take it out, and let the macaroni dry well.\n\nBut, I'm guessing.\n\n[Edit]  Okay, here's the scoop.  I just tried it.  I made a very strong solution of (red) food coloring and (cold) water.  I put a piece of pasta into it and it quickly started to change color.  However, to get it a deeper, reddish-pink, I left it in at least two minutes.  The pasta was still hard (not softened by the water) when I brought it out.  It's drying now - I expect it will do okay!\n\nAnother way to color pasta is to dilute acrylic paint in water and use it the same way you would food coloring.\n\n(Or) if you only have a little macaroni to dye, you can paint-brush the color on (acrylic paint or food coloring straighter-from-the-bottle for richer color.\n\nHave fun!

[SEP] question_content: What are the minimals skills that a 21st century student/ individual need to acquire to get started on the right path toward a career in today's technologically minded society?(at least 5 ) [SEP] best_answer: To wake up to the fact that we now live in the information age, where you can create 'information-products' that have value (MP3s, electronic books, documents, reports, password-protected web pages, newsletter, etc) and sell an unlimited number of copies of them. It costs some time and money to produce the product, but the cost of producing each extra copy is zero. This is different to a printing-press, where each copy has a cost.\n\nSome people sell downloadable products like eBooks from a website and accept payment by paypal or credit card. A simple one page, one product site can make money 24 hours a day if you advertise it hard enough via google adwords and things. You can create the product yourself or license it from another author/artist/musician/video-game writer/programmer.\n\nWe've gone beyond agriculture, industrial production and offline service industries. We are now in the information age. As well as information-products, there are information-services to sell, such as market-research reports.\n\nIts just completing the 2 x 2 = 4 permutations of online/offline and goods/services.\n\nSkills you need include, searching skills, such as the syntax of google advanced search and how to pick search terms that are likely to occur in the pages you're looking for but not appear in irrelevant junk.\n\nKnowledge of a handful of important information sources, such as wikipedia and the external links on its pages, where you can start your research on any topic.\n\nKnowledge of where to get help. In the days before the internet, you were limited to asking people you know and the university/school staff. Now you have thousands of people on here, who can answer your questions or steer you towards the info you need. It really speeds things up for someone to give you a quick overview of what you need to know. You get info in minutes that would have taken days from reading books.\n\nIt pays to read a basic book on how the economy and stockmarket works in a capitalist country. Its all about getting the maximum amount of profit each year from every dollar tied up in the business (the Return On Capital Employed - ROCE). If you only get 5%, you might as well put your money on deposit. If you can make 15%, then your money doubles every 5 years.\n\nRead up on how Warren Buffett, the world' second richest man (behind No. 1 Bill Gates) and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, does this. See the link to The Buffettology Workbook. He divides businesses into unprofitable 'commodity businesses' selling the same goods and services as everyone else with wafer-thin profits, and 'fortress businesses', such as coca-cola or gillette razor blades, which have a product that commands a high-price and profit due to a strong brand, worldwide advertising, customer loyalty. Other fortress businesses include those with products protected from competition by patents, copyright and trademarks, and with high barriers to entry (such as start-up costs), such as drug-companies, movie companies, mega-insurance companies, etc.\n\nIts far better to start one of these high-profit rapid-growth fortress businesses than a low-profit commodity business or to enjoy the better job security of working for one.\n\nHarley Davidson motorbikes is another fortress business. How many companies do you know with such a loyal customer base, where they have the company name tattoed on their arms. If you start a business, think how you can achieve that level of loyalty. You'de need some seriously cool product or service. Its also an example of the psychology of business; how people will spend far more money on things they love than everyday necessities. Think of the amount women spend on shoes and hand-bags.\n\nYou also need a basic grounding in how to run a business, maximise profits, do advertising online and offline, etc. A book on starting up and running an eBay-based business is a good start, as its not just theory, you might actual go ahead and 	Education & Reference

question_title: what was the significance of Constantine and the Edict of Milan to Christianity? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Gaius Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus[1] (February 27, 272–May 22, 337), commonly known as Constantine I, Constantine the Great, or (among Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic[2] Christians) Saint Constantine, was a Roman Emperor, proclaimed Augustus by his troops on July 25, 306 and who ruled an ever-growing portion of the Roman Empire until his death.\n\nConstantine is best remembered in modern times for the Edict of Milan in 313, which fully legalized Christianity in the Empire, for the first time, and the Council of Nicaea in 325; these actions are considered major factors in the spreading of the Christian religion. His reputation as the "first Christian Emperor" has been promulgated by historians from Lactantius and Eusebius of Caesarea to the present day; although there has been debate over the veracity of his faith because he was baptized only on his death bed.[3]\n\n\nHis victory in 312 over Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge resulted in his becoming Western Augustus, or ruler of the entire Western Roman Empire. He gradually consolidated his military superiority over his rivals in the crumbling Tetrarchy.\n\nIn the year 320, Licinius, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, reneged on the religious freedom promised by the Edict of Milan in 313 and began another persecution of the Christians. This was a puzzling inconsistency since Constantia, half-sister of Constantine and wife of Licinius, was an influential Christian. It became a challenge to Constantine in the west, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. The armies were so large another like these would not be seen again until at least the 14th century. Licinius, aided by Goth mercenaries, represented the past and the ancient faith of Paganism. Constantine and his Franks marched under the Christian standard of the labarum, and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Supposedly outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious. With the defeat and death of Licinius (Constantine was known for being ruthless with his political enemies: Constantine had publicly promised to spare his life, but a year later he accused him of plotting against him and had him executed by strangulation), Constantine then became the sole emperor of the entire Roman Empire.[4]	Education & Reference

question_title: Do online MBAs actually garner respect? [SEP] question_content: For instance, if I were to get an MBA from the University of Phoenix Online or an equivalent online unversity would it hold any clout at any business looking for an MBA grad or would it be a waste of my time to get this degree. I dont want to spend the money on something that just wouldnt be of any use to me. [SEP] best_answer: "It all depends" ... on what you want to do with it ...\n\nIf you are:\n1) Seeking personal enrichment after attaining a baseline education/experience level - go for an online program that has a variety of courses covering intersection of 'traditional domains'. These are usually from the more respected 'bricks and mortar' universities, but a few of the newer ones might make the cut too. Just make sure you do the research beforehand. Will give you an incremental edge. Mostly personal satisfaction. \n\n2) Seeking personal enrichment and don't have a strong baseline education/experience level - do not go for an online program. You will miss on the class interaction, interpersonal dynamics and worse, might be doing more harm to your career... Won't give you any significant edge. Mostly a deeper hole in the bank account...\n\n3) Seeking professional growth after attaining a baseline education/experience level - go for a respected University that has a pedigree of quality 'bricks and mortar' education. Try for a combination that includes onsite classes, personal interaction with peers is integral to professional growth.\n\n4) Seeking professional growth and don't have a strong baseline education/experience level - DO NOT go for any online program. You will miss on the class interaction, interpersonal dynamics and worse, might be doing more harm to your career... Won't give you any significant edge. Mostly a deeper hole in the bank account...\n\nHope this helps. Good news is, there are more options today than there were 2 or 3 years ago. \n\nAnother yardstick to keep in mind: Higher 'entry barriers' usually imply better quality.

I want to be able to do things with my friends, without them constantly checking up on me. [SEP] best_answer: I feel ya. While on one hand, that's a good thing, it is hard when you have overprotective parents. Try talking to them. Don't whine, complain, or beg; just ask them what they need from you so that they can feel you are safe and you can have a chance to exercise your ability to make good choices on your own. They might surprise you with their willingness to listen to a mature discussion, and that alone may impress them with your maturity. Offer to call from wherever you are, or to carry a cell phone, and remember to make those calls. Parents need contact like fish need water. :)  Other than that, just be sure to make mature choices in your daily activities, choices that show your trustworthiness and responsibility (do your work at home and at school, keep up your personal appearance, enthusiastically seek ways to improve your education and future). \n\nRegards,\n~Tia~	Family & Relationships

Use you head and find out this for yourself. \n\nPerhaps she really likes you and wants to be your friend, but probably she is lesbian, that's why i told you to ask her about what does she like to do, who does she go out to, or talk to her about boyfriends just to see her reaction.\n\nDont try to avoid having a friend, there are not a lot of good people out there.\n\ngood luck..

question_title: Would You Date A Man Who Can't Drive? (Women Only, Please)? [SEP] question_content: i cannot drive, i've never had a license and i am unable to drive. I'm 26 years old and when  i was 5  old i got meningitis and i have some problems with coordination because of that, which is why i am unable to drive and learning how is not an option for me. i also lost alot of hearing from it and i am completely deaf without my hearing aid, however i can hear fine as long as i have it in and since i didn't lose any hearing until i was 5 my speech is normal. but i'm afraid that the fact i'm unable to drive would put alot of women off and i'm always very nervous about telling this to someone i'm attracted to. so do you think most women would be bothered by this?  i know no decent woman would be, but there are alot of shallow women out there, just like there are alot of shallow men. so what do you think? serious answers only, please, i really need advice on how to deal with this. [SEP] best_answer: Honestly; given the circumstances I don't think you being unable to drive should be an issue for *most* women. Unfortunately you are correct; there are shallow women out there who see a man's ability to drive as a status symbol. You don't want to date any of these women anyway. \n\nFor any woman who truly cares about you for you, it won't be an issue. For any woman who is bothered by this, they aren't worth your time anyway.\n\nGood luck!	Family & Relationships

question_title: my husbands email account was up on the screen...? [SEP] question_content: and he went to the store. i don't trust him verry much, but we have our strong point and our weak points. it's starting to look like more weak than strong. i looked through his emails a little bit... and found some from a couple broads, 1 w/ pix. was it wrong of me to look, and do i address this at all? if so how? [SEP] best_answer: Tough one. He could be leaving it open testing your trust. He could want you to find those emails because he wants you to find them to get a divorce. He could just be an idiot. Or the emails don't mean a damn thing to him so he is not worried if you find them because he isn't doing anything wrong. Lots of possibilities. It's your computer too, he left his sign on, you stumbled upon it. However, since you are married and don't trust him, you may have a problem just because of that.	Family & Relationships

He will find someone to lose his virginity to. You have to decide if you're ok with your relationship changing.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Can a 60yr. old man ever become a faithful partner?

(1) a recent friend i met seems to think that monogamy is overrated and even quite possibly unnatural. he's pretty convinced that our natural way is to follow whatever sexual urges we have (sex is a gift, basically). (2) my own partner prefers to see people as falling into one of two categories. either they're cheaters or they're not, and cheaters cheat.\n\ntalk to him about your concerns, hon. and best of luck!

question_title: How do you stuff wedding invitations? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are usually 6 components to a wedding invitation:  the RSVP card, the RSVP envelope pre-printed with your address, a sheet of tissue paper, the invitation itself, an inside envelope and an outside envelope.  Put the RSVP card under the flap of the RSVP envelope.  Put that with the tissue paper inside of the invitation (if it opens).  If not, then layer the RSVP card tucked inside the RSVP envelope flap on top of the tissue paper on top of the invitation and place all face up into the inside envelope.  DO NOT SEAL.  On the face of the envelope, write the names of all of the people at that address who will be invited (i.e., Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sue & Mary; or John Smith & Guest).  Place this inside the outside envelope with the writing facing the opening and the top of the inside envelope the same as the outside envelope.  Address the outside envelope with formalities (i.e. Mr. John Smith; Mr. & Mrs. Smith and family).  Don't forget to put a stamp on the RSVP envelope.  Also - remember - it's etiquette to write out everything in full on the outside envelope (no abbreviations)\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!	Family & Relationships
question_title: What can I do now? [SEP] question_content: Me and my husband had a very bad relationship but I stuck w/ him hoping to workout the marriage since we had a little girl together.Tried therapy.It just got so bad.Then I moved out but moved back in after he begged me saying he will change.I found a good job and became self sufficient & workout & look really pretty.But the relationship just got worse.There are so many issues like trust,abuse and a lack of respect.So I decided to move out once and for all.Then I leaned that I may have a serious illness.The doctors are doing more tests.I don't have any family or close enough friends to help me.He is there for me at times but then he just gets so mad & fights w/me & takes off.He works for the movie biz & I think he's already looking for someone.My parents are coming next month and I have an apt. lined up for May7th.I just don't know what to do till then.I have to think about my child and not get any more ill.Please let me know how to be strong & pick up myself from the ground [SEP] best_answer: Girlfriend; you have only one thing to take into consideration, only one thing at a time and your kids should be at the top of your list.

We just started going out yesturday, but I want to know if it is worth my while, or if feeling rather odd when you hug someone for the first time is normal. I am feeling kind of bad, so please, tell me what YOU think. [SEP] best_answer: You are using some vauge terms here.  Do you mean weird like, "I wanted to make out with him never felt that way before maybe i should pray" or weird like "gross he just touched me, NEVER TOUCH ME AGAIN!!!" hese are two very different feelings that could be described as weird and both have somewhat obvious solutions.\nWeird feeling number 1: you like this guy, your hormones and chemistry are telling you that.  Be careful, don't let things get out of control.\nWeird feeling number 2: You don't like him, you don't want to be close to him, and you probably aren't going to start liking him more, so break up with him now.  You will both get over it.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I find myself being hit on by girls between the ages of 18 & 24...why? [SEP] question_content: I am a 35 year old man, married, and my job requires me to wear a uniform!!  I am in good shape and confident.  I have younger women hitting on me all the time.  It seems like the older I get the more frequently this happens.  They know I am married, but that doesn't seem to matter.  This question is for women between the ages of 18-24.  What would you want from a married man almost twice your age?  Is this a common fettish for younger women?  Could it just be the uniform? [SEP] best_answer: Hmmm. Take out the married part and I could see the attraction.  Older men are more mature, and a lot of younger woman find that attractive.  Especially if they're sick of dating immature people.  And it could be the uniform, especially if it is a type that puts you in a place of power (think cop, lol).  I don't really have respect for anyone who goes after a married man.\n\nBut who knows.  Maybe you're just cute and they like flirting?	Family & Relationships

question_title: What else can I do besides drink, smoke, and get laid? [SEP] question_content: Got your attention?  I have been in a live-in relationship for about 2 and half years.  Recently I moved out because the relations with her daughter was deteriorating.  I felt like her mom and her needed to work on their relationship, rather than her be jealous at the fact the her mother paid a lot of attention to me.  I knew that was wrong, so I left.  Now, I hate the dating scene, cant find a hobby, tired of skanky women, for the most part.  I cant get my mind off of her, but know that I dont need to return back to that relationship until her daughter and her are on better terms.  What in the hell can I do?  I have been out with my friends, been drunk, gotten laid, worked late, spent so much time with my own son he is sick of me...lol.  I am going nuts. [SEP] best_answer: WELL I THINK WHAT YOU DID FOR HER AND HER DAUGHTER WAS MORE THEN MANLY. MOST MEN WOULD SAY OH WELL AINT MY PROBLEM AND WOULD HAVE STAYED. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD STILL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT WOMAN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CARE FOR HER VERY MUCH. YOU DONT HAVE TO LIVE THERE AND SHE CAN STILL DEVOTE TIME TO HER CHILD. HAVE EITHER ONE OF YOU TRIED TO MAKE THE DAUGHTER APART OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP SO SHE WONT FEEL LEFT OUT. WE AS MOTHERS HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SHARE OUR LOVE AND ATTENTION. TALK TO HER AND YOU TALK TO THE DAUGHTER TRY TO BE A FAMILY NOT JUST MOM'S BOYFRIEND. IN THE MEAN TIME- TAKE KARATE, GO TO THE GYM, BECOME A BIG BROTHER,DO SOMETHING YOU WILL BE PROUD OF AND STOP MESSING WITH SKANKY WOMEN JUST IN CASE YOU AND MOM GET BACK TOGETHER	Family & Relationships
question_title: how do I get my fiance' back? [SEP] question_content: My fiance and I broke up three weeks ago. She left me because of the way I react when I was drinking.  I had told her numerous times that I would quit and I slowed down but never quit.  The result was that the problems I had never went away.  When she told me she was leaving, I set down my beer and I have not picked up one since.  I am going to AA and I am in counseling.  I don't know what else to do.  I miss her so much.  I know she still cares about me but everytime we have talked she says that "once I left I knew it was for good."  I am doing everything that I said I would do when we were together.  At one point she said she would go to counseling...but that was when we were together.  Now I am going and she won't go.  I am so confused.  What else can I do? [SEP] best_answer: Ouch. Kudos to you on doing what you said you would, but for her it might be too little, too late. She needs to know that you will do what you say even when she isnt threatening you. Is there anything else about you that you know bugs her? Make an effort to change that too. She feels like you dont care enough about her to change, but you are doing the best you can now.\nLevel with her, tell her that you didnt change before but that now that you know how life is without her that you want to be just the man she needs.	Family & Relationships
question_title: why are men so insecure? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think the women's liberation movement has been the real cause of this in men.  It used to be that men provided for their families and were the sole provider and the wife stayed home and took care of the kids.  But with so many women in the work-world today a man has had to take on a different role and may be threatened I believe in his role model or leadership position in the family as patriarch.  I personally would love to find someone to take care of me.  I just think naturally men love being the provider/hunter gatherer!  I am sick and tired of being in the work world to tell you the truth.  I think that is why so many women are looking more and more like men i.e., the business attire, dark pants, white shirts, wearing neckties to work, plus starving themselves to look more like a man with no womanly features, hair cut short, etc. etc.  I personally like looking like a woman and being feminine. And having the emotions of a woman.  God created men and women not just men in this world.  I think that is why so many men have become homosexuals because of this very issue.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I feel left out when I'm with my friends, what can I do? [SEP] question_content: I know this is a really open question but I'd like some help. I'm a quiet person and a bit shy. I don't talk very much. And when my friends are talking, lots of time they talk about stuff I don't know anything about (Like msn which I'm not allowed and Neighbours which I don't want to watch anyway).Sometimes I don't really feel like I'm wanted; I'm not popular, I'm not sporty, I'm not pretty and I don't have much to talk about. But I don't want to change who I am. Thanks for helping. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know how big this group of friends are, but I am sure you are a great friend. \n\nYou stand out from the crowd! Congradulations! Everyone is pretty in their own way and I am sure you there is something that your friends dont have! For example, the latest CD's (judging by your name), elegance, the best colour hair/eyes, great skin, intelligence, a boyfriend, the best book collection, poise, attitude...\n\nIs there maybe one friend who is simular in a way and also stands out from the crowd? Do these sound like any of your friends(maybe one in particular)?\n1. Who agnolowloges you a bit more? \n2. Does this person talk to about their own worries to you in private instead of the rest of the group? \n3. Is there one friend who sticks by you?\n4. One friend who asks how you are often? \n5. One person who would go anywhere with you? \n6. One person who phones you a lot?\n7. Have any of your friends ever told you how great a friend you are? \n8. If you were in an argument with another friend, did your closer friend stay with you, feel the same as you, comforted you, try to set peace?                                This is another sign of true friendship.If so then you are special. Try to stick to this friend a bit more and don't feel left out in a conversation. Instead of thinking "God this is annoying not knowing what the hell they are talking about" think "Is there anybody else in the group who doesn't know what the hell is going on." Try to relate these to one of your friends and stick by them! If you have been arguing with one of these friends a lot/recently or been to quite to even say you didn't like their actions then maybe this shouldn't be your closer friend. Just don't tell them. \n\nSTOP BEING BIASED! You seem to be think negative rather than positive about your self. Try and boost your confidence by\n1. Talk to yourself in the mirror every day about your life achievments.\n2. Writing down every good thing about your self. Look at these when you are sad.\n3.Write down every thing bad about your self. Try to improve on these or if you feel really upset then rip them up to feel in control. \nTell your self you arn't a mouse but you are a lion!\nSoon your confidence will rise and so will your popularity though popularity is a contest you just don't want to know!

question_title: What do I do when he is playing games? [SEP] question_content: This guy I have been seeing off and on for 3 years know has been trying to get back with me.Well I got back with him them some girl calls my phone telling me that is her man to leave him alone.And come to find out that we both recently had a birthday and he not only bought me a puppy but he bought her one as well ...he is playing games...or is he acting like a little kid...I meen come on he is 26 with 2 kids and im 18 with one...he does drugs and i dont...Am I wasteing my time? [SEP] best_answer: Do you really need anyone to answer this question? He's a douche bag and doesn't deserve either of you. Why would you want to be with someone who lies to you and is seeing someone else? I know it can be hard because at least your feelings are pure and honest but it will never work when this jerk only thinks of himself. He might be 26 and you might be considerably younger, but let's face it I have seen 10 year old boys act more mature then this moron. Your young and you have many years to find someone else, so don't waste your time on him because that great guy who will treat great and be the love of your life might pass you by. Think about your child too, would you want him to be a role model for them or to learn about relationships by seeing the abuse that he is putting you through? This man clearly does not know your worth and hopefully you do and will be smart enough to pursue a life without him. It might be hard to be on your own but its probably alot lonlier being with a scumbag like him. Take care and I wish you the best of luck with whatever decision that you make.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: we have a 3 yr old daughther that loves her father dearly but we have fights infront of her i cant live like this i have no one else to turn too. [SEP] best_answer: Try to stay with some close friend or relatives.  Even if you don't have anyone that lives around you - contact your family that lives out of state and tell them your situation and that you need to get out.  Most people are pretty understanding when it comes to physical abuse -especially of a family member.  Stay with a family member for a while until you can get on your feet.  \nIt will be hard for you to leave, but if he's abusing you - you need to get out.  You don't want your daughter growing up thinking that what he does is ok, and you certainly don't want him hitting her.  Get in touch with any family you can and get out of there asap.

question_title: what are three positive qualities that you find in a realtionship? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Respect, trust and honesty are the MAIN qualities, but intelligent, funny,handsome,wise,loving,caring, sharing, good listener etc. are ALL good qualities. Yet, every person is different; and some characteristics may stand out more than others in most people. Therefore, YOU have to know what U want in UR mate; as well as what turns u on and arouses u. What makes ur heart go pitter patter when u see ur guy, when u think of him, or what makes u go crazy just to hear his voice or his name. U have to know what u want in order to find it. Overall though, make SURE u have communication; in fact that's the #1 key to anything successful.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I am gay and fancy a guy who could be. How can i tell without freaking him out? [SEP] question_content: This guy has had girlfriends and says he likes girls but he is really over the top about it like he's trying to hide it (take into account the fact that his parents are very religious and would frown on him being gay or bi). How do i find out if he likes me?\n\nI don't want to come onto him without being pretty sure, incase he is actually straight. We live in the countryside and it's very conservative. Is he scared? Or worried about what could happen?\n\nI reckon he could fancy me because I have often caught him staring at me and recently he played his guitar to me. At a party last weekend he danced kinda close to me rubbing his hand all the way up and down my back all night? But does that mean anything?Plus, he acts awkwardly around me when me and him are alone together and often finds it hard to talk to me in that situation. Is that because he fancies me? Or knows im gay and doesn't like it? \n\nHelp me guys before I go crazy! [SEP] best_answer: It sounds like he's interested in you and probably having the same problem you are having, not sure and afraid.  I think you should just come out an ask him.  If that's not possible for you, well, you could run your hands on his body and see how he reacts.  You could talk about openly gay things and people and see if he is responsive....by the way if you are both dancing in the same place and he's running his hands up/down your back, that seems like he's not shy and that you should have no problem simply asking....

question_title: ok people this is serious i don't want any lame advice or anything. I feel like i totally messed up? [SEP] question_content: on friday, my friend celynne told me that she really doesn't like my other friend Lynette. I was ok with that cuz celynne can say watever but then she started telling me that she feels like Lynette is the one controlling the relationship between me and lynette.and she also feels like ly is treating me badly and is too clingy because she doesnt have any friends besides me. Celynne also told me that she called me a bitch behind my back which is not cool. I was always nice to her and hanged out with her.  so today we usually eat dinner together every nite. And I really didnt feel like talking to her. so I just didnt call her. So i just ate dinner with my other friend Jane because she was going through some problems. So then when we got back she came into our room. We had a weird moment...I just didnt want to talk to her so totally lied to her and Jane made it even worse. She left looking kinda angry. But I just really needed space. I dont no wat to do. wat can i tell her. [SEP] best_answer: There are two possibilities here and both involve controlling you:\n\n1) Celynne is jealous and trying to make you choose between her and Lynette.\n\n2) Celynne is correct and Lynette wants you all to herself, and in fact expects it.\n\nI've lived through both these things, sometimes more than once.  You can ignore it, you can try to get to the bottom of it, but more than likely somebody is going to have to leave the mix.\n\nAnd it may have to be you, because there is actually a third possibility where BOTH 'friends' are trying to control you.\n\nOnly you know what the history and attitudes with each of these friends is based upon.  Only you can evaluate it and make a decision regarding it.  Regardless, the gauntlet has been thrown down by Celynne and you can't ignore it no matter how much you may like to.\n\nSo take your time, and if one or the other or both try to force your hand - well, they've just made your job easier by showing their disregard for your own needs.

He was a very samrt man and also very wise. He gathered so many people that the Romans considered him a threat and cruxified him. I believe that he was married and that he had children. He wanted to get rid of the opression of religion actually. He encouraged people to stop sacrificing animals and to stop the many rituals they had at the time. He believed that a someone's realtionship with God should only be between God and that person He believed that there was no need for a big temple or a "middle man". [SEP] best_answer: Jesus was born of a virgin and was the only begotten Son of God. This sets him apart from every other of God's intelligent creation. We don't know exactly what the embryo inside Mary was physiologically or genetically composed of, but we do know she was conceived of the Holy Spirit, not a human sperm. We also know that Jesus Christ became flesh, and was the ONLY begotten Son of God. So, we know that he is very unique and like no other. In other words, he was not an average human being. \n\nWe are told in the prophecies of Isaiah that he had no descendents. (Isaiah 53:8) We also know that he came to seek and to save that which was lost. We know that he was anointed by God to be the Savior of the world. This was clearly his purpose. He was the spotless Lamb of God, destined to become so before the foundation of the world.\n\nHe is called a "brother" to all believers in Christ. He is the head of the whole church (body of believers). His bride will be the entire church.\n\nAttempts made to make him anything other than born of a virgin, the only begotten Son of God, and Savior of the world are for the sole purpose of making him seem carnal, average, and not particularly anymore special than anyone else. This is the whole point of the Da Vinci code...to tear down the now risen Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who is exalted above the angels and sits on the right hand of God and make him one of me or you.\n\nAverage Joe?...Absolutely NOT!\n\nOne day every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is indeed Lord, to the praise and glory of the Father	Society & Culture
question_title: Who has a problem with Christianity? [SEP] question_content: IM me, (honorablepassion) and I'll answer any and all \nI am expecting to be flooded.. so be very patient :)\nRomans 2:12-15;most Christians seem to overlook that those who do not know of Christ can be saved.\n12 All who sin outside the law will also perish without reference to it, and all who sin under the law will be judged in accordance with it.\n13 For it is not those who hear the law who are just in the sight of God; rather, those who observe the law will be justified.\n14 For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescriptions of the law, they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law.\n15 They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them\n\nthe whole of the law is 1) You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind' and 2) Love your neighbor as yourself [SEP] best_answer: Most Christians  'Most' have a problem with it. As they belive they should not follow old outdated rules, preferring to adapt old ones into those they eventually create for themselves.	Society & Culture
question_title: what's up with ebonics? why say something like "i don't know nothing"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Ebonics, also known as AAVE (African-American Vernacular English), is recognized by linguists to be a perfectly good dialect of English.\n\nThe example that you gave, for example, is an example of the classic "double negative" form, which many people think is a degraded version of Standard American English.  However, the double negative has actually existed in English for hundreds of years.  Chaucer used it in his writings, for example, and he's considered to be one of the most important writers in the English language.  In addition, many other languages use similar grammar in their standard forms.  For example, in Spanish, as mentioned, the equivalent sentence would be "No sé nada." which could be literally translated as "(I) don't know nothing."  Very educated speakers of Spanish wouldn't say it any other way.  You could see this form in Italian and Portuguese as well, and probably many others.\n\nIn fact, there is at least one grammar point where AAVE is recognized to be superior to Standard American English in preciseness.  This form is called the "habitual be".  For example, in AAVE, there is a difference in meaning in the following sentences:\nHe be happy.\nHe is happy.\n\nThe first sentence is talking about the person's general personality or character: he's a happy person all the time.\nThe second sentence is talking about the person's current condition: he's experiencing a happy state right now.\nStandard American English only has one way to say either of these things: "He is happy".  If I hear that sentence in SAE, I'm not sure whether the person is talking about the man's personality or current state.  Therefore, in this respect, AAVE is more precise than SAE.\n\nWhy is AAVE not accepted to be a legitimate dialect of English, then?  Unfortunately, it's because of prejudice.  People don't accept that dialect because it's associated with people they don't like (namely, blacks).  When we say we don't like a particular accent or dialect, it's a reflection of our feelings about the people who speak it, even if we don't realize that.  This is why one linguist has said that linguistic discrimination is the last acceptable form of discrimination.	Society & Culture
question_title: What is the origin of the term "rolling stone" as used in the sixties? Who first coined the phrase? [SEP] question_content: I know Muddy Waters wrote "rollin stone" and that was what the Rolling STones named themselves after, but what is the history of the term? Is it something that precedes the '60's and the counter culture? Maybe a Southern saying? [SEP] best_answer: "A rolling stone gathers no moss" is a saying that dates back to at least the 15th century. There are two common interpretations to the metaphor:\n-- A person who never settles down never makes any money\n-- A person who never settles down remains free of the encumbrances and restrictions of society\n\nThe attraction of the phrase in Blues and Rock circles is that both interpretations fit how the artists tend to see themselves, at least when they are starting out. Travelling from town to town, avoiding the "straight life" ("straight" in the sense of "law-abiding"), struggling to make just enough money to get by (or maybe not), these are all common themes in the lives of many Rock, Jazz, Blues, and Hip-Hop artists.\n\n"Rolling Stone" seems to capture that self-image in a very poetic way.\n\nASIDE TO JOHNG: Never heard the "never ages" interpretation, but I think you may be onto something there. There is a lot of that "Peter Pan" theme, especially in Rock.	Society & Culture
question_title: Is there a "class" problem in the world and if there is...does it affect your life...? [SEP] question_content: ...and how does it affect your life? [SEP] best_answer: Coming from a country that has, during its history, elevated the concept of a class system to staggeringly complex heights, yeah I can honestly say it's been a pain.\n\nAs a kid growing up in a painfully "woking class" town, I regularly got beaten up for having what my peers thought was an "upper class" accent. It wasn't; I was pretty poor as a kid, product of what was still fashionably known as "a broken home" and a bankrupt dad. But still, becasue of the way I spoke, the idea of class, and of being the wrong class, was imprinted on me early.\n\nToday as a white-collar worker, I probably look to all intents and purposes like a middle-class man, but the conditioning of youth means I can never be that - I've been conditioned to feel revulsion at some of the things that traditional "middle class" people are allowed to enjoy - skiing, golf, surburbia, pensions, anything that smacks of saving for a "rainy day".\n\nIn the wider world, there is a class problem, but it's operated in unspoken terms, and in some western cultures, it's predicated on money, rather than history, but anything that artificially excludes potentially talented people from following a career or calling can be described as class prejudice, and that has to be a problem in the world, holding back progress and dooming people to lives they needn't live.

question_title: Why is a man allowed to have more than one wife in Islam? i.e. why is? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Peace on you …. Thank you for asking about my religion.\n1. Definition of Polygamy\nPolygamy means a system of marriage whereby one person has more than one\nspouse. Polygamy can be of two types. One is polygyny where a man marries\nmore than one woman, and the other is polyandry, where a woman marries\nmore than one man. In Islam, limited polygyny is permitted; whereas polyandry\nis completely prohibited.\nNow coming to the original question, why is a man allowed to have more than\none wife?\n2. The Qur’an is the only religious scripture in the world that says,\n“marry only one”.\nThe Qur’an is the only religious book, on the face of this earth, that contains the\nphrase ‘marry only one’. There is no other religious book that instructs men to\nhave only one wife. In none of the other religious scriptures, whether it be the\nVedas, the Ramayan, the Mahabharat, the Geeta, the Talmud or the Bible does\none find a restriction on the number of wives. According to these scriptures one\ncan marry as many as one wishes. It was only later, that the Hindu priests and\nthe Christian Church restricted the number of wives to one.\nMany Hindu religious personalities, according to their scriptures, had multiple\nwives. King Dashrat, the father of Rama, had more than one wife. Krishna had\nseveral wives.\nIn earlier times, Christian men were permitted as many wives as they wished,\nsince the Bible puts no restriction on the number of wives. It was only a few\ncenturies ago that the Church restricted the number of wives to one.\nPolygyny is permitted in Judaism. According to Talmudic law, Abraham had\nthree wives, and Solomon had hundreds of wives. The practice of polygyny\ncontinued till Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (960 C.E to 1030 C.E) issued an\nedict against it. The Jewish Sephardic communities living in Muslim countries\ncontinued the practice till as late as 1950, until an Act of the Chief Rabbinate of\nIsrael extended the ban on marrying more than one wife.\n(*Interesting Note:- As per the 1975 census of India Hindus are more\npolygynous than Muslims. The report of the ‘Committee of The Status of\nWoman in Islam’, published in 1975 mentions on page numbers 66 and 67 that\nthe percentage of polygamous marriages between the years 1951 and 1961\nwas 5.06% among the Hindus and only 4.31% among the Muslims. According\nto Indian law only Muslim men are permitted to have more than one wife. It is\nillegal for any non-Muslim in India to have more than one wife. Despite it being\nillegal, Hindus have more multiple wives as compared to Muslims. Earlier, there\nwas no restriction even on Hindu men with respect to the number of wives\nallowed. It was only in 1954, when the Hindu Marriage Act was passed that it\nbecame illegal for a Hindu to have more than one wife. At present it is the Indian\nLaw that restricts a Hindu man from having more than one wife and not the\nHindu scriptures.)\nLet us now analyse why Islam allows a man to have more than one wife.\n3. Qur’an permits limited polygyny\nAs I mentioned earlier, Qur’an is the only religious book on the face of the earth\nthat says ‘marry only one’. The context of this phrase is the following verse from\nSurah Nisa of the Glorious Qur’an:\n“Marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that\nye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one.”\n[Al-Qur’an 4:3]\nBefore the Qur’an was revealed, there was no upper limit for polygyny and\nmany men had scores of wives, some even hundreds. Islam put an upper limit\nof four wives. Islam gives a man permission to marry two, three or four women,\nonly on the condition that he deals justly with them.\nIn the same chapter i.e. Surah Nisa verse 129 says:\n“Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women....”\n[Al-Qur’an 4:129]\nTherefore polygyny is not a rule but an exception. Many people are under the\nmisconception that it is compulsory for a Muslim man to have more than one 	Society & Culture
question_title: WHY are Jews discriminated against? [SEP] question_content: Does it simply lead to Abraham and being the 'chosen people?' Now, that excuse sounds far-fetched and it seems there's a different reason. [SEP] best_answer: Anti-Semitism has a long and sad history. There have been several forms of anti-Semitism. Religious anti-semitism is the oldest. In many parts of Europe and the Islamic world, Jews were the largest minority group. They were often the target of religious hatred often directed by rulers and leading to discrimination and occasional expulsion.\n\nRacial discrimination arose from the anthropological views of race from the enlightenment. Jews were considered to be a race and anti-Semitic views of race developed in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries. Nazi Anti-Semitism was based on this.\n\nMore recently, new Anti-Semitism has arisen based on anti-Zionism. This anti-semitism is opposed to Israel and claims to be sympathetic to the Palestinians.

People would rather pursue the destructive side of their own nature rather than being constructive.Have you ever noticed that bad news and gossip spreads much faster than good news? Your real friends will not either care or call you names so concentrate on them and forget the rest as I have known some exceptionally nice people who have had different physical handicaps.

question_title: What is sex? [SEP] question_content: People use the word sexy in the place of attractive which I difer in the sence. In Nepal, India and other south asian countries, the word sex means having sexual intercourse with opposite partner i.e., spouse, and in such case it is sacred and pure. But if yu abuse it having with many part time partners, it is a sin. Sex must be enjoyed but not be abused. Abuse means having sex with many persons and also unnaturally. It causes many harms to human life physically, mentally and also spiritually. Thus we have sex restraintly. But western malcivilisation is affecting our culture too. We believe westerns also shoul understand this fact and treat sex restraintly. Sex is a god gift but it should not be misused. Its misuse is causing several sex related and other lethal transferable diseases in human races and animal too. Diseases like HIV AIDS, gonoria, Hepatitis B etc. are spreding in vast way. So all should be aware of it whether they are eastern or western. I want publicly opinion on it. [SEP] best_answer: aha! the preacher's in town. sir, with due respect it is no one's prerogative to classify sin or non-sin like this. how about sex without consent with your 'legal' partner of the opposite sex (if you strictly follow the 'natural order')? is that all right to do so? and to mention the countries you are talking about, i think people there are as much randy as anywhere else in the world. maybe a little more repressed too. but all that is changing with the societies opening up to the idea of discussion on sex and sexual health of a society. the last thing we want is a pseudo pundit trying to make matters worse for those who feel there is no release.

[SEP] best_answer: It is just part of the job.  No matter how many lives you have a positive impact on, there will never be anybody standing around to pat you on the back when you've done a good job.  If you screw-up just once, you can be sure that there will be plenty of people there to try and take you down.  Part of that is because of the job we do.

It was set in the same relm as Zeus, Hera, and other fictional characters. There are no writings from ANYONE who supposedly followed "jesus".

I would have learned my lesson earlier instead of later. Even if I failed at the choices I made, it would have made all the difference to stand behind my decisions. \n\nI don't think I would look different.  \n\nI don't understand the last question. "only do it to one person"? You mean like avoid a person in my previous life? Well, I wouldn't do that.

I think homosexuality is a sin, but I am not God, it is not my place to judge, so I have gay friends, and support Gay marriage.\n\nIm familiar with your questions, and know what your going for here.

question_title: Muslim is prohibited from eating carnivorous animal, how about carnivorous fish such as Marlin, salmon, etc? [SEP] question_content: hark fin, cat fish. [SEP] best_answer: Islamic law prohibits a Muslim from eating the meat of any animal which itself eats meat, such as pork, monkey, dog or cat. These animals are haram (unlawful).For the meat of an animal to be halal (lawful) it must be one of the declared halal animals, it must be slaughtered by a Muslim, and the animal may not be killed by being boiled or electrocuted. Some Muslim clerics have ruled that the animal does not have to be killed by a Muslim, but may be slaughtered by a Jew or a Christian. Thus, some observant Muslims will accept kosher meat (meat prepared in accord with Jewish law) as halal.\n\nAs for fish, Muslims are told that all that comes from the sea (fish) are lawful and good to eat.

But instead of calling them on it........... why not just answer the question??  A lot of people due to circumstances did not have the oppertunity to futher their education.  Hell I make more money than most of you college grads anyway. [SEP] best_answer: If the person is not familiar with writing in English, then of course that person can be excused for making grammatical errors.\n\nBut normally, it is obvious based on the question that the person is American and lives at least a middle class lifestyle, yet makes little effort to compose a decent sentence.  Those persons should make the effort to show others how to write.  Are we not proud of our usage of language which is a reflection of our society?\n\nI commend persons like yourself who do not have a college education, but nevertheless write beautiful sentences.

Marriage is a ceremony that is done in the presence and blessed by God. So how can you do something like that if you dont' believe in the one who is bringing you both together?"\n\nFirst of all,  we don't believe in him, so isn't that an irrelevant thought? \n\nAlso, Dictionary.com's definition only includes ONE definition out of TEN that includes the words religious ceremony...and that was stated like this:\n1. the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc.  \n\nDo you consider "marriage" to be only a religious/Christian thing?  Does a civil ceremony "not count", even with a marriage license?\n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage [SEP] best_answer: Marriage is something that is present in all cultures, not just one. To pin one religious definition on marriage is to deny the others and make them invalid, which unfortunately a small group is trying to do. In the USA, marriage is a legal contract between two parties. It is set up for tax purposes and insurance and requires a court to break the contract. It can be more than that in many marriages, but in the end all marriages in the USA are a legal contract, even the ones performed in churches.	Society & Culture

The parents of the child, if they wanted the child would be sad, even if the baby was left in the dumpster by a young, confused, poor teenager who couldn't get an abortion or go to her parents. The teen most likely had friends or other who cared about him/her, and they will hate themselves for not helping out when they had the chance. The man who killed another in self difference will most likely be scarred since he was not a killer, but he became one.

question_title: Atheists-If you don't believe in God, why does it offend you when someone says you are going to hell? [SEP] question_content: Or tell you that you are a sinner? In your mind they're just dope heads any way right? Why does it offend you to the point that you would not want Christianity in your society? I know there are some butt heads out there preaching and throwing the Bible at people, but I've met ALOT of Christians that are actually good people who all they care about is helping people. Unfortunately, they all left the country to help clean up poverty in other areas of the world, leaving behind all the backwoods, extremist Bible thumpers behind to portray a terrible image for Christianity. I'm sorry about that.\n\nBut why do they offend you so much anyway if you don't believe in anything they talk about? No hell, no God, no sin--everything that makes you mad about them has to do with those three things, right? When they insult you, calling you wicked, saying you are going to hell, why does it really matter if there is no hell?\n\nPlease don't answer if you're going to crack jokes or if you're not an Atheist. [SEP] best_answer: I would never question the right of anyone to practice whatever religion they wanted (as long as they didn't interfere with someone else's ability to have the same freedom).\n\nAs a non-Christian (and by the way not all non-Christians are atheists, it doesn't break down that way) we understand that your 'hell' is the worst place imaginable.  The ultimate punishment for the worst crimes against humanity.  Am I right?\n\nWhy wouldn't we be offended if you hated us enough to tell us that we are going there?  How would you feel if I told you that you deserved the worst kind of punishment in my social club just because you don't belong?  Its not because we believe in hell, its because we believe that you believe in hell.  \n\nI'm pretty comfortable that I'm not going to hell anyway.  Just because I interpret the bible differently than you do doesn't make me evil.  There are people who read and learn from the Bible who don't call themselves Christians and I'm one of them.   I believe that God accepts all forms of love.  \n\nThere are some wonderful people who call themselves Christians but Christianity is neither the only kind of love nor is it exclusively a loving bunch of people.\n\nAfter all, isn't that the real message.  Love.  Peace.  Brotherhood.  Isn't that what Jesus' teachings are really all about?  I just can't get into the 'my-group-is-better-than-your-group' way of interpreting the great works of religion.  It only spreads hatred and Jihad and Hell, right here on Earth.	Society & Culture

question_title: what does the word sex really mean? [SEP] question_content: for the readers what does sex really mean for my oppinion it means getting closer to the the person ur with or love but another question wat does popping ur cherry wat is that can anyone tell me [SEP] best_answer: Sex:\n\n1) A categorization of human beings, animals, and even plants, which usually is separated by a binary deemed "male" and "female".  To categorize humans and most animals, we tend to look at chromosomes (DNA), hormones, and sex-linked physical traits (genitals, breasts, etc.).\n\n2) The act of copulation, usually between two living creatures (to be considered sex).  Definitions vary from the strict 'penis-in-vagina' definition (i.e. Bill Clinton never had sexual relations with that woman) to wider variances.\n\nSex does not equal gender (for example, you may identify as the gender 'male' or 'female' without having the 'male' or 'female' sex).\n\nAnd sex does not equal love, necessarily.  It can happen very coldly (popping your cherry, as you put it, for virgins), or lovingly, sweet, and nearly spiritual between two individuals.  That, in my mind, is sex plus love, however.  Sex remains a term that is by definition cold and medical, although the act itself may be infused with emotion.	Society & Culture

Her idea is --easy money--- but in my thinking it will be a lot of work.  Don't know...still thinking about it.  The problem is that if I worked with her and because she is family I would find it harder to tell her when I need a day off. [SEP] best_answer: It is usually a bad idea.

question_title: What is the true African-American traditional meaning of Jumping the Broom? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't know the meaning.  However, I know that the whole jumbing the broom thing started back in the days when slavery was legal and it was illegal for blacks to marry.  So African-American slave couples would jump over a broom to signify that they had just gotten married.  This way the slave owners had no idea that they were getting married, but the slaves had a significant event to celebrate the union.	Society & Culture
question_title: Revnants and liches, appear in RPG's and computer games,  other than related stories, do they appear anywhere? [SEP] question_content: Else, such as mythologies or legends or are they merely recent creations, also if you know of any books featuring them. [SEP] best_answer: here are wikipedia's information.\n\nwikipedia mentions only a revenant in historical information as a Medival Revenant and there are a few pieces of documentation about it.  Whatever the ideas of a "revenant" in today's language might be, in these examples a revenant was nothing more than a zombie.  Someone brought back to life to serve a purpose of some kind.  A good example of a revenant is the comic story adn movie based on "The Crow".  After his purpose was fulfilled he left.\n\na lich on the other hand goes back to old english folk lore if not further as the accepted definition of a lich in historical mythology is based on placing one's life essence in a jar of some sort to keep them ancored in the "real world".  This might suggesst lore dating back to Egypt, such as wikipedia states.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: because a decision had to be made because at the time of canonization, there were inumerable gospels and letters floating around.  The leaders of the Catholic church tried to pick the books that flowed, were the most consistant, and upheld the basic beliefs of the church.  Also, many texts were found after the fact.

question_title: are you really open-minded ? [SEP] question_content: I know people like to say they are open-minded, it sounds good doesn't it?\nI always find people saying they're open-minded then they are shocked at certain things and proceed to judge like "oh that isn't right what they do" or "what a freak/weirdo"\n\nHere's an example: The idea that drinking your own urine or putting it on cuts can benefit your health. Fine if you think it's gross. I don't exactly see it as something pleasant but to me it's no big deal if that's what someone wants to do, and who's to say it doesn't work? It's something to consider.\n\nThere are even more controversial ones, 1 involves pedophilia. I'm not going to attempt to explain it because some people on here are just far too immature to grasp what the idea suggests and will immediately write OMGS WRONG!11 sick mofo!!\nWhen I first heard the theory I didn't freak out. I don't condone certain things or even agree with them but I can see where they're coming from.\n\nWhat is open-mindedness really? Are you truely? Am I..hmm [SEP] best_answer: Open mindedness is a very personal thing. One person decides how much he/she will accept/tolerate from others. I call myself open minded because i live by my motto, basically live and let live! You mention people drinking their own urine ... Well they can well do it as much as they like just as long as they don't expect me to follow suit! You mention peadophiles and have to realise that some people may well have been abused or their children have in which case such people would never accept peadophiles, let alone tolerate them! \n\nI think you'll find that most people's degrees of tolerance/acceptance vary depending on their upbringing, primary socialisation, life circumstances. Picture yourself coming home after a bad at work, a really sore head to hear your kids playing rave music on full blast ... You wouldn't tolerate it if, at other times, you might actually enjoy it!\n\nI am a registered mental health nurse and have worked with categories of people the vast majority of us would never wish to associate with under normal circumstances, some of the patients included peadophilesand worse ... As a nurse it was my duty to treat anyone the same, regardless of what they had done (Be it alleged pending trial or proven) And i did it because it was what i did! This doesn't mean to say that i approved of what they had done (Alleged to have done) because other patients were in the ward following crimes perpetrated against them ... Same crimes these people were in for a psychiatric assessment! But it didn't reflect on my care and the way i spoke to them.  \n\nMy interpretation of open mindedness is that, and no matter how our own perception/values affect our judgement ... Not to let it show and treat people the same if privately we may feel that we do not condone what a person did!	Society & Culture

question_title: Question about voting rights? [SEP] question_content: When did the following groups get the right to vote in the United States\nWomen\nAfrican-Americans\nEighteen year olds [SEP] best_answer: African-Americans \nThe Fifteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, ratified March 30, 1870, provided that all male citizens were entitled to vote.\n\nWomen in 1926 on August 26th the right to vote was signed into law by the Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby \n\nEighteen year olds\nA third voting rights movement was the movement in the 1960s to require the voting age to be lowered to eighteen from twenty-one. This movement was given far greater impetus by the Vietnam War, as it was noted that most of the young men who were being drafted to fight in it were too young to have any voice in the selection of the leaders who were sending them to fight. This, too, had previously been a state issue, as several states, notably Georgia, Kentucky, and Hawaii, had already allowed voting at a younger age than twenty-one. The Twenty-sixth Amendment required all states to set their voting age at no higher than eighteen (as of 2006 no state has opted for an earlier age, although some have discussed it).

question_title: I am thinking of joining the free masons? [SEP] question_content: I asked and than found out I had alot of family in it....I was shocked. But I was told that it makes a man a better man. Family though just tell if I want to be one than go for it....What should I expect. [SEP] best_answer: WOW,  it looks like nobody on here has any clue what they are talking about.  As a Mason, I should be able to answer this question for you.\n\nTo become a Mason, you must merely be a good man who believes in a higher power.  Then you should ask a member of your local lodge to meet and discuss joining.  They will be happy to talk to you and get you started.\n\nWhen I joined, I had no idea what to expect.  I have since met many wonderful people and have learned a great deal about myself and others.  You really learn how to work well and serve your community through charity.  It is a great fraternal organization. \n\nThere will always be those who accuse Masons of being Satanic, or of being evil at the higher levels, but let me assure you that the higher degrees of Freemasonry are only a continuation of the first three, which recounts a legend that takes place during the building of King Solomon's temple.  As a 32nd degree Mason myself, I have never seen or heard anything to lead me to believe that anyone in our midst is a Satanist.  In fact, there are members of my lodge who are Christian ministers, Muslims, and Jews.\n\nContrary to what some may say about the higher degrees, those of us who are 32nd degree Masons are often the ones with more opportunity to do good work in the community.\n\nIf you take away nothing else from my writings here, know this....you will always learn more about Freemasonry from Masons than you will from people who are guessing about the fraternity or regurgitating opinions about what they have read.  Find out for yourself.  We are a noble institution that strives to make good men better.	Politics & Government
question_title: Is it possible for ANY government to remove e-mails from my address without me knowing? [SEP] question_content: I almost never recieve e-mails from my family overseas. [SEP] best_answer: A less dramatic and more realistic explanation is that the country your familiy is sending from is being blocked by your E-mail provider.\n\nMany providers block large portions of China and Koreaa, for example, as they are notoriously lenient on spammers, and many spammers send their email through those hosts.\n\nEven if the entire country is not blocked, many places block IP address ranges that host or have hosted spammers. \n\nAlso, sometimes "foreign" fonts or character sets will set off automatic blocks or redirects.\n\nI'd check first with your email provider, see if they use block lists, and ask if you can 'whitelist" specific addresses from your family. \n\nAs well, if you can, put your family addresses on a 'recognized' list (or whatever it is called on your email) to make sure they aren't just blocked or sent as spam.

[SEP] question_content: But we moved when I was a child and I`m a citizen of Azerbaijan now.Is it possible to get a german citizenship if I was born there? [SEP] best_answer: I found an article of the German immigration law:\n\n"Kann-Einbürgerung:\n§ 14 StAG :ausländische Staatsbürger, die im Ausland leben und besondere Bindungen zu Deutschland haben."\n\nI don't know If you still speak German, but it means that a foreigner living in a foreign country CAN be naturalized in Germany if he has a special relationship with Germany.\n\nSo it does not mean that you have the right of naturalization, but you have the possibility of getting granted the be naturalized. In practical it is up to the autorities to decide wheather you "deserve" the German nationality or not.\n\nSo you better start eating 'Schweinshaxe' and drink German beer, then you study a bit German Geography and Politics and refresh the language to pass the ability tests.. ;)\n\nGood luck with German Bureaucracy ;)	Politics & Government

At the convention the Party unanimously approved its constitution, voted to support the six-principles of the Global Green Charter, elected an executive and chose a Party logo.

question_title: I live in mobile home park.  The neighbor across the street parks blocking my ingress and egress from driveway [SEP] question_content: I have a long driveway with an exit at the other end; however, I prefer to back out of my driveway as I am exiting to leave in the other direction.  The neighbor blocks that access and says "you can just go out the other way".  His guests block my driveway. [SEP] best_answer: Since your neighbor and his guests are being rude, talk to the property manager.  There are most likely community by laws / rules including not parking in such a way to block other tenants cars.  \nAsk the manager to enforce the rules.  If he/she says they have to see it, ask if time stamped photos would prove it.  \nBe nice to the manager.  He/she is only doing either job and hopefully being fair about it.  \nAlso if you have on site security, call them when it happens.  They may be authorized to have the vehicles towed if not moved. \nThe drive way needs to be clear for several reasons especially if any type of emergency services are called to your home and need quick access to the house.   \nAlso ask the manager about putting up no parking signs in front of your drive. \nBest of luck.

question_title: American presidents - 2 terms? [SEP] question_content: Look back over the last few American presidents that served 2 terms.

If you look at 2-term Presidents you will see how power crazy they become over the 2 terms and how many enemies they gain.\n\nWould it be a better idea to have 1 longer term of 5 years or 2 shorter terms of 3 years instead? [SEP] best_answer: I think 2 shorter terms of 3 years would be wiser.

Why can't you just make your issue on the mere fact that this person is harassing you? Take action on that matter with the proper authorities. I was surfing the web for answers and came across all of the ridiculous questions people were asking about illegal immigrants and I felt I had to respond. I thought America was the great melting pot. It was made by people from different countries. Yes some will say they weren't illegal. No one was considered illegal back then. People could come and go into places as they chose. Why can't others do that today. I know there are a lot of issues with terrorists but they seem to be from a certain country. We still need to watch each person carefully just as we need to watch all of our own citizens who murder, rape and abuse us. The Mexican immigrants trying to come into the U.S. are only trying to make money for their families in Mexico, to send back to them. The country is very poor. Why do we as Americans get to go to Mexico and live there when we retire? I have researched Mexico and seen that many elderly people go to Mexico to retire. They have made large retirement villages there. They live rich lifestyles because it is cheap to live with such things as paying $15.00 a week for a maid. Can you believe that? Why do we get to go there and they can't come and live here? We as Americans get to travel many places to visit but we see nothing wrong with that, we're Americans. Why do Americans think they are above the rest? I don't know! Look at all of the movie stars like, George Clooney, who has a house in Paris, or wherever it is, then there's, Angelina Jolie, with her many houses in different countries. All of the stars do that, just like a lot of other non-famous people do. I was reading another question about the child support that was closed. I know someone who is an illegal immigrant from Mexico and the American girl is in the process of getting child support from him. I also know that all of the illegal immigrants who work here in the U.S. get paychecks and each of those paychecks has money taken from it for taxes of sorts, just like ours. This has happened for many years. Where does all of this money go since they are illegal, to the government and to the American people who are receiving retirement checks monthly. The illegals will never use that money because they will not retire from here when they get old. America is using the illegals just as they are using us for help. Why can't we go as we please as long as we abide by the laws of each place. If we don't abide just use the jails; like we use for all of the other millions of American inmates. \nWhat is the wrong in them being here? Only that people here are still prejudice and will always be; even the people who go to church, pretending they are so good. God didn't make us all so we could hate each other. We are all the same just spread throughout the world. Sure we are all shades of different colors, we have to be. Each part of the world has different climates and our skin has to protect us from it. People with very pale skin couldn't live as all of the village people in Africa do without being burnt daily. The skin tone protects each person from the climate of each region. Americans were just lucky enough to live in a climate that has both cold and hot seasons that don't effect our skin as much.\n\nSorry I used your question as a venting tool.	Politics & Government

He comes from a rich family and initially agreed to look after the child but when she really got pregnant he ran away! Can someone pls help me? As the girl is still underage I suppose the guy will get it! and i hope he does! The guy is 18 years old and a hypocrite and loser.\n\nWhat are the liabilities of the guy if this is taken to the police??\nHow much will the girl be compensated for mental and physical hurt?\nWill he get jailed?\nWhat can the girl do to advantage her position??\n\nTHANKS A MILLION [SEP] best_answer: Depending on when the sexual intercourse occurred, the man may not have committed any offence. Under Singapore's Penal Code, it is statutory rape if a man has sex with a girl under the age of 14, with or without her consent. It is also an offence if he has sex with a girl older than 14 but below the age of 16; this is covered by the Woman's Charter and is called carnal connection.\n\nEven if the man does not have a criminal case to answer to, the girl can always sue him in civil court for maintenance. Of course, the legal process would be complicated, requiring the girl to prove the baby is the man's. If this is your chosen option, I would advise you to consult a lawyer.	Politics & Government

question_title: What is the Food Protection Act 1990? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Food safety act 1990\n\nThis says that it is illegal to sell food which has been contaminated or adulterated or is unfit for human consumption or is labelled or advertised in a way that misleads the customer. The aim of the food safety act is to:\n· ensure that all food produced for sale is safe to eat, of high quality and not misleadingly presented \n· provide legal powers and penalties \n· enable this country to fulfil its responsibilities in the European Community, and the Single Market \n· keep pace with technological change \n\n\nThe Act covers:\n\nfood \nsources from which food is derived e.g. crops and animals \narticles which come into contact with food e.g. wrappings, mixing vats \n\n'Food' includes:\n\ningredients e.g. colour, sweetener, preservatives \nanimals eaten live e.g. oyster \ndrink \nslimming aids and dietary supplements \nwater used in food production \n\nIt does not cover animal feed or medicines.\n\nThe law says that it's an offence to sell any food, which is "not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser" i.e. if you ask for cod in batter, you shouldn't be given anything else; your piece of cod shouldn't contain any foreign bodies like glass, metal or insects; and it shouldn't be rancid or mouldy. If you asked your butcher for 500g of pork sausages and he sells you 450g then that's an offence under the Weights and Measures Act. If the sausages weren't pork but a mixture of beef, pork and other odd scraps, then he could be prosecuted under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 or the Food Safety Act 1990. There's a certain amount of overlap between the Acts and several laws can affect one transaction or sale. \n\nThe Food Safety Act 1990 covers four main areas: \n\nLabelling \nAdditives and Contaminants \nComposition (or Content) \nPublic Health and Hygiene	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A national flag is a flag that symbolises a country and that can usually be flown by citizens of that country.\n\nBoth public and private buildings such as schools and courthouses often fly the national flag. In some countries, the national flags are only flown from non-military buildings on certain flag days.\n\nThere are three distinct types of national flag for use on land, and three for use at sea, although many countries use identical designs for several of these types of flag.

question_title: What impedes a woman or  black person from running for president? Do you think it will ever happen? [SEP] question_content: DO you think it is simply lack of qualifications or simply thoughts of rejection or low support? Do you think a woman or black president would be a good president? [SEP] best_answer: There have been both black people and women who have run for President. Both Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have performed reasonably well in their bids. Elizabeth Dole ran for the Republican nomination against George W. Bush but didn't make much of an impression.\n\nHilary Clinton is the frontrunner for the nomination of her party and there is talk of a bid by Condaleeza Rice for the Republican nomination. In the past, there have not been many blacks or women with the experience to run for President. This position will change over time.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why was it illegal to own gold in the 1970s? [SEP] question_content: in USA [SEP] best_answer: My goodness, people are sadly ignorant.  Yes, of course, private ownership of gold in the U.S. was outlawed by Franklin Roosevelt back in the 1930's, and that lasted until the mid-1970's.  I'm ashamed to think that people have no idea.  Even at that time, however, there was an exception made for gold jewelry.  That may explain part of the confusion.  However, owning gold was against the law.\n\nThe idea was to put control over the currency completely in the hands of government, and make our fiat paper money system completely dominant.  Pre-1930, governments didn't have complete control over their currencies, because they were convertible to gold, which was then a primary international currency itself. Governments then could not easily manipulate the values of their currencies, because the market would respond quickly to devaluations.\n\nIn other words, the outlawing of gold ownership was part of a plan to remove the monetary system from the free market, and make it a centrally planned system.  Even when gold was legalized again, it never recovered its previous role as a core world currency.  Central banks around the world still have incredible power to manipulate their currencies to suit the whims of their governments.	Politics & Government
question_title: Iraq: What Does Success Mean? [SEP] question_content: Trapped in its own propaganda, the US currently faces a problem concerning Iraq. The US people become more and more reluctant to the deployment of troops in Iraq while neo-cons are already dreaming of new invasions. However, the objectives officially proclaimed about the invasion make it too hard for the Bush administration to be able to retreat from Iraq victoriously. \nTo persuade the international opinion to back the invasion as fair, the Bush administration and its allies concealed their energy and geo-strategic goals and insisted on the need for a preventive action against the proliferation of mass destruction weapons. After that pretext was gone, Washington wielded the democratization of Iraq as the main purpose of this colonial adventure.

question_title: what ya think about the illegal alien problem?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Its unfortunate, in relation to mexicans, that they have to leave their country because they are full of corrupt leaders who dont care at all about the people. Mexico is a beautiful country full of rich resources that unfortunately are not used properly. So the people have to do what they can in order to support a family even if its something illegal. That being said I dont believe they should get citizenship just because they demand it. There are other people in line who did things the right way who should become citizens first. I think they should try their best to learn english (many have), pay taxes (which many do), and do their best to become legal. Many of them dont like being here illegaly and want to become legal. Again in MExico its hard and more so for the poor people to get visas and passports. So they have few options.	Politics & Government

question_title: Who is more dangerouse to the united states Iran or North Korea? [SEP] question_content: Which one poses a clear and present danger ? [SEP] best_answer: North Korea probably represents one of the most significant nuclear threats facing the US. It is implacably hostile to the United States and unpredictable in its responses. For more than 60 years it has posed an invasion threat to South Korea, though the military balance has been increasingly tilting against its favor. North Korea now claims to have nuclear weapons, and Western analysts agree that it has had a capability to have produced them\n\nFor years North Korea’s overwhelming conventional superiority on the peninsula was partly countered by US nuclear capabilities. But as South Korean military capabilities grew, the balance shifted so significantly that by the early 1990's, the US had withdrawn all theater nuclear weapons from South Korea. \n\nThe core significance of N. Korean nuclear weapons is that they make a US use of nuclear weapons unattractive in any military confrontation. A N. Korean invasion would certainly require a strong US response. With so many US forces tied down in the Middle East, nuclear weapons might even be considered. The US might also be tempted to use nuclear weapons to preempt a N. Korean attack. Perhaps more disturbing is the N. Korean nuclear program. Not only has N. Korea withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and claimed to have actually developed its own nuclear weapons, but it appears to have been a major player in a worldwide black market in nuclear materials, information, and potential delivery vehicles. It has also been very intransigent during on-going discussions regarding its nuclear programs, insisting on a right to have its own nuclear energy reactors\n\nUnlike Iran, No. Korea has had years of building underground structures at some 30 known locations as well as presumably additional unknown ones makes the targeting extremely difficult (esp. with regard to command and control centers).\n\nIt is also assumed that they now have the capability of reaching all targets within contental USA, something Iran doesn't have at the present time.

The U.S. sold them to him when he was an ally in the 1980's.As to where they are now, he used quite a few during his years in power before Desert Storm, probably used a few more since then. As to where they are now, if Bush and his boys weren't able to find them, is there a possibility that they are truly gone and Saddam told the truth, or is that not liberal enough a question?

Saying things like "STOLEN CONTINENTS!" even though their ancestors were spanish (EUROPEANS) too.

You'd have to get off your high horse first."\n\nreally? then why is there still a high crime rate, corruption in government, etc.. in Mexico? Where are these good politians in mexico you are talking about?\n\n"Why didn't those good men ( our founding fathers ) stay home and work to better their own country."\n\nActually, their colonies were apart of their country! New england belonged to Great Britian.

Only if Mexico had lots of oil..."\n\nRiiight. Actually the whole Middle East is sitting on oil. We didn't take any oil from Iraq (proven already). Explain why the oil prices are so high? High oil prices don't do any goood to USA.\nand lol, Mexico sits on TONS OF OIL! They supply USA with tons of it already.

question_title: Why dont most republicans believe global warming is real? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a few aspects to be addressed when discussing global warming...\n\nGlobal warming is the term used to describe how the average temperature of the planet is going up. No one denies that the temperature is, in fact, going up. Therefore, no one denies that global warming is a fact.\n\nHowever, according to studies of Antarctic ice, the average temperature of the planet has been rising for 6,000 years, which is well before the Industrial Revolution of 150 years ago. This proves that global warming is not caused by man. In that time, however, the rate of temperature rise has increased, which means that the actions of humanity probably has worsened the situation.  What has been the degree to which we have?\n\nThe critical questions to be answered about global warming are these:\n\nWhat are the effects of global warming going to be, and how can we prepare for them? Currently, no model of global atmospheric projection has shown itself to accurately predict to any degree the general weather patterns of the Earth (such as the number and ferocity of hurricanes). Until we come up with an accurate way of predicting the effects of global warming, preparing for them will be difficult and based upon conjectures, which are a difficult sell to taxpayers.\n\nWhat can be done to limit the effect of humanity on global warming in the future WITHOUT putting a major damper on economic growth and development, especially in developing nations? For example, all nations could agree to stop driving vehicles that use internal combustion engines, but to do so at once would devastate the economies of many nations. However, other options, such as diverting tax funds to subsidize the development of alternative-energy propulsion for vehicles, would accelerate the advent of such earth-friendly technology.\n\nAll in all, because of the massive stakes involved when discussing global warming (and the subsequent misinformation flying around about it), many people are confused as to the facts about it. I was hoping to be as informative and unbiased as possible.\n\nAnd yes, I am Republican.\n\nPlease let me know what you think!	Politics & Government

If Armenians did kill the Turks, why did the Turks have ANY right to kill the Assyrian and Greeks? They were incapable of military advances, so why did they perish?

The government watched in horror as Shay's Rebellion transpired just before the Convention, and some states had very nearly gone to war with each other over territory (such as between Pennsylvania and Connecticut over Wilkes-Barre). One of the main goals of the Convention, then, was to ensure the federal government had powers to squash rebellion and to smooth tensions between states.	Politics & Government

question_title: who can make treaties and declare war? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The president has the duty and power to make treaties, but they must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate.\n3 Controversial yet vitally important treaties entered into are country by the 20th century: Charter of the UN, North Atlantic Treaty Org.(defense military alliance);and North American Free Trade Agreement(nafta)among Canada,Mexico, and the US.\nAs far as war the president may sign what is called an executive agreement, enabling war without Senate ratification. ie:World War II..\nCongress, however, retains to itself the power to declare war the "power to make war" is granted SOLEY By the PRESIDENT.  Oh, by the way, it is NOT TRUE that treaties and war are enacted soley upon congress and senate.

question_title: Why democrate Tony Blair is always depending on Mr.Bush? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A few things: \n\n(1) As mentioned above, Blair is a member of the Labour Party.\n(2) While the Labour Party and the US Democrats have simliar ideology just as the US Republican party and the British Conservative party do, it is a mistake to assume the two pairs see eye to eye on everything. British and US politics are not the same and have different traditions.\n(3) Often, when the US or Britain see themselves in a crises, they have tended to stand together in the past 100 years. Churchill was a conservative while FDR was a Democrat but worked well together. \n(4) Sometimes these things are a matter of personal chemistry between the leaders of the parties. Reagan and Thatcher got along great, but the first Bush and Thatcher did not. The first Bush also did not get along well with Majors and this caused some strain between the GOP and the Conservative party.	Politics & Government

And bush is trying to stop them from being able to marry.  Its not your fault who you fall in love with!!! \n\nThats my opinion, whats all of yours?

What other reason would they have for overreacting to something that doesn't concern them?\nGays want to be married so they can get the same benefits like health insurance as other families get.  \nWho is anyone to tell someone else that who they love is wrong? \nOther than deluded bible thumpers that is. \nI take it as a compliment if a lesbian makes a pass at me.

question_title: so did hitler wanted to kill jews or people with brown hair and brown eyes? [SEP] question_content: so did hitler wanted to kill jews or people with brown hair and brown eyes, caz he had brown hair and brown eyes so its kinda weird.........any ways do u think he was possesed in any way by the devil? [SEP] best_answer: The Holocaust was more than a Jewish event. Records kept by the Germans prove they exterminated millions of Communists, Czechs, Greeks, Gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, mentally and physically handicapped, Poles, resistance fighters, Russians, Serbs, Socialists, Spanish Republicans, trade unionists, Ukrainians, Yugoslavians, prisoners of war of many nations, and still others whose identity may never be recognized. Their victims, according to one survivor of four different concentration camps, "were of some thirty nationalities, from Nepalese to Andorrans, and of a variety of racial and linguistic stocks ranging from Basques to Buriats and from Ladinos to Lapps". When people were not immediately exterminated, they were sent to work and/or concentration camps. There the prisoners were divided into six penal categories and given patches on their clothing for identification purposes. Ordinary criminals were assigned green; political prisoners wore red; black was worn by asocials (slackers, prostitutes, procurers, etc.); homosexuals wore pink; conscientious objectors wore purple, and the Jewish people wore yellow.\n\nOh and by the way Hitler was NOT of the jewish faith ... Hitler, himself, was a Catholic.	Politics & Government

question_title: why can the world health find a permanant cure for the killer disease HIV? [SEP] question_content: Its taking too long for our scientist to find cure for the killer disease HIV. Even thought there is a temporary cure, the world still need a permanant solution. [SEP] best_answer: The main reason is that HIV is unlike any other virus that causes disease. A vaccine can be made for basically every other virus, becuase if you introduce dead or weakened versions of the virus the immune system recognizes it and then kills the virus effectively and quickly whenever it is introduced into the system. With HIV, however, the virus attacks the very cells that normally carry out this function. Also, it mutates very quickly, making attempts at curing or even alleviating its symptoms all the more difficult.\n\nAs for the other poster who said that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, he is spouting dangerous lies. Every credible scientist who has ever worked on AIDS agrees that it is caused by HIV. AIDS existed well before AZT was used to treat it - how could it cause AIDS?	Politics & Government

question_title: Graf Zeppelin? [SEP] question_content: The Russians sank her by using her for target practice in 1947, why did they not convert her into a Russian aircraft carrier?  They had already made it known they believed naval aviation was going to change naval warfare for good. [SEP] best_answer: The question refers to the aircraft carrier, not the airship....\n\nKeep in mind that the Germans scuttled the Graf Zeppelin in the ending days of the war off the Polish coast, to avoid having the Russians capture it.\n\nWhen the Russians refloated the ship, it was in a sorry state.  They used it to transport equipment out of Germany back to Russia for a few months, then used planes to sink it.  \n\nThe Russians were more concerned about defending themselves against carrier attacks rather than building their own, so sinking it with planes proved to be an excellent way for them to develop their own methods for defending against carriers.

question_title: Arizona social welfare crisis? [SEP] question_content: Social welfare and corrections [SEP] best_answer: Perhaps Arizona should look at ways of increasing the capacity of its systems.  I think about the former "traditonal gateways" to this nation like New York/San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Buffalo, Detroit etc. and how they managed and benefited from large influxes of immigrants.  Perhaps the state government of Arizona just has not decided to build the infrastructure it needs to manage this.  I'd venture to say that if the same amount of influx were to happen in NYC or SF etc. (and it is happening in both those cities!) that you would be hearing little about a crisis. . .but that the locality would mobilize to solve the matter that benefits all.

question_title: Do you LIKE or HATE President Bush? [SEP] question_content: Why? [SEP] best_answer: I don't hate him, but I disagree with his philosophy, his legislation and his morals. His philosophy is to lift the country by helping those that  have the most, i.e. supply side economics. At the expense of those that have the very least by cutting government programs that are sometimes lifelines for the very poor. \n  Which explains why I hate the legislation that he has augumented since coming into office. The war is a mistake that he pulled the wool over everyones eyes to start with. \n   I hate his morals the most, he will do anything that he can, encluding lie, cheat and steal all under the guise of being a christian man. All in all I feel he is a bad man and a bad choice for president, no matter what your party affilation is. I am not sure if Gore or Kerry could have done better but I am sure that they could have done no worse.	Politics & Government

How about we go after the thousands of people that can work, but would rather collect a welfare check, food stamps. You or I are not going to change nobodies mind. These idiots are not the majority.

question_title: If you to become a president of your country..What genuine politics you would adopt? [SEP] question_content: that will  make this world a safer place ?.. [SEP] best_answer: Safer?  Why that emphasis?  Why not better more generally?\n\nWhat politics I would adopt would be based on the premise that we can fit government back inside the Constitution.  And most specifically, that the Tenth Amendment implies that much of what has grown up as federal bureaucracy either ought not exist at all or ought to be done by the states individually.  \n\nIn many cases, small local programs are swallowed up in the glare of federal funding.  No, the feds don't literally control the program, but they control the funding, and that controls the program to a remarkable degree.  Move that to the state level would be an improvement.  What the states do with it is up to them.  Move as much as possible to the county level, we would hope.\n\nBut the Tenth Amendment also comes right after the first nine that spell out some pretty wide areas of rights of the individual in this country, and we need to remember that the rest was left to the states or "to the people."  That is, not the business of legislation or regulation at all, but of individual decisions.\n\nSo if I was the president, I would institute a policy of Constitutional Law Reform:  fit the country back inside the Constitution.  Streamline the process for challenge of new laws based on Constitutional grounds, and use Constitutional research as standard procedure in the congress when new laws are written.\n\nMake sure people understand that we are dedicated to living within the rules of the country we set down in writing, a sacred contract with ourselves and our posterity.

If you want, you can get one from him, too."\n\nSo Earl goes to the breeder and says he wants a dog like the one his friend Chester has.

question_title: What is the best way to shop a demo CD to labels etc...? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: First off, find out who is head of A & R at the company. Check the Billboard directory. Then send it to them personally and package it distinctively. Use your imagination. Some companies will get hundreds of CDs to audition on a monthly basis and quite frankly they won't have time to listen to half of them. Same in sending your stuff to radio stations and reviewers.\n\nTry to make a name for yourself performing. Get some reviews. Participate in things like South by Southwest.\n\nThe best way to get anywhere is to audition for management and being able to demonstrate to them that you can make money for them. Most importantly...it is the personal contacts you make that will help you. Even if you think your local music reviewer is an idiot, don't let anyone know you think that way. Join organizations like NARAS, attend the receptions, mix with other members. Some will be extremely helpful to up and coming musicians, but they have to know you are there. \n\nAudition for gigs...sometimes you will have to play for free, but that is how it goes sometimes.\n\nAlways keep in mind that however much you see yourself as a musician and artist, a record company must, at some point, consider your earning potential. Also remember, that the larger the record label, the greater their expectation for earnings will be. Smaller labels are more likely to be interested in what you are trying to do. If you are only in it for the money, look for a bigger label.\n\nAlways consider what you might have to offer that is unique...what will make you marketable. An agent can help you develop an image, but until you reach that point, you need to think like you are your own agent and work on your marketing...and I am not taking T-shirts or posters...it is getting your name before the public in reviews...in the newspaper...on local radio...branding, etc.\n\nOf course you can start your own label...but then you probably won't get anyone to distribute your stuff!\n\nThe music business is really a relatively small world. Most of the survivors remember what it was like getting started and as they age, they are often interested in helping younger musicians along, assuming they aren't burnt out on things. Remember you can learn from them, and my guess is that many of them will tell you that these days it is more about business than it is about music.\n\nGood luck.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Answer correctly and get 10 pts.? [SEP] question_content: You are trapped in a room with absolutely no way to see out of it with three light switches on the wall. In 30 minutes a man it goiong to take you to another room where the light is for the 3 switches in your room. In order to live you have to figure out whick switch turns on the light. How do you do it? [SEP] best_answer: Here's what I would do: I'd flip the first switch on for a long time (30+ minutes), the second witch I'd never switch on, and the third switch I'd turn on and leave on when the man takes me. So, if the light bulb is on, I know the third switch is the correct one. If the bulb is cold, I know the second switch is the correct one, and if the bulb is warm, I know the first switch is the correct one.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Just watched Star Wars 3, I'm confused about Luke/Lea, Darth Vader, etc.? [SEP] question_content: I'm new to this franchise and just wondering a few things.\nHaven't people said Luke/Lea were together? belonged together? yet theyre brother and sister?\nWhy did Anakin become Darth Vadar? Power hungry AND wanting to save his wife from death? How was she going to die, and how could his enemy help her?\nHow did his wife die at the end? giving birth like his mother, or "unwillingness to live"?\nHow does Obi die in the future? [SEP] best_answer: Anakin Skywalker was the most powerful Jedi ever, and if youve seen the earlier movies, you know that Yoda and Obi-Wan always warned him to learn to control his fear and anger, of he would fall victim to the dark side.  So, he was having a baby with Princess Amiedalah and during that time the council denied making Anakin a Jedi Master.  Ankins emotions (jealousy and anger) made him very vulnerable to the dark side, and the councellor seduced him to join the dark side and have revenge on the Jedi Alliance.  Princess Amiedalah Could sense this and died giving birth to Luke and Leia.  Obi Wan fought Anakin, but couldnt kill him, and Anakin was severely burned on whatever that molten planet that is.  Rescued by the former councellor, Anakin was covered in his mask and suit to protect him and arose as Darth Vader, a dark Lord.  Darth Vader kills Obi Wan later in a light saber battle, but Luke still sees him in visions.\n     So, Luke and Leia are twins, born to Anakin Skywalker and Princess Amiedalah, But raised by Jedi and hidden from their now evil father.  They werent meant to be together or anything, but it appears that way because they are twin Jedi's (though they dont know it) and share a special bond.  BTW, Anakins mother didnt die giving birth,  Anakin and his parents were slaves.  Anakin was bought by the Jedi when he was little, and promised to come back to rescue his mother from slavery.  When he did, she was sold.  By the time he almost finds her he finds out she was murdered (I think by the Sand People).  Anakin has his revenge and that starts his slow downward spiral into the dark side.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: If any of you listen to police scanners, I am looking for some good stories.? [SEP] question_content: About 2 years ago, I was in the bed trying to get to sleep and had my scanner tuned in on my local city cops. I heard this high speed chase that started at Cpt. D's and took them on about a 30 mile voyage on the highway and then curvy backroads until the car lost control on a RR track and flipped. About 1 hr. later this one cop (a friend of mine) was on his way home on the interstate and saw a truck on fire. I heard the whole thing. The pick-up was engulfed and 2 Mexicans were in there drunk and passed out. He got them out and even came back to see if a 3rd person was in there. You could hear him coughing from the smoke. He told me later on that one of the Mexicans said he hurt his ribs and the other said he didn't get his shoe out of the truck. It was very exciting to listen to but I can't believe how ungrateful the 2 men were to have gotten their lives saved. I would love to hear of any cool memories that you have with a police scanner.  I know its just personal amusement. [SEP] best_answer: i shattered my ankle once and as a result i was in bed for like 3 months so my grandfater loaned me his scanner, i was lying there one night and i heard the local(so close i could see the police staition from my window) pd and they were talking about a group of suspicious persons walking around and then one cop actually reffered to these ppl as a group of (n-word) and the other one said "yeah there in the wrong neighboorhood lets get em" they detained these ppl for something like 90 mins and kept running there names and harrassing them, also my scanner could pick up wireless phones and pager messages too there was some pretty interesting things there?!?

question_title: y do pple think humpty dumpty was an egg wen they never said that in the nursury rime?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are several theories about the original meaning of the nursery rhyme"Humpty Dumpty". One is that it is about a king with a disfigured back, who rode in to battle on his horse names Wall. He fell from the horse in battle and died. Another is Humpty Dumpty was a colloquial term used in 15th century England to describe someone who was fat or obese - giving rise to lots of theories pertaining to the identity of Humpty Dumpty. However, in this case the question should be not Who was Humpty Dumpty but What was Humpty Dumpty? Humpty Dumpty was in fact an unusually large canon which was mounted on the protective wall of "St. Mary's Wall Church" in Colchester, England. It was intended to protect the Parliamentarian stronghold of Colchester which was in the temporarily in control of the Royalists during the period of English history, described as the English Civil War ( 1642 - 1649). A shot from a Parliamentary canon succeeded in damaging the wall underneath Humpty Dumpty causing the canon to fall to the ground. The Royalists 'all the King's men' attempted to raise Humpty Dumpty on to another part of the wall but even with the help of ' all the King's horses' failed in their task and Colchester fell to the Parliamentarians after a siege lasting eleven weeks.

question_title: only for aquarious and libras..??? [SEP] question_content: im aquarious.. all of my bfs have been capricorns but iv never known a libra.. now im talking to a libra and he wants 2 ask me out... are we compatible?!?!......thanx [SEP] best_answer: Aquarius + Libra\n\nAir + Air = Wind\n\nLibra will love your crazy antics, Aquarius, and there’s a natural romantic connection between the two of you. You are likely to hit it off immediately and will sense some important emotional karma between you. Both air signs, Aquarius and Libra, naturally gravitate towards people. Libra prefers smaller social circles in contrast to your larger communal, even global awareness, which is your characteristic trademark. Aquarius, you will expand the social view of Libra as they are also interested in an enhancement of intellectual knowledge. As Libra is a natural diplomat, the revolutionary or possibly unusual political ideologies you offer are seen as marvellous food for Libran thought. \n\nBoth Aquarius and Libra have modern views about love and marriage, but Libra tends to be more flirtatious than seriously non-committal — as most Aquarians seem to be. Some Aquarians accept that such taboos as polygamy and free love, etc. should be explored and even subscribed to. But though Libra’s usually harmless dalliances or flirtations upset and repel other zodiac signs, they would be almost an enticement for your avant-garde personality. Perhaps the two of you need to take this relationship a little further, sharing that independent freedom with each other first, then considering long-term commitment later. Once you’ve both explored and exhausted the idea of sowing your wild oats, there is much in common, and the relationship will satisfy you both immensely. \n\nLibrans born between 4 and 13 October instantly recognise you as soul mates, as do those born between 24 September and 3 October, having strong karmic influences on your life. They may transform you, usually for the better. Try to avoid any continuing involvement with Librans born between 14 and 23 October, as they are far too dreamy for your liking.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: If you are in a relationship and there is a child, but you are unhappy, would you stay? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend has a child. She is in a relationship with a man who takes great care of her and the child even though the child is not his. She claims she is unhappy and is looking to me for advice, but I'm really unsure what to tell her. She has no job, no money, but has a wonderful life with this man, or so I assumed. I told her not to make any final decisions right now, to take her time and think  it thru. What do you suggest? Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: Most people would say dont stay because of the child, but I disagree. I love children, I think they deserve both a mother and a father in their lives and lets face it. Most men dont see their children that often when you are separated. I'm not assuming this, i'm speaking from experience. She has no job, or money, if she would leave now it would be selfish of her for not putting the childs needs before their own. If she feels very strongly about it, then i suggest she get it together so she can make it on her own, but until then, she should stay put and try and communicate with her mate to make it better.

question_title: What are the signs & symptons of RSV? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In adults and children older than 3 years, RSV usually causes symptoms of a simple upper respiratory tract illness or common cold. These symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, mild headache, mild cough, low-grade fever, and a general feeling of being ill.\n\nIn children younger than age 3, RSV can cause a lower respiratory tract illness like bronchiolitis or pneumonia and in more severe cases can lead to respiratory failure. Symptoms may include high fever, severe cough, wheezing, abnormally rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, and a bluish color of the lips or fingernails caused by lowered levels of oxygen in the blood. In infants with severe RSV infection, there may be abnormal retractions of the muscles between the ribs, as the child struggles to draw breath into infected breathing passages. Children who were born prematurely, or who have preexisting lung, heart, or immune problems, are at greatest risk to have serious complications from RSV infection.	Health

question_title: Liposuction dangers? [SEP] question_content: One of my friends has been dieting and exercising for the last year.  She looks great!  Lost about 50 pounds (the right way) but is still unhappy with her thighs and wants to get liposuction.  I think she looks awesome and doesn't need it. And I also remember hearing about some dangers involved, such as blood clots.  I want to be encouraging for but I'm concerned about the possible dangers.  Has anyone had this procedure and if so, what was your experience? Am I justified being concerned or over reacting? [SEP] best_answer: I had this done. There are risks in any surgery which any surgeon will go over to all potential patients.  But as long as you go to an experienced and competent plastic surgeon the risks are minimal.  I didn't suffer any pain but was very bruised in the area for a few weeks.  You wear  compression garments for about 2 months after surgery which helps healing.   It was the best thing I ever did for the confidence it gave me in my body.	Health

question_title: can you explain post replication repair mechanism? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Post Replication Repair Mechanism - DNA Repair\n\nThe reconstruction of a continuous two-stranded DNA molecule without mismatch from a molecule which contained damaged regions.  The major repair mechanisms are excision repair, in which defective regions in one strand are excised and resynthesized using the complementary base pairing information in the intact strands; photo reactivation repair, in which the lethal and mutagen effects of ultraviolet light are eliminated; and post -replication repair, in which the primary lesions are not repaired, but the gaps in one daughter duplex are filled in by incorporation of portions of the other (undamaged) daughter duplex.  Excision repair and post-replication repair are sometimes referred to as "dark repair" because they do not require light.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: HI Billie\n\nDoes Herbalife work? Definately gets a YES vote from me. I used the Herbalife Advanced Protien Plus program 2 years ago to lose 30 pounds. I lost those 30 pounds in 2 months and have not gained any of it back.\n\nIt is a simple to follow program that is firmly based in providing proper Nutrition. \n\nPeople tend to get excited and tell you it is no good because it is packaged and sold as a Weight Loss Product. Really it is a Food. \n\nWhen you look at the label on most "Diet" or "Weight Loss" product you wil see a statement to the effect of "use with proper diet and exercise" Herbalife is differant because it is "proper diet". The combination of 2 shakes a day and 1 meal a day provide the Nutririon you need with out the extra calories. I thin kof it as a "Space Age" food. Easy to prepare, complete nutrition, and tasty.\n\nMost other "Diets" have the problem that when you cut the calories and fat you also cut the important Nutrients. So when you stop your diet you quickly regain your weight and sometimes more.\n\nIn my opinion Herbalife is only a waste of your time and money if you are NOT committed to losing the weight. Follow the planb and work with you coach and you will do fine	Health

question_title: What can my 11 year old daughter use for a little acne on her nose? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If this is just a little acne, there is no need to go spending a lot of money on Proactive or other expinceive products. What she needs to do is develop a habbit of good hygeian at an early age so the problom doesn't worson durring teen years. This will also teach her responcoblitly.\n\nPimples are a scourge. They come suddenly during the night attacking us in our sleep. Sometimes during the middle of the day they will come they come and you don't know until you have said good afternoon to an office full of people. You go in the bathroom and see it and you think to yourself I can't believe I was out in the public looking like this. Not anymore. Mother Nature is on your side. For every chemical there is a natural that is it's equal. Of course the natural way takes a little time, but usually it is cheaper and better for you. \n\nLemons, tomatoes and witch hazel are all proven to fight and keep acne at bay. Lemons and tomatoes are both fruits, yes fruits, with a second quality not known to all humankind. What you want to do is cut it open. Cutting it in fours goes a long way. Take each piece of lemon or tomato and rub it on your face. You may have a little something left on your face. Just leave it there. It's for your own good. They will make pimples disappear almost overnight. It they don't disappear they will be smaller the next time you check. Lemon is also good for removing scars. That means any pimples you popped in angst that left a scar will go away over time. Lemon contains acid so it's like having an acid peel thing going, but not. Your skin will be so clear you can set that makeup aside for special occasions. \n\nAnother thing that works is keeping your face wiped off. You don't really need soap. All you want is for your pores to stay closed. How you say. Water. Yes, water. Bottled or tap water. All it has to be is cold. Wet a face rag with cold water. I hate to have cold anything on me, but I hear pain is beauty. Wipe your face with a cold wet rag everyday before setting out for the day. Wipe it again went you get in and once more before bed. Your pores will stay closed. You will keep the irritation of the skin on your face down and it should be pretty clear. Also try to remember to keep your hands out of your face. Your fingertips and nails hold a lot of germs and touch a lot of dirt. Putting them in your face increases the chance of irritation thus creating those hideous pimples. \n\nWitch Hazel is a natural way to clear ones face, too. It is an astringent. Yes, an astringent, just like the other products claim to contain. Witch Hazel is also cold almost anywhere you store it so it's like using water only it pulls impurities up out of your skin. Your will apply this anywhere from two to three times a day. Before bed is really good. As you sleep your body goes through a lot of things I am not scientifically equipped to elaborate on or prove. I just notice that if you do your beauty regimens at night and go to bed when you wake up in the morning you should be very pleased with the results when you wake up in the morning. And it is very cheap because almost not one buys it. Hurry up before they figure it out! \n\n\n~Hope this helps! and good luck with your daughter	Health

question_title: Cananyone give me a complete overview of the ADD drug Adderol? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What is Adderall / Adderall XR?: Adderall is a stimulant specifically a cocktail of amphetamine salts.\n  \nOther Forms: Extended Release (XR)\n\nWhat are the FDA Approved Uses of Adderall / Aderall XR: \n\nAdderall was approved in February 1996 to treat Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children.  \n\nImmediate-release Adderall is also approved for narcolepsy and exogenous obesity.  \n\nAdderall XR was approved in August of 2004 to treat ADHD in adults.\n\nOff-Label Uses of Adderall: Depression.  Probably others, stay tuned for studies and more potential off-label uses.\n\nAdderall's pros and cons:\n\nPros: A tried and true way to treat ADD/ADHD and narcolepsy.  \nLike most amphetamines it doesn't have much in the way of side effects, fewer than the methylphenidates (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta).\n\n \n\nCons: Those triplicate prescriptions are a pain in the ass to deal with.  If you have any history of drug abuse, the odds are you'll never get an Adderall prescription no matter how much you've cleaned up your act and how helpful it will be to you.  \nBecause it's an amphetamine it might be a little too much fun to use for some people. \n\nAdderall's Typical Side Effects: The usual for stimulants -  headache, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, insomnia, constipation, weight loss, heart palpitations, raised blood pressure, dizziness, horniness.  Generally everything clears up up after a couple weeks except the constipation, weight loss, increased blood pressure and increased libido.  So unless you have blood pressure issues and/or real problems with being too thin and/or too horny already I'm sure you can live with the typical side effects.\n\nFor tips on how to cope with these side effects, please see our side effects page.\nThese aren't all the side effects possible, just the most popular ones.\n\n \n\nAdderall's Not So Common Side Effects:  Triggering a manic reaction.  More often than not this happens when someone is misdiagnosed as only having ADD/ADHD when they are also bipolar.  Although you won't find "manic reaction" as a side effect anywhere in the PI sheet, you'll find every symptom of mania listed instead.  This is a great CYA (Cover Your Ass) move by Shire for the doctors prescribing it.  Hey, it doesn't trigger mania, it just causes a bunch of symptoms that are like mania!  I had one person write me  about her  bipolar disorder that was in complete remission for 14 years getting completely hosed by an Adderall prescription from a doctor who must have been convinced she only had ADD/ADHD.  Other not-so-common side effects are tics, twitches and exacerbation or unmasking of Tourette's or similar syndromes, depression and screwing with your menstrual cycle.      \nThese may or may not happen to you don't, so don't be surprised one way or the other.\n\nAdderall's Freaky Rare Side Effects: Amphetamines don't have much in the way of freaky rare side effects.  I may dig up something on PubMed later.  The closest thing I can find is the combination of increased libido and impotence.  \nYou aren't going to get these. I promise.\n\nAdderall's Suicide Risk:  All psychiatric and neurological meds have a potential suicide risk.  I'll get back to you on the specifics with Adderall.\n\nInteresting Stuff Your Doctor Probably Won't Tell You: Since ADD/ADHD is pretty much part of being bipolar, in some cases there really isn't anything wrong in taking Adderall if you're bipolar and taking a good mood stabilizer of some kind.  The problem is if you're taking lithium don't expect to lose any weight.  Or stay awake for that matter.  In fact, Adderall may not work at all when combined with lithium.  So if lithium is the mood stabilizer that works for you, you're stuck with your ADD/ADHD symptoms if Strattera (atomoxetine) and/or Provigil (modafinil) didn't cut it for you.\n\nMixing booze and Adderall, or any stimula	Health

I didn't cum in her coz i masturbated on her waaay before I felt like I was cumming (it took a while actually before it came). I'm afraid she might get pregnant from the precum. What are the chances of her getting preggy? [SEP] best_answer: If it is near her time of ovulation, then there is a good chance.  You don't mention how long her cycles are, but if she has a 28 day cycle then there is a good chance.  Any contact of semen on or near the vaginal opening can result in pregnancy.  If there was only pre-ejaculate, it is still possible as it still contains sperm,  If her next period is late, her best bet is to wait at least two weeks, then have a blood test done by her doctor as this is the most accurate way of testing.

If not treated out of ignorance then what are the extreme harmful effects of the disease? Can any medical professional guide me about this disease as to help me approach the doctor to be guided properly to overcome the problem? [SEP] best_answer: I know a few people with thyroid problems and it does require you to take a drug called "synthroid" for the rest of your life. It really isn't a big deal at all, hopefully you have an over-active thyroid in which case you won't have to worry about the side effect of weight gain as you do with an under active one. Your primary care doctor should be able to feel if your thyroid is enlarged at the base of your neck, he may or may not refer you to a specialist, depends on your doctor, some primary care doctors can treat the condition. It's really nothing life threatening and shouldn't really effect much except possible weight gain or loss, being very tired all the time and other minor problems. Good luck and call your doctor, again, it's not much to worry about :)	Health

question_title: For all of you complaining about losing weight, have you ever tried exercising and not eating fast food? [SEP] question_content: seriously, if you just stopped eating junk food, especially fast food, and even started a 3-4 day a week exercise program, you'd lose all the weight you needed.  No need for all the 'point diet systems'.  Losing weight is common sense isn't it?  If you feel like you're stuffing yourself with crap everyday, it's very likely you are, and your body will show that.  If you discipline yourself to not eat junk everytime your body craves it, and instead find a good meal replacer (protein bar for example), you'd be amazed.\n\nAll you really need is common sense about diet, and a decent workout program, and then you'd have no need buying unnecessary get rich scheme diet programs that prey on the naive.

question_title: Expert in Attention Deficit Disorder in children in Atlanta/Marietta area? [SEP] question_content: Who would be considerred (or how would I find) the leading (in terms\n\nof board certifications and recognized by the medical community)\n\nAttention Deficit Disorder specialist in the Metro Atlanta, Georgia\n\narea for assessing children with ADD and for reccomending action plans\n\nfor education, medication etc… ? [SEP] best_answer: Specialists who are able to treat ADHD and ADD include child\npsychiatrists and psychologists, developmental/behavioral\npediatricians, or behavioral neurologists and clinical social workers.\nIf medication is needed, then the best professional would be a\npsychiatrist, pediatrician or neurologists. Psychologists and social\nworkers are unable to prescribe medication, although some work in\nconjunction with professionals that can.\n\n“The family can start by talking with the child's pediatrician or\ntheir family doctor. Some pediatricians may do the assessment\nthemselves, but often they refer the family to an appropriate mental\nhealth specialist they know and trust. In addition, state and local\nagencies that serve families and children, as well as some of the\nvolunteer organizations listed at the end of this document, can help\nidentify appropriate specialists.”\n\nSpecialtyCan Diagnose ADHDCan prescribe medication, if\nneededProvides counseling or training\nPsychiatristsyesyesyes\nPsychologistsyesnoyes\nPediatricians or Family Physiciansyesyesno\nNeurologistsyesyesno\nClinical Social workersyesnoyes\n\n\n\n“There are several types of specialists qualified to diagnose and\ntreat ADHD. Child psychiatrists are doctors who specialize in\ndiagnosing and treating childhood mental and behavioral disorders. A\npsychiatrist can provide therapy and prescribe any needed medications.\nChild psychologists are also qualified to diagnose and treat ADHD.\nThey can provide therapy for the child and help the family develop\nways to deal with the disorder. But psychologists are not medical\ndoctors and must rely on the child's physician to do medical exams and\nprescribe medication. Neurologists, doctors who work with disorders of\nthe brain and nervous system, can also diagnose ADHD and prescribe\nmedicines. But unlike psychiatrists and psychologists, neurologists\nusually do not provide therapy for the emotional aspects of the\ndisorder.”\nhttp://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/adhd.cfm#diag\n\nChoosing a doctor\n==================\n“One of the most important decisions parents make is which doctor to\nchoose for their child.

question_title: how you catch MRSA? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium (germ).( MRSA) It is often just called 'S.aureus' or 'staph'. S. aureus bacteria are often found on the skin and in the nose of healthy people. In fact, about 3 in 10 people have S. aureus bacteria living on (colonizing) their skin. These people are called S. aureus 'carriers'. In healthy people who are carriers, S. aureus is usually harmless.\nHowever, S. aureus bacteria sometimes invade the skin to cause infection. This is more likely if you have a cut or graze which can allow bacteria to get under the surface of the skin. S. aureus is the cause of skin infections such as boils, pimples, impetigo, skin abscesses, and is a common cause of wound infections. \nIn some people, S. aureus can sometimes get into the bloodstream and travel to internal parts of the body to cause more serious infections. For example, blood poisoning (septicaemia), lung infection (pneumonia), bone infection (osteomyelitis), heart valve infection (endocarditis), etc. These serious infections are more likely to occur in people who are already unwell or debilitated, or who have a poor immune system. These infections need to be treated with antibiotics.	Health

question_title: Arthritis pain, question posted twelve minutes ago, please refer to this question, too much to repeat, HELP? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are several factors here:  your weight and age; your general health.  Most middle aged people will have arthritis in some shape or form.  Having a buldging disc would be pressing on the nerves in your spine causing pain to your lower extremeties.  I would try to resolve that problem first.\n\nIf you have pain medications that you can take, take them WITH FOOD to prevent irritation of the stomach.  Also, give your antidepressants time to work.  Stop looking for an excuse to get off of the medications.  That's what they are for..to relieve you of your symptoms.  Besides if you wait to take your meds when you are in extreme pain, they won't help at all.  So, pain management on a timed schedule is recommended.  If you're able, take tylenol between doses for breakthrough pain.\n\nNext check out your mattress; do you need a new one?  Something firm will help your back, or put a board between the mattress and box spring.  Sleep with a pillow that will cradle your head and allow your body to be in a natural position.  I like a "buckwheat" pillow.  Your body should be in the same posture laying down as it is standing up.\n\nIf you are overweight, try to lose some weight.  For every pound you exert 40 lbs. of pressure on your back and legs/feet.  Try a back brace during the day.  \n\nAbove all, try relaxing and learn about visualizing and breathing techniques to help you do that.  What about your husband?  Keeping him up all night isn't helping the situation.  He's as sleep deprived as you are!  Maybe you need to be in separate rooms for a little while.  Try nice relaxing baths or running the shower on your back before you go to sleep.\n\nI'm afraid arthritis is one of those things we have to learn to live with.  I take aspirin (with food) and get better relief than anything else.  God Bless.	Health

Is that bad? What could it mean? I'm 15 and I'm not on any medicines and I don't have any illnesses.

Rather than push with your face and neck, try to push with your butt.   If you fall over or pass out go see a doctor, or if you just want to make sure, however it sounds like what i have just suggested.  Also, don't forget to breathe, its very important.  Eat more fiber.

question_title: i am 38 weeks pregnaunt and have just started getting terrible leg cramps in my sleep what can i do about it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This sounds very familiar to me!  The same thing happened to me in my pregnancies #2 and #3.  Here's what my doctor advised me:  first, the cramps are a sign that your body needs more potassium.  Eat more bananas; that will help restore the missing potassium to your body.  Second, when you get into bed and the cramps start, what you do is (this may be hard to describe in written words; wish I could just show you how) straighten the cramping leg all the way out, while pulling your toes in, toward you.  In other words, you want to straighten your leg, pushing your heel "out" as far as you can while pulling your toes "in" as far as you can.  Hold that for a few seconds, until the cramp goes away.  This works; I know it did for me.	Health

Alcohol slows the metabolism and dehydrates your system.\n\nEat smaller portions for meals and eat 5-6 times a day. Drink water when you have the urge to snack, this not only supresses the hunger, it stimulates your metabolism.\n\nA typical day:\nBrekfast — bowl of Cheerios\nSnack — banana and one packet of outmeal\nLunch — turkey sandwich, no cheese or mayo and a salad, fat-free dressing\nSnack — apple and a hardboiled egg\nDinner — grilled chicken and steamed veggies\n\nIn between to fight off hunger slam a large glass of water.\n\nRun 3-5 miles a day, 5 times a week.\n\nWatch the weight slip off...

[SEP] question_content: My friend said I am not capable of being lazy, but I know I lack motivation (i.e. w/ work) [SEP] best_answer: There can be a difference.  If it has to do with work it's probably not that you're lazy, you just haven't found something you're passionate about or enjoy doing so you lack motivation to work hard at it.  If you're making an effort with your life then you're not lazy, but if you're not feeling motivated in what you're doing right now, you haven't found that thing that you're passionate about.  You'll eventually find it and that's good that you're friend feels that you're not capable of being lazy.  Sometimes people get into slumps and need time to come out of them.

question_title: Any young people with trouble swallowing? [SEP] question_content: I am only 34 and I have trouble swallowing.

When I swallow I feel something going up and then returning to its place (like part of the esophagus or something).  Does anyone else who is young (under 50) have a similar problem? [SEP] best_answer: Sometimes, when I eat very dry foods eg rice, it literally gets stuck in my chest, so I have to drink and make sure I take tiny bits and eat slow.   Acid reflux actually causes that feeling you mention...food or acid actually pushes up, opens the flap of your esophogus and food rises up.\n\nTry to eat less salty foods, foods with less preservatives, cut out pop and coffee and eat smaller meals and lots more plain cooked veggies and fresh fruit.  Avoid foods that cause you acid reflux.  For me GRAVY is the worst.  I don't get heartburn often but when I do it stays for hours.  \n\nI actually take a spoonful of vinegar, chase it down with water and it cures my heartburn better than any medication can.  Try and see if that helps.  Avoid lying down after eating.  If you can go for a walk and allow your food to digest.  \n\nI dont' know what to suggest as I know a lot of people that have acid reflux and nothing seems to help.  They do however eat a lot of the wrong types of foods which I think is a major cause.  Cut the spices and rich sauces out and have yogurts and soya milk and more healthier food choices and see if it makes a difference.

Here are a few options:\n\n1. tretinoin cream (commonly known by the trade name Retin-A)\n2. laser therapy\n\nYour health insurance plan will not cover "cosmetic" procedures so you'll probably want to find out what this will cost.

question_title: what are the natural ways to cure and prevent varicose veins? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I'm not quite sure what you mean by natural because, technically, treating anything would require a medicine, which is artificially made regardless of what it is. Unless one just left they're own natural immune system to take care of it naturally.\n\nHowever I just found a site which states that "self-help measures — such as exercising, losing weight, not wearing tight clothes, elevating your legs and avoiding long periods of standing or sitting — can ease pain and prevent varicose veins from getting worse."\n\n~Phoenix	Health
question_title: Does Genetics really determine your height? [SEP] question_content: Because my brother is taller than both my parents...I wanna know if i can still grow im taller than my mom but not my dad im 15 yrs old. Is it possible to still grow like 4 inches? [SEP] best_answer: Genetics will predetermine your height RANGE, but not your exact height. Proper nutrition, sufficient protein and calcium will do that.\n\nLook at the Hindus. Their upper caste, the Brahmin, despite being able to afford the best medical care and the best foods, because they eschew meat, are shorties. Average adult male height, 5'5".\n\nIn the USA, where meat is a staple part of a diet, average adult male height is 5'9".\n\nSo, if you want a few inches and you're not done growing, eat red meat! The muscle flesh of mammals contain four amino acids not found anywhere else in nature, nor can the body synthesize them from other nutrients. These four amino acids are the necessary components for proteins that aid both bone growth and muscle growth. Result; greater height. \n\nJust make that meat as UNfatty as you can. Trim off all the fat before cooking. Use lean cuts to start with. And stay away from hamburgers. Due to its original positions in the cow, that meat contains fatty acids you don't want!	Health

question_title: Is three years a long time to live with Stage 4 breast cancer? [SEP] question_content: My mom died of stage 4 breast cancer almost two months ago.  She was diagnosed over 3 years ago. [SEP] best_answer: Yes, it is.  With stage IV breast cancer the choice of chemotherapy treatment depends on the patient's goal of treatment. If the goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, it may be more desirable to select a chemotherapy treatment with minimal side effects. On the other hand, if the goal of treatment is to attempt to cure the cancer, treatment with more aggressive chemotherapy regimens is opted.  Either way, all the new advanced drug therapies have recorded average survival rates of fewer than 24 months—so your mom sure had a passion for life!  Here are some recent trial findings:\n\nET (Ellence® (epirubicin) and Taxotere® (docetaxel)): In a randomized clinical trial comparing ET to FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) as first-line therapy for stage IV breast cancer, the response rate to ET was 63%, compared to 31% for FEC. The average time to cancer progression was 8.6 months for patients treated with ET, compared to 6.1 months for patients treated with FEC.\n\nTAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide): In an attempt to further improve treatment, a third drug has been added to the combination of doxorubicin and docetaxel and evaluated as initial treatment for patients with stage IV breast cancer. Two years following treatment, nearly 60% of patients were still alive. The average survival had not yet been established past two years following treatment.\n\nAT (doxorubicin and paclitaxel): A recent clinical trial evaluated the use of AT in patients with stage IV breast cancer. Patients received AT or a common chemotherapy combination consisting of fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC). The results of the two groups were then directly compared. The average survival time was 23.3 months for patients receiving AT versus 18.3 months for patients receiving FAC.\n\nTaxotere® (docetaxel) and Xeloda® (capecitabine): Researchers conducted a clinical trial to directly compare docetaxel plus capecitabine to docetaxel alone in the treatment of patients with stage IV breast cancer. Patients who received treatment with docetaxel/capecitabine were more likely to experience anti-cancer responses, have a longer time to cancer progression and survive longer when compared to patients treated with docetaxel alone. One year following therapy, 57% of patients treated with docetaxel/capecitabine had survived, compared to only 47% of patients treated with docetaxel alone.\n\nGemzar® (gemcitabine): Recently, clinical trials indicated that gemcitabine and paclitaxel is an effective treatment option for initial therapy of stage IV breast cancer. In one trial, researchers from France treated 36 patients with stage IV breast cancer or locally advanced breast cancer with gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Following therapy, approximately 42% of patients had an anti-cancer response. The average time to cancer progression was approximately 7.5 months.	Health
question_title: Alzheimers? [SEP] question_content: What are some of the symptoms, treatment, and what is the life expectancy of someone who suffers from Alzheimers? [SEP] best_answer: Alzheimer Disease Symptoms\nAlzheimer disease begins with a mild, slowly worsening memory loss. Many older people fear that they have Alzheimer disease because they can’t find their eyeglasses or remember someone’s name. \n\n\nThese very common problems are most often due to a much less serious condition involving slowing of mental processes with age. \n\n\nMedical professionals call some of these cases benign senescent forgetfulness, age-related memory loss, or minimal cognitive impairment. \n\n\nWhile these conditions are a nuisance, they do not significantly impair a person’s ability to learn new information, solve problems, or carry out everyday activities, as Alzheimer disease does. \n Early warning signs of Alzheimer disease include memory problems such as the following: \n\nDifficulty recognizing familiar people or things (not just forgetting a name) \n\n\nTrouble remembering recent events or activities \n\n\nInability to solve simple arithmetic problems \n\n\nProblems finding the right word for a familiar thing \n\n\nDifficulty performing familiar tasks \nAs the disease progresses, however, the symptoms become more serious. They may include the following: \n\nInability to carry out everyday activities, often called activities of daily living, without help - Bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding, using the toilet \n\n\nInability to think clearly or solve problems \n\n\nDifficulties understanding or learning new information \n\n\nProblems with communication - Speaking, reading, writing \n\n\nIncreasing disorientation and confusion even in familiar surroundings \n\n\nGreater risk of falls and accidents due to poor judgment and confusion \n In the later stages of the disease, the symptoms are severe and devastating: \n\nComplete loss of short- and long-term memory – May be unable to recognize even close relatives and friends \n\n\nComplete dependence on others for activities of daily living \n\n\nSevere disorientation – May walk away from home and get lost \n\n\nBehavior or personality changes – May become anxious, hostile, or aggressive \n\n\nLoss of mobility – May be unable to walk or move from place to place without help \n\n\nImpairment of other movements such as swallowing – Increases risk of malnutrition, choking, and aspiration (inhaling foods and beverages, saliva, or mucus into lungs) \nThese symptoms typically develop over a period of years. The disease progresses at different rates in different people. \n  \nEmotional problems such as depression and anxiety are common in older people. These problems can leave elderly people feeling confused or forgetful. Because these emotional problems are reversible in many people, it is important that they be distinguished from Alzheimer disease and other brain disorders. \n\nAlzheimer Disease Treatment\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. Treatment focuses on relieving and slowing down the progress of the symptoms, behavior changes, and complications. \n \nAn individual with AD should always be under medical care. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual’s health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with AD. Treatment most often consists of medications and nondrug treatments such as behavior therapy.\n\n\nSelf-Care at Home\nMany individuals with Alzheimer disease in the early and intermediate stages are able to live independently. \n\n\nWith regular checks by a local relative or friend, they are able to live for some time without constant supervision. \n\n\nThose who have difficulty with activities of daily living require at least part-time help from a family caregiver or home health aide. \n\n\nVisiting nurses can make sure that these individuals take their medications as directed. \n\n\nHousekeeping help is available for those who cannot keep up with household chores. \nOther affected individu	Health
question_title: Why do dentists create so much pain at such a high price?  A little sadistic?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think it all depends on who your dentist is.  Many dentists nowadays will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable, and there is the option of sedation dentistry which is more expensive but I can imagine it's worth it.

Not fun when you are 13 years old and have braces and sensitivity to temperature inside your mouth as it is, let alone pain.

Besides knowing about Medicare and community services available from Medicaid, these Agencies often have programs to help support caregivers. When you call, ask about the National Family Caregivers Support Program. Let them know you are a caregiver in need of some help right now.\n\nThere is an Area Agency on Aging where you live--since this is a national network. These groups aren't selling anything! The staff there will visit with you and guide you to information you need to answer your questions. Since they talk with seniors every day--and answer lots of questions--they will know the "scoop" on the services available that might help you where you live. \n\nYou can call toll-free 1-800-677-1116 to find how to contact the Area Agency on Aging serving you. I'm confident that you will most likely find the people there friendly and very helpful.\n\nIf you do contact your local Area Agency on Aging and like the help that they give you and your grandfather, let your local county officials and your folks in Congress know. Area Agencies on Aging don't have big budgets --their funding comes from the Older Americans Act which hasn't seen increases in years! \n\nHope this helps! Good luck and best wishes	Health

Happened last weekend (15 years later) when I took Tylenol Severe Allergy for sneezing, runny nose/eyes.. Didn't realize it had same ingredient as Benadryl. People say its impossible to be allergic to an antihistamine.  BUT MY FACE SWELLS! I also have allergies to penicillin, aspirin and chocolate. I have dermographism (get big red whelps if I get scratched). I get huge whelps from flea, mosquito or ant bites. Two weekends ago I got 3 fire ant bites on my foot and spent the whole day with hives all over my body - should have gone to ER but didn't - even had tight throat and chest pains. Something isn't right, but what?  (Going to the doctor tomorrow to get a referral to whatever kind of doctor treats this.) In the past doctors have just said they don't know what's wrong with me... [SEP] best_answer: Well it is definitely possible to be allergic to just about any medication.  Not too many people are allergic to the actual medication  (Diphenhydramine HCL) in Benadryl...but they are out there.  Check out this website.  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/12633/allergic_to_antihistamines_my_story.html\nThat being said, a LOT of people are allergic to the dye they put in Benadryl....which is why they have a dye-free version of at least the children's liquid.\nIt sounds like you did the right thing, seeing your doctor for a referral to an allergist.

I’d really love it if anyone could tell me what's in there? Like when you go there what activities do/don’t you get to do? [SEP] best_answer: Rehabs vary widely in their length and scope of services - and costs. Most are like little worlds unto themselves, where the person who has checked themselves in goes through daily counseling, therapy, and support group meetings. Participants are usually prohibited from having communication with the outside world (via phone calls, emails, and/or visits) to a large degree, for obvious reasons. Rehabs can last from one week to a year or more, depending on the severity of the person's problem. People who enter long-term rehabs are usually pretty committed to recovery, as the experience is very costly, and difficult. Coming to terms with one's demons is a life-altering experience....one would hope, anyway.\n\nbtw, I am only aware of rehabs for substance abuse (drugs & alcohol). If the "anger management" thing you are referring to is Michael Richards, he is not going into a rehab. He is going for outpatient counseling. That's completely different than a rehab.	Health

question_title: wat r the food stuffs one shldnt take whose sufferig frm hypothyroidism? [SEP] question_content: in females? [SEP] best_answer: You can sometimes alleviate hypothyroidism by reducing the amount of food suspected for depressing the thyroid function: Brussel sprouts, broccoli, corn oil, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, radishes, rutabaga, soy, soy products and turnips. However, these food types are valuable in many ways, so it is probably not wise to cut them out totally. Also try to avoid artificial ingredients like the sweetener aspartame, conserving additives and fluoride.\n\nChanging out mercury dental fillings and avoiding mercury or heavy metal exposure may help to ameliorate the condition.\n\nYou may also alleviate the condition by eating food that stimulates the thyroid function according to practical experience: Chia seed, dulse, fish from the ocean, flax seed, pumpkin seed, seaweed, coconut and brewer yeast.\n\nYou can find nutritional supplements to help for hypothyroidism. The compositions of these products vary:\n\nThey may contain building materials that the thyroid uses to make its hormones, for example: iodine, acetyl-L-tyrosine or L-phenylalanine. \n\nThey may also contain vitamins and minerals that stimulate the mechanism of hormone production by being a part of necessary enzymes, or by helping the absorption of the ingredients that hormones are made from, like: Magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper and vitamin E.\n\nThey may furthermore contain constituents that stimulate tissue regeneration by being part of tissue building enzymes, and thus helping to restore a degraded thyroid, for example: Folic acid or folate, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid or pantothenate), B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (cyanocobalamin) and molybdenum.

question_title: Why do i do bad things when i know theyre bad, but i cant stop? [SEP] question_content: Why do i tell myself ill stop smokin, or poppin pills, or dealin or any of that, but i always end up doin it again? [SEP] best_answer: Things like that sometimes seem easy to do, and get away with, but the repercussions can be burdensome.  Also, they tend to glue you into a mindset and a lifestyle that may not be the best for your future.  Putting yourself into active things, oftentimes using your body instead of your mind, is a good way to lose those feelings that can creep up on you and tempt you.  A job, a hobby, a group, frienships, family time, are all good avenues.  Sometimes leaving a situation you are in is a viable alternative, with friends, groups, etc.  Life is not perfect, so finding a way to not feel totally out of whack when they happen can keep you level-headed.  Forgiveness also keeps you from feeling like your carrying the load around with you.  Also, the take some of that edge that we all fell like we are the most important thing around, and putting more selflessness, doing things for others even when you might not feel like it, can adjust your attitude toward feeling less alone.  Guard your mind, what you put in it, or what you allow others to put in it, because this will affect how you think, and what you think about.  Positive action is often the best thing for emotions that want to burst.  How you act affects how you think, and vice-versa.  In time, they become more a part of what you are and, hopefully, what you want to ideally become.  Keep a your head up.  Best to you!	Health

question_title: if your gums are starting to receed because of improper brushing, is it reversible? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If your gums have receded, it is sometimes possible to graft tissue to cover a portion of the exposed root surface and to reinforce the fragile, receding gum tissue to protect from further recession. Also common to receded gums is sensitivity that results from the exposed root surface. Your dentist can apply medications in the office, and /or recommend products for you to use at home that will help reduce sensitivity of these root surfaces and help protect the now vulnerable root surface from decay.\n\nGums that recede to expose the root surfaces of teeth is a common condition in adults over the age of 40. Many consider it to be just a sign of aging, and in some cases it is essentially that – often the result of wear and tear or years of aggressive tooth brushing. However, sometimes receding gums can be a sign of something more.\n\nIn many cases, receding gums are caused by periodontal disease (gum disease). Three out of four adults have some form of it, and in most cases, it doesn't cause any pain and goes unnoticed. \n\nCommon in adults, gum disease starts when bacteria containing plaque builds up on the teeth and gums. When the plaque is not removed daily, it produces toxins that irritate and inflame the gums. Eventually the inflammatory process destroys the gum tissues, causing them to separate from the tooth and form spaces called pockets. The pockets hold more bacteria, which only compounds the problem.\n\nIn the early stages, gum disease (gingivitis), marked by red or swollen gums that bleed easily, is reversible and can be detected and treated by your dentist or dental hygienist during regular check-ups. As the disease progresses (periodontitis), it can destroy the bone and soft tissues that support the teeth. In advanced stages of periodontitis, teeth can become loose, fall out or have to be removed by a dentist. In fact, periodontitis is the culprit in 70 percent of tooth loss in adults over 40.\n\nThe good news is these gum conditions can be prevented by good daily oral hygiene habits. Receding gums are best prevented by brushing with a soft toothbrush, using mild-to-moderate pressure and small circular or very short back and forth motions. Avoid hard toothbrush bristles and long horizontal brush strokes with excessive pressure on your toothbrush.\n\nRemember, with daily brushing and flossing and regular visits to the dentist, adults can look forward to keeping their natural teeth throughout their life.\n\n\nGL\nThe only people with whom you should try to get even are those who have helped you.  ~John E.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Your continued donations keep Wikipedia running!    \nFugue state\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nThe DSM-IV defines Dissociative Fugue as:\n\nSudden, unexpected travel away from home or one's customary place of work, with inability to recall one's past, \nConfusion about personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity, \nOr, significant distress or impairment. \nThe Merck Manual [1] defines Dissociative Fugue as:\n\nOne or more episodes of amnesia in which the inability to recall some or all of one's past and either the loss of one's identity or the formation of a new identity occur with sudden, unexpected, purposeful travel away from home. \nIn support of this definition, the Merck Manual [1] further defines Dissociative amnesia as:\n\nAn inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness. \nIn the field of psychology, a fugue state is usually defined by the term dissociative fugue and from the definitions above it is etiologically related to dissociative amnesia (which in popular culture is usually simply called amnesia, the state where someone completely forgets who they are).\n\nA fugue state is therefore similar in nature to the concept of dissociative identity disorder (DID) (formerly called multiple-personality disorder) although DID is widely understood to have its conception in a long-term life event (such as a traumatic childhood), where sufficient time is given for alternate personality representations to form and take hold. Sudden neurological damage would thus seem to fit more closely the onset of a fugue state.\n\nAs the person experiencing a fugue state may have recently suffered an amnesic onset—perhaps a head trauma, or the reappearance of an event or person representing an earlier life trauma—the emergence of a "new" personality seems to be for some, a logical apprehension of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the terminology fugue state may carry a slight linguistic distinction from dissociative fugue, the former implying a greater degree of motion. For the purposes of this article then, a fugue state would occur while one is acting out a dissociative fugue.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Prevalence and onset \n2 In fiction \n3 Treatment and Prognosis \n4 References \n \n\n\n[edit]\nPrevalence and onset\nIt has been estimated that approximately 0.2 percent of the population experiences dissociative fugue, although prevalence increases significantly following a stressful life event, such as wartime experience or some other disaster[1]. Other life stressors may trigger a fugue state, such as financial difficulties, personal problems or legal issues. Unlike a dissociative identity disorder, a fugue is usually considered to be a malingering disorder, resolving to remove the experiencer from responsibility for their actions, or from situations imposed upon them by others. In this sense, fugues seem to be the result of a repressed wish-fulfillment. Similar to dissociative amnesia, the fugue state usually affects personal memories from the past, rather than encyclopedic or abstract knowledge. A fugue state therefore does not imply any overt seeming or "crazy" behaviour.\n\n[edit]\nIn fiction\nNurse Betty: a 2000 comedy film depicting a waitress who experiences a fugue state from the stress of murder. \nThe main character in Lost Highway can also be described as going through a fugue dissociative state. \nIn the end of David Eddings' novel Regina's Song, Twink's psychological breakdown is described as a fugue state. \nSiegfried Schtauffen, a main character in the Soul series of fighting games, goes through a dissociative fugue state following the unintentional murder of his father. He convinces himself that it was not he who killed his father, and does not recall the truth until Soul Edge is sealed for the first time. \nIn Dan Sim	Health

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You MUST report them to the Better Business, Labor Department and get an attorney.  In the event you are an illegal immigrant it would not matter that you have to put up with your employer's failure to pay you.  Get all the documentation you can get.  If you don't have paper documents see if you can get a hold of office e-mails, memos, phone record's etc.. Also try to get your employer to put in writing the reason's why the company is in trouble and why you aren' being paid and by when do they expect to pay you.  Also try to find out if this has happened before to others before and try to get their story.  Keep dates of all conversations with your employer and try to get them to put in writing any agreements and to sign them.	Business & Finance

question_title: What is the best way to market an on-line Irish gift shop? [SEP] question_content: We are a non-profit organization that started our on line shop one year ago.  It is growing, but we are going to redesign the site.  We'll be adding more items and want to know what we can do to get our website out there.  Please check it out and give any suggestions.  wwww.emmetsburgirishgifts.com. [SEP] best_answer: Getting more visitors is one thing; and turning those visitors into buyers is another thing. If you are running an online store, you need to do BOTH.\n\nTo get visitors to your website:\n\n1. Offer the best products. Sounds like a no-brainer, but your products are your best advertisement - if visitors love your products, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. Some sites that accept free press releases are PRWeb.com, PowerHomeBiz.com \n\n5. Advertise only if it will get you targeted traffic. Whether you use pay per click advertising or buying text links or buying banner ads, carefully monitor your return on investment. If possible, get metrics to tell you whether the PPC traffic is actually converting into sale. Google Analytics can show that to you if you are using Google Adwords.\n\nWith regards to getting the visitors to buy more stuff, here are some tips from the article "10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm :\n\n1. Provide quality products or content. Good conversion rates start with quality and a great value proposition.\n\n2. Grab their attention immediately. Put your most important and succinct statement of what your website offer above the scroll (e.g. sales pitch, order button)\n\n3. It’s about the customer, all the time. Visitors will respond to your offer only if you can successfully make the case that your website exists for them, to provide them what they need and offer a solution to their problem. \n\n4. Design your page specifically for your target audience. \n\n5. Make it easy for them. Make the ordering process easy. An indicator of how well your process works is the ratio of abandoned shopping baskets to total orders – if this is higher than 10 percent, then it indicates that the online ordering process you have implemented is ineffective, or takes too long. \n\n6. Improve your site's copy. More than a tool to inform users of what the site is all about, the best type of web site copy explains to a visitor how your product will fulfill their wants, needs and desires. \n\n7. Think active! Use active voice to keep your customers motivated and fully engaged in the sales process. \n\n8. Increase trust factor. Trust is a key element of success on the Web. Visitors purchase only from websites they know will safeguard their information, provide them with quality service, and offer them products that are value for their money. \n\n9. Build customer loyalty. Loyalty marketing is a proven technique to increase conversion rates and improving bottom line.\n10. Study your metrics carefully. You must have a set of key performance indicators that you can look at every day to understand the pulse of your business.	Business & Finance

question_title: Financial Question? [SEP] question_content: I own a home, but am renting it out right now because I've been trying to pay off some high debts. However - it's been a year now and am anxious to get back in my house. Should I continue paying off my debts or just move into my house and hope I can continue to pay them off along with the mortgage payment (and water / electricity bills)? [SEP] best_answer: Straight up my friend, do the math, as that will tell you the answer.  If you're paying rent right now, unless its much cheaper than your mortgage, it's not helping your situation.  If you're not paying rent, then you can only afford to move back in if your debts have been reduced to a level where you can now handle them, and your mortgage.\n\nOtherwise, my advice to you is to keep plugging away at your other debts... home doesn't feel like home if you have to go through financial hardship to be there.  Good luck!	Business & Finance
question_title: do our dreams mean anyting? [SEP] question_content: is there a way to interpret dreams? i find many of my dreams coming true? is it just coincidence or something more to it?

I've seen several dream interpretation books but the meanings of the symbols vary greatly. It's all very subjective.\n\nIf you have the kind that are coming true then you certainly have a gift.  Research it some and you will gain great knowledge from them!	Business & Finance
question_title: When I "sell to open" an options contract, I have to own the stock? [SEP] question_content: I don't understand.  To sell to open a call contract is to take a short position, correct?  So why is my online brokerage telling me I need to own the stock in order to sell a call to open?\n\nAre all brokers like this? [SEP] best_answer: The brokers catagorize their clients.  You have been catagorized as not allowed to sell naked options.  It is that simple.  I had the same problem and quite frankly it made me very unhappy.  If you have your heart set on that strategy, try Optionsxpress.  They might be more understanding.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: MLM's are a ripoff. I have looked into the Nu Skin  when it was new. All the BS promises, we will help, we Will get you leads,when you get to this level you wil have all this income. Well I did not buy into it and for good reason. My friend did and he got The shaft. They only ones who really make the bucks are the ones that start the business. Why you ask, did they try to sell you any product? No but they sold you a starter sales kit to sell the product...see what I mean. You may be able to sue but you have to prove that they lied and made it sound like you only had to sign other people up and not sell the product. And that will be hard to do because most MLM's get busted in a year or less.\nSo next time take a recorder with you and record the whole thing and get any guarantees in writing.	Business & Finance

question_title: Where can I find a safe investment that'll give me more than 8% per year? [SEP] question_content: After looking at several banks, I found one which'll give me 8% annually. Which means in 9 years, my inital investment will be double.  I'm 24, I am thinking of long term investments. But what else can be just as safe as a bank, but that can give me more than 8% annually. [SEP] best_answer: I don't believe that you can find an investment vehicle with a sure 8% return that has the 0% risk of CD's or a Savings Account.  However, there are mutual funds that invest in bonds, and they tend to have very reliable returns.  I recommend LSBRX, which can be acquired through Charles Schwab without any fees.  It has averaged over 9% each year since its inception, and has never had a year with a negative return.  It's been around since 1997.  Understand, it could drop in value, but historically bonds have been a very safe bet I believe they will continue to be so.  In my opinion, LSBRX is the best one available.  Good luck.

question_title: My boss is constantly starring at my chest? Should I do something? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I guess it depends . . . do you enjoy it?  Is it bothering you (since you are writing it here, I am assuming it does).  \n\nIt is, without a doubt, unprofessional.  However, most sexual harassment policies and laws require you to let the other person know, in some manner, that you don't appreciate it.  I think the best thing you can do it approach him, and say something like, "I'm not sure how to bring this up, but there are certain things you do that make me feel uncomfortable.  We are both here to do a job, and I hope we can do it friendly, but you need to know that it is making me uncomfortable".  Document what you said, how he responded, when and where you talked to him.  \n\nIf things don't change, or you sense any retaliation, take it immediately to Human Resources.  \n\nOh, and you may know that he is doing this in a lewd way, but I had a situation where an employee was staring at the chest of people when he talked with them - turns out it was a nervous gesture, and had nothing to do with harassment.

question_title: when will Martha Stewart release the news of their contract with KB Homes, it's a done deal? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: She aleady did back in November:\n\nMartha Stewart, suburban homebuilder\nLifestyle magazines hunt for ways to grow their brands in the unlikeliest of places.\nNovember 8, 2005: 9:56 AM EST \nBy Greg Lindsay, Biz 2.0\n\nNEW YORK (Business 2.0) - Magazine publishers could sure use a few extra bucks. Advertising is down, newsstand sales are in free-fall, and the cost of paper and printing is skyrocketing. But leave it to Martha Stewart. Who else would take a magazine into a real estate venture to spur profits? \nMartha Stewart Living Omnimedia recently announced a deal with $7 billion homebuilding giant KB Homes, one of the nation's largest developers of residential real estate, to create a line of Martha-branded houses. The first project is a subdivision built from scratch in an affluent suburb of Raleigh, N.C. \nThe 650 houses -- many of which are already under construction -- will cost anywhere from $200,000 to $450,000 and will be inspired by Stewart's own homes in New York and Maine. KB Homes will offer prospective buyers eight variations to choose from, and the first homes will be completed by early 2006. KB Homes is so confident of the venture's success that it's already considering sites near Atlanta and Houston for the next Martha suburbs. \nThe partnership could be a win for both parties. KB Homes wants to attach recognizable, high-quality brand names to its homes to help justify a healthy markup. Martha Stewart Living, on the other hand, wants access to homes that it can fill with decorative shams, cast-iron skillets and other items from its vast array of housewares. And then there's the simple matter of growth: Despite the widely expected slowdown in the real estate market, KB Homes projects annual growth rates of 15 percent or more for the foreseeable future, making this an attractive potential profit engine. \nWhile no other publisher has announced plans to put its name on homes, Stewart's success at finding revenue streams beyond advertising and newsstand sales has spurred others to experiment with new ways to extend their brands. Now CosmoGirl, Maxim, National Geographic and Seventeen all license their brands to partners that create household products, ranging from bedsheets to TV stands. \nIt's not hard to see why: Stewart's merchandise division has grown alongside her magazines and now brings in more than 28 percent of total revenues. Few media do a better job of articulating a lifestyle than magazines, so it's not a big stretch, for instance, for Dennis Publishing to hope that young, male Maxim readers will show interest in its Maxim-branded barware or bathroom products. Maxim recently announced that its products would be sold at dozens of Macy's nationwide. \nMartha Stewart Living and Maxim aren't the only magazines actively exploring alternative opportunities. Playboy chief executive Christie Hefner is experimenting with bunny-branded casinos, concept stores and apparel, not to mention several overseas nightclubs. \nNot to be outdone, Larry Flynt recently unveiled a chain of Hustler Bar & Grilles. And most recently, Condé Nast's technology-focused Wired magazine -- eager to cash in on the popularity of the high-end electronics gear it shows off each month -- announced it would temporarily open a Wired-branded shop in Manhattan, just in time for the holidays, to sell the latest gear. \nStill, the decision to try the real estate market is one of Stewart's boldest plans yet. But she's proven herself particularly adept at spotting lucrative new ways to extend her brand, so she has earned the benefit of the doubt. But will similar moves work for other publications? \n"I think it could make sense," says Chris Mitchell, former publisher of Details magazine, who left to become president of BDDW, a New York-based creator of luxury furniture. He thinks extending a brand is worth the associated risk, especially for titles that convey a clear vision of h	Business & Finance

question_title: how do i access gov. grants for first time homeowners? [SEP] question_content: grants should have criteria that i can compare, to determine if they might apply to me. [SEP] best_answer: You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes. \n\nIn the instructions at Grants.gov, you have to first go to CFDA to find out the grant number that you qualify. You can search CFDA various ways (by grant number, by keyword, etc.). You can find grant programs by category -- here are the lists of grants under Home Buying/Homeownership http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.FIND_GRANT_PROGRAM_TXT.SHOW?p_arg_names=func_cat_cd&p_arg_values=ML  Check if any applies to you\n\nTo make searching easier, Housing and Urban Development HUD has a list of housing grants http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/grants/fundsavail.cfm - though I have NOT seen any grants available for first time homeowners.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html	Business & Finance

question_title: euro re-mortgage? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are some around.  Euro interest rates are generally lower than those in the UK, but that doesn't necessarily mean the saving will be passed on to you.  \n\nThe capital and the interest are expressed in euros.  That means if Sterling reduces in value, you're going to have to find more pounds to maintain and repay your mortgage.\n\nAs a general rule, it's best to arrange your mortgage in the same currency as the income you're using to repay it.  If you're buying to let and the rents in euros, go for a euro mortgage.  If the repayments come out of your UK salary, stick to sterling.	Business & Finance

question_title: how do I know what federal tax bracket i fall under? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You only pay taxes on your adjusted gross income minus deductions and credits, in other words, your Net Taxable Income. \n\nYou will be in a different federal tax bracket if you are filing single, or married filing jointly, or qualifying widow/widower, or married filing separately, or filing as head of household.  The tax bracket also changes depending on how much net taxable income you are reporting (line 43, form1040).\n\nFederal Tax Brackets are 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35% but, these percentages don't accurately portray the amount of tax due.  For each tax bracket, depending on your filing status, the bracket has a correction amount.\n\nFor example, someone filing Single, with a net taxable income of $6,000 would fall into the 10% tax bracket and owe 10% in tax.  This equals $600 in tax.  Looking up $6,000--$6,050 net taxable income in the tax tables, IRS Publication 17, shows a tax obligation of $603.\n\nAnother example, Someone filing Single, with net taxable income of $60,000 would be in the 25% tax bracket, but owe 25% of $60,000 minus $3,335.  That equals $11,665 in tax.   If you check the tax tables, starting on page 250 of IRS Publication 17, you will see a net taxable income $60,000--$60,050 shows a tax liability of $11,671.\n\nThe percentages and subtraction numbers are different depending upon your specific situation (your filing status and your level of net taxable income.)  Most people just use the tax tables and look up their net taxable income in the tables to find the tax they owe.\n\nHere's another way to compute the tax owed using the federal tax brackets:\nhttp://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=150856,00.html\n\nThe real problem finding your federal tax bracket is accurately determining your net taxable income.  The only way to do that is to complete a tax return and see how the numbers turnout.  Someone could have a high gross income but exemptions, deductions, and credits bring their net taxable income to zero.  In fact, some credits are refundable even if the taxpayer has no tax liability.

question_title: is someone knows anything about ATATURK ?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: FOUNDER AND THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE TURKISH REPUBLIC\n\n\nAtatürk was born in 1881 at the Kocakasım ward of Salonika, in a three story pink house located on Islahhane Street. His father is Ali Rıza Efendi and his mother Zübeyde Hanım. His paternal grandfather, Hafız Ahmed Efendi belonged to the Kocacık nomads who were settled in Macedonia during the XIV - XV th centuries. His mother Zübeyde Hanım was the daughter of an Old Turkish family who had settled in the town of Langasa near Salonika. Ali Rıza Efendi, who worked as militia officer, title deed clerck and lumber trader, married Zübeyde Hanım in 1871. Four of the 5 siblings of Atatürk died at early ages and only one sister, Makbule (Atadan) survived, and lived until 1956. \n   \n\nUpon reaching school age, little Mustafa started school at the neighborhood classes of Hafız Mehmet Efendi and later, with his father's choice, was transferred to Şemsi Efendi School. He lost his father in 1888 where upon he stayed at the farm of his maternal uncle for a while and returned to Salonika to complete his studies. He registered at the Salonika Mülkiye Rüştiye (secondary school) and soon transferred to the military Rüştiye. While at this school, his math teacher, also named Mustafa, added "Kemal" to his name. He attended the Manastır Military School between 1896 - 1899 and later the Military School in İstanbul from which he graduated in 1902 with the rank of lieutenant. He later entered the Military Academy and graduated on January 11, 1905 with the rank of major. Between 1905 - 1907 he was stationed in Damascus with the 5th. Army. In 1907 he was promoted to the rank of "Kolağası" (senior major) and was posted with the III rd Army , which was stationed in Manastır. He was the Staff Officer of the "Special Troops" (Hareket Ordusu) which entered İstanbul on April 19, 1909. He was sent to Paris in 1910 where he attended the Picardie manuevers. In 1911 he started to work at the General Staff Office in İstanbul. \n\nMustafa Kemal was stationed at Tobruk and Derne regions with a group of his friends during the war which started with the Italian attack on Tripoli. He won the Tobruk battle in 22 December 1911 against the Italians. On March 6, 1912 he was made the Commander of Derne. \n\nWhen the Balkan War started in October 1912, Mustafa Kemal joined the battle with units from Gallipoli and Bolayır. His contributions to the recapturing of Dimetoka and Edirne were considerable. In 1913 he was assigned to Sofia as a military attache. In 1914, while still at this post, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. His term as an attache ended in January 1915. By that time the First World War had started and the ottomon Empire was inevitably involved. Mustafa Kemal was posted to Tekirdağ with the assignment of forming the 19th Division. \n\nMustafa Kemal put his signature under a legend of heroism at Çanakkale during the First World War, which had started in 1914, and had the Allied Powers admit to the fact that "Çanakkale is unpassable!" On March 18, 1915 when the English and French navies in an attempt to force their way up the Çanakkale Strait gave heavy loses, they decided to put units on land at Gallipoli Peninsula. The enemy forces which landed at Arıburnu on 25 April 1915 were stopped by 19th Divison under Mustafa Kemal's command at Conkbayırı. Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of colonel after this victory. English forces attacked at Arıburnu once more on 6-7 August 1915. Mustafa Kemal, as the Commander of the Anafartalar Forces won the Anafartalar Victory on 6-7 August 1915. This victory was followed by the victories of Kireçtepe on August 17, and the Second Anafartalar Victory on August 21. Turkish nation who lost about 253.000 men at battle, had managed to emerge in honour against the Allied forces. Actually the fate at trenches changed when Mustafa Kemal addressed his soldiers with the wor	Business & Finance
question_title: How does the Roman Catholic church set the date to celebrate Easter? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Easter is an annual festival observed throughout the Christian world. The date for Easter shifts every year within the Gregorian Calendar. The Gregorian Calendar is the standard international calendar for civil use. In addition, it regulates the ceremonial cycle of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. The current Gregorian ecclesiastical rules that determine the date of Easter trace back to 325 CE at the First Council of Nicaea convened by the Roman Emperor Constantine. At that time the Roman world used the Julian Calendar (put in place by Julius Caesar). \n\nThe Council decided to keep Easter on a Sunday, the same Sunday throughout the world. To fix incontrovertibly the date for Easter, and to make it determinable indefinitely in advance, the Council constructed special tables to compute the date. These tables were revised in the following few centuries resulting eventually in the tables constructed by the 6th century Abbot of Scythia, Dionysis Exiguus. Nonetheless, different means of calculations continued in use throughout the Christian world. \n\nIn 1582 Gregory XIII (Pope of the Roman Catholic Church) completed a reconstruction of the Julian calendar and produced new Easter tables. One major difference between the Julian and Gregorian Calendar is the "leap year rule". See our FAQ on Calendars for a description of the difference. Universal adoption of this Gregorian calendar occurred slowly. By the 1700's, though, most of western Europe had adopted the Gregorian Calendar. The Eastern Christian churches still determine the Easter dates using the older Julian Calendar method. \n\nThe usual statement, that Easter Day is the first Sunday after the full moon that occurs next after the vernal equinox, is not a precise statement of the actual ecclesiastical rules. The full moon involved is not the astronomical Full Moon but an ecclesiastical moon (determined from tables) that keeps, more or less, in step with the astronomical Moon. \n\nThe ecclesiastical rules are: \n\nEaster falls on the first Sunday following the first ecclesiastical full moon that occurs on or after the day of the vernal equinox; \nthis particular ecclesiastical full moon is the 14th day of a tabular lunation (new moon); and \nthe vernal equinox is fixed as March 21. \nresulting in that Easter can never occur before March 22 or later than April 25. The Gregorian dates for the ecclesiastical full moon come from the Gregorian tables. Therefore, the civil date of Easter depends upon which tables - Gregorian or pre-Gregorian - are used. The western (Roman Catholic and Protestant) Christian churches use the Gregorian tables; many eastern (Orthodox) Christian churches use the older tables based on the Julian Calendar. \nIn a congress held in 1923, the eastern churches adopted a modified Gregorian Calendar and decided to set the date of Easter according to the astronomical Full Moon for the meridian of Jerusalem. However, a variety of practices remain among the eastern churches. \n\nThere are three major differences between the ecclesiastical system and the astronomical system. \n\nThe times of the ecclesiastical full moons are not necessarily identical to the times of astronomical Full Moons. The ecclesiastical tables did not account for the full complexity of the lunar motion. \nThe vernal equinox has a precise astronomical definition determined by the actual apparent motion of the Sun as seen from the Earth. It is the precise time at which the apparent ecliptic longitude of the Sun is zero. (Yes, the Sun's ecliptic longitude, not its declination, is used for the astronomical definition.) This precise time shifts within the civil calendar very slightly from year to year. In the ecclesiastical system the vernal equinox does not shift; it is fixed at March 21 regardless of the actual motion of the Sun. \nThe date of Easter is a specific calendar date. Easter starts when that date starts for your local time zone. The vernal equinox occurs at a	Business & Finance

question_title: if you accept a short sale on your house what does it do to your credit rating? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I am not 100% on this - but I would have to say that in any NORMAL circumstance where you didn't have any forclosure issue or any creditors coming after you - you would simply pay the difference.  \n\nSo if the mortgage was for 200,000 and you could only sell for 190,000 you would have to kick in the extra 10,000 to pay of the rest of the mortgage.  \n\nthe reverse is true - if you sell the house for 210,000 YOU would KEEP the extra -  If you sell for less you would have to pay the extra.  \n\nMakes sense to me -  I could be wrong - but I don't think so.  Especiall if you wanted to not have your credit rating be affected. Pay that mortgage off. Either that or stay in your home and don't sell it for a loss.	Business & Finance
question_title: How can my boyfriend go about becoming a probabtion officer? Does he need to go to uni again or do they train? [SEP] question_content: on the job?? We live in London, UK. [SEP] best_answer: Hi\nThink he will have to wait until October for next intake and has to go through assessment centres etc. Adverts usually go into the broadsheets but you can contact any Probation area for information as all applicants go through regional consortium's. Doesn't have to have a degree and pends on his age and experiences as to what is required to apply, best clarify with the consortium's. The trainee probation officers ( TPO) do a degree and NVQ level 4 whilst working and its a two year intense course, if he has a relevant degree already might be able to AP EL (claim credits) and not have to do all essays etc. In house experiences and work are essential as thats how you learn the job!\n\nOther way into the service if he hasn't got right credentials currently  is to do voluntary work or apply for a post of a Probation Service officer, these are the backbone to the Probation Service and work alongside the officers. The service is changing dramatically as we speak and the best bet really is to contact your local area and arrange to visit and see whats available and what your partner wants to do. Lots of opportunities but the TPO programme is very competitive and given changes in government may well change  again soon. I know there is definitely an intake next year but not sure after that!!\n\nHope that helps a bit its a demanding, frustrating, sometimes rewarding and never ever dull challenge so good luck with it if he applies!!!

question_title: Whats the best way for a disabled person to make money or start a business at home making at least 50k a year? [SEP] question_content: Is ebay still a good way to make money how does someone get started is jewelry a good thing to sell what if you have little money to start. [SEP] best_answer: Jewelry is a very competitive arena in eBay. You need to have an established reputation in the community, great closeup photos, certificate of authenticities, etc. You have to understand that ebay is not a sure thing -- just look at the number of listings that end without a single bid and you will see that ebay can become very expensive (you keep on paying ebay listing fees but you may not sell anything).\n\nOne way to succeed on eBay is to know what the HOT products are. eBay has several ways for you to determine exactly what the hot items to sell on their marketplace: \n\nItems In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sellbycategory.html  \n\nHot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/whatshot.html and select "Hot Items by Category" from the menu on the left. \n\neBay Pulse = "a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. \n\nMerchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/calendar.html  to view the current Merchandising Calendar.

question_title: Can you file a claim againest property that you have the paid taxes for 5 years .? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Some states allow a person to acquire title to property through adverse possession. Part of adverse possession is to have paid all the taxes on the property for 5 years, but there is more to it than that... you must also 1. Be on the property either against the property owner's wishes or without the property owner's knowledge 2. Have been in continuous use of this property for 5 years.... so in other words you must have lived there or been there on a daily basis and 3. prove that you have a right to the title of the property. All of these conditions all must exist on TOP of you paying the taxes for 5 years. \n\nObviously, acquiring title through adverse possession is quite rare.	Business & Finance
question_title: Should I voluntarily tell a potential employer that I am single without kids? [SEP] question_content: I have been looking for a job, and I know employers arent supposed to ask about marriage and kids, but would it hurt or help me to volunteer that I single and childless? [SEP] best_answer: Hmmm...doesn't seem a wise thing to bring up during an interview...I don't see how it would affect your getting or not getting the job and might only make the potential employer wonder why you are giving out that personal information (after all, whether you're married with family or single with no family...either situation could change).  I would address my qualifications for the job rather than my marital status.	Business & Finance

question_title: What happens to you if your house is foreclosed? What are you responsible for? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on if the bank can re-sell the property and for what amount. If your mortgage is for say 150k and they sell it for 100k, you'll still owe the bank 50k. If they don't sell it, you'll continue to owe the remaining balance on your mortgage. If you're struggling to make house payments, try re-financing your mortgage to see if you can lower your monthly payments. Also try state agencies for help in making monthly payments. You may be eligible for help depending on your income level.	Business & Finance

question_title: Does anyone know of any programs to help ex-convicts gain employment when they leave prison? [SEP] question_content: I’d prefer programs in Maryland or Virginia, but I’ll take any advice you can give me. [SEP] best_answer: Everybody makes mistakes and some pay for it by going to prison.  It makes me sick to think that the private sector will not make the effort necessary to try hard to match a job to someone who has  been in prison.  It would appear that this will follow you unless you are one of the lucky ones and find a decent company out there that can assist you.  Right now, there are thousands of people with poor credit records that cannot even get a job because they are deemed irresponsible, etc. and this simply is not the case.  Most had a run of bad luck financially and they too, like you, will continue to pay the price.  But please don't try to ask the government for help as they can't even help themselves right now.  You should be gaged on your work knowledge and talents and also what the offense was that you served time for and in that event, work towards finding an employer that can accept it.  I personally would like to start a program myself to help individuals like yourself, if deserving, and I am sure you are.  Good luck as you may have a family to support and want to go on with your life.	Business & Finance

question_title: How do I post a press release? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The best way is to use a press release distribution service, which will take care of sending out your release for distribution to their journalists' contacts. Services can vary anywhere from $80 (PRWeb.com) to $650 (national distribution from PR Newswire). The benefit in using these services is that they allow you to reach a much wider media audience than you would on your own. Plus, journalists are already familiar with these services and you may stand a greater chance in getting them to at least take a look at the title of your release.  \n\nCheck out where these services distribute your release. Some are just web-based, while others are sent to both print and web journalists (web journalists only distribution service is cheaper). PR Newswire, for example, can get your release into databases such as Lexis Nexis but PRWeb.com cannot. \n\nOf course, you can get the contact details of some publications and you can send your release to them on your own. Or you can use some free services (search for "free press release submission"); the catch however is your release is only listed on their website and not anywhere else unless you pay a fee or "donate"	Business & Finance

question_title: I have 2 operating systems on my computer.win 98 and win xp,how do I remove the windows 98? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It is very likely that the two operating systems divide your hard drive into two partitions: if you take a circle and divide it in half, imagine each system taking half the circle. None can store data on a portion not its own.\n\nYou can remove windows 98 by deleting the partiton it resides on (with some form of bootable partition manager, probably on a floppy disk or CD), but you cannot automatically resize a partition, so without manual effort your windows XP partition can't be made any larger with the deletion of win 98.\n\nIf they're both on the same partition, then I would be VERY careful about what you do on it. Some system folders may share files used by both, and deleting the wrong file could corrupt your XP install and render it useless.	Computers & Internet

question_title: My computer keeps poping up " Explorer has performed an iligal operation and will close" Does anyone know why? [SEP] question_content: My computer is a Compaq and is old. [SEP] best_answer: Error Message: "This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the problem persists, contact the program vendor." with Details such as: "IExplore caused an invalid page fault in module Mshtml.dll." or "IExplore has caused an error in Mshtml.dll. IExplore will now close. If you continue experiencing problems, try restarting your computer." (or something similar) \n\nTranslation: You may receive these types of error messages after installing IE. And by clicking the Details button in the error message window, you'll see the second part of the error message. During new program installations, many of the files copied to the system are DLL files. And, as we mentioned previously, DLL files that don't work with existing software or DLL files that have been deleted or become corrupt frequently cause illegal operation messages and then shut down the program. \n\nSolution: This particular error message might be caused by a conflict with an earlier version of Gator software by Gator.com. Gator helps Internet users expedite the process of filling out forms online. To solve the problem, you can either uninstall Gator or upgrade to the latest version of the software.

[SEP] best_answer: It will be much better then your Hp laptop, at least in my opinion, and Macs have the best video editing software out there, iMovie which will come pre-installed on your Mac is fantastic for editing movies of the family and such. \n\nIf you want to go all out with your video editing, FinalCut Pro is the best video editing software around, and its Mac only, FinalCut Pro is what a good portion of Hollywood Movies are edited on, but its pretty expensive.  \n\nFinalCut Express is substantially cheaper however and will do 99.9% of anything that anyone but the most serious of film maker would ever want to do.

question_title: How Do I Perform a Low Level Format? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Where the high-level format cleans your hard drive down to the DOS partition required to install Windows, a low-level format goes even deeper. It erases even the partition information and retraces the drive's physical track and storing sector information necessary for creating a DOS partition. Most hard drive manufacturers run such an initialization prior to shipping their units, although you may occasionally run across a drive that is devoid of even this much structure (known as a bare drive).\n\nA low-level format can be used to wipe a drive that has been attacked by a boot-sector virus if the virus cannot be removed with anti-virus software.\n\nHUTIL, available from the Download Center, includes EraseHDD, a utility that will perform a low-level format including the partition table and Master Boot Record.

question_title: When will Beta Mail be available to all sbc yahoo dsl customers? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The All New AT&T Yahoo! Mail will be released in two phases. Beginning April 18, 2006, 30% of the total AT&T Yahoo! primary accounts and sub accounts that are not under parental controls will be able to switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail. The rollout will continue with the other 70% in the 2nd phase on May, until all Members that do not have parental controls enabled have the option to use the new version of AT&T Yahoo! Mail.\n\nYou dont need any invites to be able to use the new Yahoo Beta email. You just need to at least meet the system requirements:\n\n*Browsers\nIE 5.5 and higher (for Windows) \nFirefox 1.0 or higher (for Mac and Windows) \nMozilla Suite 1.7 or higher (for Mac and Windows) \nNetscape 7.2 (For Windows) \nSBC Yahoo! Browser 3.3 \n\n*Operating Systems\nWindows 2000, XP \nMac OSX \n\n\nEntry points for the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail are the following:\n\nTrap page | Promo Module on the Mail Welcome Page | Link on the Mail Options Page \n\n*Trap Page*\nWhen Members log in to email for the first time after being provisioned with access (30% on April 18) to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail.\n\n*Promo module on the Mail Welcome Page*\n\nSBC Yahoo! Members using classic email will see the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail module on the Mail Welcome page, suggesting a switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail. The Member needs only to click on the Try it today link to switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! email - provided they meet minimum system requirements.\n\n*Link on the Mail Options Page*\n\nThe Try it now link will be displayed on the Mail Options page only for SBC Yahoo! Members who are provisioned, regardless if the Member has already switched to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail. This link will allow the Member to switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail by directing them to the landing page from which they can access the new Mail version.\n\nNow if you really cant wait to change your email to Beta and you're tired of waiting, then the easiest way to change to Beta is change your location to UK or any other location not US. You can go about this by going to My account and click on Edit and under General preferences, change you Preferred Content to UK or Canada for the moment.When you click finish you are gonna be given a TOS (terms of service), you click accept and then after that you would be asked if you want to try the new Yahoo Beta version then you email away and enjoy Yahoo Beta! \n\nAnd if you want to switch back to the original "face" of yahoo mail, you simply click on the link that says, Switch Back (in line with Sign Out and My Account links at the top), then you're back to the original. But if you decide to switch back to Beta again, then you simply go to the Options tab (on the upper right corner), there would be a purple button there to Try Yahoo Beta again. This process is reversible and should not affect your email. So don't you worry about losing you emails.=D	Computers & Internet

question_title: what is the main differences between 3 tier architecture & 2 tier architecture? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Two-tier architecture is a client/server architecture , where a request to do some task is sent to the server and the server responds by performing the task.\n\nThree-tier or a multi tier architecture  has client, server and database. Where the client request is sent to the server and the server in turn sends the request to the database. The database sends back the information/data required to the server which inturn sends it to the client.\n\nIn a modern two-tier architecture, the server holds both the application and the data. The application resides on the server rather than the client, probably because the server will have more processing power and disk space than the PC.\n\nIn a three-tier architecture, the data and applications are split onto seperate servers, with the server-side distributed between a database server and an application server. The client is a front end, simply requesting and displaying data. Reason being that each server will be dedicated to processing either data or application requests, hence a more manageable system and less contention for resources will occur\n\n\nCheers mate	Computers & Internet

question_title: what are 3G network standards ? [SEP] question_content: I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains [SEP] best_answer: Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe	Computers & Internet

[SEP] question_content: can any one provide good source [SEP] best_answer: The Standard Template Library (STL) uses many of the extensions that the ANSI/ISO committee has made to templates, and g++ doesn't support some of these yet.  So if you grab HP's free implementation of STL it\nisn't going to work.  However, starting with libg++-2.6.2 libg++ contains a hacked version of STL, based on work by Carsten Bormann,which permits g++ to compile at least the containers.  A full implementation is going to need improved template support, which will take a while yet (2.8.0 will compile the HP version successfully,\nexcept for a couple of easily fixed places where the HP code violates the draft standard).Some say that the hacked STL and gcc-2.7.2 work quite well. Almost all of the ObjectSpace examples (a set of over 200 simple examples of STL usage) now work.\n   There are several commercial suppliers of STL implementations;ObjectSpace's version supports gcc-2.7.x. M.Khan has produced an "STL newbie guide" with lots of information on using STL with gcc.  See `http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/stl/STL.newbie.html'	Computers & Internet

question_title: Designated Hitter? [SEP] question_content: Why doesn't the National league have a designated hitter? [SEP] best_answer: The reason is Major League Baseball rule 6.10 and it leaves it upto the League to decide to use or not use the rule. The National League chooses not to use the rule as it bucks baseball tradition. The younger American League is not so stooped in tradition and has used the rule since the 70's!The rule was put in initially to see if the offensive performance of a team could be enhanced by using a hitter in place of the pitcher who typically doesn't hit for average or power. \n\n6.10\nAny League may elect to use the Designated Hitter Rule. (a) In the event of inter league competition between clubs of Leagues using the Designated Hitter Rule and clubs of Leagues not using the Designated Hitter Rule, the rule will be used as follows: 1. In World Series or exhibition games, the rule will be used or not used as is the practice of the home team. 2. In All Star games, the rule will only be used if both teams and both Leagues so agree. (b) The Rule provides as follows: A hitter may be designated to bat for the starting pitcher and all subsequent pitchers in any game without otherwise affecting the status of the pitcher(s) in the game. A Designated Hitter for the pitcher must be selected prior to the game and must be included in the lineup cards presented to the Umpire in Chief. The designated hitter named in the starting lineup must come to bat at least one time, unless the opposing club changes pitchers. It is not mandatory that a club designate a hitter for the pitcher, but failure to do so prior to the game precludes the use of a Designated Hitter for that game. Pinch hitters for a Designated Hitter may be used. Any substitute hitter for a Designated Hitter becomes the Designated Hitter. A replaced Designated Hitter shall not re enter the game in any capacity. The Designated Hitter may be used defensively, continuing to bat in the same position in the batting order, but the pitcher must then bat in the place of the substituted defensive player, unless more than one substitution is made, and the manager then must designate their spots in the batting order. A runner may be substituted for the Designated Hitter and the runner assumes the role of Designated Hitter. A Designated Hitter may not pinch run. A Designated Hitter is "locked" into the batting order. No multiple substitutions may be made that will alter the batting rotation of the Designated Hitter. Once the game pitcher is switched from the mound to a defensive position this move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for the remainder of the game. Once a pinch hitter bats for any player in the batting order and then enters the game to pitch, this move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for the remainder of the game. Once the game pitcher bats for the Designated Hitter this move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for the remainder of the game. (The game pitcher may only pinch hit for the Designated Hitter). Once a Designated Hitter assumes a defensive position this move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for the remainder of the game. A substitute for the Designated Hitter need not be announced until it is the Designated Hitter's turn to bat.	Sports

Okay, he might not be the most spectacular England player ever (certainly not an English Carlos Alberto Pereirra by any means) but you would behard pressed to find a better professional and a better attitude than his.

question_title: Who is Ryk Neethling? [SEP] question_content: Who is Ryk Neethling and where did he graduate from ? Where is he from and what did he achieve ? [SEP] best_answer: Ryk Neethling is one of the most successful swimmers in history to compete for the University of Arizona and the Republic of South Africa. Ryk has participated in the last three Olympic Games for South Africa, culminating with a Gold Medal and World Record performance in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. Currently, Neethling holds the South African record in five different events and ranks in the top ten in the world in both the 50, 100, 200 Freestyle and Individual Medleys. Yet it is his success as an intercollegiate swimmer at the University of Arizona that elevated him to become one of the most highly regarded athletes in Tucson and the International swimming community. Ryk’s collegiate athletic career at Arizona was unmatched, leading to nine individual NCAA Championships and the Arizona Athlete of the Century Award.\n\nRyk, was born and raised in Bloemfontein, South Africa. He was raised by his parents Ryk and San-Marie with his two sisters Elsje and Jean-Marie. Growing up in a close knit family, Ryk learned the meaning of competition and determination. His sister, Elsje, was diagnosed with brain tumors at the age of twelve and endured three brain surgeries before recovering fully. Throughout her treatment, she continued swimming, never giving up her hope, determination, and passion while fighting for her life. It was this mentality that Ryk adopted in his swimming that led him to his international and collegiate success.\n\nRyk attended all of his schooling prior to the University of Arizona at Grey College in South Africa; the third generation of Neethling’s to attend. One of the most prestigious institutions in South Africa, Grey College, was attended by former South African presidents and other influential politicians.\n\nAt the age of 6, Ryk started taking water safety lessons after a near fatal drowning incident at a neighbor’s house, and immediately took to the water. Ryk quickly became a national force in the age groups, but international sanctions due to the apartheid always put a damper on South African athlete's celebrations and dreams. Unable to compete in any international competitions because of these sanctions, South Africa's top swimmers were forced to attend American universities to compete against the best in the world. But Ryk was fortunate enough to be surrounded by some of the top swimmers in South Africa at his club in Bloemfontein and soon realized his dreams of competing in the Olympics might be attainable. It was during this time that Ryk started dreaming about going to the US to study and swim and to make his Olympic dream a reality.\n\nIn 1995, at the age of 17, several colleges began recruiting Ryk for swimming scholarships. At this point, he had never visited the United States and barely spoke English. He was recruited by swimming powerhouses Michigan, Stanford, Southern California, and ASU. At that time, Michigan was his first choice because of their history of great distance swimmers. When Michigan did not guarantee him an athletic scholarship and he began seriously considering other programs, he first thought of the University of Arizona. Ryk had received a package from Arizona Head Swim Coach Frank Busch which included pictures of the Hillenbrand pool and McKale Center in the swimming media guide. For some reason, after staring at the picture of the pool and becoming mesmerized by the mountains set in the background, Ryk envisioned himself training in that pool. He soon committed to Arizona and enrolled in the fall of 1996, immediately following the Atlanta Olympic Games. Throughout the four years he competed for Arizona, he had several opportunities to show Michigan the recruiting error they had made. Ryk had become one of the most successful intercollegiate swimmers in history.\n\nDuring his career at Arizona, Ryk’s success in athletics was unparalleled. He was a nine-time NCAA National Champion (2nd most in history). He was voted Arizona Athlete of the Year and PAC-10	Sports

question_title: in basketball if someone set a screen are u allowed to get around without fouling? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You can go around them...but not through them.  I think the most important part of defending the screen though is to decide with your team/teammates how are you defending?  There are two main ways..1) switch-so the person picking you now becomes your responsibility or 2) fight through the screens-which you may have to help each other out with at times.\nI think the other aspect you have to take in also is whether or not they are setting good screens.  Are they sticking their arms out and holding?  Are they moving?  All of these are illegal-and make getting through or around them alot harder.	Sports
question_title: Is curling a game?If so how does one play it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes.\n\nCurling is a precision team sport similar to bowls or bocce, played on a rectangular sheet of prepared ice by two teams of four players each, using heavy polished granite stones which they slide down the ice towards a target area called the house. Points are scored for the number of stones that a team has closer to the center of the target than the closest of the other team's stones. The level of precision and complex nature of the strategic thinking required to win has led curling to be referred to as "chess on ice."	Sports
question_title: Running // If competitive running events were on TV more often, would you watch them? [SEP] question_content: I enjoy watching coverage of major marathons on TV, and felt fortunate when I recently lucked into being able to watch some of the NCAA Track and Field championships on CBS.  I know these shows must get pretty low ratings though.  I wonder what it would take to make televised marathoning / cross country / running in general attractive for TV... [SEP] best_answer: man im a runner myself and i dont watch coverage of televised running events\n\nrunning is not a spectator sport, most runners would rather run themselves than watch someone else do it\n\nthe whole challenge of running is invisible because it lies in the individual runner's body and mind and it can't be broadcast or conveyed via television\n\nfinally, i loathe events where speed is considered somethign of value\n\ndont show me on the tv the elite guy who gets paid by new balance to train 8 hours a day so he can hit the 2:06 mark, show me the dad with four kids, a 50 hour a week job who coaches little league and still finds the strength in himself to be able to complete a marathon in under 5 hours, THAT GUY, is the real athelete and hero to me\n\nhaha\n\ngood luck getting it on t.v.

And out of the 3 of us, im always the good one, not getting into trouble, always paying attention and many other things....so who do u think is the mostly one that doesnt pay attention in softball?

question_title: Curious, approximately How much Weight does Erik Morales have to lose for his 3rd fight with Pacquiao? [SEP] question_content: He looked amazingly chunky in their last press conference a few months ago.\n\nDo you think this weight loss will play a role in Pacquiao's favor? [SEP] best_answer: They are suppose to fight at 130lbs.  However,  due to Morales having a lot of trouble getting to that weight I heard that there is a $500,000 penalty for every pound he weighs in over!  The Pacquiao camp has agreed to fight Morales at 132lbs with the penalty.  But they will NOT fight him if he weighs in at 133lbs.  They will just walk with the money.  I watched an HBO special on this exact topic.  When fighters cut weight a lot of them will wait till the last week to start cutting.  It gets as bad as then trying to cut 10lbs the day before weigh in!  Which is horrible for your body.  I believe Morales tried to cut this way in the past and it effected his performance.  This time around I have heard that he has been slowly cutting weight the last couple of months and it has left him alot stronger.  Rumor is he will make the 130lbs fine this time.  I think we will see a much better fight this time which is exciting!	Sports

question_title: Would Home County Football Be a Big Hit in England? [SEP] question_content: The proposal is similar to country versus country - each player may only represent the one county he has spent more nights sleeping in than any other (either in his life or in the 1st 20 years of his life - I don't mind which) - the league season is to be shortened by 10 rounds to allow for a 10 round Tournament of England to take place - after the first four rounds are played within 4 regions (N, C, E, SW), the 2nd four are played in a Top 20, a middle 12 & a bottom 12 and the final two rounds are 1v2, 3v4, 5v6, then W1vW2, W3vL1, W4vL2,...\nAlternatively, we could use Englands 11 new regions or its 200+  local authorites, or a structure like the above but with the large 10 counties in Pool 1 & the rest in Pool 2 for rounds 1-4, then the top 6 from each in a Div1,...\nOf course the ambitious presumption is that all the good players & stadiums would be available for this, and that other countries have similar events, so that there is no disruption to foreign players' rhythm or theirpay [SEP] best_answer: Sounds like a double Dutch side to me.

question_title: Why was John Terry sent off in the Tottenham/Chelsea game? I don't see the reason.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I watched MOTD 2 on Sunday, and was curious why only the black Spurs players were the one who were enraged.\n\nHaving done some research on the internet message boards, it is alleged that John Terry told Ledley King to 'Shut up you lippy black monkey' before getting sent off on Sunday. This would explain the following: \n\nWhy King went mad, when normally he is mild tempered and the \nincident appeared harmless \n\nWhy Chimbonda went berserk and had to be physically restrained \n\nWhy Zakora went mad also \n\nWhy Drogba, who was there and always gets involved, did nothing \n\nWhy Terry calmly walked away expecting to be sent off for what \nappeared on TV to be nothing \n\nTerry was accused by Eto of making racist comments in the \nBarcelona game last year. \n\nApparently a Spurs player has leaked this, but Chelsea are \nworking overtime to keep it quiet \n\nA$hl€y Col€ has said that Poll told him the lack of discipline \nby Chelsea was out of order and Chelsea are trying to discredit \nPoll, but he cannot possibly come out and say what Terry did as he is the England captain, preferring to say he was sent off for 'ungentlemanly conduct'. \n\nIF this story is true, it will be massive and I can't believe \nthe press haven't got hold of it yet. Chelsea must be weighing \njournalists out left, right and centre.	Sports

I rushed him and caught him flush on the temple with a titanic right hand he was out cold, convulsing on the floor like a infantile retard." \n\nOn Fans \n\nTo a question on whether he feels support from the common fan: "I don't feel love from them because there's no love. They don't know me as an individual; they know me for what I actually do. Because they pay to see me smash anybody. If they're white they pay, [it's] because the only thing they have respect for is my ability as an athlete. But if I was in court and I had to use them to testify against me on my character, they wouldn't testify positively against me and they would think I'm a cad..." \n\n&quot	Sports

question_title: Who's better? Pau Gasol or Shaquille O'neal? Why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Are you talking about present and old Shaq or dominant young Shaq?\n\nIn terms of accomplishments, no doubt Shaq takes this one. He's got 4 trophies, an MVP award, and seriously, no one can defend him in the post during the Lakers era.\n\nIn terms of present talent, as much as I like Shaq, I go with Gasol on this one. The reason? Pau's the undeniable leader of this team, while Shaq plays second-fiddle to D-Wade. Although Shaq's dominance is still there in some games, he's not that consistent. Pau's game is 20 and 10 almost every game. And freethrow shooting is a critical part too.	Sports
