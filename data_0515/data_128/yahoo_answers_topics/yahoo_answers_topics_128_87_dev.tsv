question_title: Astrology, Numerology,Date:5/sept/1977? [SEP] question_content: Time:6:30 Am.Place:india\nWhen will i get a job?what is my profession? [SEP] best_answer: Well you're a double Virgo. I see that you should be in communications. Your side of fine things and loving them is obvious. You have set ideas. Your moon is in Gemini making you more compelled to communicate. I would actually see this through the Arts. There is nothing wrong with being behind the scenes....in fact you have the ability to make others their very best wherein YOU may be more fit for the job. Were I you, I would also start a dise business to save up money. Your Numerology I believe is a 2...perhaps the master 11/2 giving you the stronghold to Plan what others cannot, to sense what others cannot, making you  the perfect helper to any occasion if youre interested. With the information that you have here, you are most likely drawn to the fixed signs of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus and Scorpio. You have a temper, perhaps slow to boil....though I see you as a mediator or moderator. Dont take your work home with you! You probably have a great radio voice as well. Try some song writing and dont be afraid to be behind the scenes...often that is where all the action is!Enjoy!	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] best_answer: 15 is definitely not too old to start playing the drums. i think yo ucan start playing any time. if you're worried about how good you'll be, don't expect to be a grand master right at the start. it really depends on how often you practice.\n\ndrums are a very rewarding instrument, i absolutely love playing drums. i took piano before i played drums, and that helped a little, but they're really not all THAT similar. tap dancing might help though, because that means that you've got rhythm!

Somebody posted something like "We are Aly & AJ Michalka and we are Disney movie starts".  I didn't believe it because they mispelled the last name (they spelled it "Machalka" not "Michalka").  Don't you think someone would know how to spell their own last name?\n\nIf I see them obviously doing that, I'll just report them.  Otherwise, I might have a hard time controlling my temper.

Sharon Kay Penman wrote an amazing trilogy about the struggles of the Welsh Princes and English Kings.  The first book was called "There be Dragons."  The tales are relatively true and heart-wrenching, especially in "The Reckoning" when Wales falls. The trilogy has a Tristan & Isolde or King Arthur feel.	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] question_content: I am a fan of the 1999 animated TV show Roughneck Starship Troopers Chronicles and I was wondering what is the major opinion about the show.Is it really a cult one or does it plainly suck?\nBe honest,I appreciate that. [SEP] best_answer: Great show, but it was to light on plot.

question_title: Is the format of movie trailers too cliche now, and does it need to change? [SEP] question_content: I just saw the trailer to "The Devil Wears Prada", and I was truly refreshed by its originality.\n\nIt was better than those "5 billion and 1" trailers that are all alike. There are the action/drama movie trailers, and there are the chick flick trailers...which are virtually all the same if you watch them enough.\n\nEnough is enough? Is it time for some originality and "out-of-the-box" thinking? [SEP] best_answer: yes, it should. i think that would truly attract more people to watch the movie. \ni also saw the "devil wears prada" trailer, it was original, i have to agree.\nbut movie trailers don't need to be that original, movie trailers are just supposed to attract more people to watch the movie. but originality would probably help	Entertainment & Music
question_title: Is Ashton Kutcher's show "punk'd" unfair to black people? Is he racist? Or just mean? [SEP] question_content: I think that Ashton Kutcher treats black people really cold on his show. I've noticed that he always has police involved when black people are on his show. Most people on his show are pranked into thinking they'll be sued or lose their car; but black people are pranked into thinking that they stole something and will have to do federal time. Is this tasteful humor? Is this good entertainment? I don't think so. What do you think? Is this as mean as I think it is or is it just fun? is it okay to laugh at people when they are scared for their life? Tell me. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think he's racist. i just watched Punkd yesterday. Where Avril and Mike Jones were Punkd and yes the fake police was called in for Mike Jones' one but every Punk has to be different. i believe you may have over-thought it a bit :/	Entertainment & Music

If you go by what they say, there's no such thing as bad press (although Michael Richards might not agree with that).\n\nI do know that it is bad news for Britney's children. If she's out all night (or late into the night), who's watching the kids??? Maybe she wants K-Fed to have custody after all. Although that would not be an ideal situation for the kids--who am I kidding, neither Britney nor K-Fed are mature enough to be raising kids. Hopefully, Britney got it out of her system the other night and will focus on taking care of her children (but I doubt it)	Entertainment & Music

question_title: How to cross the river? [SEP] question_content: There is a man, with a deer, a lion and a cabbage. All four have to cross the river, but of course, only the man can row.

How will the man cross the river so that nothing is eaten up in his absence and everyone gets to cross the river? Remember he can only carry one other thing/animal with him at a time. [SEP] best_answer: First he brings the deer over.  He goes back and brings the lion over.  He brings the deer back.  He brings the cabbage over.

When Adam stayed out very late for a few nights, Eve became upset. \n\n"You're running around with other women," she charged. \n\n"You're being unreasonable," Adam responded. "You're the only woman on earth." The quarrel continued until Adam fell asleep, only to be awakened by someone poking him in the chest. It was Eve. \n\n"What do you think you're doing?" Adam demanded. \n\n"Counting your ribs!"\n\n\nThis husband and wife are staying in a hotel, and after a romantic evening wining and dining they go off to bed. However, as soon as they settled down, the man (not quite ready for slumber) leans over and whispers softly, "Hey snuggle boopy boops, your lickle hubby wubby isn't quite ready for bye-byes yet." \n\nThe wife takes the hint and says, "OK, but I have to use the bathroom first." So off she goes but on her way back she trips over a piece of carpet and lands flat on her face.\n\nHer husband jumps up and exclaims in a concerned tone "Oh my little honey bunny, is your nosey-wosey all right?" \n\nNo harm is done, so she jumps into bed and they have mad passionate sex for three hours. Afterwards, the wife goes off to the bathroom again, but on her way she trips over the same piece of carpet and again lands flat on her face on the floor. \n\nHer husband looks over and grunts "Clumsy b***h."\n\n\nHOW TO SATISFY A WOMAN:\nCaress, praise, pamper, relish, savor, massage, make plans, fix, empathize, serenade, compliment, support, feed, tantalize, bathe, humor, placate, stimulate, jiffylube, stroke, console, purr, hug, coddle, excite, pacify, protect, phone, correspond, anticipate, nuzzle, smooch, toast, minister to, forgive, sacrifice for, ply, accessorize, leave, return, beseech, sublimate, entertain, charm, lug, drag, crawl, show equality for, spackle, oblige, fascinate, attend, implore, bawl, shower, shave, trust, grovel, ignore, defend, coax, clothe, brag about, acquiesce, aromatize, fuse, fizz, rationalize, detoxify, sanctify, help, acknowledge, polish, upgrade, spoil, embrace, accept, butter-up, hear, understand, jitterbug, locomote, beg, plead, borrow, steal, climb, swim, nurse, resuscitate, repair, patch, crazy-glue, respect, entertain, calm, allay, kill for, die for, dream of, promise, deliver, tease, flirt, commit, enlist, pine, cajole, Anglicize, murmur, snuggle, snoozle, snurfle, elevate, enervate, alleviate, spotweld, serve, rub, rib, salve, bite, taste, nibble, gratify, take her places, scuttle like a crab on the ocean floor of her existence, diddle, doodle, hokey-pokey, hanky-panky, crystal blue persuade, flip, flop, fly, don't care if I die, swing, slip, slide, slather, mollycoddle, squeeze, moisturize, humidify, lather, tingle, slam-dunk, keep on rockin' in the free world, wet, slicken, undulate, gelatinize, brush, tingle, dribble, drip, dry, knead, fluff, fold, blue-coral wax, ingratiate, indulge, wow, dazzle, amaze, flabbergast, enchant, idolize and worship, and then go back, and start again. \n\nHOW TO SATISFY A MAN:\nShow up naked with food.\n\n\nA young couple is out carousing one evening.

question_title: who would win a fight between wolverine and apocolypse? [SEP] question_content: i am talking about the x men characters [SEP] best_answer: Apocalypse. This fight won't even take more than 5 minutes if Apocalypse wanted. First of all I have to say that Wolverine is one of the best mutants out there. Plus he has his healing factor, which helps him all the time when he fights. However, the power that Apocalypse has it's unmeasurable. He in not only the oldest and baddest mutant alive but he is immortal as well. He can change shape, size, he can teleport, live without food, air, water, he can blast, oh man, what can't Apocalypse do. So all those said, even if some people might argue that if Apocalypse blasts off Wolverine, he might heal, then all Apocalypse has to do is to teleport Wolverine on a planet without air, or a deserted one. If not, he could just make Wolverine give all that he has until he passes out of tierdness. \n\nWinner: Apocalypse	Entertainment & Music

question_title: What is the purpose of the temporal lobe? [SEP] question_content: I suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosic. I was wondering what problems this can cause having my right temporal lobe removed? [SEP] best_answer: Function\nThe superior temporal gyrus includes an area (within the Sylvian fissure) where auditory signals from the cochlea (relayed via several subcortical nuclei) first reach the cerebral cortex. This part of the cortex (primary auditory cortex) is involved in hearing. Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior and lateral parts of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. In humans this includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes plays a key role (in tandem with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low-level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions.\n\nThe underside (ventral) part of the temporal cortices appear to be involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli such as faces (fusiform gyrus) and scenes (parahippocampal gyrus). Anterior parts of this ventral stream for visual processing are involved in object perception and recognition.\n\nThe medial temporal lobes (near the sagittal plane that divides left and right cerebral hemispheres) are thought to be involved in episodic/declarative memory. Deep inside the medial temporal lobes, the hippocampi seem to be particularly important for memory function, and they also seem to play a part in controlling spatial behavior	Health

Whether you feel safe and understood by the individual who you see.\n\n   And unfortunately that seems to be a personal quality, and simply not something they can teach in school.\n\n   I guess the point I want to make is that while those who have more schooling may indeed have more training, at the same time.....all the training in the world is not going to help if you don't feel safe or connected with the person you are putting your trust in.\n\n  When it comes to something as personal as you mental health, generally your best bet is to "interview" several therapists first, and go with the one who feels like the best fit for you.\n\n   Just my two cents,\n\n   Bob J.

question_title: Does anyone know how glycoproteins supplements help hearing loss? [SEP] question_content: I have a friend who suggested my 20 month old niece take glyconutrients to improve her hearing loss she has had since birth. However, I cannot find any articles which has researched this. I am not sure where to go to find out if glyconutrients or glycoprotein supplements do help indeed. Please direct me if you know or have experience with this personally. Thanks in advance. [SEP] best_answer: glycoproteins are basically sugar molecules that attach to proteins in the body.  ogliosaccharides is the term i think.  anyway glycoproteins help signal the cells in the body basically to do their job and help the body to function.  people who could have a deffiency in these could suffer from a multiple of disorders or problems, one of them being hearing loss.  however this med hasnt officially been approved for this treatment, which is probably the reason in which you cannot find any research on it, and to some extent, i wouldnt believe everything i read on the web anyway.  there are places that sell them on the web, but i dont if i would go there, i would first before anything have her parents talk to her pediatrician.  i wouldnt even know if they would be safe for someone her age to take.

question_title: Symptoms of what? [SEP] question_content: I have been experiencing brain fog and neuropathy (extremely little, but still there) I have low blood sugar but I am a diabetec. What might I have? [SEP] best_answer: The question that I have for for you is: are you an insulin dependent diabetic or do you take an oral medication to regulate your blood sugar? Low blood sugar can be indicative of a change needed in the regulation of your insulin. Perhaps you are on too high of a dose. This can cause a drop in blood sugar levels. Another cause for low blood sugar is taking in too many carbohydrates, which would first raise the blood sugar, then lower it, sometimes to a unsettlingly low level.  Blood sugar fluctuations can also cause what you refer to as "brain fog," particularly when it gets low. I'm sure you know that diabetes is a condition that is not to be taken lightly. It can affect nearly all organs in the body. Neuropathy is common in someone who suffers from diabetes. Neuropathy can cause permanent nerve damage so it is very important to check in with your physician or an endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes and notify them of any symptoms you are experiencing. Diabetes is manageable, but it is important to stay on top of new physical symptoms, as well as maintaining a good diet and exercise program.  I can appreciate your concerns, as I have diabetes myself. Good luck to you!	Health

question_title: what is an apgar score?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A score given to newborn babies evaluating their breathing, skin color, etc. See the following: \n\nThe very first test given to your newborn, the Apgar score occurs right after your baby's birth in the delivery or birthing room. The test was designed to quickly evaluate a newborn's physical condition after delivery and to determine any immediate need for extra medical or emergency care.\n\nAlthough the Apgar score was developed in 1952 by an anesthesiologist named Virginia Apgar, you may have also heard it referred to as an acronym for: Activity, Pulse, Grimace, Appearance, and Respiration.\n\nThe Apgar test is usually given to your baby twice: once at 1 minute after birth, and again at 5 minutes after birth. Rarely, if there are serious problems with the baby's condition and the first two scores are low, the test may be scored for a third time at 10 minutes after birth.\n\nFive factors are used to evaluate the baby's condition and each factor is scored on a scale of 0 to 2:\n\nheart rate (pulse) \nbreathing (rate and effort) \nactivity and muscle tone \ngrimace response (medically known as "reflex irritability") \nappearance (skin coloration) \nDoctors, midwives, or nurses add these five factors together to calculate the Apgar score. Scores obtainable are between 10 and 0, with 10 being the highest possible score.\n\nThe midwife at my homebirths used it too. If there'd been a problem we'd have gone to the hospital right away. This test is useful by the experienced. My midwife wasn't concerned that the first baby's head was shaped a little like a banana and his skin was a pretty purple! Lol. He was fine. Buttercup	Health

[SEP] question_content: i just got a bridge done for my tooth.\nit's a temporary one until i align my teeth with retainers and then i am going to put in an implant. however, the color is very .... unnatural? so in order for them to look uniform, i was thinking of whitening my teeth with colgate brushons or the white strips from crest. \n\ncan bridged tooth be whitened at home? how about implants?/ [SEP] best_answer: i have been in the dental field for about 20 years.  No unnatural teeth will lighten with any bleaching material.  sometimes it changes the shade a LITTLE bit because it removes stain. Hopefully this doc has enough experience in implants to complete this procedure with the utmost natural look for you. Most of the time the dentist will make a semi custom temp that closely matches the natural teeth nearby. Best thing to do is  make SURE the dentist takes a close match shade check on the adjoining teeth before this final impression is completed.  My feeling about this is just that the doc made a crappy temp.  It doesnt have to be this way.....and make sure you ask LOTS of questions about the implant....long and expensive procedure....BUT if you have healthy gums and bone, its the very best way to restore a lost tooth.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A personality disorder is identified \n\nby a pervasive pattern of experience and behavior that is abnormal with respect to any two of the following:\n\nthinking, mood, personal relations, \n\nand the control of impulses.\n\n \n\nThe character of a person is shown through his or her personality -- by the way an individual thinks, feels, and behaves.  When the behavior is inflexible, maladaptive, and antisocial, then that individual is diagnosed with a personality disorder. \n\n \n\nMost personality disorders begin as problems in personal development and character which peak during adolescence and then are defined as personality disorders. \n\n \n\nPersonality disorders are not illnesses in a strict sense as they do not disrupt emotional, intellectual, or perceptual functioning.  However, those with personality disorders suffer a life that is not positive, proactive, or fulfilling.  Not surprisingly, personality disorders are also  associated with failures to reach potential.\n\n \n\nThe DSM-IV-TR: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, defines a personality disorder as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectation of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.\n\n \n\nCurrently, there are 10 distinct personality disorders identified in the DSM-IV:\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder:  Lack of regard for the moral or legal standards in the local culture, marked inability to get along with others or abide by societal rules.  Sometimes called psychopaths or sociopaths. \n\nAvoidant Personality Disorder:  Marked social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and extremely sensitive to criticism. \n\nBorderline Personality Disorder:  Lack of one's own identity, with rapid changes in mood, intense unstable interpersonal relationships, marked impulsively, instability in affect and in self image. \n\nDependent Personality Disorder:  Extreme need of other people, to a point where the person is unable to make any decisions or take an independent stand on his or her own. Fear of separation and submissive behavior. Marked lack of decisiveness and self-confidence. \n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder:  Exaggerated and often inappropriate displays of emotional reactions, approaching theatricality, in everyday behavior. Sudden and rapidly shifting emotion expressions. \n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder:  Behavior or a fantasy of grandiosity, a lack of empathy, a need to be admired by others, an inability to see the viewpoints of others, and hypersensitive to the opinions of others. \n\nObsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder:  Characterized by perfectionism and inflexibility; preoccupation with uncontrollable patterns of thought and action. \n\nParanoid Personality Disorder:  Marked distrust of others, including the belief, without reason, that others are exploiting, harming, or trying to deceive him or her; lack of trust; belief of others' betrayal; belief in hidden meanings; unforgiving and grudge holding. \n\nSchizoid Personality Disorder:  Primarily characterized by a very limited range of emotion, both in expression of and experiencing; indifferent to social relationships. \n\nSchizotypal Personality Disorder:   Peculiarities of thinking, odd beliefs, and eccentricities of appearance,  behavior, interpersonal style, and thought (e.g., belief in psychic phenomena and having magical powers). \n\nAccording to Dr. Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self-Love: Narcissism Revisited, individuals with personality disorders have many things in common (see The Interrelationship Between Personality Disorders):\n\nSelf-centeredness that manifests itself through a me-first, self-preoccupied attitude \n\nLack of individual accountability that results in a victim mentality and blaming others, society and the univ	Health

Then when I got off it, I was so tired. [Like cancer patiants should be.] She might just be tired because cancer takes a lot out of people.

question_title: Worried could have HIV/AIDS? [SEP] question_content: A month or two ago I developed a bad blister in my mouth which is not unusual for me however it lastest several weeks. At the time I put it down to stress/being run down. \nI went to S Ireland last week with family and was generally feeling very confused within myself but physically felt fine, had overly high appetite. I had come down with a bad outbreak of cold/flu however and since I have got back I got back home I have lost at least half stone of weight suddenly, I have swollen neck glands, sore throat, inflammed taste buds, very weak arms/legs, slight irratation below and feeling generally exhausted. Doctors think it could be to do with my thyroid/hormones or a continuing virus however I am concerned it could be an STD as my previous partner of about 5-6 months ago cheated on me with someone who was very rough and hung around with druggie types and he performed oral sex on me and on one occasion kissed me when he had been bleeding slightly from mouth. [SEP] best_answer: You sound so scared so lets see if we cant help you a little, first dont panic i know but please this makes you ill and your sytoms worse which may well be the case right now.The truth is the risk of aids  is low and the only way to know is a test. Yes scary but it will put an end to all of this. In your phone book there will be a number of a clinic the nhs is your in the uk has private test centres within the hospital they have councilors who can talk to you can tell you of the risks. And help you deal with what is happening and how you feel, it will help. While at the clinic they will also run other test at the same time so then you will know for sure. At this point i will tell you that if you have std it can and will be treated it is not the end of the world, just a huge learning curve for you. Also remember having a cold or flu does not mean that you are ill with anything else, it may of just knocked you side ways and took alittle longer to run its course and you were travelling as well, so your body have of slowed down. There is only one thing to do and that is call your hospital, no one has to know and you dont even have to be called your real name when you get there and no one has to know, but you need to go and get checked out. Remember it may be nothing, it does not sound like hiv or aids, the chances are so so remote and if its std you can be treated. Take care and good luck.	Health
question_title: why there is blood in teeth? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I'm not really sure what you're asking.  But, there is in fact blood in everyone's teeth.  You shouldn't be able to see the blood from the outside of the tooth in a healthy tooth.  Every tooth has a pulp chamber (the root canal) filled with blood and nerves.  The teeth need nutrients and hydration just like every other part of your body.  \n\nIf you see blood when you are brushing your teeth, then you have gingivitis.  Bleeding gums are not healthy.  Brushing twice daily and flossing once a day will treat the gingivitis.  Also rinsing ONCE a day with Listerine or Crest Pro-Health Rinse can treat gingivitis.  Do not rinse with Listerine three times a though as suggested above.  Listerine contains alcohol which can really dry your mouth out if used too often.  If you can't stand the burn of Listerine try Crest Pro-Health rinse.  It does not contain alcohol, and works as well as Listerine.	Health

Some women are deeper and/or wider than others, but don't let that discourage you or fool you into thinking you can't satisfy. Learn the about the female body and the ecspecially the exclusive area. Maybe you can get a specail thang that you do, that makes the ladies satified. Remember too.. If you don't have confidence in you and your performance it will show. Know that all women are different one may enjoy where the next may not, you may have a couple that will be future stalkers..lol..but serious learn about the female organ and learn how to get to that mental state with a woman, and get your own technique, master it, and always leave room for improvement.

question_title: What is in a flu shot? [SEP] question_content: What are its components? [SEP] best_answer: the Influenza Vaccine - the "flu shot' is made up of killed inactivated Influenza virus. It is grown in chicken egg culture and the antibiotic Neomycin is added to it to prevent bacterial growth and a small amount of thimersol (inorganic non-tox mercury) is added as a preservative. \n\nSo if you are allergic to eggs, have an allergy to neomycin or have had the disease Guillan-Barre (a rare neurological disease that has been linked to Influenza and Meningitis vaccinations), you should not receive it.\n\nOtherwise, I would definitely recommend it. \n\nhope this is helpful.

question_title: Did early humans eat meat? Are we designed to eat meat (intestines, etc.)? [SEP] question_content: It is my understanding that our intestines are not designed like those of true carnivores, for example, the tiger. There is evidence that meat eaters have higher rates of cancers, such as colorectal; however, it is not clear to me whether the culprit is the meat or the toxins we add to farmed animals. Assuming the meat is organic, I want to know if we are really supposed to eat meat. I have also heard that our ancestors' meat was different, because animals weren't farmed, and therefore their bodies were more muscular and the proteins/nutritional composition (??) were different. [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely, your body produces digestive enzymes and fluids that allow for the digestion of the high amounts of fat and proteins found in meat. With a few exceptions, humans are omnivores.\n\nYou may be right about the health problems associated with meat. A lot of the meats we eat are highly processed and not entirely healthy. Personally, I think meats are a superior protein source, bar none. Few vegetable sources can compete with meat and other animal products as substantial protein sources. Generally, I think meat is a great part of a normal diet, provided it's reasonably lean and eaten in reasonable moderation. \n\nI like the occasional plate of tofu. I just keep it low because it's a soy product. Soy is thought to raise estrogen levels in the bloodstream. This poses a problem for me and my efforts at body building. So, I stick to the meat and the dairy for most of my protein.	Health

Also I have huge red patches on the under parts of my breasts where I sweat badly because my breasts now sag and because they are large. I wear cotton bras. Any remedies? [SEP] best_answer: After you take a shower try applying an antibiotic ointment that is petrolatum based until the sores are healed.  Then use a good cream like Avveno daily.  This works in both area's.  Also get undies that have cloth around the elastic like fruit of the loom for ladies.  Get some new well fitting bra's the lift...  If this doesn't start to clear up after a week or so you might want to talk to your doctor.   You could develop a bad infection.

[SEP] best_answer: A bump on your penis can be many different things. Of course, the most frightening things that it could be are STDs. This is why going to a doctor for a diagnosis is so important. Depending on the differences in what the bump on your penis looks like, it could be one of several different STDs, or it could be none of them. For example, most bumps that are related to herpes look more like blisters, so if you have bumps that do not appear to be blisters, you probably don’t have herpes. However, you should still get it checked out.  \n\nThere are other things that cause a bump on your penis. The most common, however, is simply blocked hair follicles. This problem can cause bumps anywhere on the body, not just the genital area (although it’s much more worrisome when it occurs in the genital area). While you should still go and see a doctor, generally the only treatment for blocked follicles is to wash gently and to be careful not to scratch or use lotions that can cause the skin to be more broken up.

Lots of rehab places will work with you on payments.  He did not even begin to try to detox.  Trying for 3 days is a waste.  He needs to go and stay there until he's well again.

question_title: Does a vasectomy  make sex any different?  Does loss of ejaculate fluid make orgasm less pleasurable? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The amount of semen that is sperm is only about two percent.  The rest is the whitish fluid you have likely observed after having sex.  The difference is too small for you or your lover to notice, so it is not possible to feel any different.  A vasectomy leaves no scar, and therefore nothing looks or feels different.  The only way to tell, is to put some of your semen under a microscope.  Nothing will be different.\n\nYou could potentially have a vasectomy, then later, hook up with a woman, and never tell her that you had it.  She will never know, except for the fact that she will never become pregnant.  \n\nI had mine 20 years ago, and have been married twice, since.  I have no children, and have had a lot of sex during that time. I know lots of men that had them, and not a single one had problems.\n\nNow for the psychological part.  My brother works in the mental health field, so I asked him about your question.  Some men can get all emotional, about a vasectomies, and have issues.  If you are the super alpha male egotistical type, that considers women inferior, then you might have issues with a vasectomy because such type tend to associate it with castration.  Remember that such is a psychological issue, not a physical one.	Health

question_title: What are the chance of a mistake on a pap-smear test? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What are false positive and false negative results? \nThe Pap test is a screening test and, like any such test, it is not 100-percent accurate. Although false positive and false negative results do not occur very often, they can cause anxiety and can affect a woman’s health.\n\nA false positive Pap test means that a patient is told she has abnormal cells, but the cells are actually normal. A false negative Pap test occurs when a specimen is called normal, but the woman has a significant abnormality that was missed. A false negative Pap test may delay the diagnosis and treatment of a precancerous condition. However, regular screening helps to compensate for the false negative result. If abnormal cells are missed at one time, chances are good that the cells will be detected the next time.\n\nWhat methods are being developed to improve the accuracy of Pap tests? \nIn April 1996, the Consensus Development Conference on Cervical Cancer, which was convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), concluded that about half of false negative Pap tests are due to inadequate specimen collection. The other half are due to a failure to identify or interpret the specimens correctly. Although the conventional Pap test is effective in the majority of cases, the conference made it clear that new methods of collecting and reading specimens are needed to reduce the number of false negatives.\n\nThe Bethesda System requires laboratories to determine whether there are enough cervical cells in the specimen to make a proper evaluation. This requirement helps improve the quality of samples and sample collection. The Bethesda System requires a sample to be categorized as “satisfactory for evaluation” or “unsatisfactory for evaluation.”\n\nOne new method of collecting and analyzing samples is called liquid-based thin-layer slide preparation. This method may make it easier to screen for abnormal cells. Cervical cells are collected with a brush or other collection instrument. The instrument is rinsed in a vial of liquid preservative. The vial is sent to a laboratory, where an automated thin-layer slide device prepares the slide for viewing. Results of this method suggest that it is comparable to, or more sensitive than, standard Pap tests for the detection of significant abnormalities.\n\nComputer automated readers are also being used to improve the reading of Pap tests. This technology uses a microscope that conveys a cellular image to a computer, which analyzes the image for the presence of abnormal cells.	Health

If you have generalized anxiety (excessive worry or fear) he may per scribe an SSRI like the anti-depressant you were already on.	Health

But i want to lose it fast, cause i'm getting fitted for my dress (im one of the bridesmaids) in a couple of months, and if i keep losing it gradually, i'll have to keep bringing the dress back for adjustments. I'm not overweight, im 5'3 and i weigh 62 kilo's. Its just that the dress is going to be tight and i wanna lose weight around my hips and stomach.. anyone know how i can do this fast?

question_title: Is it possible for one boob, to be bigger then the other? [SEP] question_content: I was just wondering! [SEP] best_answer: Not only is it possible, it is pretty normal -- our bodies are not mirror-image perfect, by any means, and tend to develop more on one side than the other.  A right-handed person will be more developed and stronger on the right side.   A significant difference in size could have something to do with how much exercise that side of the body gets.  For example, a right-handed tennis player or bowler -- or anyone who does a lot of work with the right hand -- will tend to develop more and have some increased muscle bulk (pecs) on the right (active) side, ergo, a larger breast on that side.  Many women notice one breast will swell more during menstrual cycles, and benign conditions such as fiberous tissue or cystisis could make one breast larger.  Women who have nursed babies frequently notice a difference in size between breasts.   However, it never hurts to have the doctor check to make sure it isn't something else if you are really concerned.	Health

question_title: any feedback on total immune booster? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The "total immune booster" is a unique product, designed to allow the immune system to recover from the ravages of everyday living. \n The "total immune booster" contains 5 key ingredients: \n...Allisure®, a patented stabilized allicin garlic extract. \n...Biosure®, a full eco-system probiotic \n...Swedish flower pollen \n...Chinese wolfberry \n...Whole glucan particulate beta 1, 3-d glucan \n While the overall strength of the human immune system is dependant on many factors, researchers are now convinced that one of the keys is a healthy intestinal tract. \nWithin a healthy intestinal tract are hundreds of different species of "beneficial bacteria" called microorganisms. \n\nThere are trillions of these micro-organisms and the play a vital role in: \n\nthe production of b vitamins. \n\nThe production of enzymes. \n\nThe digestion and absorption of nutrients. \n\nThe production of many immune factors. \n\nIf these microorganisms are depleted or missing altogether then we become susceptible to a wide range of diseases. \n\nUnfortunately, our lifestyle today is continually killing these beneficial organisms. \n\nThe chlorine in our drinking water kills them. \n\nThe antibiotics in the meat we eat kills them. \n\nMany pain-relief medications kill them. \n\nThe antibiotics our doctors over prescribe every time we get sick absolutely slaughter hundreds of billions of them. \n\nAnd we then wonder why we regularly get sick, why we have no energy, why we feel run down and why we just plain hurt. \n\nUntil now, the accepted solution to these problems has been to supplement with a simple "probiotic" product. \n\nThere are many of these supplements available, and most of them have a very limited beneficial effect due to the way they are manufactured. \n\nThey typically provide only 4-10 different types of microorganisms that have all been cultured separately and then blended together in the product. \n\nThis approach does not work effectively as the human body requires microorganisms that have been cultured together in a complete eco-system for optimum effectiveness. \n\nThe "total immune booster" is light years ahead of these other so-called "probiotic products" \n\ningredient.........................

question_title: Girls is the new Silicone in implants alot safer than the previous Silicone... why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I understand that the primary difference between the silicone implants of today and those of the past are twofold.  One, the actual mambrane that holds the silicone is stronger, sometimes double layered and some are now more naturally shaped as well. The silicone itself is now a gel, not a liquid.  It has properties that make it want to bind together and therfore, if an implant were to tear, the gel stays together and doesn't spread throughout the body.  You should speak to a doctor, of course, but I believe the above to be correct.	Health

question_title: How can I incorporate more vegetables into my 4 year old son's diet.? [SEP] question_content: Like most kids, he won't go near them....but I believe the principles of a healthy life start in childhood.  Please include any receipies or ways I can "disguise" the veggies.  Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: Our 10 year old has been like that for a long time. We are all lacto- vegetarian and grow most of our food here too.  I have to blend-hide all sorts of veggies into everything we make (esp dark greens like kale, spinach, collards. We also grind up broccolli, cauliflower, carrots, misc squash in our misc recipes too.)  We are great at hiding so much stuff in and he never knows! We are amazed at how many awesome veggies we get into each gallon of spaghetti sauce or a vegetarian sloppy joe type sauce! As long as the sauce is mostly red in color and not too green we get away with it! He is sensitive to herbs I use too, so little by little I add more and he is adjusting and developing gradually, a more sophisticated palate. I use a Vita Mix and both the small hand held blenders, but any blenders can work.\n\nHe is good about the fruit.\n\nNow that he is ten and learning more details about nutrition as a science, we are asking him to start logging his diet into a computer program so he can see how high or low he was in his misc daily nutrients. He will be in fifth grade and he is good on the computer, so we are starting that this fall. (I have been a nutriton prof for decades) If he refuses to eat what we make for him, he is not allowed to make any of his favorites like ramen noodles or mac and cheese unless he adds a cup of veggies to it. I hope to teach him how to make some foods he has liked so he can take pride in his nutriton and skill in making something.\n\nWe make the following:\n\nvegetarian chili (lots of veggies in the sauce blended in!)\nveggie burgers (with lots of veggies to add on top like tomatoes, spinach leaves, cucumbers, grated carrots)\nsloppy joes with TVP (veggies hidden in sauce)\nspaghetti sauce with TVP (veggies hidden in sauce)\npizza (with lots of veggies hidden in sauce) he picks veggies to put on pizza...self serve veggie toppings before we put it in the oven\nstir fries with his favorite veggies\nraw finger veggies he likes with a healthy salad dressing type dip\nfalafels with pita bread and he puts his "salad" in the pocket\nbean tostadas with lots of "salad" for him to put on top\nwhite bean soup in a spagheti sauce type sauce (lots of veggies blended in)\nvegetarian eggless quiches with lots of veggies he likes\nveggie tempura type thing with different indian spices in the batter\n\nThese have worked great.  If he lived alone he would probably just eat junk, but gradually he will learn what he needs to know.	Health

question_title: "LIFO makes for a smaller tax under conditions of inflation". Can you please give me an example? [SEP] question_content: Can you give me an example? With the tax rate of e.g. 10% ? [SEP] best_answer: Suppose that you are making some product. \n\nSuppose you have two inventory choices -- LIFO or FIFO.  Inflation is causing you to pay more for parts.  If you make a new product, you take parts out of inventory.  You sell the product for the going rate.  The inventory system youuse doesn't affect the amount you take in.  But it does affect the cost of making the product.  \n\nYour profit is the sales price minus the cost of making the good.  If you use LIFO, then your cost will be the new price of the parts.  If you use FIFO, then the cost will be the old, lower, price of the parts.  Using LIFO means that your profits are lower.  Since you only have to pay taxes on your profits, your taxes are lower.

question_title: jonathon kozol? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: onathan Kozol was born in Boston in 1936 into a traditional middle-class Jewish family. Kozol's father worked as a neurologist and psychiatrist, and his mother was a social worker. Kozol attended Harvard and later Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and then lived in Paris in poor neighborhoods for several years while he worked on a novel.\n\nA defining moment in Kozol's life occurred in 1964 when, shortly after returning to Boston to pursue an academic career, he heard about three young civil-rights workers who had been murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. He had never been political or had any involvement in race issues, but he was greatly affected by the news. Soon after hearing of this event he began working as a teacher in a freedom school that had been set up in a black church in a low-income, predominantly black area in Roxbury, just south of Boston.\n\nKozol has made a practice of leaving comfortable surroundings for more challenging, impoverished areas. He enjoyed teaching young children, and eventually got a job in the public school system in Roxbury teaching fourth grade. The segregated public school in Roxbury was very different from the school Kozol had attended as a child growing up in the wealthy Boston suburb of Newton. Shortly after he began teaching in the public school system, Kozol was fired for reading from a book of poetry by Langston Hughes that was not on the approved curriculum list. Soon after, he wrote his first work of nonfiction, Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools, based on his teaching experiences in Roxbury. The book won the National Book Award in 1968.\n\nKozol's books often involve first-hand accounts of his experiences. His books serve to bear witness to social problems such as segregated and unequal schools, illiteracy, and homelessness. Often Kozol succeeds in humanizing abstract social issues by involving the reader intimately with particular individuals who are directly affected by these issues.\n\nIn his most recent book, Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation, Kozol addresses the issues of race and poverty by exploring the lives of inner-city residents in the South Bronx. In a review for the Washington Post Book World, Marie Arana-Ward writes that it is "a powerful book that lays bare what is surely the ugliest truth about us: that there are pockets of hell in our inner cities, and that even as an entire sector of America is condemned to burn in them, we insist on looking the other way."\n\nKozol has said, "Of all my books, Amazing Grace means the most to me. It took the most out of me and was hardest to write, because it was the hardest to live through those experiences. I felt it would initially be seen as discouraging but, ultimately, sensitive readers would see the resilient and transcendent qualities of children and some mothers in the book-that it would be seen as a book about the elegant theology of children. That's what happened finally. The most moving comments about it also pointed to its moral and religious texture."\n\nKozol currently lives with his dog Sweetie Pie in a 200 year-old farmhouse in Byfield, Massachusetts.\n\nJonathan Kozol has received the following awards:\n\nRhodes Scholar, 1958-59; Olympia Award, 1962; Sexton fellowship in creative writing from Harper & Row, 1962; National Book Award, 1968, for Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools; Guggenheim fellow, 1970 and 1984; Field Foundation fellow, 1972; Ford Foundation fellow, 1974; Rockefeller fellow, 1978 and 1983; Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, 1988; Conscience in Media Award, American Society of Journalists and Authors, 1988; Christopher Award, 1988, for Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America; New England Book Award, and National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, both 1992, both for Savage Inequalities:	Education & Reference

question_title: who is charles martel? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: CHARLES MARTEL [Charles Martel] [O.Fr.,=Charles the Hammer], 688?-741, Frankish ruler, illegitimate son of Pepin of Heristal and grandfather of Charlemagne. After the death of his father (714) he seized power in Austrasia from Pepin's widow, who was ruling as regent for her grandsons, and became mayor of the palace. He subsequently subdued the W Frankish kingdom of Neustria and began the reconquest of Burgundy, Aquitaine, and Provence. Charles Martel defeated the Spanish Muslims at the battle of Tours (732-33) and began the military campaigns that reestablished the Franks as the rulers of Gaul. Although he never assumed the title of king, he divided the Frankish lands, like a king, between his sons Pepin the Short and Carloman\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nName: Charles Martel \nBirth Date: c. 690 \nDeath Date: October 22, 741 \nNationality: Frankish \nGender: Male \nOccupations: ruler \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCharles Martel Biography\n\nThe Frankish ruler Charles Martel (ca. 690-741) reestablished central authority in Francia and constructed a power base on which the Carolingian monarchs founded their empire.\n\nTo understand the historical importance of Charles Martel ("the Hammer"), it is necessary to appreciate the situation of the last Merovingian kings of Francia and to understand what historians generally refer to as the crisis of the mid-8th century, namely, the expansion of Islam and the sealing off of the Mediterranean. After the reign of Dagobert I (629-639) the Merovingian royal house was weakened by the fact that none of the later kings survived until manhood. Therefore in the 7th century the real power of government was exercised by the mayors of the palace. These officials controlled the royal treasury, dispersed patronage, and granted land and privileges in the name of the king.\n\nThe Merovingian kingdom in Gaul comprised two major subkingdoms, Neustria (the northwestern portion) and Austrasia (northeastern Gaul and the Rhineland), each of which was ruled by a mayor of the palace. The respective rulers of the two kingdoms fought bitterly for supremacy, and in 687 at the battle of Tetry, the Austrasian mayor, Pepin of Heristal, defeated the Neustrian mayor and united the two kingdoms. It was thus the task of Pepin and his son Charles Martel to restore centralized government in the Frankish kingdom and to combat the expanding power of Islam.\n\nCharles Martel was the illegitimate son of Pepin of Heristal and a noblewoman named Alpaide. When Pepin died in 714, Charles successfully asserted his claims to power over the resistance of Pepin's widow, Plectrude, and became mayor of the palace. Charles attracted and maintained a group of personal retainers who formed the core of the royal army. Most of his reign as mayor of the palace was spent in checking the expansion of the Saracens in southern France and in the Rhone-Saône Valley.\n\nIn October 732 Charles won a major victory against the Saracens outside Poitiers despite the fact that the invaders were mounted and the Franks were on foot. The battle, aside from temporarily checking the expansion of the Moslems, was of long-range significance because it was here that Charles became convinced of the necessity of cavalry. After Poitiers, Charles developed the cavalry as his primary offensive fighting force. This change, however, proved highly expensive, and the cost of supporting and training men on horseback led to the adoption of a means of support that had far-reaching consequences. Charles found it necessary to "borrow" considerable lands from the Church; he then dispersed these properties among his lay retainers. The old army of Frankish freemen became less important, and gradually a considerable social distinction developed between the mounted knight and the ordinary foot soldier. Thus the elite class of mounted warriors who dominated mediev	Education & Reference

question_title: What r the pros to carrying cell phones in School? [SEP] question_content: I am doing this for an English Assignment [SEP] best_answer: A cacophony of ringing cell phones is annoying anywhere, but in the classroom it's an unacceptable distraction. A decade ago, it would have been an unheard-of distraction, as well. Few adults owned or used cellular phones then, and even fewer children. \n\nBut times have changed. As the prices of cell phones fall, their use is growing, especially among teenagers. Increasingly, school boards are having to decide how to deal with students who bring these ubiquitous communication devices to school. \n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer to ban student use of cell phones in schools, but few policy decisions are that clear-cut. The necessity for banning another electronic communication device -- the pager -- has been widely understood and accepted. Cell phone bans, however, present a conundrum: During the Columbine shootings, students were able to call for help on their cell phones, drawing dramatic attention to the safety aspects of cell phones. \n\nInexpensive equipment and low-cost family service plans have made cell phones "affordable to just about anyone," says Lisa Ihde, manager of wireless education programs at the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association in Washington, D.C. Parents want the phones, says Ihde, to communicate with their children throughout the day. The association doesn't know how many of the phones that parents buy go to their children, but anecdotally, cell phone use by teens seems to be on the rise. \n\nSchool boards can find themselves at odds with parents or their communities when forming policies about student cell phones, despite the conviction held by many educators that student cell phones do not belong in school. "Cell phones ringing during a class would be very distracting to the learning environment," says Mary Beth King, vice president of the Plano, Texas, school board. "We are committed to maintaining the sanctity of the classroom." \n\nEven among those who endorse cell phone restrictions, there is disagreement. Some educators believe only a total ban will prevent disruptions. Others argue that bans don't teach children to use technology like cell phones responsibly.\n\n\nCommunity support: \n\nSome school boards have faced dissenting parents over the ban, while others have earned community support. The Plano Independent School District has banned electronic communication devices since 1995. Board vice president King says the board put the policy in place before many students had access to cell phones or pagers. \n\n"Parents have been very understanding about the policy and supportive of [there being] no disruptions in student learning," says King. "We are also very good about facilitating communication, should a parent need to reach the child during the school day." \n\nIn Franklin, Wis., the school board first banned pagers, then broadened the policy to include two-way electronic communication devices. Dave Szychlinski, president of the Franklin School Board, says the broad language was necessary because it could include up-and-coming technology, such as handheld computers like Palm Pilots. "Students functioned well before cell phones," says Szychlinski. "They're not necessary for students in their daily activities." \n\nBefore the Cobb County (Ga.) School Board banned pagers and cell phones in 1997, teachers complained that students interrupted class when they forgot to turn off their beepers or ringers. Also, students talked on the phones between classes. \n\nBoard member Curt Johnston says parents were unhappy at first, but became used to the rule. On the other hand, students complained that they were being punished for the misbehavior of only a few students, a point he sees as valid. "I would prefer to confiscate devices and charge in-school suspensions for in-school users or disrupters on a case-by-case basis," says Johnston, "but not ban possession by students who use them responsibl	Education & Reference

A child that has less than a 20 min. attention span is sometimes held back, alot of it depends on the teacher. I have found teacher's that expect a 3-4 year old to sit still in their seats and quiet for 30 mins. at a time and that is not normal for a 3-4 year old. A preschool teacher needs to have something different going on about every fifteen mins. When I was teaching preschool my 3 year olds could write their names after the first month of school, count to 20, and memorize the poem of the week by Wednesday. My 4 year old students were taking simple spelling and math(adding and subtracting # 1-20 with no barrowing) by Christmas break. I taught a small class that can also be the key to good learning. My class was never over 14 students. Hope this helps !!	Education & Reference
question_title: Who is Henry Lee Lucas of Virginia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Henry Lee Lucas was born on Aug. 23, 1936, in the back woods of Virginia, near a small community named Blacksburg in the Appalachians. He lived with his family in a two-room log cabin with dirt floors. His alcoholic parents brewed moonshine whiskey, and his mother, Viola, ruled her family with an iron rod, often forcing her children to work on the still.\n\nHis father, Anderson, gained the nickname "No Legs" in a drunken spree that resulted in his losing both of his legs in a freight train accident. Afterwards, he occasionally sold pencils on street corners while Viola turned tricks for extra cash. Lucas had eight brothers and sisters, many of whom were farmed out over the years to institutions, relatives, and foster homes. For some reason, Viola kept Henry at home. She often beat him, along with his father, occasionally forcing them to watch her sexual endeavors with strangers. Sickened by one such episode, Anderson dragged himself outside to spend the night in the cold where he contracted a fatal case of pneumonia.\n\nWhen Lucas entered school in 1943, Viola sometimes sent him off in a dress and ringlets — and always shoeless. When Lucas returned home from school one day wearing a pair of shoes his teacher had given him, Viola severely beat him for accepting the gift.\n\nAs a teenager, he reported having sex with his half-brother and with animals whose throats they slit first. At 17, one of Lucas' brothers accidentally struck him in the left eye with a knife. He suffered at home for several days until someone finally took him to a doctor who removed the eye and replaced it with prosthetic glass.\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nAs Lucas grew older, he became bitter and distant. Malnourished and uneducated, he never developed an ability to assign value to life. He spent his teen years in and out of jail, beginning in 1954 when he was arrested for a string of burglaries near Richmond, Va. Lucas was sentenced to six years in the Virginia State Prison, but on Sept. 14, 1957, he escaped from a road gang and fled to his older sister's home in Tecumseh, Mich. Three months later, he was recaptured and returned to Virginia where he attempted another escape a month later. This time he was caught the same day. Despite the two escapes, Lucas was released on Sept. 2, 1959, one year early. He went back to live with his sister in Tecumseh where he was plagued by calls from his mother, insisting that he return to live with her in Virginia. When he refused, Viola followed him to Michigan.\n\nDeadly Revenge\n\nOn the night of Jan. 11, 1960, Lucas and his mother went to drink at a local bar. "I was pretty well drunk when she started arguing with me, wanting me to go back to live with her to Virginia, but I told her I didn't want nothing to do with her," Lucas remembers more than 20 years later.\n\nWhen they left for home, still arguing, they took the dispute to an upstairs bedroom and railed at each other into the early hours of the following morning. At one point, Viola hit Lucas with a broom. He struck back with a knife. When the fight was over, 74-year-old Viola was dead. The next day, she was found on the bedroom floor with a fatal stab wound in her neck. Lucas, who was immediately suspected, was nowhere to be found.\n\nFive days later, he was spotted in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n"I was picked up by a state trooper and he said I looked kinda funny with a big, heavy coat on. He said, ‘Well, you just look suspicious, ya know,'" Lucas recalled during an American Justice interview more than 30 years later.\n\nWhile running a routine check, the trooper learned that the heavily clad visitor was wanted in Michigan on a murder charge. When Lucas was locked up, he confessed to murdering his mother and raping the corpse. Lucas wrote in a statement: "I had a knife in my hand, but I do not know if the blade was opened or closed. I do not know if I got the pocketknife from my pocket or just had it in my hand. Whe	Education & Reference

question_title: How to write a persuasive essay? Thesis statement is "People today can improve their health.? [SEP] question_content: I have the following categories to choose from: firsthand observations, informed opinions, examples, resasons, facts, and statistics. I am stuck on where to begin. Help!!!! [SEP] best_answer: You have quite a few options to choose from.  I am not sure if you have to use each one - observation, opinions, etc. or just choose one??   It would seem to me that using a combination would be most effective, but if you have to choose one and it is a persuasive essay you want to choose the one that is most likely to win the argument - I think that would be one with facts and stats.\n\nHowever, I would probably prefer to start with some informed opinions such as "Dr. ??? states that ...." and go from there.   That often seems to be a more friendly way to start.   Obviously you will need to find data to back up the opinions.  \n\nProvide data to show how various changes in lifestyle have improved health of individuals - exercise, stopping smoking. less alcohol, losing weight, changing risky behavior (promiscuity, taking drugs), nutritious diet, taking appropriate medication (to lower cholesterol, thyroid meds, insulin, etc.).  You could probably pick a few of these and devote a paragraph to each.\n\nI hope these thoughts are of some help.	Education & Reference

I thought he was the one with the glasses? Well...look here:\nhttp://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/canalysis.html\n\nRalph is the athletic, charismatic protagonist of Lord of the Flies. Elected the leader of the boys at the beginning of the novel, Ralph is the primary representative of order, civilization, and productive leadership in the novel. While most of the other boys initially are concerned with playing, having fun, and avoiding work, Ralph sets about building huts and thinking of ways to maximize their chances of being rescued. For this reason, Ralph’s power and influence over the other boys are secure at the beginning of the novel. However, as the group gradually succumbs to savage instincts over the course of the novel, Ralph’s position declines precipitously while Jack’s rises. Eventually, most of the boys except Piggy leave Ralph’s group for Jack’s, and Ralph is left alone to be hunted by Jack’s tribe. Ralph’s commitment to civilization and morality is strong, and his main wish is to be rescued and returned to the society of adults. In a sense, this strength gives Ralph a moral victory at the end of the novel, when he casts the Lord of the Flies to the ground and takes up the stake it is impaled on to defend himself against Jack’s hunters.

This is because Papert did his doctoral dissertation at the University of the Witwaterstrand.  He defended in 1952.  \n\nPiaget was teaching at the University of Geneva in the late forties and early fifties, and went to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1952.\n\nOne's advisor must be attached to one's institution.

question_title: Can u suggest me how to memorize things better? [SEP] question_content: Dear friend, I want to tell you something about myself. I finds it very difficult to memorize things that are being tought to me in my college and classes. That's the main reason I score less marks in my exams. Can you tell me what is the best and easy method of learning my subjects and scoring high percent of marks in my exams? Please help me! [SEP] best_answer: Improving your memorising really depends on what kind of learner you are..\n - If you are visual you need to associate things with images or set them out in a way that is easy for you to understand. You can work on your visual memory by drawing diagrams, staring at them for a while, then re-drawing the diagram on a blank page until you remember the whole thing. This helped me with a lot of biochemistry exam questions!\n - If you're an audio learner, you need to hear what you're trying to learn. You can do this by recording your voice reciting what you need to learn or by telling someone else what you need to remember (even if it's an inanimate object or a pet, it actually works).\n - If you learn by actually doing things, then the best way is to write out what you need to learn and keep on writing until you remember.\n\nAs for help with getting extra marks in exams, the best method is to start with the questions you know you can answer easily first. Then if you hit a question that is taking you too long, leave it and then come back to it later. And if there's something you don't remember as a part of a question, at least attempt to answer what you can because you can grab extra marks without answering the whole question.\n\nGood luck! :)	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: stuff like, class topics, uniforms, times they start in the morning and go home at night, etc. [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure what exactly you wanna know. But here is something I found:\n\nThe official organism that regulates education is the Secretaría de Educación Pública, known as SEP. Their site is spanish only, though.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nReligion has always had an important influence on education in Mexico. However, nowadays, public education in Mexico is secular (not based on religious beliefs). \n \nToday, children go to nursery school, followed by pre-primary school when they are 5 or 6 years old. They go to primary school between the ages of 6 and 12 and secondary school from 12 to 15. At 15, teenagers can go to preparatory school for three years and then to a Technological College or University.\n\nLike in Britain, most children attend public schools, but there are also many private schools in Mexico, for all levels. \n\nIn most schools, children have to wear a school uniform. \n \nThe Ministry of Education provides free textbooks to every child of pre-primary, primary and first grade of secondary school. In some indigenous communities where the children are bilingual, primary school is taught both in Spanish and the local language (such as Nahuatl, Mayan, and Zapotec) Due to the large number of students, public schools have two timetables. \n\nSome children go to school in the morning from 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and some in the afternoon from 2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.\n \n-----------------------------------------\n\nI don't know about the topics, but in elementary school they use the following (free) text books:\n- Spanish language\n- Literature\n- Math\n- Natural science\n- History (mexican and universal)\n- Geography (mexican and universal)\n- And some book about the mexican constitution (law principles)\n\nSome schools have some additional books (not free):\n- English\n- Civic education\n- Social science\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nA law that intended to keep children in school all day long didn't pass in the Congress. Some private schools do so though, since they have freedom with their programs as far as they meet a minimun criteria.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nYou can find the first section of my answer in the first two links below. The rest is from my personal experience. \n\nHope this helps you.	Education & Reference

We say we "grasp" what one is saying, to mean we know what they are saying.  That is, we have a sense of what they are saying.\n\nSo I think it is in some ways a sense.\n\nBut it is more than that, because it is formed as a result of various senses.  The 5 physical senses, plus mind or consciousness come together to form knowledge.\n\nSo I think it is its own category.  I could be wrong.	Education & Reference

Because the nutrition of present food has been destroyed by the fore-runner of genetic engineering - unnatural farming in order to make more profit.\nAlmost always there is an answer which ends up with - to make more profit.\nOur current society is run on the idea that profit is essential. If we examined all these things down to the root we would see that society is definitely headed in the wrong direction, and genetic engineering is a part of that.\nIt's of no long term benefit to the human race.

question_title: What is the proper (if any) honorarium for speaker at a (very small) high school graduation? [SEP] question_content: This person is my second cousin and my father asked her if she would speak at the graduation. She is a judge. The school is really a small home school group with just six kids graduating. I'm am completely stumped on this. [SEP] best_answer: I have 3 kids who attend a one room school.  there are a total of 7 kids in the whole school.  a senior just graduated there.  We just had one senior.  The speaker was the second graduate (also the only senior in his class) back from 1982.  He is an ems driver and he talked about life taking you on different courses in life.  you plan one way and something may change your direction but no matter which route you take go with all you have!  We treated this speaker with the same attitude if we would of had 100 graduates.  With a smaller class you have have more personal moments that can make a graduation special.  they do not get lost in a bunch of names.  The judge would be a great person to have to speak at  the graduation.  Not only will she be making just a speech but she can direct it to the class to where it will impact each one with what she says!	Education & Reference
question_title: Can you give me some basic inforamtion on microfilming and microphotography? Plz it is very urgent!!!? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Microfilm is an analog storage medium for books, periodicals, legal documents and engineering drawings. Its most standard form is a roll of black and white 35mm photographic film. Another form, more common for engineering drawings, is a Hollerith punch card that mounts a single exposure. Most microfilm media have a digital indexing system exposed on the edge of each image, but these data are not required to use the microfilm, but rather to support automated retrieval systems.\n\nMicrofilm is not the most compact analog microform in wide use. Microfiche is more compact.\n\nThe medium has numerous advantages:\n\nFirst, it is compact, with far smaller storage costs than paper documents. \nGenerally, a year of a periodical takes 10% of the space and 3% of the weight.\n\nSecond, it is lower cost than a standard subscription. \nMost microfilm services get a bulk discount on reproduction rights, and have lower reproduction costs than a comparable amount of printed paper.\n\nThird, it is a stable archival form. Most library microfilms use polyester with silver-halide dyes in hard gelatin, with an estimated life of 500 years in air-conditioning. In tropical climates with high humidities, fungus eats the gelatin used to hold silver-halide. In the tropics, diazo-based systems with shorter archival lives (20 years) are preferable, because they have polyester or epoxy surfaces. \nFourth, since it is analog (an actual image of the original data), it is easy to view. Unlike digital media, the data format is instantly comprehensible to persons literate in the language; the only additional equipment that is needed is a simple magnifying glass. This reduces the possibility of obsolescence. \nThe medium has numerous disadvantages:\n\nThe principal disadvantage of microfilm is that the image is too small to read with the naked eye. Special readers are required to project full-size images on a ground-glass screen or a flat reading surface. \nHard-copy reproduction: A conventional photocopier cannot reproduce the images and a special combined scanner/printer is required. Libraries using microfilm often have a very limited number of these viewers that can produce a photocopy of an image, for a nominal fee. \nStorage space: Shelf space is required to maintain an efficient archive as well as a safe and secure storage environment. \nActual reproduction: the microfilm itself can only be reproduced a limited number of times, while digital media regenerate and often include error detection and correction schemes. \nSystems that mount microfilm images in punch cards have been widely used for archival storage of engineering information. For example, when airlines demand archival engineering drawings to support purchased equipment (in case the vendor goes out of business), (as of 1999) they normally specified punch-card-mounted microfilm with an industry-standard indexing system punched into the card. This permits automated reproduction, as well as permitting mechanical card-sorting equipment to sort and select microfilm drawings. Hollerith-mounted microfilm is roughly 3% of the size and space of conventional paper or vellum engineering drawings. Some military contracts around 1980 began to specify digital storage of engineering and maintenance data because the expenses were even lower than microfilm, but these programs are now finding it difficult to purchase new readers for the old formats.\n\n---\nMicrophotography: The art of making microphotographs\n\nMicrophotograph &#92;Mi`cro*pho"to*graph&#92;, n. [Micro- + photograph.]\n1. A microscopically small photograph of a picture, writing,\nprinted page, etc.\n\n2. An enlarged representation of a microscopic object, produced by throwing upon a sensitive plate the magnified\nimage of an object formed by a microscope or other suitable combination of lenses.\n\nNote: A picture of this kind is preferably called a photomicrograph.

question_title: how do you deschool a new homeschooler? [SEP] question_content: I have removed my son from public school so I can homeschool him. He was having a bad time in the school I know that he hated it and wanted out. [SEP] best_answer: Bless you in your endeavor! Just to start out, you could surround him with books...give him time outside...not too much of the TV or video games or ipod...don't completely take it away...or he'll hate homeschool, just don't let him use that stuff during "school hours"...so he'll find something productive to do. Ask him what he wants to learn about and do a Unit Study...but don't overdo it, let him take the lead...but he may need you at his side for a while until he realizes he doesn't need a teacher to learn, just the desire to learn. The library is a great place to get all of the "curriculum" you could ever need. You could get him some science kits, or let him start a rock collection, or buy him a telescope so he could begin studying the stars, the possibilities are endless. I don't know why we call it homeschooling, it's really universeschooling...but I won't get into all of that...I'm homeschooling my 4 children and I wouldn't trade it for the world. They LOVE it and would not like to go back to school. \n\nI don't know where you live, but I'm sure you could find a homeschool support group near you.

question_title: Why does Britain have a 20oz pint? [SEP] question_content: The difference in us and uk gallons boils down to the pint, they are the same measurement, four quarts, eight pints, it's the basic pint that changes the measure. fluid ounces and dry ounces have the same basis and in both systems an ounce equates to 28.8 grammes or 28.8 ml Given the origin of the system in the uk it appears the U.S. adopted the original system and we altered ours. Americans use a 16oz pint and given that there are 16oz in a pound it would appear that the British pint increased in size at some point, when and why? [SEP] best_answer: In England, the Winchester standards were used since the 15th Century. They were slowly modified, as usual: at the beginning of the 18th Century, we had a wine gallon containing 231 cubic inches, an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches and even a corn ("Winchester") gallon. The bushel was defined at a time as "any round measure with a plain and even bottom, being 18.5 inches wide throughout and 8 inches deep" (hence its official US definition : 2150.42 cu.in.)\n\nThe Weights and Measures Act of 1824 defined an Imperial British Gallon to replace all others : it was to contain 10 pounds of pure water at 62°F (possibly inspired by the decimal system) (= 4.54609 liters). \n\nAt the same time in the US, the old wine gallon (also called Queen Anne's gallon) just discarded in England became the new official US Gallon (= 3.785411784 liters).\n\nAt least in England, they had a common system for liquid and dry measures thereafter.\n\nIn the US, there are two systems : for liquid measures, the base is the US Gallon just mentioned. The dry measures are based on the old Winchester Gallon (= 4.404884 liters) or 268.8025 cubic inches.\n\nFYI, general measures of capacity:\n\n2 gills = 1 cup \n2 cups = 1 pint \n2 pints = 1 quart \n2 quarts = 1 pottle \n2 pottles = 1 gallon \n2 gallons = 1 peck \n4 pecks = 1 bushel \n3 bushels = 1 bag \n12 bags = 1 chauldron or chaldron	Education & Reference

question_title: Need help for Java. Can any one answer this question ? [SEP] question_content: How can you create a JFrame whose size is determined by the underlying components rather than by the setSize() method that the JFrame inherits from the\nComponent class? [SEP] best_answer: It depends on how you mean, the underlying components.\n\nIf the JFrame is the parent frame, as it should be, then there is no way to be able to do this.  The only thing you could do, is make a properties file, and when the JFrame opens, have it open to what the properties file says.  If the user changes the size, save it in the properties file.\n\nIf the JFrame was not the parent frame, you would still need to use setSize, but to get the size, you could use getSize, or getHeight, getWidth, whatever methods are available to it.  To set the size of the JFrame, you could use percentages, like 60% of the width and height.\n\nTo get the operating system to determine the size would require knowledge of the operating system and how it could give you this information.

The major differences are:\n\n1. Procedure languages: SQL Server uses T-SQL while Oracle uses PL/SQL.\n\n2. Platforms: SQL only runs on Windows (duh) while Oracle runs in Unix, Linux, and Windows.\n\n3. Oracle is marginally more expensive than SQL server. In addition SQL server has more add-on products included.\n\n4. Oracle is generally recognized as more scaleable than SQL  server -- primarily due to support on large SMP Unix hardware.\n\n5. SQL Server is intented to be more user-friendly and does not require a specialized DBA to maintain the database.\n\n6. SQL Server supports many extensions using .NET while Oracle integrates with Java.\n\n7. Oracle supports more advanced features for data objects, maintenance functions, and database partitioning, though SQL is catching up.\n\n8. Oracle has been considered as generally more secure. SQL's security issues are often related to Windows issues. Later versions of both products have much improved security.\n\nPicking a database is a complicated and you need to be careful to define your client and backend requirements.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what are the differences between high speed &  dial up? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The fundamental difference between dialup and broadband Internet connections is the manner in which the connection is made from your PC to the Internet. A dialup service connects to the Internet through your phone line. The modem in your PC "calls" an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and connects with a maximum speed of 56,000 bytes per second, better known as a 56K speed connection. Each time your PC dials into the ISP, it is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address, which you can think of as an "Internet address." A different, unique IP address is assigned at the beginning of each visit so that the ISP can recognize your PC and make sure you can send and receive email, surf the Internet, and so on; basically, this address lets your ISP know where to send the information you are requesting through your modem. In terms of hackers, in order for someone to gain access to your computer, it would be necessary for them to know your IP to successfully do so. The fact that your IP address constantly changes essentially makes your Internet connection more secure.\n\nIn contrast, when you connect to the Internet via a broadband Internet connection, the process is slightly different. Once your PC is connected to the ISP through a cable or DSL connection, it remains connected until the cable box or DSL line is disconnected or physically unplugged. A DSL connection runs through unused wires in your existing phone line without disruption and can translate data at 5 million bytes per second, or 5Mbps. Broadband services are often referred to as "always on" services because it is not necessary to make a setup call to your ISP each time you wish to access the Internet; this means that once you are assigned an IP address, you keep it until you request it to be changed. We'll learn how to do this in a later newsletter.\n\nConnection speed and price are two important considerations when choosing between dialup and broadband. Dialup connection speeds make it more difficult to view certain types of media, such as video, and it can take much longer to download and open email attachments, play online games, and so on. Although the slower connection speed is a disadvantage for dialup users, there are also a few advantages to using this type of connection, which include lower monthly charges and a higher level of security. The cost difference is obvious when comparing the $20-30 per month subscription fee for dialup and the $50-60 per month subscription fee for most broadband services. In terms of security, because the connection is not "always on" and because you are assigned a different IP address each time, it is slightly more difficult to be attacked over the Internet, although nothing is ever fool proof and risks still do exist	Computers & Internet

question_title: When some certain websites refused to open in ur pc... what can be done? [SEP] question_content: Some websites that were previously opening in my pc .... now they have refused to open. What can be done pls? [SEP] best_answer: Hello there. \n\nWell as you probably know by now, a solution will not always work but here are a few.\n\n1. Purge all your cookie files. This means getting rid of all the cookies that are stored on your computer, because there could be some malicious ones that prevent other sites from opening. So, in Windows Explorer...\n\na. Click on tools\nb. Go to Internet options\nc. On the 'general' tab, go to the browsing history\nd. click on 'delete' Internet temporary files\ne. apply and close\nf. close all applications and restart PC for settings to take effect\n\nAlternatively...\n\na. perform steps a. and b. from above\nb. click on 'security' tab \nc. outside 'security level for this zone square'\nd. click on 'reset all zones to default level'\ne. apply and save\nf. close all applications and restart PC for settings to take effect\n\nOr...\n\nCheck below tabs in 'Windows Internet explorer' \nor below status bar in explorer windows to see if the browser has blocked the site, and click the bar to allow the active X control...\n\nHope this helps!!

question_title: Favorite Linux? [SEP] question_content: What is your favorite linux, im looking at Ubuntu or Kubuntu Im installing on a Gateway computer. It is running Windows 98 at this time.\n\nThanks [SEP] best_answer: I tried them all, and none of them felt right to me until I found Ubuntu.\n\nUbuntu is a great way to go. It is free, and they will even send you free CD's if you can't download it for some reason (if you are asking a question here, I assume you are already online). For me, the best part of Ubuntu is the community. There is a great community of people from around the world, that are very polite and happy to help answer any questions that you have: http://www.ubuntuforums.org\n\nEven though Ubuntu is currently on version 5.1 (Breezy Badger), http://ubuntuguide.org which was written for version 5.04 (Warty Warthog), is still a great guide that is very helpful as well.\n\nBest of all, you can get Ubuntu in Gnome, KDE, and more. If you want, you can even choose which version to use when you log in (requires additional installation).\n\nThe Synaptic Package Manager makes it VERY easy to install additional programs.\n\nThere is a live CD is you would like to try that first:\nhttp://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/5.10/\n\nGive it a try, I am sure that you will like it. I installed Ubuntu as a dual-boot about 4 months ago, and I eventually removed Windows a month ago. I am here to stay.	Computers & Internet
question_title: what is encapsulation in object-oriented programming? please give atleast two example.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Encapsulation — ensuring that code outside a class sees only functional details of that class, but not implementation details. The latter are liable to change, and could allow a user to put an object in an inappropriate state. Encapsulation is achieved by specifying which classes may use the members of an object. The result is that each object exposes to any class a certain interface — those members accessible to that class. For example, an interface can ensure that puppies can only be added to an object of the class Dog by code in that class. Members are often specified as public, protected and private, determining whether they are available to all classes, sub-classes or only the defining class. Some languages go further: Java uses the protected keyword to restrict access also to classes in the same package, C# and VB.NET reserve some members to classes in the same assembly using keywords internal (C#) or Friend (VB.NET), and Eiffel allows one to specify which classes may access any member.

It is the same across multiple keyboards and even different OS's.  For ex.: When the apostrophe key is pressed the symbol @ appears.  Any ideas as to a solution? [SEP] best_answer: Across multiple keyboards and multiple OSs - on the same system?

question_title: RAID Arrays...? [SEP] question_content: Ive got 3 disks 1 SATA, 2 IDE, 2 of them are 80 GB, one of the IDE's are 250. On the 250 GB IDE drive I have Data. I dont want to lost the data since I am adding an SATA to my computer for the first time. Will I lose that data if I am doing RAID O striping for performance? Im not doing RAID 1 which is Mirroring for Security. I already started the process but have not rebooted. Im scared it will reformat. What is going to happen..?? [SEP] best_answer: The best advice I can give you (which may be too late, if I understand things right) is to back up the data you want to preserve, off the computer, so that if something goes wrong with the RAID configuration, you will be able to cope with the loss. Depending on how your RAID setup is designed, you may (or may not) be able to use IDE drives and SATA drives in the same RAID setup. They have very different latencies adn other characteristics, which may confuse the RAID software/firmware, and perhaps the operating system too. \n\nAnyway, a few DVDs will probably be enough, at least for a temporary backup. DVDs and CDs aren't so sturdy and suited for long term storage as many think. Any damage to the edges of the disk or the label side of the one sided sort, is quite likely to start a corroson process which will lose data. Protection of the data storage layer is only a thickness of lacquer there. The sturdiest side of these things is the reading side, as it has a somewhat thick (a few millimeters, anyway) layer of plastic between the outside world and the data storage mechanism. But they can probably be safeguarded long enough to be useful in this case. \n\nIf possible, I'd suggest RAID 5 as it allows you (in the best case) to survive the complete loss of a disk, rebuilding the data on it from the remaining data. Whether that will be possible for your hardwae (and operating system) is another thing, of course. But a full implementation will require more disks than you have; there's a way to do RAID 5 with only three disks, if I recall correctly, but I'd spend a little on the hardware to reduce implementational complications. A test run is, I think, a good thing. Record some test data on your RAID 5 setup, then remove one disk entirely, and see if the data can be successfuly restored. Don't count on it all working until you've had a successful test...\n\nBest of luck, whatever you decide to do.	Computers & Internet

question_title: My computer won't urn cds and I've burend cds before please help me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The error with the burned CDs could really be a number of things.  It could be that there's a malfunction with the CD itself, in which case, I'd try bruning with another CD (if you haven't already tried that).  It could be that there's a problem with your hardware...The lens is dirty or scratched, a mechanism has burned out, and electrical circuit is on the fritz.  Listen to the sounds that your computer makes when you insert a CD.  Is the disc even spinning up when its inserted, or is the computer not even recognizing the disc?  If that's the case, you'll need to install a new CD drive.  The other issue that could be a factor is software trouble.  It could be that your CD burning software is missing a driver or has been affected with a virus.  \n\nI'd recommend you start with a new blank CD, if you haven't already.  If that's not the issue, go with the software cause..  reinstall the program that you're using to burn.  Make sure that all the necessary drivers and product key is on-hand for the installation.  If it appears that software is not an issue, and your drive has gone bad, you'll need to replace that.  Hope this helps.	Computers & Internet

question_title: ok i have a comp that i cant start up windows it says stop error i cant get to nothing to fix anything? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Shut it completely off and unplug it from the wall.  Open the case so you can see the motherboard.  Look for a silver battery on the motherboard (about 1 inch diameter or smaller).  Somewhere close to the battery, you will see a jumper (also known as a link setting).  \n\nThis is the CMOS jumper, and it will be positioned on 2 of the 3 available pins.  Remove it from the the 2 pins on one side (could be on pins 1 and 2 or on 3 and 4...doesn't matter) and place it on the other end (pin 2 will be used on both settings, only 1 and 3 will change).  Let it sit for 10 seconds, then return it to the position it was in when you found it.\n\nReplace the cover and plug it back into the wall.  Turn on the computer and let it try to boot up.  If it works, cool, you've fixed it.  If you get the same error, you need to reboot and this time when it starts up press whatever key you need to get into the Bios (could be delete or F8 or F12, whatever).\n\nOnce in the Bios, make it search for you fixed disk drives...it should come up with each drive and how big they are.  If it finds all the installed drives, great!  Hit Save And Exit and allow it to reboot.  If it still comes up with that error, you may have a corrupted drive...it's now time to call in the professionals.\n\nI hope this helps!	Computers & Internet
question_title: who hosts the internet? [SEP] question_content: what i mean is there has to be a computer or server somewhere that connects the 'internet' to everyone? [SEP] best_answer: My god, I am trying to think of a way to explain it, there are a million links if you search, but think of a million large spider webs hooked together, you do have one (Company) thats does take care of all the names, somebody has to so there would only be only one of each name, You have millions of web servers, that are computers that can have 1 to 50,000 sites on each one.\nIf you use  your telephone line and modem or high speed connection, the computer connects to the ISP's server. Once there, the ISP acts as a gateway connecting you to any computer hooked to the World Wide Web, using browsers like Internet Explorer or Netscape. \n\nNext, you type in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - such as www.yahoo.com. The computer translates this into a number - the IP address - that is unique to every web page and computer, making it possible for machines to recognise each other. The machines then 'talk' to each other using 'languages' called protocols. Specifically, the protocol in question is TCP/IP, which allows computers to describe data to one another over a network. \n\nEvery computer on the WWW understands these two protocols, and can therefore communicate amicably. TCP/IP is actually two different things. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) takes the information you want to send over the Internet, and breaks it into small chunks of data called 'packets' that can include programming, text, pictures, sound or video in various combinations. IP (Internet Protocol) takes over and routes those packets through computers to get them to their destination. \n\nWhen the packets arrive at the destination computer, TCP reassembles them into what you finally see as a web page on your computer screen. TCP/IP is further broken down into specialised protocols like STMP (which works with email), Ftp (for simple file transfers) and the omnipresent 'http://' (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is how Web browsers work. \n\nSounds a bit intimidating? Just remember: you have gone through each of these steps every time you have logged on to the Internet! .	Computers & Internet

question_title: application of artificial intelligence in medical laboratory science diagnosis?. what is process control syste [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, using neural networks, the program can be trained to predict certain outcomes.\n\nSay you have a bunch of random data (the more random the better) that you think could build a connection to a specified outcome.  You can feed this data through neural network where it'll learn the data and any trends throughout.  Then you can program it to give certain results.\n\nAnother example:\n\nYour an ad agency and you want to target only four types of people.  Well obviously there are more than four categories of people to target, but with neural networks you can come up with four pretty good ads that'll cover all the people.  So you take data of people at Central Park.  You notice that people who wear white shirts usually eat hot dogs on friday, but only if the temperature is above 70 F.  So now you have for data points: color of shirt, what the eat, when they eat it, and on what kind of day.  Now do this same thing for 100's or 1000's of people and feed that data into the neural network you program.  The program if trained enough can come up with some conclusions about what those people would like for our advertisement.\n\nThis is a very simplified analysis but you can kind of get the point:\n\nLook at someones heredity, sertain genomes, and train the neural network with that data and then possibly figure out some pretty neat conclusions from that.

question_title: I have a NEW computer, do I really need to "close other applications during installation??"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what you are installing. The reason that installing applications tell you to close all other applications is that if other applications are using system files that the installing application needs to update, it will not be able to update them since they will be in use. So if you are not exactly sure what system drivers that those applications are installing, I would recommend closing all open applications with the exception of anti-virus and spyware programs.

I have tried Nero and although it works when played on my PC, zilch when played on my DVD player [SEP] best_answer: some DVD players cannot play .avi format so you can either:\n\n1. convert your .avi files to mpeg files and burn them to your DVD. theres a lot of free converters out there and you can check www.download.com.\n\n2. look for a software that burns video files into DVD automatically so that you wouldn't have to worry about file formats since these softwares converts them automatically anyways.

question_title: IT dependency on critical applications in the retail industry how they can achieve the applications robust? [SEP] question_content: With the increased dependency on critical applications in It what we can believe any retail organization should be looking at to ensure that the  IT (Information Technology) applications are\n-robust\n-supportable\n-scalable and secure [SEP] best_answer: A robust application is one that continues to operate correctly even under stress placed by environmental factors.\n\nIn the retail industry such factors that place stress on a program are,\n\n1.  Inexperience in operation brought about by unskilled and semi skilled workers using it.\n2.  Environmental factors such as recovery from power fluctuations.\n3.  Destructive behaviour applied to it from such factors as sabotage by an individual and the threat of virus activity in communications.\n\nTo achieve robust operation generally is a three part strategy. The first is thorough implementation of exception handling within the software and recovery to exception. The second is adequate research at the design analysis stage to account for faults and recovery. Finally the third part is to implement the software with a carefully supervised alpha and beta implementation to oversea the program for shortcomings or unexpected problems. \n\n\nThe criteria for robust operation might be to access such factors above against loss of income to the retailer.

question_title: I have had access to www.ezboard.com for years.  Suddenly 2 weeks ago, I only get "unavailable? any ideas? [SEP] question_content: I am on an wireless intranet with wireless access IP.  All computers on the intranet have different versions of Windows (98, ME, XP) and problem exists on all computers. ISP has no ideas.  Anyone here have any idea what is going on? [SEP] best_answer: Hi probalby no help but I can get to www.ezboard.com fine. I would suggest maybe a few things that are pretty basic and you may have already tried. First do you use a proxy to access the internet. From Internet Explorer go Tools, Internet Options, then on the connection tabs then look at the LAN settings (if you are on Wirless DSL). If there is anything in there then your computer is going through a proxy before reaching the internet. The issue could be caused by that.\n\nAlternatively sometimes ISP's will block an IP range if they suddenly get loads of spam, but it can be a nightmare trying to talk to someone from most ISP's that will look into it.\n\nTwo other things you can do... if you can get to your command prompt (Dos Prompt) normally under start menu, accesories.\n\nType ping www.ezboard.com \nit will then try to send packets to the server - if this works and comes back with response times it may not be your ISP after all but something in your browser.\n\nWhen you ping it it will say something like pinging www.ezboard.com (nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn) where the number in the brackets is the IP address of the server.\n\nIf that works try typin tracert nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn is the number in brackets from your ping. This will then show all the steps the packet is taking. Interstingly when I tried this it kept failing at a 64.125.nnn.nnn - it kept going around in circles before timing out.\n\nAnysort of information like this is useful to give to your ISP.

question_title: what do i need for wires for a internal dvd burner, and what type is recommendedfor a emachines computer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Does your computer have a free 5.25" external bay?  If so, open the computer and take a look at the ribbon(cable) attached to your cd-rom.  If you see a connector in the middle of the ribbon you only have to attach that (and a power connector) to the dvd-burner.  The original drive will need jumper settings of master and the new burner should be set as slave.  Power connectors are plastic with 4 holes.  I would suggest you buy a retail version instead of OEM.  OEM lacks software.  If your original ide ribbon only has one connector you can easily purchase the right type.  They are listed as 3 connectors(mobo and both drives).\n\nI would suggest Newegg also.  They have many for around $40.\nI personally have purchased 3 NEC 16x dual-format drives and they work excellently.\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Order=PRICE&Page=1&N=2010100005+1036506653&Submit=ENE&SubCategory=5\n\nIt looks like the Lite-On oem drives come with software.\n\nHope this helps.

question_title: iTunes Library taking up all my hard drive?!? [SEP] question_content: My computer has really slowed down since I've been using iTunes... makes sense as I'm using up about 40GB in songs. How can I (a novice computer user) speed my system up again? Do I need to load another hard drive (if I have a slot available)? THANKS! [SEP] best_answer: I have about 10,000 songs in itunes, and my computer is not any slower because of it. You are just storing the files on your disk. This does not use any of the processor unless you are actually accessing the file.\n\nSo - the real question is why your computer is slowing.\n\n1/ Over time, you need to defrag your hard drive. Open my computer, right click on your c drive > properties > tools > defragment now. Do this every couple of months.\n\n2/ You have a lot of programs that have snuck into your computer at startup time. install winpatrol (free - use the link below). Check the 'startup programs' tab. if you have more than about 20 items, invistigate each item and disable anything you dont need. Liutilities.com is a great source for this.\n\n3/ If your antivirus is norton or mcaffee, dump them, as they are resource hogs. Just make sure you follow all the remove instructions to get everything out. Install Avast instead. Its free, small, fast, and more effective than the previously mentioned.\n\n4/ lastly, you can blame microsoft's patches every month to a small degree. Every patch they make adds a little bit to the overhead. Its the price we all have to pay for the innocent and not-so-innocent hackers.\n\nTaking care of the 1st three should speed you up considerably. regarding #4, and just overall performance, RAM is the best thing you can buy next to bandwidth. Forget all the accelerators you may hear about. Its just junk.	Computers & Internet

question_title: is ice  a  mineral?.....glacial    oxide  of   hydrogen? [SEP] question_content: from a n old  prospecter [SEP] best_answer: Yes, if it forms naturally it is a mineral. The name is just ice. There isn't any 'glacial' part, although that does add to the description. Liquid water is NOT a mineral because it is liquid, and man-made ice is not a mineral because it is man-made. It is hydrogen oxide. \n\nHere's a good definition of a mineral: (I quote)\n"To be classified as a "true" mineral, a substance must be a solid and have a crystal structure. It must also be an inorganic, naturally-occurring, homogeneous substance with a defined chemical composition."\n\nIce is solid. It has a crystal structure. It is inorganic. It is naturally-occurring, and it is only made of one thing, H20, so it fits the definition well.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Once I heard about a very serious physics study on that /   I'll try to find it for ya.\n\nHERE IT IS> When the simulation was complete, it showed that the spray drove a vortex. The center of this vortex—much like the center of a cyclone—is a low-pressure region. This low-pressure region is what pulls the shower curtain in. The vortex rotates around an axis that is perpendicular to the shower curtain. It is a bit like a sideways dust devil. But unlike a dust devil, this vortex doesn't die out because it is driven continuously by the shower.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Who really built the pyramids? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A race of people from the planet known to the ancient Sumerians as NUBI.RU, the 10th member of our solar system. They built them as a method of navigation, as baum_e said above. Their atmosphere was dwindling when they came to Earth around 750,000 years ago, during the ice age, as a result of NIBI.RU's highly elliptical comet-like orbit; they came here to mine gold to be ground into fine particle that would orbit the planet and somehow insulate the planet from outgassing. In the process they created humanity using DNA from the Homo Erectus around at the time mixed with their own to create a primitive worker ("ADAM.U"). They built the pyramids as a form of navigation, built on specific lines of latitude. Their planet, having an orbital period of about 3,600 years, will return in 2012 for its 200-somethingth return since then, as will the race that lives upon it. There will be war.

After one day the water is reduced to 98% .Now what is the weight of tomatos. I give the answer 50kg ,plz let me know am i right & if not plz explain the right answer\nThanks in Advance [SEP] best_answer: You are right!!! The 1% solid part remains the same weight (1kg). If the water on the second day is 98%, then the solid must now be 2%. If it is now 2%, it still weighs 1kg, so the water weight is now 49kg. 49 + 1 = 50. \n\nAnother way to look at it is, the solid part is now double the amount it was, but since it didnt grow (did it?), the water must be half what it was.\n\nLets assume that on day X the water is reduced to 50%. The solid part is now 50%, but still weighs 1kg, so the water must also weigh 1kg, 1kg + 1kg = 2kg.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why old car use more fuel to run than the new one? [SEP] question_content: what i mean that the old car have to use up more fuel to run than the new buy one. i hope to have a right answer,thank you! [SEP] best_answer: One of the classic inefficiencies of cars of yore is the driveline design.  Take for instance a 1962 V-8 Impala with a hydramatic transmission and rear wheel drive.  The two-speed transmission always allowed slippage between the engine and the wheels, which caused energy loss in the transmission fluid being heated up in the torque converter during all driving situations.  They have cured that in today's automobiles by locking out the torque converter with an automatic clutch.  Putting a 90 degree angle between the input and output is also an energy sucker.  In more efficient front wheel drive cars, the axis of engine revolution is the same as the wheels.  This saves some energy as well. The final drive ratios of cars in the 60's was insane!  A cruising RPM of 3600 at highway speeds was not unheard of--and on a V8!!! Think of the gas going down the tubes.....  Modern cars reduce the final drive ratio and add overdrive to the transmission to reduce cruising speed RPM.  Less RPM means less air consumption and less fuel use.  In the 70's, they caught on and offered rear wheel drive cars with 2.73:1 rear end ratios to save gas.  This hurt acceleration, but was cheaper than offering a 4 speed automatic.  (It eventually happened.)  \n\nA huge determinant of efficiency is COMPRESSION RATIO.  Without computer control and injection, most cars of the 70's (BAD efficiency) had LOW compression ratios, say 8.0.  (And food for thought--the first spark ignition engines had a sorry compression ratio of 4.0:1.  How sad!!  They did not know enough about fuel chemistry at the turn of the century, so that's why the horsepower value of vehicles was so low back in the teens. A four cylinder automotive engine having 10hp in the "old days" with a displacement of 2 liters.  WOW!) New cars have all kinds of tricks to increase compression ratios while running on regular 87 octane fuel.  Current compression ratios include 9.0 to 10.1.  Computers adjust injection and spark ignition timing (to repeat a collegue's information already submitted) along with monitoring piezoelectrick "knock" sensors which make adjustments for preignition "pinging."  In the old carbureted cars, even ones with HEI ignition, there was no way to deal with the pinging. The sure fire way to prevent pinging (and serious damage) is to lower the compression ratio.\n\nAnother huge problem with cars of the 70's and 80's were the addition of the catalytic converter and other emission control systems like the huge drain from a "smog pump."  EGR valves put exhaust in the intake charge to reduce nitrous oxides, but that reduces peak combustion temperatures and the available power from the fuel charge.  Running exhaust through the manifold also made the intake charge hotter, reducing efficiency.  Old cars had fixed valve timing, which determines the relationship between power at high rpm and torque at low rpm.  Some manufactures today have adjustment on the exhaust valve timing, and some even adjust both the exhaust and the intake timing to increase efficiency and torque at low RPM while changing valve overlap for high rpm horsepower with a net smaller displacement.\n\nSome modern cars still include EGR, but the catalytic converter technology is much better and more attention to exhaust system design has helped increase MPG.\n\nThe actual energy used by the valvetrain has also been reduced by reducing the mass of the components in the valve train.  Using a cog belt to a cam riding right above the valves reduces the energy used to activate the valves.  That can really add up over the life of the engine.  \n\nAnother development was the inclusion of the electric cooling fan.  Belt driven fans consumed huge amounts of power from the engine, even if they had a thermal clutch.  Flex fans were supposed to reduce energy, but we are still talkin' in the multi-horsepower range just to move air across the radiator.  The modern c	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is it possible to be both a cardiothoracic surgeon and a neurosurgeon at the same time? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Technically yes.  You could be any combination of specialized surgeon if you really put your mind and soul into it.  After medical school, you are matched to a residency program in the field you would most like to practice in.  Cardiothoracic surgery is about 6 years of residency, and neuro is typically 7.  In either case, the first year or two will be general surgery, and the remainder of your time will be focused on your specialty.  \n\nCommonly, after residency a physician will continue to train and specialize through at least one fellowship of a year or more before attaining a full surgical position with all the bells and whistles.  Completing one residency does not exclude you from being able to train in other areas as well.  \n\nIf its what you really want, I believe it is possible to be both.  However, I would caution you that you are looking at 10-12 years of 80 hour work-weeks after med school.  That means you're likely to be 36-40 years old by the time you are done.  Furthermore, the point of specializing is to know everything about a small aspect of medicine.  If you divide your attention between two, its highly unlikely that you would be as well versed at both as you could be at one.  Lastly, money might be an issue as well.  Having two specialties doesn't mean you can do twice as many surgeries.  A hospital isn't likely to pay you twice what you would make with one.  In fact, I would guess that the second specialty would not add a tremdous amount to your paycheck.  Also consider that you will be missing out on roughly $1,500,000 of income while you are going through all the extra training of the second residency.\n\nLike I said if its what you really want....go for it.\nI'd say do one, then see how you feel.

And why aren't they here, or at least locally active.  This gets a little more confusing.\n\nImagine a successful spacefaring civilisation evolves on the opposite side of our galaxy, abou 10000 light-years away.  This race has succesfully colonised it's solar system and is looking at the the stars.  Now without any massive new technologies (no hyperspace or jump-drives, etc) the simplest way to travel between starts is a generation ship (people living and breeding onboard the ship until it reaches its destination and the descendants of the original crew disembark).\n\nAssuming a moderate speed of travel, this races empire will expand at least 0.01% of the speed of light.  That means that this empire will reach Earth in about 100 million years.\n\nThis may seem like a long time, but considering that the universe has been around for 15 Billion years, and the Earth itself for 5 Billion years, it is unlikely that no such civilisations have evolved in our galaxy.  \n\nUnless of course, we are alone...\n\nI've probably explained it badly, so probably wise to check out "Fermi Paradox" at Wikipedia.org for another version.

question_title: What makes Physics so hard? What are some good study habits for the subject? [SEP] question_content: I am a college student and will be taking Physics 1 and 2 in the upcoming year. I've heard horror stories about Physics. I've made it through life cramming the night before for tests and doing just fine. I have a feeling this won't work as I get into my harder classes. And I just realized I have no study habits. What is it about Physics that makes it so hard, and any good ways to study for it? [SEP] best_answer: Physics is an extremely visual discipline.  It takes imagining in pictures.  People who think best by getting their hands dirty touching stuff, or (worse still) in words rather than pictures, do more poorly in physics, because most physics teachers think in a visual sense, and most don't have the verbal skills needed to communicate with other types of people.\n\nFor most physicists: Newtonian mechanics is billiard balls; Electricity is water flowing around canals and pools and waterfalls and pumps; magnetism is iron filings around a bar magnet; light and sound are light/dark waves in a ripple tank.\n\nThen there's the math.  Now, most physicists don't start with the math, they start with the pictures, and use the math to prop up the answers.\n\nTo succeed in physics:  draw lots of pictures - you have to learn to think visually to get it.  Go over solved problems - see how the pictures fit into the math.  Once you realize that there are only about five or six basic equations, and you learn how to solve them (most physicists are bad at math, anyway), you go back to drawing pictures.\n\nAnd forget about historical personalities.  My god, the way people idolize Newton and Maxwell and Einstein, you'd think they were minor gods.  They were just people, thinking in pictures.\n\nDraw lots of pictures.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How far can one use electrical wires before needing a transformer? [SEP] question_content: My pole that has electricity is 400 feet away, can I plug in to it? Legally of course. [SEP] best_answer: Like everything else, it depends.  The concern is that at the maximum current you will draw, there is sufficient voltage at the point of use.  Voltage drop depends on the amount of current, and the resistance of the circuit.  \n\nYou can determine the minimum voltage requirements for whatever you are driving.  Knowing the resistance per foot of various sizes of wire, you could determine the size wire needed.\n\nNow it becomes a matter of economics.  Is larger wire less expensive than a transformer--or two if you are going to maintain the original equipment operating voltage.	Science & Mathematics

Mineral oil is available in light and heavy grades, and can often be found in drug stores	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What could you say about a line if every point on the line has the same x coordinate? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If every point on the line has the same x coordinate, the line would be vertical. The formula for slope is rise/run. The "run" part would be the change in the x coordinates. Since there is no change, "run"=0. Dividing by zero is undefined, so the line's slope is undefined (not zero). Only vertical lines have an undefined slope.\n\nAlso, try plotting points. Choose any x value, and you will see that if every point has that same value, the line will be vertical regardless of the y value.\n\nAlso notice and vertical lines are not functions as they do not pass the vertical line test.

question_title: who discovered opals, when was it discovered and how was it discovered? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It is no wonder why early cultures from around the world have attributed magical properties to the opal. The mysterious patches of color that appear and disappear with every movement give opals a life of their own. Opals have been collected for thousands of years. The oldest opal artifact, estimated to have been collected at around 4000 B.C., was found in a cave in Kenya. Opals were one of the most highly prized gemstones to the Greeks and Romans. Early Greeks believed opals were the source of prophetic powers. As the Roman Empire grew, so did the demand for opals. A Roman Senator, Nonius, chose to be exiled rather than give his valuable opal to Marc Antony who wanted to give it to his lover, Cleopatra. A legend tells of a Roman Emperor who offered to trade one-third of his kingdom for a single opal. The Roman natural historian expressed his difficulty in describing the gem: "... it is made up of the glories of the most precious stones. To describe it is a matter of inexpressive difficulty: There is in it the gentler fire of the ruby, the brilliant purple of the amethyst, the sea-green of the emerald, all shining together in an incredible union." Opals have often found their way into the jewelry and crowns of royalty. Queen Victoria adored opals and kept a fine collection. \n\n     While opals have always been an object of curiosity and mystery, the powers attributed to it have not always been positive. In the late 18th century, the opal was considered to bring bad luck to its possessor. The Spanish King Alfonso XII had given an opal ring to his wife who died shortly thereafter. The ring was passed on to family members and each person who wore it died mysteriously. Eventually, the king himself wore the ring and he too died unexpectedly. While historians will say that the deaths can be attributed to the cholera epidemic of the times, many have blamed the deaths on the opal.\n\nhttp://www.gbjewelers.com/education/opals/opal-information.html	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: A sucrose molecule is made up of a glucose and a fructose molecule. 1 mole of sucrose gets broken down to 1 mole of glucose and 1 mole of fructose. The metabolic pathway of both glucose and fructose are very similar. \n1 mole of glucose yields 6 moles of CO2 and 1 mole of fructose yields 6 moles of CO2, therefore, 1 mole of sucrose will yield 12 moles of CO2\n1 mole of glucose yields 36 ATP and 1 mole of fructose yields 36 moles of ATP, therefore, 1 mole of sucrose will yield 72 moles of ATP.\nFollowing the same logic, 1 mole of sucrose will yield 6 moles of Acetyl CoA (3 from glucose and 3 from fructose)  and 4 moles of pyruvate (2 from glucose and 2 from sucrose)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: If we mgnfy a line we see its width(2nd dmnsn) if we cut it into more lines n mgnfy, we see the second dmnsn? [SEP] question_content: I mean to say that if we cut the line (simple) into more parts (linearly) then we see its width(magnified) which refers to its second dimension and quite comfortably the third if we again do the cutting and magnification sequence several times then probably we find that we can still see the 3 dimensions Does it mean that nothing can exist in the 1st and 2nd dimension but compulsorily in the 3rd dimension?or that a single dimension exists in the infinite magnification? [SEP] best_answer: Any line you can make in this physical Universe is 3-dimensional.  A drawing has a 3rd dimension - no surface is ideal, and there has to be something beyond this surface.\nIf you draw a line, it is also 3-dimensional (otherwise, you would not see it - it would be infinitely thin, and if it is not, it is a rectangle on an uneven surface).\n\nIf you ask whether truly 1-D or 2-D objects can exist in our Universe, there is an answer: no and yes.\n\nNO for macroscopic objects: the reason is that there is a minimum unit of space: Planck length. Therefore, you may think of all non-elementary objects in this Universe as being at least 1 Planck length thick in all 3 dimensions.  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length\n\nYES for elementary particles. They are viewed either as zero-dimension (points) or one-dimension (strings, with the size of - I think you guessed it - Planck length).\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how does the nyc water supply work from the source to the sink? [SEP] question_content: Please describe how it works from the source to the sink. [SEP] best_answer: The water comes from a point elevated far above the sink height (a reservoir in upstate NY).\n\nBecause its source is higher, the water will flow (downward)--even though the pipes might go 'up' a buiding. Its all about the conservation of energy laws you can learn about in physics.\n\nFrom the reservoir it is piped to the city, and it gets filtered and treated before it gets to the sink.\n\nThe sink valves hold it back until you open them, and let the force of the flow down your drain, where it goes out to the river.

question_title: 7 C(s) +  9 CH4(g)    --> 2 C8H18 (l)  Is it possible? [SEP] question_content: Can we convert carbon to liquid fuel using natural gas?\nIs this reaction possible? (Solid+Gas-->Liquiid)\nIs it energy eficient?\nHas anybody done it?\nAre there studies or research papers?\nAny usefull links? [SEP] best_answer: It sounds extremely unlikely.  In fact, so unlikely that I would rate it as impossible.  The problem is that the first stage of the reaction would be the splitting of one of the C---H bonds in methane and you would need pretty brutal reaction conditions to achieve this, e.g. temperatures well in excess of 1000°C.  At these temperatures, hydrocarbons such as octane are unstable and simply would not form.  If there is any reaction at all, I would guess that, at fairly high temperatures you would get some acetylene, e.g. by passing a stream of methane over a bed of red-hot carbon :\nC(s)   +   CH4(g)   --->   2 C2H2(g)\n\nNote that the equation you wrote is balanced.  But just because you have a balanced equation, that doesn't mean the reaction is feasible.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Why exactly do some people need to wear glasses? [SEP] question_content: Just wondering.Is it something to do with the lense in your eye not being able to focus properly or something? [SEP] best_answer: The lens in your eye may be too strong and thus focus the image of the outside world in front of your retina, or it may be to weak and focus the image behind the retina.  By placing a lens (glasses) in front of the eye, we can compensate for this by ensuring the image falls exactly on the retina, which allows for good vision.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: is there a installation system for building windows that withstand high wind forces? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Consider looking up Polycarbonate\n\nPolycarbonate is a clear polymer that is used in bullet proof glass.  It is commonly used nowadays in homes to resist breaks.  \n\nAcrylic is also used and is more flexible but less impact resistant.\n\nBoth of these materials are available at hardware stores such as Lowes.  If you seeking profession installation, just ask about the two materials, acrylic is cheaper then polycarbonate, usually by about 1/3 the cost.  \n\nIf you are only considering windows that resist breaking due to wind force, go for acrylic, its cheaper and the wind force, even at high pressure, may bend an acrylic panel, but will not break it.   \n\nThe polycarbonate will not only resist winds, it will flex less, and given the right thickness can stop a baseball bat or ball. crow bar, and even thicker, will repel small arms fire.  \n\nBoth materials flex to some degree, but return to their original flatness immediately.  Both materials are plastics and must have a UV protective coating to prevent "yellowing"  The protective coating, which is put on the outer surface, should be on any of the material you purchase that is intended for outdoor use.  The coatings guarantee no yellowing for 10 years.\n\nmore FYI, The combination of the two materials is used by a particular company to make one-way bullet proof "glass" really  sandwich of the two materials, with the more flexible acrylic on the bad guy's side.

question_title: Radiating  or reflecting light. is what? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Visible light is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves.  Light is produced by the rearrangement of electrons in atoms or molecules.\n\nNewton's laws of reflection and refraction treats light as a particle:\n\nLaw of Reflection:  When light is reflected from a surface, the angle of incidence EQUALS the angle of reflection.  The angles are measured from the normal (perpendicular) to the surface.\n\nLaw of Refraction: Deals with the  way light changes its direction of propagation when it passes from one medium to another.  The light beam transmitted into the second medium is said to be refracted. \n\nThe angle of refraction bends toward the normal if a light beam passes from air into glass (the angle of reflection is less than the angle of incidence).   If the angle of reflection is greater than angle of incidence,  light is bent away from the normal as when it passes from glass to air.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: mechanism of ESR? [SEP] question_content: all about erythrocyte sedementation rate [SEP] best_answer: Here is a simplified explaination of why ESR increases as a result of inflammation. \n\nThe outside of a red cell is positively charged, generally at the same level, except in the middle of the cell (the thinnest part of the biconcave disc) where it is relatively negatively charged. This means that the there is an attraction between this negative charge and the positive charges of other red cells (opposites attract). However, under normal conditions, the positive charges around the rest of the red cell repel the other positive charges of other red cells. This repulsive force is called the Zeta potential. So in the normal state, the Zeta potential is stronger than the attractive force. \nDuring states of inflammation, there are more immunoglobulins, proteins and acute phase reactants sent out into the blood, these are negatively charged, and reduce the overall Zeta potential, and subsequently the repulsive force. This means that the positive areas on the red cells can now get closer to the negative area of other red cells. And they do so. The nature of the shape of the red cells means that they fit quite neatly (with minimal deformity) into each other, and stack like coins. The more the inflammatory response, the higher the acute phase reactants and other proteins in the blood, and the lower the Zeta potential, the greater the attraction between the red cells, and the higher the ESR.\n\nHope this helps	Science & Mathematics

question_title: can a refractor see distant planets  such as Uranus ,Neptune and other distant galaxies? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Firstly, Uranus and Neptune are planets, not galaxies. But if you are using the term correcly, then even a pair of binoculars will allow you to see these things if you know where to look (in the case of galaxies you need mostly dark skies). Now if you want to know if you can see them WELL as opposed to *just* seeing them, then as others have pointed out, the larger the aperture (diameter of objective lens or mirror) the more you will see. Because of expense reflectors are more suited than refractors >100mm to see these things.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: If the world is moving so fast along its axis, around the sun, and through universe, why dont we feel it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The world is spinning, so we're like masses attached to a cord and spinning around very fast.  If the cord is cut, then the mass would go bye-bye.\n\nBut fortunately our cord, which is gravity, can't be cut, and it holds us to the surface of the earth.  We can't feel it because gravity exerts a force on us much larger than the centrifugal reaction "force", but if it suddenly dissappeared we would feel that force and go flying out of the planet.\n\nAbout that answer that says that we're moving at the same speed, it's partially right.   I'l put it like this:  We are moving with the earth at its tangential speed, but when we ride on a rollercoaster we are moving at the same speed as the cart, then why can we feel it as it spins and turns?   Things spinning mean acceleration, and acceleration means that we're not on an inertial frame of reference, which is the only place that answer will be valid.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Seriously why does water not burn.  Two hydrogen atoms (rocket fuel) and one oxygen (also rocket fuel).? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When hydrogen burns, it produces water.  That's the end result of the burning process.  It would be like you saying, seriously, why can't we cook already cooked bread to get fresh bread.  You already cooked it, it's not going to change anymore.\nWater also doesn't break apart into it's individual atoms very easily.  You either need electricity or heat hotter than the sun.  But if you do break it up, yep, it'll burn.  But it's not water then, it's 2 hydrogens and an oxygen.  And when it burns it'll make water.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: How many calories do you burn when you sneeze? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Though it seems violent and energetic, the only muscular event is contraction of the diaphragm and stomach muscles for less than a second.  The most vigorous physical activity (which sneezing isnt) burns about 1800 calories per hour, so about 30 calories per minute, or half a calorie per second.  So I would estimate it to be something well under 1 calorie.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Why does a glass tumbler crack when hotwater is poured in it? [SEP] question_content: It relates to thermal expansion.\nAlso tell why cycle tyre bursts on a hot summer afternoon. [SEP] best_answer: interior of cup expands faster than exterior of cup due to poor thermal conductivity of the cup material.\n\nglasses that are thin enough will not suffer this problem because heat can conduct thru thin materials easily so that thermal expansion is more or less equal on the interior and exterior.\n\nyou can also force one of your glasses to break by cooling the glass with ice water, dumping the ice water away and then dousing the glass with boiling water. try not to hurt yourself.\n\nbicycle tire ruptures due to a simpler explanation. the tire cannot withstand increased pressures that occur when a gas is heated in a closed system.

question_title: what do i need to create a control circuit to regulate an AC engine speed? [SEP] question_content: I want to use PWM techniques to regulate the speed of a relativly small AC engine. I know there are integrated circuits that can performe this task, but this is a college proyect so my friends and I need to create the contorl circuits ourselves. First we need to now how PWM technique work (Specifically the mathematical behavior of the wave shape  in time). Now the control circuit will be attached to a three-phase inversor that consits of six IGBT's. The load conected to the inverso will be of course an AC engine. The engine speed will change in time, so we need to control the voltage at the bornes using PWM techniques. Remember we cannot use integrated circuits available on the market other than IGBT's and maybe some operational amplifiers, it is important to build the control circuit ourselves, so the more specific the answers the better. [SEP] best_answer: You should use pulse width modulation (PWM).  PWM is essentially an on-off sequence in time, like a square wave alternating between 0 and 1.\n\nClearly full voltage will give you maximum speed.  This happens when the voltage is always on.  Now, suppose you only wanted to go half the maximum speed.  You could send a a square wave with 50% duty cycle (on half the time and off half the time) at high enough frequency that the motor will spin at a constant 50% maximum speed.  The motor is like a lowpass filter and therefore, a square wave at high enough frequency will produce a steady response without oscillation.\n\nIf you want the motor to go slower, say, at 25% maximum velocity then send a pulse that is on 25% of the time and off 75% of the time.\n\nIn reality, if you want 25% speed you may have to send something like a 27% duty cycle because of the time delay between commanding 'on' and the system actually turning 'on'.  In this application, though, I don't think you will have this porblem.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why is a chemical bond covalent? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When two elements come together, the type of bond they from depends on the number of valence electrons.  Everybody is shooting for 8 valence electrons with the exception of couple of elements (i.e. hydrogen which is happy with 2). If the number of valence electrons is such that, it's tough for an element to lose or gain that many electrons to achive 8 valence electrons, two elements share electrons to fill their valence shill with 8 electrons and a covalent bond is formed.

question_title: HOw do electrons create the colors in a line-emission spectrum? [SEP] question_content: please, its very important [SEP] best_answer: A material's emission spectrum is the amount of electromagnetic radiation of each frequency it emits when it is heated (or more generally when it is excited).\n\nWhen the electrons in the element are excited, they jump to higher energy levels. As the electrons fall back down, and leave the excited state, energy is re-emitted, the wavelength of which refers to the discrete lines of the emission spectrum. Note however that the emission extends over a range of frequencies, an effect called spectral line broadening.\n\nThe term often refers to the visible light emission spectrum, although it extends to the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from the low energy radio waves up to high energy gamma rays.\n\nThe emission spectrum can be used to determine the composition of a material, since it is different for each element of the periodic table. One example is identifying the composition of stars by analysing the received light.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: who is the founder of Super computer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A supercomputer is a computer that leads the world in terms of processing capacity, particularly speed of calculation, at the time of its introduction. (The term "Super Computing" was first used by New York World newspaper in 1929 to refer to a large custom built tabulators IBM had made for Columbia University.)\n\nSupercomputers introduced in the 1960s were designed primarily by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), and led the market into the 1970s until Cray left to form his own company, Cray Research. He then took over the supercomputer market with his new designs, holding the top spot in supercomputing for 5 years (1985–1990). In the 1980s a large number of smaller competitors entered the market, in a parallel to the creation of the minicomputer market a decade earlier, but many of these disappeared in the mid-1990s "supercomputer market crash". Today, supercomputers are typically one-of-a-kind custom designs produced by "traditional" companies such as IBM and HP, who had purchased many of the 1980s companies to gain their experience, although Cray Inc. still specializes in building supercomputers	Science & Mathematics

The test is performed with a 5kg “kerbstone” dropped from one meter to create the test impact force of 50 Joules The standard contains two levels of energy transmission performance. 18kN passes LEVEL 1 "basic" compliance and 9kN passes LEVEL 2 "high performance" compliance. So LEVEL 2 protectors allow 50% less energy to reach the spine. .\n\n4kN is the medically recommended level of transmitted force, but is NOT actually required by the current CE back protector standard EN1621-2 LEVEL 1 or LEVEL 2, and most protectors cannot provide this level at the 50 Joule impact level.

question_title: briefly explain the process of electrophoresis and illustrate it's uses in DNA technology.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Electrophoresis is a process used in molecular biology labs where a given protein, often of unknown composition, is migrated through a gel with polarity;positively charged on one side and negatively on another, such that the protein, in this case DNA, is migrated through the gel to create "bands" (visual horizontal lines).  The distance that the DNA fragment migrates is inversely proportional to the (log 10) of their molecular weight.  This enables the researcher to deduct the sequence of the codons within the particular DNA sequence and this is critical in mapping genes and sequencing.\n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis is an easy way to separate DNA fragments by their sizes and visualize them. It is a common diagnostic procedure used in molecular biological labs.\nThe technique of electrophoresis is based on the fact that DNA is negatively charged at neutral pH due to its phosphate backbone. For this reason, when an electrical potential is placed on the DNA it will move toward the positive pole (source:  http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/classes/bicd101.SP06/Electrophoresis_of_DNA.doc)\n\nSee this link for more info:\nhttp://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/biotech/gels/agardna.html	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why bananas are first green, then yellow? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Ripening is a process in fruit that causes them to become more edible. In general, fruits become sweeter, less acidic, less green, and softer as they ripen.\n\nStages of a plant's life are influenced by hormones. An important plant hormone involved with ripening is the chemical ethylene, a gas created by plants from the amino acid methionine. Ethylene causes increased levels of certain enzymes in fruit, which include:\n\nAmylase, which breaks down starch to produce simple sugars, and Pectinase, which breaks down pectin, a substance that keeps fruit hard. \nOther enzymes break down the lime pigment chlorophyll, which is replaced by blue, yellow, or red pigments.

question_title: What do you think about terraforming? Will it ever be practically possible? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It seems unnecessary since space settlement will be able to build more than a thousand times the Earth's surface area for us to live on while with Venus you might get the surface area of the Earth after a lot of effort and with Mars you'll get maybe a third or so (unless you do without oceans).\n\nTerraforming though is certainly possible, Mars would be easier than Venus but Venus would probably be a better planet once you finished it.\n\nTo terraform Mars you just increase the thickness of the atmosphere, put some plants there to give it oxygen and get some more heat to the planet (either you create a greenhouse effect or you put mirrors in orbit of the planet).  The biggest problem with Mars is the lower gravity.  It might not be a problem or might only be a problem if the Martians want to return to Earth or it might be almost as bad as zero g (and unlike in space it is very hard to make a large centrifuge on a planet).  The higher gravity will also make Mars incapable of holding an atmosphere with a lot of oxygen in it for any great length of time so over millions of years you'll have to replace the oxygen that leaks out.\n\nVenus has higher gravity (about 90% of Earth) so I don't expect gravity to be a problem there although heat is going to be a big problem.  Venus simply receives too much sunlight which is why it is so hot.  Even if you were to remove the atmosphere it would still be 100 °C which is far too hot for anyone to live so you have to reduce the insolation somehow.  Moving the planet would be the best way in my opinion although a giant filter between Venus and the sun (say at Sun-Venus L1) would also work.  Once you reduce the amount of sunlight striking the planet you can start to work on getting the atmosphere down to a more reasonable pressure by removing the CO_2 preferably by putting it into the rocks and then adding water.\n\nWith water you can then add plants and get photosynthesis going so that you can get the oxygen atmosphere needed.\n\nMercury might be another possibility but it combines the problems of Mars (low gravity and small size) with the problems of Venus (too much sunlight).

Et quand on voit la vitesse du 8 néo-zélandais, j'ai cru que c'était Rokocoko qui sprintait !! Mais je crois qu'on est plus près qu'eux qu'on ne le croit. Si toutes les pénatouches à 5m sont mises, ça nous fait +21 points, et eux -14pts (deux essais sur deux contres). Ca aurait pu être 24-37. Et encore, le score aurait été mois net, donc les Français auraient toujours pu croire à la victoire (quand il y a -27 après 50 minutes, c'est plus dur que -7 ).

[SEP] question_content: I want to take a women on my ski & fish runabout.\nDo I need to get a port-a-potty or something? [SEP] best_answer: Depending where you are. If we're out in the bay and there is no one around, you just hang over the edge. However if the water is choppy you have to be a little more careful. If there are other people around, you can get into the water, or complain to your husband that he need to get a port-a-potty. But these are not feasible on a smaller boat as they tend to spill out, and anyone can see you drop you drawers anyway...if she is shy tell her to get in the water. But you need to go over all of this with her before you take her out there.	Sports

[SEP] question_content: was i?  i'm not sure.  they just let edmonton back in the series when they went to edmonton.  they lost momentum and just crashed and burned out after the second loss.  i thought they played ok in the series but they just gave up.  there is always next year.  at least they got farther than dallas and detroit and the new york rangers. [SEP] best_answer: I'm not disappointed.  When I was there for the last Ducks/Sharks game at the Sharktank, the Sharks fans got too cocky for their own good.\n\nI think its karma.  They thought the Thorton /Cheechoo line was unbeatable.  Then when Toskala gave up that one goal by trying to play the puck, the entire game shifted to the Oilers.\n\nThe last clinch was the fans booing the Canadian anthem.  Sure, fans are posting they were not booing at the song but at the TV monitor... yeah, whatever, but the fact is, that fired up the Oilers and they beat the Sharks in 4 consecutive game.. because of Cockiness.\n\nSharks fans... have those Raider fans turned hockey fans stay home if you want to win.

question_title: Fix old bike or buy new one.? [SEP] question_content: When i bought my trek for $200 i thought it would last a long time but it has gone bad w/ many things wrong w/ it. The estimate to have it fixed would cost $140. So i cant decide whether to fix it or buy a new bike for $140. Someone help, i'm undecided! [SEP] best_answer: There are a lot of things to consider first. How old is the bike? What kind of condition is the frame in? How often and what type of riding do you do?\n\nIf the bike is very old you might want to consider getting a new one. Newer bikes have features that you may not have on your bike. For example, more gears, lighter parts, better brakes, etc. Buying a new bike may get you a lot of features that you would not get by having this one fixed. On the other hand, you may not need any of these and your old bike was working just fine until  you started having all these problems.\n\nCheck the frame out for wear or damage. If the frame is steal, which I'm guessing it is based on the price you paid, check for rust especially around the spots were the welds are. If the frame is starting to rust, you would just be throwing you money away by adding new parts to a bad frame. If the frame is aluminum and you do any kind of regular riding, consider getting a new bike if this bike is more than 5 years old. Aluminum has a fatigure limit and the frames generally wear out after about 5 years of regular use.\n\nFinally, if you are just a casual rider and use the bike for fun and just getting around on, you may be able to skip some of the repairs they quoted you and just get enough done to keep the bike moving. However, if you ride a lot or ride off road, you will want your bike to be in the best shape possible. $140 is not a lot to pay for a tune up, including adjusting all the deraillers and cables. Drive train parts wear out over time and need to be replaced. If you get a new bike, considering spending a bit more to get a quality bike that will last a long time. $200 is not a lot to pay for a new bike and investing a little more might get you a much better bike. Not only will it last longer but you will have a better experience riding it.\n\nIf you are really interested in keeping this bike and don't want to pay the bike shop to fix. Most of the repairs can be done at home with a few simple tools. Get a repair manual from your bike shop and you should be able to fix most anything yourself. Just be careful when taking things apart that you remember how to put them back together.	Sports

question_title: Who should the chargers draft in the nfl draft and do you think rivers will lead the chargers to the playoffs? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I like Sinrice Moss, the WR from Miami.  He has the ability to get down the field for the big play.  I think that would compliment the short passing game they have with Gates, who can breakout after the catch, and would make McCardell a possesion reciever, which he should be.\n\nRivers is the big question mark though.  He hasn't had much experience.  That could hurt the Chargers this year.  They're in what could be the toughest conference in the NFL, Oakland aside.  Could be a tough season, I think they miss the playoffs by a game or two.	Sports

Unless you've damaged these, an upgrade seems a bit unnecessary. There are better wheels around, but they're really expensive and the performance gain will be marginal. If you need this edge change the bike! The Cannondale is good, but its getting on a bit now and there are better frames around.	Sports
question_title: Do any of you think they should get rid of Kip Wells, or signed him back.?

They thought he would bring a veteran presence to a young staff.   Also, they thought he would eat  his share of innings.\nI don't think it matters what we think about this, because the Pirates will keep him.  It sort  of made me feel sick to my stomach when I heard about his contract, though.  \nBefore his injury, it was said what a good job Tracy and Colbert were doing with Kip.  I sure hope so.  We'll see next month when he comes off the IR.	Sports

question_title: Should Mark McGwire make the baseball hall of fame? [SEP] question_content: I say he should.  Steroid use is purely speculative, as he has never admitted it or tested positive for it. [SEP] best_answer: Everyone is bringing up steroids; I don't care if he used them or not - he's NOT a Hall of Famer.\n\nHis numbers just aren't there; this is the "Hall of Fame" - not the "Hall of Guys who were fairly good at ONE aspect of a game when there's '5 Tools' behind true greatness."\n\nTo me, Big Mac had TWO "HOF" caliber seasons; 1996 and 1998. The guy played 15 years and all he could muster was ONE season over .300 in which he played over 90 games.\n\n.300 is the mark of a 'good' hitter; not even great. Big Mac has a career average of .263; that's average-to-below-average; Big Mac was a BELOW AVERAGE contact-hitter - playing a position that wasn't at a premium defensively - that almost makes him a liability.\n\n583 - his homerun total - is impressive. Very good. Prodigal; even. As is his 10.6 At Bats per Home Run(good for best all time).\n\nBut his strikeout totals are pretty 'impressive' too; if you like big numbers. He's 23rd all-time(1596). Which doesn't contrast very nicely with the fact that he isn't in the Top 100 for all-time at-bats - I don't know what he ranks in that; only that it's over 1500 less than the guy who is 100th (Bid McPhee, 8291). What I'm getting at: He strikes out too much to be a hall of famer.\n\nSo, he strikes out too much; he doesn't hit for average. He's not even top 5 in home runs - but that's not the worst of it.\n\nHe's a choker. He has a .217 career average in the post-season. His prodigal power becomes timid in the post season; 5 HRs in 129 ABs. That's ONE homerun for every 25.8 at-bats; Which is rather pedestrain. So, Big Mac turns into a Kid's Meal under pressure. Hall of Fame? Pshaw - David Eckstein is more of a HOFer once October rolls around. This is a guy they needed to count on; he was a key part of the batting order; called upon to produce - he didn't.\n\nYou want to enshrine someone who lived and died(judging by his Batting Average and Strike Outs, mostly died) by the Home Run - an overrated statistic, if you ask me - who can't buy a hit in the post season - into the Hall.\n\nNo; just no.

Some of their games were at the LSU Tigers Stadium. The others, played where the team wanted, were in San Antonio. That was where the team moved to and had their work outs. Basically the team decides where they are going to. As to where they play I'm sure part of the NFL rules would give about the distance but I think with a displaced team that is basically waived.

[SEP] best_answer: I despair that the French (well some few petty officials) are still going after him, despite all the proof to the contrary (except in their minds), shame on them and bringing their sport into disrepute.\n\nWhat i can say is that Lance wont give a ****, he had no reason to "win" against them - hes done all the real taking that matters.

question_title: what is the difference between figure skating jumps??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Almost every budding figure skater I’ve encountered doesn’t want to spend their time learning swivels, crossovers or turns. They want to jump! Who can blame them? Jumping makes you feel like an accomplished figure skater. The first jump learned by every figure skater is the most basic of them all, the waltz jump. Even in its simplicity, this half rotation jump can be a beautiful jump to watch and master and is often used as the cornerstone for mastering the most difficult of jumps, the axel.\nIn order for a jump to be successful, it has been said the most important aspect is the time spent on the ice two to three seconds before take-off. The waltz jump and axel are the only two jumps where the skater leaves the ice in a forward position. \n\n\nA waltz jump begins with a long glide on a right back outside edge (any edge stuff in website?). The right knee should be slightly bent, or soft, and the hips level. The left leg is pointed straight out behind the skating leg allowing the skater to keep their hips level to the ice. The skater then draws their left skate in behind the heel of the skating leg and steps forward onto a left forward outside edge. Leading with the left shoulder, the skater kicks the right leg up and through to begin the lift in the air. Because this is only a half rotation jump, the arms should be held away from the body. If the arms are held tight and close to the body, it will initiate more of a rotation in the air than necessary. In the air, the skater must transfer their weight from the left leg over to the right hip in preparation for landing. As with all jumps, the skater lands on a right back outside edge, knee soft, left leg extended, arms out, and chin high held proudly high.\nThe good news about the waltz jump is there is not much that can go wrong. If you want to ensure learning the axel is as painless as possible, it’s worth learning and executing the waltz jump correctly. There are several post jump analyses the skater can do to ensure the jump has been executed correctly. First, as with all jumps, spins and edge work, analyze the tracing made by the skating blade. Specific to the waltz jump, the right back outside edge, left forward outside edge and right back outside landing edge should form a continuous arc on the ice, interrupted only by the change in feet from back to front and the distance covered in the jump from take off to landing.\n\nAdditionally, the skater knows they are doing the jump correctly when they feel like they are floating suspended in the air, landing squarely and solidly over the right hip. Landing cleanly on a right back outside edge should allow the skater to maintain their speed and provide flow out of the jump.\n\nWhile gliding on a right back outside edge, the upper body should not be forced around by the edge. If this happens, there will be a tendency to pull your left side back and swing the right leg around the body instead of driving it up and through. Both arms need to drive forward and up, acting as a counter to the forces trying to make you pivot around the left leg.\n\nGreat jumpers are not great skaters. Conversely, sound stroking, footwork and spins all aid in a creating a great jumper. Excellent edge quality is essential for jump set ups and landings. Likewise, spinning is vital in achieving perfect vertical air position as well as tight rotations. In jumping, the skater must use their basic skills as a strong foundation for an impeccable jump. Breaking any jump down into small pieces using the skating technique they already possess will allow the skater to learn specific jumps properly and successfully.	Sports

question_title: how can i improve...? [SEP] question_content: hi. i was wondering how i could improve on some things concerning hockey. i play for high school jv and am in 8th grade. I need to get faster, alot faster. any suggestions. (i need em really bad) also, how can i improve on stick handeling and shooting? please give detailed and helpful answers. thank you!\n   p.s. - for those of you who play good hockey, (like open high school,AAA) how often do you workout practice and what do you eat to stay fit?) [SEP] best_answer: Lots of good suggestions made so far. Skating with weights is a great one..it really helps you feel lighter and quicker. All leg excerises are good, speed starts with your burst and you need leg strength to have burst. \n  To improve stick handling the biggest trick is to get a shorter stick. Most players who struggle with stick handling often have too long a stick. If you cut your stick now with skates on to your nose try cutting it to your chin. If you use a shorter stick it may also help with some speed as it will get you a little lower in your skating position.\n  Last there is NO substitute for practice! Listen to the best players around you and the pro's and the common theme you will hear is how hard they work at their game. Dont go through the motions when practicing...keep your focus and practice like it is the end of the game and you need a goal. And practice specific skills during each practice, dont hop around doing a little of this-a little of that.\n Good luck...and remember skate with your head up!	Sports

Start searching the web for clubs with websites to see if you can find any positions available.  Also, start calling around to clubs to see when they'll be interviewing for positions.  Patience and persistence pays off.\n\nI just wanted to add that if you don't have experience, you can get experience by taking a volunteer position.  After a couple years of that, you can get a paid position.  And then you just work you way up by moving to better clubs.  \n\nGood luck!	Sports

[SEP] best_answer: I would definitely keep Beckett over Dontrelle, especially if you need wins.\n\nFlorida is awful and it won't be better anytime soon, plus Willis is struggling so far, SO it's a no brainer I think.\n\nI would drop Wood and keep Clemens, get a good starting pitcher to replace Wood and you should be fine.

question_title: what is wrong with the confederate flag? [SEP] question_content: Why does everyone assume that the Rebel Flag (Confederate) hate it so much? Im just wondering. and why does everyone assume its always used for raceism instead of Heratige, when its actually a battal flag for the south? [SEP] best_answer: Many people believe that the only reason the Civil War was fought was because of slavery. In reality, though, the War's principal reason for starting was because many southerners did not agree that men who lived hundreds of miles away had the right to dictate their way of life (back then, the distance from D.C. to Georgia or South Carolina made them seem like seperate countries-no airplanes). To most people, the Confederate flag represents racism for that very reason. My great-great-great grandaddy died wearing a Confederate uniform, and by reading his journals, I understand why he chose to do so. My family never owned slaves-we were dirt poor in the 1800's-, but he honestly believed in states rights, and that a federal government had no right to decide what was right or wrong for him. I don't care that the South lost the war-it was almost 150 years ago! But like the great General Lee said of the men who served the Confederacy: They gave more than they were asked to give, and they gave it without complaint. That's enough for me-I'll always show respect to the Confederate flag, and honor the men who died under it, fighting for something they believed in.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why God barbeque The Dalai Lama on the grill of righteousness for being a Buddhist? [SEP] question_content: The Dalai Lama is the Buddhist leader who speaks about love for your neighbor and forgiveness.  He has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his positive contributions to the world.  Here are some of his quotes:\n"This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness." \n"All major religious traditions carry basically the same message, that is love, compassion and forgiveness ... the important thing is they should be part of our daily lives." \n"The very purpose of religion is to control yourself, not to criticise others. Rather, we must criticise ourselves. How much am I doing about my anger? About my attachment, about my hatred, about my pride, my jealousy?"\n"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."\n\nHe has not asked Jesus to be his Savior. So based on Christianity, God will throw him into the lake of fire right? [SEP] best_answer: There is no singular head of Buddhism. \nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama is only the religious leader of Tibet .	Society & Culture

The gnostic writers didn't even know Jesus so how could they write about him? [SEP] best_answer: I know and to be a gospel it had to be written by one of the disciples or their assistant.

question_title: Is religion the result of living in society? [SEP] question_content: Religion has been always present in all kind of societies. From the most primitive ones: the banana tree, the sun etc to more complex forms of God, religion has evolved as societies have change with time. Perhaps, religion is a way to control society with certain approved rules ( that always change over time) made by the same society. [SEP] best_answer: in my opinion, religion is the result of man's search for that absolute someone they can look up to, or that perfect entity they can rely on.\n\nreligion has been made up by the society in order to try to give order to chaos, to have some rules to live by. but it's not necessarily the result of living in the society.

question_title: Im gay, but im only attracted to straight men.....what to do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Dude! I have exactly the same problem. Living in a very conservative area I do it alot. Here are some tips on how to get around it based on what I do.\n-Surround yourself with girlfriends and talk to them about it. They always come together and help you forget about the guy.\n-Make a real effort to become friends with him. It may sound counter preductive but if you start to see him as a friend instead of a sex object then that is better and potentially more rewarding. I did this and that's how I found one of the best friends I've ever had.\n-Visit gay bars and have sex. I know that this sounds rather immoral and disgusting but it could work.\n-Find a hobby and immerse yourself in it. That way you can meet new people who are interested in the same things and help you to move on.\n\nThere are many other ways too. You end up picking the one which feels best for you. But there is ALWAYS a solution.\n\nGood luck buddy.	Society & Culture

question_title: What kind of proof would you accept to convert to another religion? [SEP] question_content: This has been a question on my mind for awhile. I would like to hear opinions as to what people would take for conclusive evidence that another religion has enough to interest you.\n\nHave a great day! [SEP] best_answer: First, I would have to have some reason to think that my current belief is wrong.  I believe the Bible, and it is historically accurate and without contradiction (despite the charges of those who have never read it).  It is supported by evidence, both internal and external.\n\nNext, I would have to be convinced that the other religion is correct.  It is possible for two contradictory beliefs to both be wrong, but they cannot both be right.  Does it agree with history and science?  Is it internally correct, or is it filled with contradiction?  What is the character of the founder(s)?  There is a major world religion (which I will not mention here) whose founder claimed that he took a stairway to heaven and saw the stars as literally made of silver and hanging from silver chains from the ceiling.  Nothing could make be convert to that religion.  Another was founded by a convicted con man, who said that he could find water on your farm by looking at a rock in his hat.  One was started by a woman who had 'visions of heaven' after severe head trauma.	Society & Culture

question_title: Is true Christianity secret? [SEP] question_content: Luke 8:10\nHe said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, " 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'\n\nJohn 18:20\n"I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.\n\n1 Corinthians 2:6-8\nWe do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.  No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. [SEP] best_answer: The true Christian knowledge taught by Jesus was not understandable by everyone nor was everyone deserving of a full explanation. if you were spiritually ready you would get it. he said "cast not your pearls before swine" this was kind of spiritual elitism and so was  later removed from the so-called teaching of Christ so absolutely anybody could get to be a christian with no effort or knowledege. that is why it got so popular. But true Christanity does have secrets that only certain people can get.	Society & Culture
question_title: What is your opinions and thoughts on gay marriages? Adoptation of children? [SEP] question_content: Why do you say it is wrong or ok? [SEP] best_answer: I think its' ok. Look at it like this. If gays are allowed to marry, some will want to adopt and have a family just like everyone else. They dont mind adopting the children that others dont want. If abortion is made illegal, there will be a huge increase in children being given up, right? Who's going to adopt those children? Gays dont 'raise children gay'. There has been many studies on this. They are actually less rigid and judgemental to the children they care for, probably because they were given hell by their own parents. Most children raised by gays turn out straight. This makes sense cause only 3-10% of the population is born gay and gay people dont generally 'recruit'. Banning gay marriage is just like the Jim Crow laws of the last century. It is discrimination and bigotry. The problem is that gays are only a small percentage of the population. Even if every single one of them marched to make their voice heard, it would be dwarved by the Civil Rights marches of past days. Is it ok to bigot against them just because they are too small a minority to force change? Look into the other reasons for gay marriage, like your gay partner being able to make medical decisions for you in emergencies, power of Attorney, inheriting property or estate, funeral decisions. These people are mostly in commited loving relationships that last for many decades, but when a crisis happens they are pushed aside, have no right to decide care for their lover, can be called to testify against their partner, can be shoved aside by the sick ones family.

[SEP] question_content: According to the Bible, if a baby dies for any reason, does it go to heaven?\n\nIf no, where does the baby go?\n\n(No personal opinions please, I'm wondering what the Bible says) [SEP] best_answer: I see double standard from Christians in this regard. Because they believe that every one is born in sin of adam and eve. So the babies are sinner. no matter if the baby dies just after 1 day. he or she will be sinner becuase he or she has not accepted Christ as his saviour. so according to this logic. the baby should go to hell. \n\n\nIn islam, everyone is born sinless. there is no concept of original sin in islam. Islam makes sense in this regard. and if a baby dies, he or she will directly go to paradise.\n\nhope this answers.\n\n\n\n=============================\nEDIT ************************\n\nSORRY I FORGOT TO MENTION ONE THING/.\n\n\nRegarding the concept of original sin, it is taught by the church. What the church teaches that Eve (pbuh), she tempted Adam pbuh to eat the forbidden food, and because of that humankind is born in Sin.\n\nIn Quran, the story of Adam and Eve  is mentioned. But there is not a single verse in the Quran which puts the blame only on Eve pbuh. If you read the Quran 7:19-27, it says both of them disobeys Almighty God. Both of them repented and both of them was forgiven. The blame is put equally on both. There is not a single verse in the Quran which puts the blame only on Eve pbuh. But there is one verse in Quran which speaks about only Adam pbuh, i.e. Quran 20:121 says that Adam pbuh disobeys almighty God. \nI am asking you a question that Did Eve and Adam peace be upon them ask me to eat the forbidden food? No. So how can I be held responsible. Its illogical! If they ask me and i have given them permission then i will be responsible. \n\nAccording to the bible sin is not inherited. \nEZEKIEL 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the sin of the father, neither shall the father bear the sin of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. \nEZEKIEL 18:21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.\n\nIf son shall not bear the sin of father, how can we be born in sin. What the church teaches that sin is inherited, is against the bible. Islam says that every child is born sinless. \n\nDEUTERONOMY 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.\n\n===============================\n\nTHE QUESTION WAS REGARDING BIBLE, BUT I MENTIONED DEATAILS ABOUT ISLAM TOO BECAUSE ISLAM BELIVES IN JESUS AND REVELATION OF GOD ON JESUS.

[SEP] best_answer: Atheist here, and yes, I have indeed tried to see the other side of the arguement.\n\nI was raised Lutheran from infancy, so I've got 20+ years of Christian teachings under my belt. Went to church services and Sunday School weekly. With my family not going was NOT an option. I also own a Bible as a result of Sunday School attendance. New Revised Standard Version(NRSV), not a King James or any other version, but it's a Bible nonetheless. And yes, I have read it. The most recent time was this summer.\n\nSo there's no way that I'm unqualified to speak on religious matters as far as Christianity's concerned.\n\nWhen I answer questions on here or the rare times I'm able to speak with someone personally about religion and not end up in a fight over it, I try to see their side of the arguement, provided they haven't jumped right into insults and "You're wrong" and "You're going to burn in Hell" sort of crap right off the bat. Unfortunately, a lot of people where I live do just that, so you can see why it's rare I'm able to speak civilly with people in my hometown about religion.\n\nWhen it comes to insults and bigotry, I don't even bother. I walk away from people who talk like that to me in person and on YA, if I see questions I feel are biased or worse, I don't even bother to answer them. If a person's honest and polite, I'm all too happy to answer. If a person's just being an obnoxious jerk, I don't even waste my bandwidth.\n\nWith polite people, I do try to see their side of the arguement, especially when I do already understand Christianity. When it comes to other religions I'm not as familiar with, even though I might not fully understand them, I try to, and I do defend other religions as I know that religion itself isn't a bad thing. No truly bad religions, just bad followers.\n\nYes, I have even defended Christianity more than once. I defended it just a few minutes ago with the question I answered just before this one about the whole church and state and prayer in school issue. A lot of Christians think they don't have the right to pray in a public school, but I've looked into that myself for the last ten years.\n\nJust because it was decided in 1963 that it wasn't right and constitutional to require kids to recite a prayer(from my mother, it sounds like it was usually the Lord's Prayer, at least when she was young. Seeing as how the ruling was made long before I was born, I can't say if that was standard or just what my mother's school did), doesn't mean Christianity is "banned". Christian kids can freely pray or read the Bible or hold Bible clubs(if they allow things like photography clubs, they can allow Bible and other religious clubs as well) or invite another classmate to join them for services.\n\nI might be an atheist and I might not want my own children to have to recite the Lord's Prayer or any prayer in school, doesn't mean I won't stand up for the rights of Christians and anyone else who's religious to have their beliefs at school, or when holding office, or whatever. Just because you step into a public place, doesn't mean you have to leave your beliefs at home. All it means is that you have to be aware and respectful of others and that goes for everyone.\n\nI was raised Christian and had my own beliefs(and eventually nonbelief as I was sort of paganistic for a time before I turned to atheism) stepped on and treated as if I was undeserving before. My own family has unfortunately taken to this sort of behavior from time to time. It's happened to me way too many times, so I'm not about to do it to anyone else.\n\nI have gone to church, I've read the Bible, I've studied church and state matters and tried to learn about and understand other religions for some time. I've had painful personal experiences when it comes to my beliefs being stepped on. 	Society & Culture
question_title: how do i find the right church and join it? [SEP] question_content: I am a single mom with 3 kids.  My daughter is 6 months old and is mixed in race.  I have not attended a church in probably 10 years but I feel that it is something my children and I are missing in our lives.  I do not even know where to start looking.  I feel like an outcast because of my situation.  I do not have a lot of money because i am a nursing student.  i feel like they look down on me because of this.  our town is pretty small and it seems like only the people with money go.  please help i want to go but dont understand how to find or begin going. [SEP] best_answer: Money should never ever be an issue.  If you feel that a church looks down on you, either you're over sensitive or they have a real problem.  In a good congregation nobody is an outcast.  I'm also a student with very little money but I feel more than welcome in my church, and even sing in the choir and help with creche.  \n\nIf you went to church as a kid then start with a church of that denomination.  Otherwise just start with your nearest one.  A library or information centre will have a list of churches and sevice times and many have their own websites.  \n\nStarting to go is easy, you just need to pluck up the courage to walk in to a church on the Sunday morning.  There's no preparation involved, you don't need any contacts there.  You should recieve a warm welcome, as churches are always trying to bring more people in.  Hang around after the service, most churches do refreshments and you'll have a chance to introduce yourself to the minister and members of the congregation and get a feel for the place.  You'll probably find that not everybody is rich, and everybody will want to be friends with you.  \n\nGo to each church in the area for a couple of weeks, as one visit won't always be enough for an accurate impression, then make a decision as to which one you prefer. \n\nIf you don't have one which is nearer than the others, baptist and methodist churches tend to be friendly (this is coming from the U.K so bear in mind if you're not in Britain the denominations may be different), so they would be good to start with.\n\nDo go for it, it will be the best thing you ever do.

question_title: My BF told me not to take the Porshe through the car wash because it ruin the paint, what's wrong with  paint? [SEP] question_content: Please explain why an automatic car wash would hurt the paint. [SEP] best_answer: There is nothing wrong with the paint on the Porshe. The problem is that car washes do damage to paint jobs whether it is a Bentley or a Kia. The ones with the brushes will leave microscopic scriches in the paint that will allow water and other elements to further damage the paint job. Touchless ones don't always remove all the cleansing agents and again can corrode the paint job. With run of the mill cars (ones 95% of us drive) owners don't really care. A Toyota with imperfections in the paint is still just a Toyota and most feel the effort taken to hand wash the car is more valuable than the paint job. Your boyfriend bought a Porshe because... well I don't know but after spending that kind of money he wants it to look as good as possible for as long as possible.	Society & Culture
question_title: Are you ready?? [SEP] question_content: I saw this article in my inbox today...\nJune 6 - Hell: It Isn't a Joke or Party    \n    It has been interesting watching the world speculate, pontificate, and get it all wrong; that is, the issue with this week's date of 666--June 6, 2006. I have tuned into secular talk radio and some television intentionally to hear what both credible Bible scholars and also fools have been saying about it. I was on two secular talk shows briefly to give the truth and the hosts received my words with interest.\nThe good news is that the secular world is curious. Many are open to hearing the truth and what they will do with it is up to them. The sad news is that at church services this week, very few will offer a sermon of prime importance: Jesus is coming again, likely sooner rather than later. Are you ready? And while the "feel good gospel" is so popular today, the greatest "feel good" message is that God has prepared a Home for us if we claim Him as Savior and Lord [SEP] best_answer: Yes, I am ready. Also, I agree with you about the sermons of today not telling us about the good news. Jesus is coming soon. The signs of the times are right for His coming and I believe that it will be sooner than most expect. Thank God that He has a place prepared for us that is beautiful beyond desciption. No more pain, tears, heartache, sin, or death can enter there. He is my Savior and Lord and I thank Him for His sacrifice.\nGod Bless	Society & Culture
question_title: What is Eid al Adha? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Eid ul-Adha (Arabic: عيد الأضحى) occurs on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhul Hijja. It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate. Eid ul-Adha is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son for God.\n\nMuslims believe that God revealed in a dream to Ibrahim (Prophet Abraham) to sacrifice his son Isma’il. Ibrahim and Isma’il set off to Mina for the sacrifice. As they went, the devil attempted to persuade Ibrahim to disobey God and not to sacrifice his beloved son. But Ibrahim stayed true to God, and drove the devil away. As Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son, God stopped him and gave him a sheep to sacrifice instead. The story is also a part of the other Abrahamic religions\n\nIt is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja (ذو الحجة) of the lunar Islamic calendar, after Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. This happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.\n\nWhile Eid ul-Fitr is considered to be three days, Eid ul-Adha is supposed to be four days. The first day is the primary holiday, on which men, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing and perform prayer (Salah) in a large congregation. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals, usually sheep, as a symbol of Ibrahim's sacrifice; this sacrifice is called "Qurban." The meat is distributed amongst their neighbors, relatives, and the poor and hungry. The charitable instincts of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during this day. Coming immediately after the Day of Arafat (when Muhammad pronounced the final seal on the religion of Islam), Eid ul-Adha gives concrete realization to what the Muslim community ethic means in practice.

What happened to christ you replaced him with some fat barstard who falls down a chimney!?\nIf I was christ I'd be pretty pissed off! [SEP] best_answer: Yes, I think it has been made corrupt. Most people think it's a time to spend more money they can afford, children becoming greedy, people pushing and shoving each other. Santa Claus is a myth that doesn't belong in Christmas. \n\nA lot of children don't even know what it is all about, except how many things they can get and how disappointed they are when they don't get what they want. There is only one meaning to Christmas and that's the birth of Christ. To me Christmas eve has more meaning than Christmas Day. I feel at peace knowing that Christ has been born in such a humble manner. Yes, the wise men gave Baby Jesus gifts to celebrate His birth, just like we give gifts on a persons birthday. \n\nIf we took all of the money that is spent on gifts and fed the homeless and those who are less fortunate than we are, that would be a real Christmas and a gift to Christ.\n\nSo how about it everybody, let's put Christ back into Christmas.

question_title: What do you think of this....? [SEP] question_content: I know several people that are getting medicaid, foodstamps and other forms of welfare because they are not married and have children. What the government does not know is that these women are kliving with the father of their children and these men make plenty of money to support them and they do. I think this is disgusting and unfair to those people out there who really need help, they should be ashamed of theirselves. what do you think and do you think that the government should maybe do a little more investigating before approving these people. [SEP] best_answer: agree with you. It's something I think about quite a lot. Where I come from to work is kind of a privledge and a pain in the ass at the same time, but taxes do take a sizeable chunk out of anyone's income. People on a benefit admittedly do not receive a large income, but it's a pain in the ass when they say that they should be on one because "boo hoo" they are a single parent or whatever. And when the people who are working and basically, apart from all the rest of it, paying for them through their taxes, quite possibly have things which they could choose to say "boo hoo" about also. Anyway - that is just regarding your basic everyday run of the mill single parent family, which honestly probably does need quite a lot of help. If someone is together with someone else and passing themselves off as single so they can claim more benefits, then that is shitty yes. If they have plenty of money coming from someone else I don't think they should be chasing welfare stamps as a lifestyle option.	Society & Culture
question_title: do u think that religion is the most important thing in our life? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Not RELIGION... but the spiritual development of your soul is the most important thing in your life... It should be important that you create as great a soul as any artist does in creating a work of art... and you make your own code of conduct based upon the highest principles that you decide to implement as a code... and you may want to upgrade your code to higher levels of actions of living and interacting with other persons...  Living a good life for yourself and how you treat others... is most important in your daily living... Religions are only organizations that guide people... but most times they get too confused in that they try to take control of how people live their code... and they want to set the codes of what people should believe... and then some religions are mostly about money... which is really wrong... So, what some people do is they join a "religion" to get the basics... then they leave and formulate their own spiritual program.... Hope this helps...	Society & Culture

question_title: Spirit vs soul? [SEP] question_content: Whats the difference between spirit and soul ,is one mind and the other emotions? [SEP] best_answer: Precisely the same Hebrew phrase used of the animal creation, namely, ne'phesh chai·yah' (living soul), is applied to Adam, when, after God formed man out of dust from the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life, “the man came to be a living soul.” (Ge 2:7) Man was distinct from the animal creation, but that distinction was not because he was a ne'phesh (soul) and they were not. Rather, the record shows that it was because man alone was created “in God’s image.”  He was created with moral qualities like those of God, with power and wisdom far superior to the animals; hence he could have in subjection all the lower forms of creature life.  Man’s organism was more complex, as well as more versatile, than that of the animals. (1Co 15:39.) Likewise, Adam had, but lost, the prospect of eternal life; this is never stated with regard to the creatures lower than man.\n\nSoul, A Living Creature\n\nAs stated, man “came to be a living soul”; hence man was a soul, he did not have a soul as something immaterial, invisible, and intangible residing inside him. The apostle Paul shows that the Christian teaching did not differ from the earlier Hebrew teaching, for he quotes Genesis 2:7 in saying: “It is even so written: ‘The first man Adam became a living soul.’ The first man is out of the earth and made of dust.” 1Co 15:45-47.\n\nThe Genesis account shows that a living soul results from the combination of the earthly body with the breath of life. The expression “breath of the force of life [literally, breath of the spirit, or active force (ru'ach), of life]” (Ge 7:22) indicates that it is by breathing air (with its oxygen) that the life-force, or “spirit,” in all creatures, man and animals, is sustained. This life-force is found in every cell of the creature’s body	Society & Culture

question_title: Do Christians know that making partner with God is the greatest form of sin? [SEP] question_content: My sincere advice to all Christians:\n\n- Worship God alone\n- Ask God alone (for help)  \n- Pray to God alone\n\nJesus was a prophet sent by God to convey his message to the children of Israel... He worshiped and prayed to God and asked him for help. \n\nJesus was not crucified for the sins of people, since everyone is responsible for his own sins and it's God's choice to forgive them or not. God is the one who created us, he doesn't except perfection from us ,as he knows that he is the only perfect... he is the most merciful and can forgive all the sins if one returned to him and repented to him sincirly.\n\nThis is the true faith. [SEP] best_answer: wish they could believe  this all......*sigh*\n\n  making partner with God  is one of  the unforgivable sins	Society & Culture

question_title: Whats the easest way to get laid by a stranger,with little to no money?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A bar is a good place.... but you could spend as much as $100 between your drinks and the drinks you by for various girls.  (the first girl you buy a drink for will most likely NOT go home with you, so you might have to talk to a few girls)  Or just go to a crappy part of your town a pick up a hooker for $10.  WEAR A CONDOM, 'cause either way you are asking for a STD.  After you get laid (if you do) go to a clinic and get checked out. Some STDs can live in your body for as many as 15 yrs without any symptoms.  Some clinics test for little or no money and it is worth knowing.	Family & Relationships

At the time I had low self-esteem, but I wish now I could go back to that girl and tell her what she really is: Perfect.\n\nAnyway, if I were a man, I would want a big woman.  If I were gay I would want a big woman.  I love big women, all my friends are big women, I've TRIED being big again (the weight just didn't gain in the same spots as it was before).\n\nI think that when I felt used backthen was when I didn't care enough about myself, was insecure, and so I gave myself away faster than I would make a man work, earn, prove that he deserved me.  If I could do it over again, I'd be big and I would know how worthwhile I was.  Good luck to you, sweetheart.  I went out with one boy back then who broke up with me when I lost weight!

question_title: (a) WHAT  IS behind a needy person's automatic need to need? [SEP] question_content: (b) does it come from the environment  not giving that person what they need or is it a mechansim from the past - childhood?  \n\n(c) Can a needy person's needs ever be satisfied or are they a bottomless pit? [SEP] best_answer: What you perceive as a needy persons "Automatic" need to need may not be so automatic after all. For example if you enter a room and a baby starts to cry,,,you may perceive that to be an automatic need,  to need to be fed. When in reality perhaps the baby has been hungry for quite some time, and cried out to have that need met to the next person who entered the room.UN fulfilled needs come from both childhood and environment. I don't believe people are bottomless pits of needs . most will know when they are satisfied. It is only when one cannot determine need from want that neurosis manifests.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What is the average size of a mans penis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Average is hard to peg down, part of it will depend on culture and area, the kind of man you generally are interested in, lots of other variables.  If a number is to be assigned, generally about 5-6 inches is average, with moderate girth.  There are, obviously, some who seem to tip the scales further in one direction or another.  I would caution anyone against putting too much stock in size, as there are so many variables in sexual compatibility.  If the only basis for interest is a number, the person is interchangable.  No one wants to feel interchangable.	Family & Relationships

Not to mention he's given me an STD.  How do I tell him about the STD and tell him that I know he slept with some skank he met at the club and ask him if she was just a one night stand or not because typically he's not my man yet or should I take him saying that we are in some kind of relationship as him saying that he is my man?

With the extra money I'd be saving I could actually be able to do more with the kids.  As it is now I struggle to afford to take them to a movie or do anything. My single residence isn't kid friendly and they can't stay over...so I don't see them much now.  It feels like blackmail, but somehow it might be better.  Should I go for their deal? (my kids are 9 and 10 yrs.old) [SEP] best_answer: If you are comfortable with doing that then do it, but I would get a lawyer involved to make sure that you can see your children and get it in writing. They will always know you as their dad and im sure you love them alot, and they are just lucky enough to have another man that loves them just as much as you do.	Family & Relationships

There is a possibility some of those things were going on, but there is a greater possibility she says those things so you wont take her back.  Your best bet is to go and visit someplace else before you admit her.  Talk to area psychiatrists and pastors of a local church.  There are good places to go, it just takes time and effort.  Good luck.	Family & Relationships

question_title: friend is out of control!? [SEP] question_content: okay long story ill try to make it short. \n My friends have been together for 5 yrs now. He cheated on her once. He goes on long work trips to different states for 2 weeks at a time. Goes to who knows where when he is gone. She in turn cheated on him twice. They made up and were okay. He found out she was tweaking " using crank" and sleeping with some guy from highschool. they are 28 and 30 she is a dog groomer and he is a mechanic/drifter/racer. She has no care or concern for what he is doing. She goes off with these old friends and uses drugs and neglects her 10yr old son and her animals and house. But for some ungodly known reason he keeps fighting to get her back. Its to the point of calling family and cops to get them on his side. Its a mess. I told the guy to give up about a month ago and he just cant do it. Why is he pursuing something so worthless. She wont even talk to the guy and he is buying flowers and cards and big $$ gifts for her to get her to come back. IS HE STUPID? [SEP] best_answer: yes he is in love	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is it unethical to replace your engagement ring? [SEP] question_content: My fiance is in Iraq. I was at my mother's house yesterday and was helping her wash dishes. I pulled off my engagement ring and put it in my purse. Somehow I have misplaced the ring. I have looked EVERYWHERE! I have the UPC for the ring and could order a new one. It won't have the same emotional attachment for me though. Should I tell him I lost it or simply replace it and move on. I don't want to hurt him, esspecially since he is at war. It was not intentional and I keep PRAYING that I will find it. I love him dearly and do not want to hurt him. What do I do? [SEP] best_answer: Oh, Honey, how awful! I hope the original ring turns up but until then, here's what I would do...replace the ring and tell him AFTER he gets home...no reason to have him upset while he's deployed, but when he gets back you two can do something special, maybe recreate the proposal, with the new ring... I hope that your "real" ring turns up...it probably will, the day the jeweler is done resizing the new one....most of all,I hope his homecoming is swift and safe	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is it alright for a person to have a relationship with a married man who has no relationship with his wife.  T [SEP] question_content: husband and wife are not "In Love"\nHe is in completley in love with someone else [SEP] best_answer: The guy is just feeding you a line. Most of the time there is no problem the guy is just trying to see if he would still be wanted. Or is nearing an age where he thinks he is old. Or the wife is going through a difficult pregnancy or he is just an a**.\nIf he is married he has nothing to offer just spare moments every now and then. He is just going to use you. You are wasting your time with that loser find a guy who will not have to sneak around with you, who will be proud to show you off who will respect you enough to introduce you to his relatives. Run as fast as you can from that loser let someone else become a fool. If he does not love her let them divorce then maybe think about it, just be assured that he will also fall out of love with you while he is married and feed the same story to another unsuspecting female. You will never be able to trust him, because once a cheater always a cheater.	Family & Relationships

question_title: My best friends sister has just died............? [SEP] question_content: I don't know what to say. I have never experienced this myself so i have no idea what she is going through.\nAny one with any ideas on what to do or say is much appreciated.  So far all iv'e done is offer to do her washing.................. [SEP] best_answer: If she has kids, offer to watch them so that she can visit her sister's grave.\n\nPlant a tree on her grave that will bloom flowers.  It will be nice for your friend to have a shady place to sit when she visits her sister and to see something strong and beautiful, which may reflect how she remembers her sister being.  Not only that, but it will make her sister's grave distinct and unique in the cemetery - she'll always be able to find her if she knows where the tree with the pink flowers is.\n\nTalk to her about her sister comfortably, let her share, and share what you remember about her.\n\nOffer to go with her to the cemetery and bring something to leave at the gravesite that you know her sister would like (favorite kind of flowers, windchimes, pictures, etc).\n\nIf you have any pictures or home videos that include her sister in them, make copies and give them to her.\n\nIf you have access to a lot of pictures of her and her sister, make a nice arrangement of them and frame them for her.\n\nThis might sound strange, but I know it's been done - Go with her to her sister's favorite place (park, lake, playground) and carve her name on a tree or into a stone if you can.  It's a way of leaving a physical mark that this person lived and was in that place.  It will be something that she can go back to and see and remember.  It sounds like an odd tribute, but it really can be meaningful.\n\nOffer to go with her to the funeral, wake, burial, family reception, etc.  Do not assume that this is for family only, and do not make her ask you.  Just ask if you can be there for her at these things.  She needs you more than you know.	Family & Relationships

question_title: If you were me, How would you respond to my Girlfriend's e-mail? Please help - thankyou!!? [SEP] question_content: Sexy Bill,\n \nWhat a wonderful Wednesday it was, I just wanted to write you and thank you again since I was unable to write much yesterday morning due to the workload at hand. It was positively wondrous to be close to you, and to make love, which is out of this world. \n \nI have to tell you, I am so impressed with your spirit in willingness to honor my request for more space that I feel closer to you than ever. You displayed an unprecedented level of understanding and wisdom, I am beside myself with admiration and respect for you. You never fail to show me the light when I have doubts. I only hope that I treat you as well as you deserve to be treated, because you are worthy of only the best and nothing less. \n \nLooking at the whole, the only thing that I've had trouble with is how much you give, which is almost to an extreme, since you have such a generous heart. I can't help but to feel bad because I'm not in a position to give as much in return. At the same time I understand that is how you demonstrate your feelings, and I respect that. \n \nI want to apologize that, I realize I've pretty much made it all about sex. That is shallow of me. I suppose I tried to justify it in my own mind by thinking that, as a man, maybe that is all you would care about too. But I am really a jerk for thinking alongs those lines-- you are a human being with feelings, not just a hot body and handsome face. \n \nThe more I find you reaching out to me with personal things such as sharing pictures with me, and showing/giving me things from your childhood, sends a message. Today I was puzzling over this outpouring, not knowing really what to do. My initial reaction unfortunately is to try to avoid getting too personal. But I started to think about how what a person shares is also what a person needs-- and maybe that I was treating you like an object. Like a sweet-hearted protest, you are showing me that you are more than just a toy. Like that toy doll in my dream that suddenly spoke, I've suddenly come to realize what's going on. I can see that you really want and need a special connection, and it's sad that I tend to do the exact opposite and vigilantly avoid everything that is romantic, sentimental, and personal. I don't know how to change this, but I think by ignoring your attempts to make a connection I am only making matters worse.\n \nAt least by acknowledging your needs I hope that you can see the level that I care about you. I am making my own attempt to figure out how to treat you right. I just wanted you to know that.\n \nHave a joyful and happy Friday, looking forward to talking to you sometime this weekend.\n \nHayley [SEP] best_answer: Why do you ask the same question over and over and over???\nthe e-mail sounds fake..

Ex-girlfriend broke up and has a another guy within a short period of time. Does not want any form of contact in the future... What does this mean? What is the best way? Should contact be made again in the future like a month of 2 from now? [SEP] best_answer: If you just recetly broke up, then just leave her alone for a while.  Let her get on with her life while you get on with yours.  You could send her a Christmas card but; don't write anything like, "I miss you", just a simple holiday wish is plenty.  If your reasons for wanting to keep in touch with her is to stalk her or possible hopes of getting back together in the future, let her alone.  Chalk it up to one lost and move on.

Think how you feel about him, do you love him as a partner or just a friend. Once you have made your mind up tell him how you feel. If you only love him as a friend tell him and stop sleeping with him as you will never meet someone and so would he not.	Family & Relationships

Every time he looks at a magazine with girls in it he asks, "Would you do her?"

Some people can make an open lifestyle work for their relationship. However, both people have to be brought into it strongly and both people have to be secure in their love, trust and sexuality.

question_title: help i dont know what to do? [SEP] question_content: ok theres this guy i like and i dont no if he likes me and were good friends and i think i want to tell him i like him but i dont want it to reck are friendship [SEP] best_answer: It depends partly on how old you are.  Until a guy is around 13 or 14, he does not know how to deal with those special feelings toward a girl.  So for a 13 year old guy friend, you're kind of out of luck.  Just keeping being a supportive friend.\n\nFor a guy 14 or over, you can give it a try.  First start by talking about dancing and see if the thought of dancing with a girl appeals to him.  Then hold his hand when you're walking together for a few seconds and see how he reacts.  If he is still smiling, then ask him if he wants a hug or something.  Then if he  has not turned to run yet, you can start off the conversation by saying you want to be friends most of all.  But there is something you have to clarify, and you are asking because you want to protect your friendship.   When people get to be a certain age, they start to think about the opposite sex in a "different way", and you are starting to be in that situation.  Then you ask if your friend would be offended if you told him how you feel about him.\n\nIf he is not ready, he would change the subject or look really scared.  Then  you'll know.  He won't be offended because you've already prepped him and warned him not to be offended.\n\nOpenness is very important if you are friends already and want to move on to something else.  When you grow up, you'd want to communicate with your boyfriend of husband in the same, gradual way.	Family & Relationships

question_title: How can you know if a guy has even any interest in you and how do you make them express it? [SEP] question_content: I mean like, how can you get his attention, how do you know if he likes you and  well, anything else I should know. [SEP] best_answer: Just like with girls, there's no one type of guy.  Some are more self-confident and some are shyer.  Some guys think that EVERY girl wants him, and some wouldn't believe that a girl is interested in him unless she came up and told him to his face, and even THEN he still may not believe it. \nTo get his attention, you might try something as simple as starting a conversation with him and see where that goes.  Find something the two of you have in common that you can use as an excuse to spend time with him.  Don't be overly aggressive, pushy, or trampy; I know that works on TV, but not in the real world.  Plus, do you really want a guy who thinks you're overly-aggressive, pushy, or trampy?\n\nThere's a book by Shaunti and Jeff Feldham called "For Men Only" where her and her husband did research on what women want and think, and their (women's) perspective on things that men THINK they know, but really don't.  Believe it or not, men and women really do think differently.  It was a real eye-opener for me.  They have another book called "For Women Only" that's the same thing, but for women.\n\nGood luck!

question_title: I dont know.....???? [SEP] question_content: Okay, so my bf will be moving back in soon and I really dont feel like dealing with his mother.  Before my bf moved out, me and his mom would always be around each other.  I mean, we went to the laundrymat every weekend and i only went to wash my clothes right???  \n\nBut all she does is rant and rave about how her son is this and that, negative ways those.  She never has one good thing to say about anyone becuz she is sad and lonely.  Well, i mean she is annoying and puts me in a bad mood.  When he moves back in i really dont want this to erupt again.  \n\nThe thing is, my bf told me that he wants me to stop keeping everything built up inside and let him know what i am thinking all the time.  I do that and tell him how i feel about his mother and his family and he gets all upset.  Should i just keep my feelings built up like before, or just tell him regardless how he feels about it?\n\nLet me know ppl, i really am confused on what to do... [SEP] best_answer: I would not be frank about this to him . I would just let him know that you want to see him for himself and not let his mother influence your thoughts. Follow this up with what you do feel about him and how much you care for him. This will keep his cool down. Just let him know that your not interested in hanging with his mother. You in the relationship for you and him now his mother or anyone else for that matter. Just let him know you wanna love him for what he shows you.	Family & Relationships

Just talk once in a while, maybe send a card once in a while...nothing should ever really come up that breaks you up...it can last forever without too much work.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I need help to open my feelings for my girlfriend in order to get to the next level? [SEP] question_content: I have been divorced, her as well. When our marriges ended we both told ourselfs "never again". My divorce was 6 or 7 years ago hers was 2. We have both know each other since high school but never dated. I recently returned from a 3 week vacation to Florida and that is when I realised how I truely feel about her. However I can't seem to get or find the right words to truely tell her how diferant she is from the rest. I have never had a problem in telling someone what I knew they needed to hear, until now. I believe the reason was simple the feeling were not real they were tools I used to get my way or to stop the person from getting to me. Now that I need to say the right words and take the chance again I cannot find them. Please if you know where I may find the insperation to get out my feelings for her please point me in the direction. [SEP] best_answer: Here's the key you are looking for. Speak from the heart, it's never wrong. She will feel every word.\nTell her all you could think of when on vacation was her. Nothing on the beach even interested you, all you wished was with you was her.\n\nHere is a book I found and read, it will help make your point clear and easy. have fun.\n\nGood Luck.

question_title: what should i do i told m cousin to never call me again because she cursed me out yesterday? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Wait a couple of days and let the boiling water cool. If you and your cousin are close, then she may undoubtedly call you first to apologize. If she does not, then I would call her perhaps on Monday, and apologize for your part, then stress to her, in a mature manner, that she hurt you. Now, I say this all the time to young girls, when we hurt someone, we must never say, "I'm sorry you felt this way." By saying it that way, you place the blame on the other person, and pretend that they have the problem and not you. Therefore, if you wish to apologize for your part, please say, "I'm sorry cousin ____ that I hurt you. I'm truly sorry. However, you hurt my feelings when you __________." She's your cousin, you love her, and you two are home girls. Don't forget that.	Family & Relationships

question_title: How do you know when your in love? [SEP] question_content: Is it when you feel you can,t life with out the person. or can not stand being with out the person? [SEP] best_answer: Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.\nSome love lasts a lifetime. True love lasts forever.\nThose whom true love has held, it will go on holding.\nFor true love is inexhaustible; the more you give, the more you have. And if you go to draw at the true fountainhead, the more water you draw, the more abundant is its flow. \nWe don't believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack. \n True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked. \n The energy of Love is the force that binds the world. This is the energy we all exist on. This energy runs through you and you act like a filter for it. When you experience an absence of love or love is lacking in a situation, your filter is unclear. True love is simply experiencing this energy without the distortions of a muddy filter. True love is the acceptance of others without judgment and of course to do this you need to love and accept yourself first.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What happens to a debt when it has been outstanding for several years & not been paid back to the creditor? [SEP] question_content: I started of really great when I first receive my credit card and lately I've had some struggle with family members who stole and have her friend use it as well. The credit card I have is usually from shopping stores. I still owe money till this day.  This has been an ongoing process that I was paying for about 6-8 months for 8 credit cards. Now, 4 years later, some of those charges has been disputed and of course sent a a collection agency. And most of it has been charged off. I want to know how long does it really takes for your credit to clear up if payments haven't been made to the creditors? Will I ever possibly gain access to ever have a credit card in my life? Help please! [SEP] best_answer: I don't know what planet shaybjones lives on, but that's not how it works around here.  \n\nTo answer your question, there are two time frames you need to be aware of.  For your credit report, the bad reports will stay on your credit history for 7 years, starting from the say they went delinquent.\n\nThe "statute of limitations" on your debt depends on the state you live in (look at the links below).  Once that day runs out, the creditor can no longer sue you, and you have no legal obligation to pay.\n\nAgain, read the links below.  They go into the details of both of these time frames.\n\nYou can start cleaning up your credit by following procedures in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Protest the listings, and demand that the creditor validates the debt.  Sometimes the listing can be removed through this process (not always).\n\nStart building your credit by getting secured credit cards, or other types of credit cards (department stores).  By making your payments, you will slowly develope your score back up.	Business & Finance

question_title: How do I change my identity so I can run from the law? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you can establish a mailing address under a false name, and if you can get something as simple as a fake drivers license that matches your false name, you can open a bank account in that name. That would be the first step in creating a new identity. If you could also get a fake birth certificate, you could get a real social security number under that false name, or better yet, if you could steal someone's identity, you would be gold - you are what your ID says you are, the only real link to your old life is your fingerprints, and you don't get fingerprinted for jobs, unless you work in a few select industries such as banking.

question_title: Where to find help with grant proposals? [SEP] question_content: i am a single mother trying to start a career in realestat im looking for assistance with government grants do you have any info on grant proposals and how to obtain state funded grants [SEP] best_answer: You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nThe government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.\n\nFor one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.\n\nThere is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.	Business & Finance

question_title: Do you agree that single workers are more vulnerable to deceit in the workplace than married workers? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, in fact I think it may be the opposite.  I'm single and I think that because I've had deceitful things happen to me by my former girlfriend, I'm more apt to see deceit before it happens.  If someone is happily married, they may be lucky enough to not have someone they love lie to them. Therefore, when someone is trying to deceive them, they may not even suspect it.\n\n  I guess that being single and or married has nothing to do with it. I think that if you've been in a relationship with someone who lies, you are more aware that that kind of thing goes on a lot more than most people think.  Married people may have had that happen in a previous relationship.  And Single people may be lucky enough not to have had that happen.\n\n  I think that people who have been hurt are more likely to see deceit for what it is.	Business & Finance

question_title: Do I have to pay taxes on a qdro that I received after my divorce and if so how much? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Investments (that would be addressed with a QDRO) can be defined as pre or post tax investment. \nPre means that tax was deferred on both the basis ( the initial contribution) and the income. A post tax investment means that the basis was already taxed, so tax is only due on the income. Tradition IRA's and 40lK's ( or similar plans) can have both. \nRoth IRA's are post tax investment where the income accrues free of add'l tax.\n\nIn each case, beyond any tax,there are penalties for premature withdrawl. If the funds from the QDRO are transferred into an equivalent IRA or qualified plan, then ther is no penalty and you pay any tax  onlyat the time when you  actually take a distribution. \n\nIf you take a distribution now and do not rollover, you will be required to pay applicable penalties beyond the tax.

question_title: what are the differences of RN and a LPN in terms of salary,working load? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is really dependent on where the nurse is working. I have worked in the hospital setting as an LPN where I did the same job as the RN with the exception of giving IV medications. I had the exact same number of patients that my RN counterpart had. \nI have now worked in long-term care as both an LPN and an RN. The work is nearly identical if you work in the capacity of charge nurse. An RN can serve as the Director of Nursing, but an LPN cannot. We employ both LPN's and RN's as supervisors. \nWork load is basically the same. Some jobs require more paperwork, but that is not different because of the job description. Salaries are different depending on where you live and the type of facility you work in. Larger cities often pay more than small towns. There are web sites out there which can give you ballpark salaries for both job descriptions.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately, as I keep hearing from other immigrants to Canada,  your professional accreditation from Iran or almost any other country will probably not be accepted in getting a job in the medical profession here. I recently heard of a Pediatrician from Moscow who was told she did not qualify to become a nurse without going back to school and starting her medical training over again from scratch.\n\nAs a Russian nuclear physicist (now a Canadian electrician) said to me last week, Canada doesn't want smart professionals, they want smart labourers.\n\nI wish you the best of luck...

question_title: How do I sell the house I'm in and use the money to buy another house? [SEP] question_content: The only money I will have is the money I get from selling my present house. [SEP] best_answer: It sounds like you are in the IDEAL situation for what is called a "contingency" agreement. Put your house on the market and start looking for a new house. If you have no income and the only money you have is from the sale of your current house then you can sign a purchase contract with another seller that says you will close on the purchase of their home contingent on the sale of your current property, which, in regular words, means you can buy their house as soon as yours is sold!!!\n\nThere is also the option of a bridge loan. These are secured by the equity of your current house and gets paid in full once your house is sold. These work well but you have to pay interest on them just as you would a regular mortgage. I would speak with a mortgage broker after you get in touch with a real estate agent!!!!	Business & Finance
question_title: Please i want some tips om running a home ironing Business? [SEP] question_content: How to go about it if anyone of you have done so. Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: Hello:\nIf you are sure that this would be a viable businesses in your area. I would create fliers and business cards (links below for lost cost options) and target families that have 2 working parents.  Give them a cost analysis of using your services to complete ironing for them as opposed to taking it all to the dry cleaner or hiring a housekeeper.  Also the elderly may be a target market, you could also possibly approach your local coin-op laundry's, ask them if they offer this service and if not ask them if perhaps they can include your card or flyer with their customers bill.  My local coin ops have a pay per pound service to have my laundry done for me, but the only one that will iron is the one that is attached to a dry cleaner (very expensive).\n\nYou may want to add other services as well (if you cant do them, maybe you can co-op with other people in your area) like sewing, alterations, laundry, errands etc.\n\nCheck out the other links, one is a forum of small business owners, they have a lnk on the left to ask questions and you can look through or post.  The other is Inc magazine, many many great articles on business. Click on "small business" "Start ups" or typr in your business and see if any articles come up.\n\nGood luck	Business & Finance

question_title: How do I remove derogatory accounts off my credit score after they have been settled? [SEP] question_content: I have 3 derogatory accounts on my credit score. I have settled them. They were charge offs and I settled them through a collection agency. Is there any way to remove these accounts becasue I think they are absolutely killing my credit score. Also, they have not been reported as being settled yet. I just settled them a month a go. Does anyone know how long it usually takes for the collection agency to report these settlements? Please help. [SEP] best_answer: You have just stumbled into the trap that I have tried warning people about for months now!\n\nThere are only two ways to get a negative item removed from your credit history.\n\n1) The creditor must remove it\n2) The creditor fails to respond to a credit bureau investigation request.\n\nOnce you have paid the creditor, you are going to find it extremely difficult to get them to cooperate in fixing your credit.  \n\nThat is why I warn people who are going to pay off old debts...make the creditor agree IN WRITING to delete the entry once the bill has been paid off.  Don't pay them a dime unless they agree to do it.\n\nNow you are broke, and you still have bad credit.  Is that fair?\n\nAll you can do now is start the dispute process.  Note that even though you paid off this debt, the creditor is only REQUIRED to show that the debt has been paid off, but it will still show reports of late payments, charge offs and collections.  It will still be a negative report. \n\nBut it at least should show the bill is paid.  Failure of the credit to update your credit history is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  If they don't update the listing, you can sue them for $1000 in small claims court.\n\nSend a dispute letter to both the credit bureau and the creditor.  But note that it sometimes takes a couple of months for these updates to show up on your report, so you need to be patient.	Business & Finance

question_title: Not knowing much about the stockmarket. If I wanted to buy shares in a mining corp. What should I do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think it is not a good idea to buy stock in a single company.  Investing in many companies through mutual funds is less risky.\n\nAsset allocation is the most important investment decision you will make.  How you divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash (money markets, etc.) will determine most of the returns you receive.  So long as you maintain a mix of investments, the particular stocks, bonds, and cash instruments in which you invest are of secondary importance.\n\nIf it will be more than 5 to 10 years until you use the money, you ought to have very high risk investments; 80% stocks and 20% bonds is appropriate.  If you are within 5 years (10 years if you are very risk-averse) of using your money, gradually switch from 80-20 to 60% stocks, 20% bonds, and 20% cash.  So, when you begin to draw down your investments, such as at the beginning of retirement, you should be at the 60-20-20 allocation.  Gradually change to 10-80-10 within 10 years.  One-fourth of your stocks should be international funds, so long as you have enough in stocks to maintain the minimum balance required for an international fund.\n\nTo summarize:\nMore than 5 or 10 years from using money: 80% stocks, 20% bonds.\nAt 5 or 10 years away, gradually change to: 60% stocks, 20% bonds, 20% cash.\nAs you begin drawing down (early retirement): 60-20-20.\nOver ten years of retirement gradually change to: 10-80-10.\n\nI'm a big believer in index funds.  A mix of index funds beats 3/4 of managed mutual funds.  I think it is really advisable to read up on the "couch potato portfolio" and the "coffee house portfolio."  Scott Burns discusses these at his web site (free registration).  You can search Google.  They are simple mixes of index funds that only require rebalancing once a year.\n\nRead "Bogle on Mutual Funds."  It shows why index fund investing is the way to go.	Business & Finance

Unfortunately, some of these people come with little education, etc. We are getting them and their families off the welfare system but I was curious if there is any kind of tax credit given by the government.

question_title: What can I do about a lazy co-worker who keeps messing up at work and keeps leaving things for me to do? [SEP] question_content: I work in a pharmacy so we can't make mistakes like he does!  He is very lazy and leaves some of his work for me to do.  It's not fair.  He's a nice guy and all, but still!  Any suggestions? [SEP] best_answer: DO NOT DO HIS WORK!!!!   \n\nif someone isn't cutting it at work and you get questioned about work not getting done, then inform your supervisor of the problem.  you shouldn't have to do your work and his.  \n\nthis is coming from a managment person of many years.  your supervisor may not be aware of his slacking...all your sup may see is that the work is done. \n\nif he leaves tasks that HAVE to get done by end of day, but are his responsibility, then document this and take the documentation to your supervisor.  explain that you are not complaining, you are simply pointing out that he slacks and you're left with it.  it's unfair and if you are doing more, perhaps you should have better wages, better hours etc.  BUT like i said...don't whine and complain, managers HATE that.  we all feel like we do more than our co workers, however, if you have documentation and show it to your sup in a professional manner and it is clear that he is shirking his responsibilities, then your sup should hear you loud and clear.\n\ngood luck and take care!

question_title: Trying to purge file cabinet. What needs to be retained and for how long? [SEP] question_content: What files need to be retained as permanent record? Do telephone and utility billes need to be kept? Do credit card statements need to be filed? [SEP] best_answer: Keep all tax records until the statute of limitation expires; I think it's seven years. Keep all "terms and conditions" type paperwork for any open accounts: insurance, credit cards, mortgage, etc. Keep receipts for major purchases at least until the warranty expires. Keep any records on which there's any hint of a dispute with anyone.\n\nAs for monthly statements, keep the most current one for each account, and you can toss the rest as soon as you've reconciled them and verified that you were charged correctly. You may want to keep a credit card statement if there's a purchase on it for which you plan to claim reimbursement (from your employer, etc.)\n\nWhatever you get rid of, be sure to shred!

question_title: what is athema? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I believe you mean "Athematic"\n\nIn the Indo-European languages, thematic roots are those roots that have a "theme vowel"; a vowel sound that is always present between the root of the word and the attached inflections. Athematic roots lack a theme vowel, and attach their inflections directly to the root itself.\n\nFor example, consider the endings of the Latin "first declension" singular:\n\nNom. rosa \nGen. rosae \nDat. rosae \nAcc. rosam \nAbl. rosâ \n\nThe vowel a seems to be prominent in these case endings, so nouns like rosa came to be known as "a-stem" nouns, with a being the "theme vowel," and was later analysed as having a stem containing a root plus a suffix. In fact, philologists now believe that the suffix in Indo-European was now *-eh2, with a laryngeal that usually became a in the daughter languages.	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Banks are under-regulated.  One need only look back in the mid 1980's with the failure of S & L's due to deregulation.  Basically, financial services need to be regulated (i.e., deposit insurance, capital requirements, staff reductions at the FHLBB, et. al.) to solve "moral hazard" problems (i.e., taking sub-optimal risks to generate higher returns for investors).  Here's a link to an article below which expounds upon my point above - good luck!	Business & Finance

An example would be, you purchase a burger and you get another burger free, or you get a movie ticket or a toy (especially in kiddie meals), etc.\n\nPrice promotion is when you get a discount on the product you are purchasing.

Buy one and get the second half price, or you get a discount voucher after making a purchase, etc.\n\nPromotion comes into play when you introduce a new product in the market and you want people to try it, when you want to get rid of stock (especially perishable goods, remember most products have a shelf life), when you want to prevent a new competitor from entering the market and establishing themselves.

question_title: When is the best time to refinance my auto loan? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Depending on how long you have had the loan I would say probably never.

Simply put this means that most of your payments in the first year are going to interest not to principle.  Ask the lender what the payoff number is and you should be able to determine how they have treated yor loan.	Business & Finance

question_title: How can I redeem myself after this? [SEP] question_content: I went on an interview today at a major NYC advertising agency.  I had interviewed with them before (different position) and did fairly well, but this interview (with another lady) didn't go too well.  During the interview, I ended up asking her what she's looking for in a candidate.  As usual, she said detail-oriented and organized (which I am... I'm very anal about organization).  Now, this is where I screwed up majorly.  Sometimes I'm so blunt, it's horrible.  I ended up saying something along the lines of "Anyone who comes in here is going to tell you they're detail-oriented and organized, but the only way to really verify it is by speaking to past employers."  I didn't mean to come across as a smart@$$ at all, but after I said it, I'm pretty sure that's how it came across.  Is there any way to save myself?  I can't believe I said that. I would have been perfect for the position too. [SEP] best_answer: She may just appreciate your freshness and honesty.  I sure would if you had been interviewing with me.  Don't count it as a lost cause yet.  \n\nIt's a good idea to follow up all interviews, even second and third ones, with a letter.  In your letter, state you enjoyed meeting with her and hope that your attention to detail comes through in your crisp letter writing.  Provide examples of your attention to detail and organizational skills.  Did you create an ad campaign that ran in a paper or magazine?  Include a photocopy sample of the ad, and the contact details for your supervisor on that project.  Reiterate in your letter how you can help them - phrase your abilities from their point of view (sample:  You need a creative individual.  My background in fine arts provides ....)  Avoid saying how much you want the job; the letter itself says that.  They want to know what you've told us:  That you would be perfect for the position.  Close the letter with "I look forward to speaking with you again" and warm wishes.  \n\nDon't forget to proofread the letter for style, grammar, and spelling.	Business & Finance

question_title: If World War III happened in twenty years, would there be much use of infantry, or just nuclear bombs? [SEP] question_content: Say it was USA versus China.\n\nWhat defences would there be against such bombs.\nEvery bomb  used on both sides would destroy hold cities.\n\nSo how would it be fought? With what weapons? [SEP] best_answer: Nuclear bombs would be used. But it is recognised that there is a ceiling to the number of bombs that would destroy the Earth utterly. Countries involved would limit strikes to below this number as part of the new nuclear war doctrine. China and the US have vast territories so some civilians and military would survive- China has less than 500 warheads, while the US only has a few thousand ready for use.\n\nIf World War III kicks off the theatre will be global and incalculably vast- there would be low level skirmishes all over the place. Hence infantry would be used and see action all over the globe- they have an ability to avoid destruction tanks and planes cannot.\n\nThe world would instantly become a more violent place- so other wars of a conventional kind would erupt, and the US would intervene where strategically helpful.

[SEP] best_answer: I am sorry for people dying during war.  But i am sick of soldiers families (i.e. rose gentles) going on about the illegal war - if you didnt want your son to fight in a war you should have stopped him joining the army.  I feel for innocent people who die during war not people who pick up a gun and go and fight.	Politics & Government

question_title: Rep. Charles Rangel said he would introduce legislation to reinstate the draft? [SEP] question_content: Most voters polled say they want the troops out of Iraq......Wonder how those people that voted for the democrats to accomplish that feel about the draft coming back?????

Underscore serious."\n\n"I don't see how anyone can support the war and not support the draft. I think to do so is hypocritical," Rangel said. [SEP] best_answer: The democraps will do anything to make the war unpopular, what better way than to mention the draft?	Politics & Government
question_title: Whites stole the Africans and brought them to the Western Hemisphere as slaves................................ [SEP] question_content: Human stupidity knows no bounds. One would expect such rubbish from a Negro's mouth. A white guy no less posted this ignorant statement. Africans were the first to own African slaves. Africans caputered other Africans from other tribes and sold them into slavery to white slave dealers. Would someone do me a favor and push this guy out of a jet? [SEP] best_answer: I find it very interesting that someone as ignorant as yourself would even post this statement. By the way what century do you live in anyway or what year do you think it is? The correct pronunciation  is African American. I Also can detect your level of education. Reading is very fundamental! The truth is, The truth hurts and apparently it's hurting you! Read your history Not the ones they give you in school with the one page on slavery. Go to the library or do you even know where that is ? You are very much in titled to your opinion but don't let you hatred for the truth cause you to no want to listen.	Politics & Government

question_title: Does the US military operate its own railroads? [SEP] question_content: I'm sort of an amateur railroad buff, but I don't know much at all about the military. Could someone who knows about both please steer me in the direction about military railroads? I know during the two world wars the military contracted with the civillian railroads to move troops. But what about today? Does the military operate branch railroads to ship things to and from their supply depots (such as Honey Lake in California, Hawthorne in Nevada, Aniston in Alabama, etc)? Does the military actually operate the trains themselves, or do they contract with freight operators like NS, UP, BNSF, and CSX? [SEP] best_answer: Yes the military operates their own railroads. Most of the train crews are civilian employees. I work for a railroad now and I was in the US Air Force for several years around a USAF railroad. The gov't owns track, property, locomotives and rolling stock. They also contract out to several class 1, 2 and 3 railroads to meet the transportation needs. I belive that military railroads are class 3 railroads, basically shortlines. See the link below for pics.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why the practice of One-Man-One-Vote in democracy? [SEP] question_content: Is the equity in our respective rights to vote the same as the respective degrees of our rights to vote? Democracy is already discriminatory in importing the concept of "eligibility". So, why not discriminate in the number of votes to be accorded everyone "eligible" to vote? [SEP] best_answer: I guess I'm wondering what the alternative would be??\n\nThe "one man, one vote" form of democracy we now enjoy, is only about a century old. Before that, the ability to vote, or the number of votes one could cast, depended on ones wealth and, usually, how much one could pay in taxes.\n\nIn 1959, in Baker v. Carr, the Supreme Court said it was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause to make one person's vote count less than another's.	Politics & Government

question_title: what is the best way to take study-notes on a text? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: General answer -- the way that works best for you to remember the key parts.\n\nReally, the "best way" is different based upon individual learning styles and previous knowledge.\n\nSome common techniques -- read it thoroughly. Summary the main points in your own words, in addition to any quotes you think are important. Really seek to understand the content.\n\nWriting it down longhand (as opposed to typing it) helps if you learn kinesthetically. \n\nReading it outloud to yourself, or reading the summaries, helps if you are an auditory learning.\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to keep your notes short enough that you can retain them in memory, without missing essential concepts.

question_title: Is anyone else as appalled and in disbelief as I am about the illegal uprising? [SEP] question_content: I mean, I sit and watch it, read about it, I'm glued to it.  But at the same time, I just cant believe it is happening and that it's being allowed to happen.  \n\nThe fact that they have broken law after law to exist in this country, and then they demand rights of U.S. Citizens.  \n\nI heard one mantra "Next we vote."  They're demanding nothing less than amnesty.  \n\nI feel so angry at these people (especially the organizers of these rallies) and let down by my own government. [SEP] best_answer: I'm with you.  I just can't understand why this is allowed to happen.  I just keep asking, "what part of illegal are they having trouble with"?  And as far as the government is concerned, what can I say?  The whole thing just frosts me.  I almost never vote for an incumbent and after this I may remove the word "almost" from that statement.\n\nI'm sure you understand that if we legalize all of them right now, it will only lead to more illegals entering to take the $.50 an hour jobs these folks will no longer qualify for.  \n\nI give up.  I am so flustered I can't even make sense of my own thoughts.	Politics & Government

question_title: Who do you think will become the next King of England? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Charles is heir to throne and I don't think he'd abdicate.  I think its wrong to say that nobody likes him, so he's made a few mistakes in life, haven't we all!  In my opinion this should make it easier for the public to relate to him and make him the peoples monarch.  I can't blame him if he wants to be George after his coronation, Kings named Charles don't really have a good track record in this country!  I hope that the public do accept Camilla as Queen, she is so supportive to Charles and makes him look happy and relaxed, isn't this what a Queen should do for the King?  It annoys me that people go on about how she's not the prettiest woman alive but as long Charles and Camilla and happy it doesn't really matter and they have my support!	Politics & Government

question_title: Do you like politics?  Do you watch cable news where they always talk about politics? [SEP] question_content: I enjoy politics, I work in it in fact.  I'm interested in whether other people follow the political events whether by watching cable news, reading the newspaper or getting your information online.  Or do you pay more attention to Brangelina's baby? [SEP] best_answer: Politics is everywhere.  It effects all our lives to some degree.  It has become a topic that "should not be talked about in a bar".?  Sadly, the biggest place people feel like talking about it, is now a "No talking Politics/Religion."  Soon there'll be "No talking about Computers in the bar."  \nPeople need to realize before discussing Politics, that there's so much to know, noone has all the answers, all the correct one's anyway.  More important, we need to be able to discuss Politics without letting our emotions get the best of us.  We should be discussing Politics everywhere, with an open mind, and with the goal of learning & educating others.\nStaying awake through C-Span is difficult, even for Senators and Reps, you'll see them nodding off, picking their nose, passing notes, flirting with interns.  If they speak, it's the same monotone emotionless ramble, putting most to sleep or change the channel.  Unless Ted Kennedy has the mic, he can provide hours of entertainment.  Especially after he's returned from lunch, nice and loaded.  He's usually on the wrong side of issues, his outburst at least wake up the room.  I'll never get bored of his "look up from the paper, remove the glasses and point with them!  The crowd is like, "oh shit, lookout, Teddy really means business this time."  He really only does that to stop the room from spinning, HA.  For all his faults, I do love the guy.  \nThe point is, Politics has become soo broad, it's a full time job, just keeping up w/ US politics, nevermind world politics.  And, If you don't know or can't grasp history, current events will really "F" you up.  People forget history, that's a big reason why so many get upset when discussing even the simplist issues.  So instead of being open minded, they close themselves off and refuse to continue the discussion or get into a fight over it.  Ironically, these people rarely consider themselves close minded.  Our competitive nature has turned "discussing Politics" into "Debating Politics", and nobody wants to lose a battle of knowledge.  That's why the uneducated, change subject, fire off hateful comments or repeat the same thing over and over, is a common defence to cover up their insecurities of "Not knowing/having info", but still trying to win the debate, this does nothing but get both parties a warning from the bartender and give Political Bar Discussions a bad name.

[SEP] best_answer: You know I am a democrat and I have to agree that probably nothing will change.  It is so new to say you are a democrat and then do republican things so really nothing will change.  Not until the big election.

[SEP] best_answer: i think u make sense. the world will be a much better place if people were nicer to eachother. \n\nin particular, i think that instead of going to war against other countries, maybe we should be making peace. i mean, even the people who flew planes into the twin towers had a reason for doing it...at the time, american soldiers were in saudi arabia. maybe instead of blowing their homes up, we should be listening to their complaints and helping to solve them\n\nso yeah, i think we should have a "everyone shut up and be nice to eachother day"	Politics & Government
question_title: Interrogation? [SEP] question_content: During the interrogation process should a officer be allowed to lie to the suspect in a effort to elict (get) a response or open another avenue of questioning. [SEP] best_answer: Although this technique can be open to interpretation by a jury, it is perfectly legal.  Is it wrong for a police officer to walk into an interview with a burglary suspect, holding a blank vhs tape, saying, "We have you on tape burglarizing that store."  The crook then confesses.  This is perfectly legal.  Do you think crooks always tell the truth?  It is a game of chess.  Interrogation is an art and you have to adjust the style to whomever you are interrogating.

question_title: Will you get a ticket for always driving your car in reverse? [SEP] question_content: even if you do it safely [SEP] best_answer: You don't say what state you're in.  If your state has laws about driving in reverse, then you're probably going to get a ticket.\n\nIn California, there's no law against driving in reverse per se.  I might try to make an argument that by "always" doing so, you're driving in a reckless manner, and therefore guilting of reckless driving (chances are this would be a bigger ticket than any ticket for driving in reverse).\n\nIf you're driving so slow that you're impeding traffic, you might get a ticket for that.  You want to know if you'll get the ticket even if you're driving safely, and I'd suggest that you won't be able to do so...to be safe means you're probably going to have to be slow, and to be slow probably means that you're going to be impeding traffic.\n\nIf you're driving in reverse, you won't have brake lights at the rear of your vehicle where they belong.  In California, that's a ticket.\n\nBy the same token, you're not going to have headlights where they belong, and at night...that's a ticket.\n\nMirrors also won't be where they belong, and that's a ticket.\n\nWon't be any wipers on the "front" windshield, and that's a ticket.\n\nThe list is nearly endless.\n\nYou'd really have to want to prove some kind of point by doing this, and I disagree that it can be done safely for any length of time.\n\nBest answer: go to the local cop shop and ask them how many tickets they can give you for doing it; not *if* they can.

question_title: What is MacCarthyisim and what impaact did it have? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: McCarthyism took place during a period of intense suspicion in the United States primarily from 1950 to 1954, when the U.S. government was actively countering American Communist Party subversion, its leadership, and others suspected of being Communists or Communist sympathizers. During this period people from all walks of life became the subject of aggressive "witch-hunts," often based on inconclusive or questionable evidence. It grew out of the Second Red Scare that began in the late 1940s and is named after the U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, a Republican of Wisconsin.\n\nThe term originates from March 29, 1950 political cartoon by Washington Post editorial cartoonist Herbert Block. The cartoon depicted four leading Republicans trying to push an elephant (the traditional symbol of the Republican Party) to stand on a teetering stack of ten tar buckets, the topmost of which was labelled "McCarthyism". The reluctant elephant was quoted in the caption as saying "You mean I'm supposed to stand on that?".\n\nWiki has a good write up of this topic and I would suggest that you read the link that I have given below:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism\n\nHope that Helps.

You will hear about the most secret of the new world order groups, the bilderberg group. [SEP] best_answer: George Bush -I take you mean George W Bush-, no. He's just a puppet.  The New World Order? Absolutely! I've been studying these guys for seven years now, tons of books and documentaries (contact me and I'll reccomend some good 'uns!) and these societies do indeed exist. All the skeptics who deny it and chuckle at the conspiracy researchers are just that: IN DENIAL. They've been so brainwashed by CNN and American Idol that they've completely lost touch with reality. Folks: the official story behind 9/11 is a LIE; the invasion of Iraq was for OIL, and the Department of Homeland Security and The Patriot Act really were designed to turn the United States into a police state.\nSkeptics, go ahead and call me paranoid and anything else you like. Sticks and stones. Besides, myself and people like me are gonna have the last laugh in the end, because when the fit hits the shan, all the skeptics are gonna be saying, "Damn...we shoulda listened to those conspiracy theory kooks...they were right after all!"\n\nDon't forget:\n"Even paranoids have enemies."\n                                       -Henry Kissinger (one of the granddaddies of the New World Order)	Politics & Government

Was it Osama and his following?  Was it Saddam Hussein and his following?  If it wasn't Saddam (Iraq), then why are we at war with them?  What are our soldiers fighting so hard and losing their lives for in Iraq?  Is it oil?  Is it money?  What kind of relationship does the Bush family have with the BinLaden family?  Why didn't we go full force into Afganistan to hunt down Osama? I'd like to hear everyones thoughts and opinions on all these issuses.

question_title: how can i find out if a murderer has been released without having to pay?? [SEP] question_content: murderer convicted in 1991 to life minimum being 18 years could he be out if so how do i find this out without it costing me? [SEP] best_answer: He can't be out until the 18 year tariff is up. When someone is sentenced to life they are set a "tariff", in this case 18 years, and they can not apply for parole until then and there is no guarantee that it will be granted.  He will be eligible for parole in 2009. \nThe only way to find out if he has been released in to contact the Victim Liaison Unit which is run by the Probation Service. You can not get this information any other way as it will go against the Data Protection Act. If you are not a victim of this murder (e.g. family or friends or witness) you will be unable to get this information. \nSorry if this doesn't help but with all this Human Rights stuff the information is incredibly difficult to get.

Since the US has invaded not one but two countries bordering Iran, practically surrounding it? Since the US sponsors shadowy groups that attempt to undermine its government? Since the US interfered in Iranian internal affairs for decades, sponsored coups and supported tyrannical b@stards like the Shah? Since the US encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade Iran in a a war that cost them 1.5 million casualties?

I know this is a little far fecthed but some of the plots are very close to whats realy going on???  Fiction often seems more real than the "official truth" [SEP] best_answer: When parody shows like Colbert Report and the Daily Show are more reliable news sources than CNN, we have some REAL problems with society.\n\nLately though, I didn't notice it until my "politically un-inclined" wife pointed this out, most of the movies in the box office contain very subtle hints as to the current state or future state of our society.\n\nMinority Report - Deals with "thought crime"\nLord of War - Hints at government involvement in screwing with 3rd world countries\nSyriana - Very direct\nInside Man - based on the real story of Bush family historical involvement in laundering money for Nazi industrialists along with other prominent bankers\nMatrix series - very direct message also\nStar Wars Ep 1 to 3 - Shows the rise of a fascist state from a republic\nV for Vendetta - Perfect example of an Orwellian fascist state\nEnemy of the State\nThe Island\n\nI might have missed many, but almost all contain VERY subtle political messages pointing out exactly what is really going on vs. the propoganda you see on Fox or CNN.  Whether the messages in these movies can effect the collective conscience of Americans is another story, but it at least counters the brainwashing somewhat.	Politics & Government

But I think majority of the people stereotype.  Just because a person made a comment that Mexicans eat beans does not make them a racist (although perceived by many as being one).  That is stereotyping though.  I believe that we all stereotype based on our experiences and observation towards other race.

How is this fair to other countries? Please don't say that other people will try to live in America if it was possible because right now Americans are living in other countries, too(especially Asian countries as teachers).\n\n*I'm American and carry an American passport. [SEP] best_answer: Countries like Thailand are not worried  that American citizens will go to Thailand and STAY there illegally. They are pretty sure that they will get out in 2 weeks. So the government of Thailand decides to save money on a useless task of checking Americans and issuing them visas.\n\nNow, Americans cannot say the same about the citizens of Thailand, so they have  a strict visas system for them.\n\nSo this is quite fair if you think about it.\n\nBesides a lot of countries DO require Americans to get visas.\nIt all depends on the local policy of a country.

question_title: OK.. Military Veterans. . ..  .. What are we gonna do about John Kerry and the Democratic Party? [SEP] question_content: I served our country(1981-1987). I remember being stabbed. I remember the first time I got shot at. Nobody ever forgets that. And I never regretted a moment of it. I did it for EVERYONE. All Americans. \n\nIsn't it about time. ONCE AND FOR ALL. To send a BIG message on election day and vote Republican. John Kerry's statement was an insult to every one of us. And he easily could have just apologized, and claimed he was tired or mis-spoke. HE DID NOT.\nAre you pissed at the Democratic party? Are you going to SHOW IT and VOTE REPUBLICAN? [SEP] best_answer: Kerry`s statements just prove the how the Democrats are uninformed and have true contempt for the Military.\n\n1.The Military is better educated than the general population. \n2.The Military is all volunteer. \n3. One can not join without a minimum of a high school degree.\n4. 73.3 percent of the Enlisted Military have some college, 16.2 percent have an associate’s degree or equivalent semester hours, and 4.7 have a bachelor’s degree. 85 percent of officers have advanced degrees – 70.7 percent have master’s degrees, 12.1 percent have professional degrees and 2.5 percent have doctorate degrees.\n5. Dropouts can not get in the Military. They have to go to Mc Donalds.\n6. Bush out performed with better grades Kerry in the same school and Bush went further.\n7. There is no draft that takes underachieving kids out of school and sends them to war, that was the Vietnam war.\n8. Kerry was talking to students about education.\n\nSo Kerry`s joke doesn`t fit and he was stating what he believed about a Military he has contempt for. The "Joke" was damage control for the gullible.

question_title: Could someone  that speaks Spanish and if you are illegal even better, explain? [SEP] question_content: to me what does the word illegal mean in your country? Does it mean something different than what it means in English? Can you really protest in your country about laws that use the term "illegal" in them. Just curious. [SEP] best_answer: Your question just made a thought pop into my head. Frankly, I haven't given the issue much thought, because I'm just too darn tired! But, to answer your question, the word, translated, means the same, but it occurred to me that the way they view laws may be entirely different.\nThe entire legal system in Mexico, from policemen, right up to judges, is corrupt. You can buy your way out of anything with a little bit of cash. American dollars, preferred.\nSo, the concept of illegal probably doesn't hold much weight with them.\nDo they then come into this country with that attitude and viewpoint of the law? That's the only thing they've ever known. If so, then one can see why legal, illegal, doesn't matter to them, since they have no respect for law.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why ndidnt the treaty of Versailles pass the Senate? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually, the Treaty of Versailles was voted by the Senate, and it was defeated. Instead, the United States negotiated and signed a separate treaty with Germany which led to American soldiers on temporary occupation duty in western Germany for about 4 years.\n\nThere were two main problems for the Senate, one personal and one dealing with policy. The personal problem was between President Wilson on one side and Senator Lodge (the Republican leader) on the other. The two had come to an agreement that they would both honor a political truce during the war, where neither side would use the war for electoral purposes, but President Wilson broke the agreement when in the 1918 midterms he campaigned saying that only Democrats would be able to create a lasting world peace. For obvious reasons, Senator Lodge felt betrayed by this, and when the voters actually turned out against President Wilson and voted in a Republican majority in the Senate, the Repbulicans were not in the mood to give a "do-over." To make matters worse, when President Wilson travelled to Europe for the 1919 Peace Conference, he invited only Democrats to come with him, Republican ideas were completely snubbed. When the Treaty was finally signed and brought back to the United States, even though Lodge agreed with many aspects of the final document, the Republicans felt they could not trust President Wilson and made certain that the treaty would be attacked everywhere it was debated across the nation.\n\nThe procedural problem was the incorporation of the League of Nations as a vague but permanent part of the treaty and thus a permanent responsibility of the United States. The treaty was very vague and just said that a League would be set up at a future date. Many people were very hesitant to get the United States involved in a world organization where American sovereignty was subordinated to some outside aurthority. During the war, even President Wilson had been very hesitant about this sort of thing, and the United States never actually signed the Entente Cordiale or entered into any permanent agreement with the Western Allies.\n\nIn the end, despite a very hard-fought debate which saw President Wilson travel the entire country supporting the Treaty (to be followed by Republican Senators to speak against it after the President left) and eventually led to President Wilson being debilitated by a stroke, the treaty went down to defeat in the US Senate.\n\nIt is likely that, especially with President Harding's Normalcy and President Coolidge's ideas of governmental non-intervention outside of Latin America, the United States would not have had a very good experience with the League if the treaty had been approved. The League in the end was built around the colonial asperations of Britain and France and as such had a very hard time reaching meaningful agreements to stop aggression throughout the world.

question_title: How about liberal? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Liberalism is an ideology, philosophy, and political tradition that holds liberty as the primary political value.[1] Broadly speaking, liberalism seeks a society characterized by freedom of thought for individuals, limitations on power, especially of government and religion, the rule of law, the free exchange of ideas, a market economy that supports relatively free private enterprise, and a transparent system of government in which the rights of minorities are guaranteed. In modern society, liberals favour a liberal democracy with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed[2]. Liberalism rejected many foundational assumptions which dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, and established religion. Fundamental human rights that all liberals support include the right to life, liberty, and property. In many countries, "modern" liberalism differs from classical liberalism by asserting that government provision of some minimal level of material well-being takes priority over freedom from taxation. Liberalism has its roots in the Western Enlightenment, but the term now encompasses a diversity of political thought, with adherents spanning a large part of the political spectrum, from left to right. In the context of economics, the term "liberalism" refers to economic liberalism, which is associated with the political ideology of liberalism itself.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: a well-thought out idea, a well-defended position, an articulate answer, or one that makes me think of something i haven't thought of before all warrant a 'thumbs-up' in my book.  i am impressed by those who make the effort (NOT the same thing as "take the time") to put a coherent or creative thought to the keyboard, and give it a voice to share it with all of us.\n\ni'll almost never give a thumbs-down, but a reason i WOULD is because an answerer insults another person's questions or answers.  i feel that there's no need for that stuff here.  it's interesting to me to see how many questions (and people) have found a way to attract so many thumbs!

question_title: Why was Israel still invading Gaza after Hamas offered recognition? [SEP] question_content: I realize they wanted their soldier back.   But Hamas - of all organizations - offers recognition and still the tanks were rolling?  It defies all logic.\n\nThis just proves to me even more that individual counrties censor the full story of politics from their respective masses. [SEP] best_answer: Nothing new, the "internaional community"  can ignore the weeks of shelling by the Israeli army of Gaza, the firing of hundreds of missiles into the crowded Strip that have destroyed Palestinian lives and property, while spreading terror among the civilian population and deepening the psychological trauma suffered by a generation of children. They can ignore the deaths of more than 30 civilians, and dozens of horrific injuries, in the past few weeks at the hands of the Israeli military, including three children hit in a botched air strike last week, and a heavily pregnant woman and her doctor brother killed a day later as a missile slammed into the room where they were eating dinner.\nThey can ignore the blockade of Gaza's "borders" by the Israeli army for months on end, which has prevented Palestinians in the Strip from trading goods at crossing points with Israel and from receiving vital supplies of food and medicines. As a captive population besieged by Israeli soldiers, Gazans are facing a humanitarian catastrophe sanctioned by Israeli government policy and implemented by the Israeli army. They can ignore Israel's bullying of the international community to connive in the starving of the Hamas-led government of funds and diplomatic room for manoeuvre, thereby preventing the elected Palestinian leadership from running Gaza. So desperate is the situation there that Hamas officials are being forced to smuggle in millions of dollars of cash stuffed in suitcases to pay salaries. And finally They can ignore the violation of Palestinian territory by Israeli commandos who infiltrated Gaza a day before the Palestinian attack to kidnap two Palestinians Israel claims are terrorists. They have been "disappeared", doubtless to be be held in administrative detention, where they can denied access to lawyers, the courts and, of course, justice. This attack in Israel, they tell us, is the most serious to date, with the implication that it is therefore illegitimate and part of the same "escalation". Even ignoring the fact that this attack was against Israeli soldiers besieging, imprisoning and shelling the Palestinians of Gaza, does the "international community" not to pause to consider the double standard it is applying? Was the Israeli army's incursion into Gaza a day earlier to capture two alleged Palestinian militants not an equal escalation? Was it not an equal violation of Palestinian sovereignty? Of course not. The "international community" knows, as do the rest of us, that the army never really left Gaza and the occupation never really ended. But you won't hear that from any of its reporters.

question_title: Can someone explain to me the "freedom of speech"? [SEP] question_content: I'm really confused.. why are the cartoons against the Muslims' prophit are considered "freedom of speech", while David Irving's denial of the Holocaust is not, although he pleaded "guilty"! (check:  http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060220/wl_nm/austria_irving_dc_4 ) I'm not saying he's right or wrong, I'm just asking why is that not taken as freedom of speech as well? [SEP] best_answer: The government may make no law respecting your freedom of speech. (1st Amendment).  No state may make any law depriving you of your freedom of speech (14th Amendment).  The freedom of speech applies to personal speech, political speech and even to a lesser extent, commercial speech.  In general, no prior restraint may be made against your freedom of speech (Times v. Sullivan).  However, the freedom of speech is not absolute.  You may not exercise freedom of speech when to do so would subject the public to danger (for example, you may not shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater if there is no fire).  This is a synopsis of ideas from the Constitution and many Supreme Court cases.\n\nYour exercise of freedom of speech may not interfere with other constitutionally guaranteed rights. Many cases have addresssed the use of religious symbols in public places as well as actions of political speech such as burning of the American flag. These cases are not always models of consistency.\n\nSuffice it to say that freedom of speech is well protected but not absolute.\n\n\nIn the context of these cartoons and comments, at least in the USA, you can publish these ideas, even if they are offensive to others.  You are really not addressing the "freedom of speech" as such as much as you are addressing editorial judgment of the press.  While the press is free to say what it wants, it ought to consider the sensibilities of others, especially those who might legitimately take offense to the writings or utterances.

question_title: Why is it that people seem to know more about celebrities then their country's government? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Good question.  Probably because celebrities are "glamorous" and more visible than the government.  Following them also requires much less thought and effort than paying attention to the government. If people pay attention to the government, they usually start to get uncomfortable with what they see, so they stay away or they get involved and forget the celebrities.  I hope more people forget the celebrities, who are just human beings like all of us, and start getting involved in the world around them!	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: Come up with a monumental goal for the country to rally around...in the same vein as President Kennedy's challenge to put American's on the moon.  And then put lots of money and policy change behind meeting that goal.\n\nSuggestions might be to reduce our country's oil usage by 30%  or more by 2012.  Another suggestion might be to land a manned ship on Mars by 2020.  Or find a cure for cancer.  \n\nIf we focus all of our resources and efforts on anyone of these goals, we could make significant achievements.  When politicians and political activists start becoming obstructionists we lose that ability and become a stagnant, non-competitive nation.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: First, immigrants know that America offers many freedoms not available elsewhere, and they are aware of the fact that it is easy to "slip through the cracks." They can find labor easily because employers want to hire cheap laborers. It works out for both parties. In addition, the crime market is easily accessible to them and they know that heavy profit lies in drug trafficking. Drugs are available and very profitable to them.	Politics & Government
