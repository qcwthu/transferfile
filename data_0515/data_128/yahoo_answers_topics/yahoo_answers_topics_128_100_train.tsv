question_title: what is a conjugated bridge? [SEP] question_content: part of the body [SEP] best_answer: A hfr cell (also called hfr strain) is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid (often F) integrated into its genomic DNA. Hfr is the abbreviation for high frequency recombination, which was first characterized by Luca Cavalli-Sforza. Unlike a normal F+ cell, hfr strains will, upon conjugation with a F- cell, attempt to transfer their entire DNA through the mating bridges (called pili) to the F- cell. This occurs because the F factor has integrated itself via an insertion point in the bacterial chromosome. Due to the F factor's inherent nature to transfer itself over the pilus during bacteria conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it, thus making such cells very useful and interesting in terms of studying gene linkage and recombination.\n\nA structure as fragile as a mating bridge will, however, likely break, and so the transfer is rarely complete. Thus, the F- cell uses only part of the genomic DNA of the Hfr cell for recombination. Though there is some debate on the issue, the pili themselves do not seem to be the structures through which the actual exchange of DNA takes place; rather, some proteins seem to open a channel between the bacteria.\n\nIt should also be noted that the bacterial genome's rate of transfer through the pilus is constant; this allows molecular biologists and geneticists to use Hfr strain of bacteria (often E. Coli) to study genetic linkage and map the chromosome. The procedure commonly used for this is called interrupted mating.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: if an anchor is dropped from a boat into a lake, will the water level of the lake rise or fall? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Say the anchor weighs 15 pounds in air and displaces 2 pounds of water.\nBefore the drop, the boat displaces its weight plus the 15 lb weight in air of the anchor. This is the maximum displacement situation, so the water is at maximum height.\nAfter the drop, if the anchor hits bottom, the boat displaces its weight only and the anchor displaces 2 lb of water, the minimum displacement situation, so the water is at minimum height.\nAfter the drop, if the anchor doesn't reach the bottom, the boat displaces its weight plus the 13 lb weight in water of the anchor. The anchor displaces 2 lb water. The total displacement is the same as the maximum displacement situation, so the water is at maximum height.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Leonid meteor shower....... Anyone in Santa Barbara, CA??? [SEP] question_content: what would be the place to see it from, what time? which way do i look?? i don't want to miss it this year so just wondering if anyone can tell me where to look and stuff... [SEP] best_answer: Anyplace not cloudy and that does not have too many bright lights will do. Just look anywhere in the sky. The meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Look after midnight though, because the radiant won't rise until then. The later at night you look, the better. 4:00 AM would be the best time to look.\n\nThe predictions are not that good this year. A few years ago I saw 50 bright ones per hour. This year they are predicting 10 or 15 per hour, and maybe not bright ones either. Also, the peak time is before the radiant rises in the US, so Europe will see the best show. If the predictions are correct.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: can we trap light after the source of which is turned off so that we can open the trap and see the light in it [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Say you shine a flashlight into a mirror. Then put a mirror behind the flashlight and remove the flashlight. Given that the 2 mirrors are exactly parallel, will the light just bounce back and forth forever? No - the light travels in waves and each time it reflects back, some of the light is not hitting the mirror exactly at 90 degrees and is reflected off on an angle. The light will reflect away and eventually dissipate completely. \nIf you try to trap light in a box, as it bounces off the walls inside, it will dissipate into energy (heat). The temperature of the inside of the box will raise - but just infintestimly so.\nRemember all of this will take place at the speed of light.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes the movement of wind? [SEP] question_content: And what causes it to come to an end? [SEP] best_answer: Wind is the roughly horizontal movement of air (as opposed to an air current) caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It occurs at all scales, from local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting tens of minutes to global winds resulting from solar heating of the Earth. The two major influences on the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect).\n\nGiven a difference in barometric pressure between two air masses, a wind will arise between the two which tends to flow from the area of high pressure to the area of low pressure until the two air masses are at the same pressure, although these flows will be modified by the Coriolis effect in the extratropics.\n\nWinds can be classified either by their scale, the kinds of forces which cause them (according to the atmospheric equations of motion), or the geographic regions in which they exist. There are global winds, such as the wind belts which exist between the atmospheric circulation cells. There are upper-level winds, such as the jet streams. There are synoptic-scale winds that result from pressure differences in surface air masses in the middle latitudes, and there are winds that come about as a consequence of geographic features such as the sea breeze. Mesoscale winds are those which act on a local scale, such as gust fronts. At the smallest scale are the microscale winds which blow on a scale of only tens to hundreds of metres and are essentially unpredictable, such as dust devils and microbursts.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below...

question_title: How does battery-charging without physical contact work? [SEP] question_content: I thought that you need a physical contact between the charger and the battery so the electricity actually arrives inside the battery.\nNow my new electrical toothbrush seems to work differently. It has a battery, the manual confirms. It also has a charger. But all I need to do is to put the toothbrush on the charger.\n\nHow does that work? Both parts are plastic covered. [SEP] best_answer: Its using induction charge principle. Essentially the primary coil side of the transformer is built into the base and the secondary coil is built into the toothbrush. \n\nThe primary winding of the inductive charger transmits charging power to the secondary winding, inside the target device, without making direct electrical or mechanical contact with it. In the target device, power is received with a coil and then rectified by a diode. This DC voltage is used in charging the battery of the device.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is big bang? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In physical cosmology, the Big Bang is the scientific theory that the universe emerged from an enormously dense and hot state about 13.7 billion years ago. The Big Bang theory is based on the observed Hubble's law redshift of distant galaxies that when taken together with the cosmological principle indicate that space is expanding according to the Friedmann-Lemaître model of general relativity. Extrapolated into the past, these observations show that the universe has expanded from a state in which all the matter and energy in the universe was at an immense temperature and density. Physicists do not widely agree on what happened before this, although general relativity predicts a gravitational singularity (for reporting on some of the more notable speculation on this issue, see cosmogony).\n\nThe term Big Bang is used both in a narrow sense to refer to a point in time when the observed expansion of the universe (Hubble's law) began — calculated to be 13.7 billion (1.37 × 1010) years ago (±2%) — and in a more general sense to refer to the prevailing cosmological paradigm explaining the origin and expansion of the universe, as well as the composition of primordial matter through nucleosynthesis as predicted by the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory [1].\n\nOne consequence of the Big Bang is that the conditions of today's universe are different from the conditions in the past or in the future (natural evolution of universe constantly takes place). From this model, George Gamow in 1948 was able to predict, at least qualitatively, the existence of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) [2]. The CMB was discovered in the 1960s and further validated the Big Bang theory over its chief rival, the steady state theory.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What happens to the body when somebody has taken an lethal overdose? [SEP] question_content: Could it be the brain shuts down first or the other organs start to fail continusoly?  If a postmorten came out with the lungs undefected, how come they didnt get affected? [SEP] best_answer: It sounds like you have a particular scenario in mind, so here goes...\n\nPeople who use street drugs develop a tolerance to them, so they need bigger and bigger doses to "get high." Sometimes they increase the dose too much and overdose. Another problem is purity. Average street drugs are only about 50% the actual drug, and 50% filler to increase the dealer's profit margin(although heroin has gotten much more pure recently...). When an addict gets drugs from a different supplier, he might get a different concentration than what he's used to and unintentionally overdose.\n\nCocaine and amphetamines ("meth") are stimulants. An OD on them can cause a heart attack, where the heart stops beating, blood flow to the brain stops, and the person dies. It would not cause any obvious lung damage.\n\nMost other drugs of abuse--opiates (heroin, oxycodone, vicodin, demerol etc.), alcohol, GHB, benzodiazepines (xanax, valium, clonapin) slow down the rate and/or depth of your breathing so you go to sleep and stop breathing. This causes lack of oxygen in the blood, and this causes brain damage leading to death.\n\nNeither of these paths will cause any visible damage to the lungs.  Most of the damage is at the cellular level, so to the naked eye, the organs look normal.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Base triplet on T-RNA recognizing complementary base triplet on M-RNA? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: t-RNA or transfer RNA consists of short RNA coupled to specific amino acids.  mRNA is translated into protein in ribozomes, via pairing with tRNA.  The pairing takes the form of a three letter code called a codon.  The pairing bases occur on the tRNA in the stem-loop structure.  The pairing is complementary, A with U, C with G.  However, the third position of the anti-codon on the tRNA is called the wobble position because an unusual nucleotide, inosine, can be found in some tRNAs.  This nucleotide can bind to A, U, or C. This leads to a single tRNA with a single amino acid being able to recognize and bind different codons.  Evolutionarily, it means that mutations in the coding sequence of DNA will not necessarily cause a change in the protein, depending on if the mutation is a point mutation of a wobble position.

question_title: how do classification systems help us to think about and study diversity on earth? [SEP] question_content: lots of detail please [SEP] best_answer: Taxonomic classification systems are useful for a couple of significant reasons.  First and foremost, it creates a name for each living organism that ALL scientists can agree upon.  Therefore, biologists on opposite sides of the world can be confident that they are discussing the same organism when looking at the taxonomic label of that organism.  Secondly, the design of the system is useful for showing evolutionary relationships among organisms.  Generically, the breakdown is kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.  There are five kingdoms (six in some systems) and millions upon millions of species.  For any two organisms, they are more closely related evolutionarily if they share a classification more toward the species.  For example, two organisms that share a genus are more closely related than two other organisms that only share a family.  You should know that there modifications of the above system so that you get things like subphyla, superfamilies, etc.  The genus and species names are GENeral and SPECIfic for a particular organism and are always written in italics, with the genus name being capitalized and the species name beginning with a lower-case letter.  The millions of species described by the system is a testimony to the great biodiversity of life on this planet.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: Premature atrial and ventricular contractions are considered harmless by the 3 doctors and 2 cardiologists I've seen, but what a pain in the ass!  Those of you who are as unfortunate as me to actually feel every single one of them, how do you cope?  I can't sleep, and then being tired makes them worse.  I take atenolol, but it doesn't seem to do much.  Does anyone have any favorite medicine to control them or sleep through them? [SEP] best_answer: Those doctors aren't very helpful sometimes, are they?  (  :\n\nYou're certainly not alone.  If it's serious enough that you can't sleep, then that in itself can be a real problem.  There are medications that MIGHT help, such as beta blockers (like propranolol and metoprolol), but these all have a bunch of other effects which it would be better to avoid if you can.\n\nSo you might want to try some lifestyle changes.  Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exercise can all be triggers that increase the frequency of your arrythmias.  Unfortunately, so can stress - so worrying about whether you can get to sleep will unfortunately only make it harder to get to sleep!\n\nDeep breathing will help you relax, and some people report that magnesium, calcium, and fish oil supplements can help too.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.

question_title: What is a 3 digit number divisable by 7 but not 2-The sum of my digits is 4? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Because your result is odd (not divisible by 2), the last digit can't be 0 or 2, so it must be 1 or 3...\n\nIf the last digit is 3, the other digits must add to 1, so you have only one choice:\n103\n\nIf the last digit is 1, the other digits must add to 3, so your choices are:\n121\n211\n301\n\nNow test each one to see if it is divisible by 7:\n103 / 7 = 14.714285...\n121 / 7 = 17.285714...\n211 / 7 = 30.142857...\n301 / 7 = 43\n\nSo the only number that fits your criteria is:\n301\n\n301 is 3 digits\n301 is divisible by 7 (7 x 43)\n301 is *not* divisible by 2\nThe sum of my digits (3 + 0 + 1) is 4.

question_title: what  is the difference between energy and force? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Although the words are used in many ways, science has specific definitions\nfor each.\n\nForce is a push or a pull.  Force is between objects, one object pushing or\npulling on another.\n\nEnergy is more difficult to define, because energy is "abstract".  Energy is\na quantity that gives an object the ability to affect other objects.  There\nare different kinds of energy.  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion,\nstored within a moving object.  Potential energy is stored in the force\nbetween objects, perhaps in the stretch of a spring.  Thermal energy can be\nstored in the temperature of an object.  Energy passes from place to place,\nobject to object, but never disappears.  The total energy of the universe\nremains constant.\n\nFuel is a material that has energy stored in its chemical structure.  When\nfuel is processes (burned, for example), the chemical energy is released.\nThis released energy can become heat and cause the temperature of something\nto rise.  The released energy can become the kinetic energy of a car.  It\ncan become the energy carried by sound to your ears.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: The movement of sediment by the forces of nature is called? [SEP] question_content: These are the possible 4 answers:\n\nA. weathering B. depostion C. erosion D. abrasion [SEP] best_answer: You need to think about this in terms of the question, that is what one of these processes involves movement of sediment.\n\nWeathering does involve movement of sediment, since weathering includes lots of processes that break down rocks into smaller particles or even dissolve rocks. Dissolution of limestone by carbonic acid in water is weathering that 'moves' rock. Freeze-thaw weathering of sandstone breaks the sandstone into smaller particles that are carried away by water, gravity, and wind. \n\nDeposition is the end result of the process of moving sediment, and may be the only one that does not answer your question, but because it is part of the process of 'moving' sediment it probably counts. \n\nErosion definitely moves sediment. Soil, sand, and rock are eroded by moving water and transported to new locations. \n\nAbrasion results in 'moving' sediment. Glaciers abrade underlying rock and grind it into small particles. Wind blows sand grains against rock and abrades it and reduces it to smaller particles. \n\nI think the only correct answer here is "all of the above.”	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What's the carrying capacity of lynx rufus (bobcat)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The carrying capacity is generally very hard to determine. With bobcats it may be near impossible as they do not cram in as many individuals as the land will hold, as a moose or deer will, so carrying capacity is different for them. The carrying capacity will also vary depending on the different habitat, it is generally determined for a type of ecosystem or a particular area. Bobcats set up territories, so the territory range within an acceptable habitat will determine how many bobcats there are. I doubt their population numbers ever even come close to the actual carrying capacity for them. With that said, from what i could find, it looks like there are around 7 bobcats/100km2. Ive attached a link to a good paper discussing bobcat distribution. hope this helps a bit	Science & Mathematics
question_title: determining stoichiometry of Ni and en or EDA by Job's method? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hello,\n\nThe idea behind Job's method is to prepare a series of reaction mixtures (for example solutions) in which the total number of moles of the reactants is fixed but with different ratio. One then plots the number of moles of product vs the ratio. The maximum of the curve will occur at the correct stoichiometric ratio.\n\nIn your case, one could prepare solutions containing a total number of moles (i.e. moles of Ni + moles EDA) equal to 1 with the following composition:\n\nmoles Ni     moles EDA Ratio Ni/EDA\n0.9                0.1           9        \n0.8                0.2           4\n0.6                0.4          1.5\n0.4                0.6          0.666\n0.2                0.8          0.25\n0.0                1.0          0.0\n\nOne then needs to measure the amount of Ni-EDA complex and plot that amount agains the ratio. The maximum will tell you which is the right stoichiometric ratio. Hope this helps. See the web site below for a more complete explanation.\n\nOne then measures the	Science & Mathematics

Even if you were to pour the bubbles in after the water stopped runnning the bubble mixture would still spread evenly throughout the water by simple diffusion.\n2. when you light a scented cande. The scent travels throughout the whole house because it travels from an area of high concentration (right above the candle) to the rest of the areas around the house that have low concentrations of the scent.\nGood? next time do your homework yourself :)	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Should I address my grievance to the management, or sell these inferior goods on the secondary market? [SEP] question_content: Last month I ordered 41 gross of strut bearings for my temporal distorter matrix, since each use of the matrix tends to sublimate the 212 requisite bearings into a silvery Jackson-Pollock-esque mess on the ceiling of my garage. I was assured these bearings were mookie-proof.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, the mookination had transpired and was clearly underway. Now, I'm sure you're fully aware of the dire consequences that come when mookine interrupts a temporal rift - we all hang our heads sadly in rememberance of Andrew "Unsafe at any speed" Clayton of Westshireship, who, in 1996, had installed only 4 mookinated bearings in his primitive array of 143, disappeared for two weeks, and came back an inverted penguin.\n\nSo I ask you, should I sell these decidedly non-mookie-proof bearings on the secondary market, or complain to the management? [SEP] best_answer: Sell them on the secondary market. Complaining to management will get you nowhere.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How long is silver nitrate suppose to stay on the wound after cauterization? [SEP] question_content: I had cauterization performed on a wound.  The dried up silver nitrate was left on the skin.  How long am I suppose to leave it on?  Am I suppose to wash it off when I shower? [SEP] best_answer: I don't know where your wound is but if SilNit was applied because the area is sensitive to infection or inflammation, leave it on so long as the wound/skin is still raw or broken. If not, its water soluble so you can wish it off given your PCF states so.SilNit is usually associated wiith infection. However, if it is associated with, and I don't mean to bring this up, gonorrhea leave it on and check with your PCF to get specific info from them as needed.  But it should be ok to wash off so long as the wound is looking presentable with no discomfort.  If the color has darkened a lot, then full exposure to the SilNit has come and gone.  Hope it helps, good luck.  Corrections Welcomed.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Calculus II question please help? [SEP] question_content: This question was on my test and the answer was 3,272,500.\nA tank is in the shape of a right circular cone of altitude 25 feet and base radius 20 feet with its vertex at the ground. (Think of an ice cream cone with its point facing down.) The tank is externally braced to prevent its falling over. If the tank is full of a fluid which weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, find the work done, in foot pounds, correct to the nearest hundred footpounds, in pumping all of the fluid out of the top of the tank.\n\nI received an answer that works but I don't know how they got 20000.  \nBelow is the answer that was posted\nFirst, you need the volume. The formula yields: V = pi rh/3 = 20000pi/3 cubic feet. Since it weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot, the ratio 50 lbs/ft.^3 = 1. So multiplying this to our volume equation, V = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 = 20000pi/3 ft.^3 * 50lbs/ft.^3 = 100000pi/3 lbs. The work function is (25-x)100000pi/3 = W(x).

[SEP] question_content: b) What is the area on the map if the actual area is 3.2 km^2? [SEP] best_answer: Part (a)\n4:10000 scale means 4 cm distance on map represents 10000 cm or 100 m. Hence a 12 cm road is actually (12*100/4) = 300 m = 0.3 km long.\n\nPart (b)\nLength scale 4:10000 means area scale is (4*4):(10000*10000) i.e. 16:10^8. This means 10^8 cm^2 area will be represented by 16 cm^2 area on the map. Hence 3.2 km^2 = 3.2*10^10 cm^2 actual area is represented by (16*3.2*10^10/10^8) = 5120 cm^2 area on the map.

question_title: Did matter travel faster than light during big bang? [SEP] question_content: Also, what is the rate of expansion of the universe? and how do we know that it's accelerating and if so, will it (the rate of expansion) reach the speed of light? Can anyone explain in hopefully layman terms? [SEP] best_answer: this is somewhat similar to a question I answered realative to time travel. The short answer is no, there was never a time, nor will there ever be a time when matter (massive fermions) travel faster than light (massless bosons). This is because massive objects need energy to accelerate and regaurdless of how much energy was released in the big bang, it could not have been infinite, and that is what is required to move a massive particle faster than light. Light speed is not a derived measurement, it is a fundemental constant that is the same in all reference frames. Here's the cool exception though.....and this is how a theoretical warp drive would work..... the actual expansion of space itself might have been faster than light. There has never been a limit imposed on the speed at which space expands although because gravity is a result of the deformation of space and gravitons are the theoretical force carrier, it has been assumed that the expansion of space would occur only as fast as gravitons can travel....which is most likely light speed. One of the many postulates asserted by string theory is that gravitons may not be bound to our spatial demensions, that they might radiate through extra demensions (which would account for gravity's lack of strenght compared to the other forces). If this is the case that the gravitons travel through other demensions it is quite possible that within a given reference time, a graviton could pop into a superior demension and back into our at some other point and essentially beat light to some defined location.\n\nI know thats a little confusing.....but its fun to think about.

question_title: what are the mechanical properties of E8 steel? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I  think you are talking about EN-8.\nA plain carbon steel suitable for use where a good degree wear resistance combined with toughness is required but without the expense of an alloy steel.\n\nTypical applications of EN8 include base plates for tools in plastic moulding and pressure casting dies, components for hand tools.\n\n\nSince 1988 a new series of 'mandatory' European standards (EN = Europaischen Normen) has been created, to replace national standards, such as BS, DIN, SS and NF, throughout 18 countries of Western Europe. EN are a part of the 'Single Market' legislation, designed to give equal opportunities for firms to compete throughout Europe, by harmonising the technical requirements between countries. The national standards bodies, of which BSI is one, are required to officially withdraw their national standards, when an EN is created with the same scope of application.\n\n\nA number of letters with there mechanical property identifiers are listed below\nLetter Steel Use Mechanical Property... \nS Structural Steel Minimum Yield Strength \nP Pressure Purposes Minimum Yield Strength \nL Line Pipe Minimum Yield Strength \nE Engineering Minimum Yield Strength \nB Reinforcing Steel Characteristic Yield Case \nY Pre-stressing Steel Minimum Yield Case \nR Rails Minimum Yield Case \nH High Strength Cold Rolled Minimum Yield Case \nD Flat Products for Cold Forming C, D or X followed by \ntwo numbers characterising steel \nT Tinmill Products Nominal Yield Case \nM Electrical Steel Number = 100 x specific loss in \nW/kg, "—" \nNumber = 100 x nom thick in mm \nLetter for type of steel (A,B,E,N,S or P) \n\nEN 8 IS an old standard.

question_title: if you work for long hours for a long period of time does your body adjust to this and act normal after awhile [SEP] question_content: My mom has been taking understandedibly tiring and long days of work for about a month and a half and she always gets home tired and ready to go to bed. I heard your body should adjust. But I wonder beacause i think she is just saying she is tired. I told her i didnt like her when she was on antidepressants and, she has taken them to get high before and I think she still is and just using the "tired act" just to get away with it, because she does act tired but also goofy too (the same as when she took the antidepressants). And im not sure if she is lying me or not. I want to confront her but i have tried before and she denied it so i just wanted to research a little.\n\nsorry for the long story [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately, the human body cannot adjust to sleep deprivation; it has only a limited capacity to absorb lack of rest, too.  It never totally adapts to either, frankly.\n\nThe fact that she has used antidepressants abusively is very much an issue to be worried about, however; on the whole, you have to work very hard to hurt yourself with the more modern antidepressants, but it's altogether possible to do so.  Much depends on the precise compound being used for her depression, but many of them will cause tiredness as a side effect.  You might get the name and do a quick search on the 'net on it.  (pdr.net might be available to you; worth a try if it is)\n\nOffhand, I'd say there's a whole lot more going on here than you see--and perhaps more than the individual prescribing the antidepressants is aware of, too.  I realize that you feel your Mom is the one with the problem--you may well be right, too--but if I were in your shoes, I'd seek counseling.  You've got personal stresses generated by having to cope with this; those will take their toll on you, over time, if you don't get some assistance.  If you're still in pre-collegiate school, find a counselor to talk to; no matter what level of training you're in, maybe your clergy of choice would be a reasonable place to turn; or a professional counselor.\n\nYou can't solve your mom's problem; that's a guarantee.  She has to face it and solve it herself, though you can help her in that process.  All you can do is the best you can to keep her problems from damaging you.\n\nHope I've made sense...

question_title: (3x + 4)/6 = 2/5? [SEP] question_content: i was confused on this again [SEP] best_answer: Well, first you want to isolate the "x".  So, divide out the left side-this gets you 3x/6 + 4/6 = 2/5.  Take 4/6 from each side, so x/2 = 2/5 - 4/6.  You have to make the fractions have the same denominator, so you get x/2 = 12/30-20/30, or x/2 = -8/30.  Now multiply each side by 2, so you get x = -16/30, or x = -8/15.\nplug it back in to check, so (-24/15 + 60/15)/6 is the same as (36/15)/6, which is the same as 6/15, which reduces to 2/5.  O Ho! We got it!  x DOES equal -8/15..  That was fun-I havent done that kind of math for a long time..	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why are yawns contagious?

question_title: how far??? [SEP] question_content: if your looking outside how far can  a person see in a distance? [SEP] best_answer: On a clear dark night you can see galaxies millions of lightyears away.  The horizon you see depends on how high above the ground you are.  One approximate formula for the distance in miles to the horizon is:\n distance =sqrt(1.5 x height)  \nso if I'm 6 feet above the flat ground or better yet a flat ocean, my horizon is sqrt(9) = 3 miles.  This would work really well if the Earth were smooth like a bowling ball, but its rough and has mountains and valleys and hills and trees so the formula is idealized.  See wikipedia "horizon"\n In Modern industrialized countries, pollution often makes it difficult to see more than 20 miles unless you are way up in an airplane.	Science & Mathematics

Columbia is in the lowlands and the Congaree River runs through the city about one mile from the  center of campus.\n\nThe nearest mountains of any size are the Great Smoky Mountains which are located at the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, about 200 miles (3 - 4 hours) North of Columbia. They are awesome and offer a lot of recreational activities but would make for a fairly long day trip from Columbia.\n\nThe USC Spartanburg campus is much closer to the mountains (1.5 - 2 hours) but is not near any rivers.\n\nWK	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Which part of the human brain releases dopamine & what are its effects? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Dopamine is not produced only in the brain. it is produced in a number of areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems -- chiefly in the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, and the caudad.  \n \nDopamine plays a role in many different physiological processes, including skeletal movement to drug addiction. In addition dopamine's activities have been linked to cardiovascular, renal, hormonal, and central nervous systems.  \n \nBoth an excess of or deficiency of dopamine can cause disorders.  A deficiency in the striatum or substantia nigra results in Parkinson’s-like symptoms.  In this case, movement becomes slow and rigid, accompanied by muscle tremors. Drugs, such as L-DOPA, are used to alleviate these symptoms.  An excessive amount of dopamine is associated with schizophrenia.  Certain drugs, such as cocaine, block the return of dopamine into the brain, resulting in a build up of dopamine in the synapses, leading to drug-induced psychosis or schizophrenia.

question_title: wht is Fallen astronaut?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Fallen Astronaut is an 8.5-cm aluminum sculpture of an astronaut in a spacesuit. It is the only piece of art on the Moon.\n\nIt was created by Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck, who met astronaut David Scott at a dinner party. Van Hoeydonck was asked to create a small statuette to personally commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts having lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration. Van Hoeydonck was given a set of design restrictions: in addition to the physical requirements that the sculpture be both lightweight and sturdy, and that it be capable of withstanding the temperature extremes of the Moon, the statuette could not be identifiably male or female, nor of any identifiable ethnic group. Furthermore, in accordance with Scott's wish to avoid the commercialization of space, Van Hoeydonck's name would not be made public.\n\nIn 1971, Fallen Astronaut was placed on the Moon by the crew of Apollo 15, along with a plaque bearing the names of fourteen American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts who died during spaceflights or training exercises.\n\nAfter the crew mentioned the statuette during their post-flight press conference, the National Air and Space Museum requested that a replica be made for public display. The crew agreed, under the condition that it was to be displayed "with good taste and without publicity"; in April of 1972, Van Hoeydonck presented the Museum with a replica of Fallen Astronaut, which is now on display with a replica of the plaque.\n\nIn May of 1972, Scott learned that Van Hoeydonck planned to make more replicas and sell them. Feeling that this would be a violation of the spirit of their agreement, Scott tried to persuade Van Hoeydonck to refrain, but was unsuccessful; 950 signed replicas went on sale for $750 apiece at the Waddell Gallery of New York.\n\nHope this helps.

question_title: Is there end for universe? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Universe is expanding, but it doesn't have a phyiscal start, middle, or an end.  It's going to expand forever. Don't think about it, because it's not something our mind can really grasp.\n\nHere's an analogy that helped me:\n\nImagine the Universe as a two dimensional place.  The Universe is the surface of a rubber ball.  There's no start, finish, or middle.  As the Universe expands, the rubber ball fills with air.  Still no start, finish, or middle.\n\nFor a long time, it was unknown whether the Universe was open or closed, meaning whether the Universe would expand forever or eventually collapse back on itself back to nothing.\n\nThe hubble telescope proved that the Universe it open and would expand forever.

Does he means he is selling his horse and himself?\n\n②I'm asking a job, I'd even be willing to...Cut my fee?\nDoes he mean it would be ok to have low payment if he get a job?\n\n③Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to go with the second rule of horse racing.　Never beat a dead horse.\n\nWhat is the second rule mean? [SEP] best_answer: 1. He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses. He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.\n\n2. Yes. He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.\n\n3. Beat a dead horse (actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled. For example, if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind, then to keep asking can be described as  - Beating (Flogging) a dead horse. In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer. But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses :-)\n\nThe expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse (to make it work harder) if it is dead!!

question_title: henry hudson's fourth voyage? [SEP] question_content: Wat did he do on his fourth voyage help me plz. [SEP] best_answer: Henry Hudson's Fourth Voyage\n1610: The Northwest Passage\n\nMore info at link below:\n\n    Henry Hudson managed to get support from English backers for another voyage, this time in search of a Northwest Passage, one he had wanted to pursue almost since the start of his voyages. The main sponsor this time was Sir Thomas Smythe - governor and treasurer of the Virginia Company, and also of the English East India Company. Smythe desperately needed to recoup his losses after a disaster that saw his last fleet to Virginia scattered, with hundreds of men lost. He may not have paid Hudson for his services - rather, it may have been Hudson's payment for Smythe getting Hudson out of house arrest. \n\nThe voyage started inauspiciously with a company man put off the ship and a another man brought aboard - Henry Greene, a gambler who would prove a partner in trouble with Juet. Almost from the start there was trouble with the crew. Hudson's ability to manage his crew appears even weaker than in previous voyages. There were fights and almost a mutiny within the first few months, before they even reached the area Hudson intended to explore.\n\nDiscovery ended up sailing through the treacherous Arctic waters north of modern Quebec - the Furious Overfall - known today as Hudson's Strait although he did not discover it - and into a large body of water now known as Hudson Bay.\n\nBy the fall of the year the crew was stuck hundreds of miles south, unable to go further or to get home. They had to endure a harsh winter in that hostile land, during which one crewman died and most others were sickened by scurvy or lack of food. Again, Hudson's showed his inability to deal with the natives and his own crew during the cold months they spent ashore.\n\nBy late next spring, the ship was ready to sail again. Hudson wanted to continue his explorations, but the crew only wanted to head home. Fights broke out over food and Hudson accused some crew members of hoarding. They in turn accused him of the same. Eventually a large number of crew members, led by Juet and Greene, decided to mutiny. They put the captain, his son and others they didn't like into a small shallop and set it adrift while the Discovery sailed away. None of the abandoned crew were ever seen again.

question_title: what range of TOEFL Score is considered very good? [SEP] question_content: what range of TOEFL Score is considered very good in case of CBT where total score is 300. If u want to get admission in TOP scholls what is the requirement of TOEFL score [SEP] best_answer: TOEFL Score Interpretation\n\nD.W. McKeon, Director, ESL & GTA Training Programs \n\nExecutive Summary \nI. Introduction\nII. Overall Scores and Subscores \nIII. Other Factors Affecting TOEFL Scores \nIV. The Old GRE Verbal Section and the TOEFL \nV. The New GRE Analytical Writing Section and the TOEFL \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language, TOEFL, developed in the early 1960’s, has become the main instrument of measuring English language proficiency for international students around the world. A total score (range of 310-677) was determined based on the scores of three subsections: Listening, Structure, and Reading; (note: an optional essay was administered at every other international testing date, the Test of Written English, TWE, with a score range of 0 to 6). \n\nIn the late 1990’s, the TOEFL Board produced a computer-based test (CBT; range: 40 to 300. Other than the supposed ease of electronic test-taking, the CBT TOEFL made a few notable improvements on the paper-based test (PBT); to mention two: (1) it includes linear testing (from easy to difficult) and computer-adaptive testing (tailoring to the proficiency level of the individual test-taker); and (2) it includes a compulsory essay, whose score is factored into the Structure section and is reported in a separate Essay Section, equivalent to the former TWE. A Concordance Table was published in 1998, providing equivalences between the familiar PBT scores and the new CBT ones. Since the CBT is not administered at every site where the PBT was, the PBT continues to be used in various parts of the world. \n\nGraduate School admissions committees have generally used a 550 (=213 CBT) cutoff score, but often without consideration of the total profile of subscores. In light of their near magical aura to the aggregate TOEFL scores, below are some recommendations on the use of TOEFL (either form) for admissions committees:\n\nRegardless of the total score, subscores must be taken into consideration \nListening subscores should not be below 50/16, regardless of the total, aggregate score \nEssay Writing subscores should not be below 4.0 (same rating as TWE scores) \nSince neither PBT nor CBT TOEFL versions measure one’s speaking ability, admissions committees considering offering teaching assistants with teaching duties should not use TOEFL scores alone in such decisions (certainly Listening scores should be a factor) \nThe number of times (and length of intervals) a prospective student has taken the TOEFL should be considered as a factor (read, test-wiseness as an issue) \nDate of last administration and activity in using English since then should be factored in the decision to accept an applicant or not \nFinally, TOEFL scores have never meant to be predictors of academic success. \nReturn to top \nI. Introduction\n\nHaving been developed in the mid 1960’s, the TOEFL has become the major standard of measuring proficiency in English as a second language throughout the world . Because of its widespread use in determining admissions into colleges and universities, TOEFL scores have taken on a sort of magical aura to them. One rather unfortunate consequence is the emergence of innumerable TOEFL preparation courses—not to mention TOEFL preparation centers—throughout the world: the tail is indeed wagging the dog. Even more unfortunate is the temptation to view one’s TOEFL scores as an indicator of general intelligence or as a predictor of academic success, despite the TOEFL Board’s insistence to the contrary. \n\nAlthough the TOEFL Board introduced a computer-based version in 1997 to replace paper-based testing, the latter is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Thus, in general, TOEFL scores in the 310-677 range (paper-based test) are still more familiar than those in the 40-300 range (computer-based test).\n\nLike the paper-based test (PBT), the c	Education & Reference

question_title: ♥What do u mostly do and learn in college? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my humble opinion (and experience), an undergraduate college education is largely the process of training oneself to take the time to retain knowledge.  That's the point of the introductory classes in the first couple years.  They prepare you for the more in-depth major classes and perhaps research in the later years.  Ideally, it's more of training someone in how to learn more than teaching them facts.  \n\nAs far as what you do in college, it's usually a crazy balance f diverse things.  Time for classes, studying (hopefully), extra-curricular involvement, and a social life is hard to manage, but to be a job-attractive graduate, they are all necessary.	Education & Reference

If however, I say "John is as strong as an ox" you have a much more vivid image in your mind because of the comparison that is made.  This is an example of visual imagery but often authors try to appeal to other senses for more effective writing.	Education & Reference

There are also variations of the course available. However, depending on where you are going you may not need one (although it's good to have a backup) For example if you go to Thailand or Bangkok you can easily pick up work teaching English. A friend of mine found work in a day and carried on to be very successful there. In places like Thailand when teaching English the student you teach are paying for the privilege and must try to speak only English while in your class.\nThe money you'll be paid there is good when compared to the national average and is enough to give you a descent standard of living. Over there you can live well on about £350 a month. You'll find accommodation and costs of living to be less than western countries. If you're thinking of travelling and working abroad you should try getting in contact with different charities that do projects in these countries and ask them about it. They'll be able to give allot of good information relating to the place you have in mind. They'll be able to give you a more accurate estimate of how much it will cost you and such.\n\nGood Luck honey, if you go, have a blast... You'll love it!	Education & Reference

For the "normal" person, behavior reflects feelings, and is appropriate for the social context. However, B/ED people have feelings that do not match their environment, and/or their natural behavioral responses are not socially acceptable.  Therefore, their big challenge in learning is to build "unnatural" behavior patterns to meet society's expectations. The world will not change to fit them...they must change to fit the world. Life is not fair...and never has been.\n\nThe purpose of special education is to help children who are different, learn to function effectively in the mainstream society. If your child does not learn to control his own behavior by the time he is an adult, he WILL end up in prison (the prison population is full of people with ADHD, ED, etc.). \n\nYour son is not in special education to be coddled, "allowed to be himself," or enabled in his use of maladaptive behaviors. He is in special education so that he can be guided toward appropriate behaviors.\n\nThe question you should be raising is not "why are they appearing to attack my son?" but rather "Are they providing appropriate instruction in behavior skills so that HE can learn to control himself?" AND "Am I being trained, as a parent, in these techniques so that I can use them at home and provide him with stability across all environments?"  AND "What am I already doing at home to bring about changes in his behavior so that my baby boy won't spend a life behind bars?"	Education & Reference

Apart from cultural things that may be tied to a language, each language also has a unique sound or melody which I think affects you in some way just the way that music can. It affects how things are expressed, as well as perceived. This is why I would be concerned about the spread of English; it could definitely hurt the diversity of the world.  And the mainstream English is not nearly as melodious as half the other languages out there in my opinion.	Education & Reference

I think that because we have not perfected the way people learn best, that within pedagogy there can be theories about how people learn.\n\nResearch usually has more to do with collecting information.  When we do research for papers, we gather information to prove our point from a variety of sources.  Scientific research gathers information through experiments to support a hypothesis.

Indiana school isn't going to teach a GREAT deal on poisonous snake bits because they don't have many poisonous snakes.  Go near the ocean and they will focus strongly on drownings.

question_title: I've just been diagnosed dyslexic, and find it hard to motivate myself to start assignments. Any advice? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Wow, your doctor is full of shit. Just, wow.\n\nDyslexia doesn't make sense for the inability to focus. A simple test: bdqp. What does that say? If you can read that and know which sequence it is, you aren't even dyslexic in the right way to effect reading at all. You could have a problem called ADD, or you could have a combination of the two like I did. ADD means you can't focus and get easily distracted, among other things:\n\nScan these:\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diseases_and_conditions/add_adhd.htm\nhttp://borntoexplore.org/whatisadd.htm\n\nThere is no easy way to deal with ADD, other than learning to cope. For the dyslexia, I just had to grow out of it (but still confuse right and left once in a while) I still don't study well unless I retreat to someplace quiet where there are practically no distractions, like a library. Ritalin is one solution, but you may or may not like its effects. My brother took the stuff and it didn't do a damn thing, but it helps some people.\n\nThe only plus side is that you will probably make a good scientist or engineer or artist anything where you need visualization skills. I can't do abstract math, but with a physics problem where there is something to visualize I am faster than blue blazes. I also do photography well enough to get recognized as art, although I lack the coordination or patience for drawing by hand. I can also think in five dimensions, but I haven't found a use. Perhaps you will be an architect or a sculptor? Thomas Edison was probably ADD too.\n\nRemember the trick about going to a library or something to study!	Education & Reference

question_title: who is Captain Hook? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Captain Hook\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \nCaptain Hook as seen in the Disney version of Peter Pan.Captain James Hook is the (so-called) villain of J. M. Barrie's play and novel Peter Pan. Hook is a pirate captain and Peter Pan's nemesis. It is said that he was Blackbeard's bosun, and that he was the only man Long John Silver ever feared. He wears an iron hook in place of his left hand, which was cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a crocodile; the crocodile liked the taste of him so much that it follows him around constantly, hoping for more. Hook hates Peter obsessively, and lives for the day he can make Peter and all his Lost Boys walk the plank.\n\nLest anyone think Hook's name too convenient, Barrie notes that "Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze." Barrie also suggests through several clues that the Captain was an Old Etonian - in Barrie’s short story “Jas Hook at Eton,” Hook’s final words before jumping overboard are “Floreat Etona” (115).\n\nIn Barrie's play and novel, Hook kidnaps Wendy, the girl who loves Peter and whom Peter views as his surrogate mother, and challenges the boy to a final duel. When Hook is bested and must choose between surrender and death, he commits suicide by throwing himself into the waiting jaws of the crocodile. Just before dying, however, he takes a final jab at Peter by taunting him about his "bad form". Peter, with the callousness of youth, quickly forgets Hook and finds a new nemesis, but as Hook made a stronger impression on the public, most sequels brought him back one way or another.\n\nThe symbolism of Peter Pan's fight with Captain Hook (traditionally played by the same actor as Wendy's father), combined with Hook's fear of time in the form of the ticking crocodile, possibly hints at Jungian subtext.\n\nIt is hypothesized that Captain Hook was modeled after the famous English captain Christopher Newport. Both were dark-haired captains of dubious pasts, and both were missing their right hands which were replaced by metal hooks. Newport commanded the ships that landed the settlers at Jamestown in Virginia. He also seems to have a distinctive similarity to Bartholomew Roberts, especially regarding his choice of clothes and his impeccable manners, although Barrie specifically associates his dress and hairstyle with that of King Charles II of England.\n\nAnother hypothesis claims that Captain James Hook could represent Captain James Cook, the British captain who discovered both Australia and New Zealand. The Lost Boys symbolize the Maoris, who inhabit New Zealand, or the Aborigines, who inhabit Australia.\n\nSmee is Captain Hook's bosun and right-hand man, so to speak.	Education & Reference
question_title: Why do teachers ignore certain students? [SEP] question_content: This doesnt happen to me often, but it happened a lot in this one certain class.  I had an A+ in the class because I did the homework and took tests well, but the teacher still treated me terribly campared to the other kids.  They were allowed to start open discussions without having to raise hands and whatever.  So I thought that was cool.  But when ever I made a comment she refused to respond or 'shushed' me; which I found extremely degrading.  Also I found her to be very fake and a lot of what she told us about the world was wrong.  Her facts were totally wrong and these were like common knowledge to me.  So I would say my comment to say that she was wrong, but believe me I did this respectfully.  But she gave me a dirty look and continued with her 'mind-tainting' lecture.  It was absurd.  Why would she do that? Does she just not know better? (oh yea she isnt a new teacher, apparently she's been doing this like forever) [SEP] best_answer: My son's first experience in school in Kindergarten got him one of those teachers.  We butted heads all the time.  She labeled him a trouble maker because he didn't stay on task and wanted to move faster than the class did.  I told her that she was wrong so I was the demanding parent.\n\nTeachers come in all types and some are just not good or have worn out their welcome.  Some fear change.  Some are threatened easily and when there is a smart student they feel it and react badly.\n\nIf there is an issue that she is wrong about (or any teacher in the future too) bring in proof that you are right in writing.  I did and, yes it made my teacher MAD, but the other students then started to question her and she was forced to prove herself the rest of the way through.  You may not be the favorite in class with that teacher but you will be respected by your fellow students.  If the teacher threatens to fail you for speaking up (like mine did) go higher up (principal, dean, etc) with the proof.\n\nYou're an A+ student.  Let her know it!	Education & Reference
question_title: Is an SAT score of 1770 okay? [SEP] question_content: Or should I retake it?

The most selective schools (e.g., ivy league) typically had SAT averages north of 1400 (combined math & verbal, not all three tests).\n\nSo I guess it's a question of how you did on the math & verbal, and what is your goal in terms of schools.

Consider that he's Hamlet's foil throughout the play, then look at Horatio's response to Hamlet's comments about the lawyers and politicians who used to be those skulls. He responds very gently to Hamlet's tirades, and seems like he's there to say, "yes, corruption is bad, but it's within some people, and they are now skulls, so they got what's coming to them" and wants to assure Hamlet to despise corruption, but tolerate it and be true to himself.\n\nLook at Horatio's first line in the scene, "Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness". It seems his function in that scene is to let Hamlet know that people are made by their social status	Education & Reference

question_title: plz help me i am in desperate need of advice? [SEP] question_content: so junior prom is coming up right, and there's boy that i liked. my cousin had asked him if he wanted to take me to prom he said yes and we both agreed that we would go as friends. then the same night that my cousin asked him, we were hanging out in our development, and all of a sudden he just kisses me, tounge and everything, then he tells me that even though i did that, i am not looking for a relationship, i said neither am i. so two days after this happened, he haventh said a word to me and he seem to be ignoring me. what do you think happened? and to add he is white and i am black and we live in pennsylvania [SEP] best_answer: Two possibilities: \n- he wants to have the benefits but not the responsibility. Perhaps he was just letting you know how he'd like your friendship to be. You know, fooling around but not committing.\n- in reality, he wants to have a relationship with you, but is afraid to ask or is afraid that you would not be down with it. So by saying he doesn't want to committ, he was testing the waters to see how you thought about this. \n\nMy personal guess is that the first option is more like it. He's a guy, and guys like to think of themselves as players. Unless you have no problem with being casual friends with benefits, then no prob. But if it disturbs you that he wants the goods but not you, then you're better off with someone who wants the whole package.\n\nIn any case, make sure he still wants to go to prom with you. He sounds a bit like a jerk (sorry, but he's ignoring you!). Make sure that YOU have a date!	Family & Relationships

question_title: my ex and I are trying to be friends... good idea? [SEP] question_content: So my ex and I have never been too great of friends, even before we were dating. But this year, the tension between us seemed to pull our group of friends apart, so we decided to try to be friends.\nThe problem is, he seems to expect me to put in all the effort to be nice and friendly, only responding once i've made the first move.\nWe have our ups and downs, but i can't take it anymore. So now, i've made it clear that i'm not going to try so hard unless he decides to be a man and put in some effort. \nShould I:\n(1) wait for him to come around,\n(2) go back to putting in all the effort,\n(3) just give up on him?? [SEP] best_answer: option 3. he wasn't much of a friend before, and now that you have relationship baggage and nothing strong platonically to bind you from before, there is no friendship to revive here. too much complication and effort on your part. let him go and make different friends, see different guys, be free!!

question_title: I am married to a truck driver who, even whrn he's home I'd consider myself alone.? [SEP] question_content: I left him for @3 weeks and he was wonderful while we were apart. We had long conversations and made love 3 times in a week, where as it had been almost a year since the last time. I feel like he's really not interested in me. Not emotionally, sexually nothing.... I don't want to leave him but I'm not getting any younger. I'm 46 now and I want some romance and love in my life, and yes, sex would be nice also. Someone please talk to me. He wont and I just don't know what to do anymore. [SEP] best_answer: If you're miserable in your marriage and you have tried unsuccessfully to work things out with your husband then there is only one thing you can do--SHOW HIM THE DOOR.  Trust me...I was in a dead-end marriage and was totally miserable.  The only reason I stayed in the marriage as long as I did was for the kids. But now I look back at it and realize that I should have left him long before we even got married, because there were signs there that things weren't going to be right.\n\nSo many times us women think if we just stick things out things will change, or even we can change the man.  But sadly that doesn't happen, and for you to stay in a marriage\nwhere you feel alone is only going to hurt you.  Life is short--you deserve to be happy and feel loved and like you have a partner in your relationship.\n\nRegarding your previous split with your husband, it sounds like he was almost over-doing it in fear of losing you.  It shouldn't take the fear of losing you to make him treat you like his wife.  Cut him loose, and when he comes a wooing tell him "Sorry, you had your chance."  Then get out there and find you a good man.  You'll be glad you did.	Family & Relationships

If so your dependent would be listed on your orders.\n\nIf not, a birth certficate should list you as the parent.  If the father was also on the birth certificate you may have more of a problem.  If you have not been to court to establish custody, they may view you as kidnapping your child.  \n\nWould need more detail to say for sure but if the father is on the Birth Certificate you may have to file court documents for custody or maybe a notarized letter may work???  Check with the US Embassy in Kuwait.\n\nAs for a document saying you've never been married, not sure there is such a thing.  Just because you have not been married in one state does not mean you weren't marrried in another.  You would need proof from all 50 states saying you haven't been married???	Family & Relationships

question_title: what to do about this situation......? [SEP] question_content: ever since my bf moved away to start his business, he has changed, we went to talking on the phone 5-6 times a day now down to 1-2. if i call him sometimes he would say "bay i'll call you right back, but sometimes he forgets to call me back for the rest of the night. he used to stay on the phone with me while i drive home from work, but now he just says text me when you get home, or he'll say call when you get home, and i call but no answer. he has changed alot, when we were together here everything was great, but now i have alot of doubts, how can i move down there when he is acting like this, i am very unsure about him. can anyone help me to figure him out? because it's about to be over...... [SEP] best_answer: Hey! I understand how you must be feeling. It is better to talk to him openly with out pushing him at all. While talking to him make sure that you are giving him enough space to answer your questions. Dont ask him any close ended questions. Ask him only open end questions. I feel he must be very busy with his bussiness since it is new, he needs to pay more attension to his bussiness to grow. Generally boys are very less in talking and showing feelings. it doesnt mean that they are not sensitive. So dont jump in to conclusion and be open to him and dont try to control him or try not to doubt him too. give him time. I wish you good luck. God be with you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Is this common for North american girls? [SEP] question_content: My girl friend is Canadian, and her father abandoned her when she was very young. She always hangs out with other male friends, and it really bothers me a lot. I told her to stop doing it. But she keeps telling me that I should trust her, and sometimes she even calls me sexist. I really like her, but I can't stand this anymore. Do you think her acting this way is somewhat related to her father that abandoned her? or is this just very typical thing to do for North american girls? Are you girls hang out with other guys a lot when you actually have boyfriends too? [SEP] best_answer: I guess she feels good that way. Isn't it so? And you like her?\nThen you should enjoy that she feels good. Or don't you ?\nSo, I see you do not like her so much. That's it. \nGot it ?	Family & Relationships
question_title: my husband is NOT gay but likes it in the butt why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The organ involved in male ejaculation is the prostrate, which can be stimulated by anal play for men (about four inches in, curve towards his front, but use *lots* of lube!). It develops from the same cells which, in a female foetus, develop into the G-spot, we think.\n\nBeing open to this does *not* make a man gay, and not all gay men enjoy anal play or penetration. There are many nerve endings around the anus and, if people are open-minded enough to try, then they can find play there very enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to indulge him, try playing after he's showered, with plenty of lube, gentle at first, and see if you get into it. Some women do. The good sex sites (Good Vibrations, Scarlet Letters and Toys in Babeland for example) will have information if you want it.	Family & Relationships

Both men and women are welcome to offer me your insight. [SEP] best_answer: Both women and men want sex. Some more than others.

question_title: What should I do about my 'mother'? [SEP] question_content: My adoptive mother has always had a problem with me. She abused me as a child, and even though I tried to forgive her for it over the years, she has continuously hurt me. She feels that I cannot be happy. She has tried to make me leave the man of my dreams, and when I sent her some ultrasound pictures of our son, she refused everything at the post office. Neither of us have spoken to her since, but what should I do? Should I leave things alone knowing that I'd probably be better off without her, or should I take yet another step to trying to include her in my life? [SEP] best_answer: How sad for you. You need to ask yourself if you and your unborn children are better off without her. If she doesn't show you any love or compassion, then she certainly won't show your children any, which will only hurt you more in the long run. Have you tried calling her and asking her why she would miss the opportunity to be in her grandchildrens lives? If she still refuses to talk to you, chalk it up to God's work and move on without her. What does your Dad have to say about all this? Maybe he could be your "rock" when it comes to dealing with Mom.\nGood Luck and remember you still have your Mother in Law to lean on and show you some support......I know because your story is the same as my daughter in laws and I love her as if she was my own.

My love for my husband is beyond any love I have ever felt in my life. I knew the moment I meet him and he smiled his BIG ol' Californian guy smile at me there was something there. And to this day I get butterflies in my stomach when I see him across the room or when he walks up behind me and kisses the back of my neck. :D\n\nKeep this in mind- Love is what you make of it, not what someone else tells you it should be. :)	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is it possible to think that you are divorced and then find out you really aren't? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend said he was divorced.  Years ago, he had gone to a paralegal and had most of the divorce paper work completed. (I have seen the papers and his child custody agreement.) I found out he was still legally married.  He told me that he looked into it and that he really wasn't divorced because the paralegal didn't file the papers with the judge.  Is this possible?  Is a person stupid to not know if they are divorced or not?  Am I stupid for even wondering? [SEP] best_answer: It's possible, but unlikely.  He is not divorced til those papers are signed, sealed and delivered.  He's been lazy in finding out.  If he has no paperwork, he doesn't care whether he's divorced or not.  Or, he's just lazy.  If he's truly serious about you, he should make sure his divorce is final.  If you have to drive him to the courthouse yourself.\nI was not in a hurry to get the paperwork done, until I knew I was ready to remarry.  Well, that time came and I went to the nearest paralegal and had them get it done in time.  To make sure, I filed them myself.\n\nI hope everything works out for you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do females like to flirt? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: it just pings off all the right hormones, it's (supposed to be) clever and funny conversation, that anyone can get into with anyone else because you chat about common things, and express common sentimentl. it's about paying people compliments and getting them back, enjoying someone's company and showing that you do! \n\nYou excercise your powers of observation, everything doesn't have to be true, flirting isn't supposed to make people feel bad, just happy, attractive and appreciated...\n\nanybody would love that!

question_title: what is love? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: According to Robert Sternberg's research, "Love" is an emotion consisting of three components: intimacy, passion & committment.\n\nIntimacy, the feeling close and connected to someone (developed through sharing and very good communications over time). Intimacy is what makes you want to share and offer emotional and material support to each other.\n-Intimacy alone is Liking (true friendship without passion or long-term commitment)\n\n\nPassion, the feeling physically aroused and attracted to someone. Passion is what makes you feel "in love" and is the feeling most associated with love. It also rises quickly and strongly influences and biases your judgment.\n-Passion alone is Infatuation (passionate, obsessive love at first sight without intimacy or commitment)\n\nCommitment, pledging to your self and each other to strengthen the feelings of love and to actively maintain the relationship. Commitment is what makes you want to be serious, have a serious relationship and promise to be there for the other person if things get tough.\n-Commitment alone is Empty Love (decision to love another without intimacy or passion)\n\nRomantic Love: Intimacy & Passion, no Commitment\n-Lovers physically and emotionally attracted to each other but without commitment\n-“As in a summer romance”\n\nCompanionate Love: Intimacy & Commitment, but no Passion\n-Long-term committed friendships or a marriage in which the passion has faded\n-I love you but I’m not IN love with you\n\nFatuous Love: Passion & Commitment, but no Intimacy\n-Commitment based on passion with without time for intimacy to develop\n-Shallow relationship such as a whirlwind courtship\n\nConsummate Love: A complete love consisting of all three components	Family & Relationships

question_title: Scooby Doo? [SEP] question_content: When I was a kid I watched this episode of "The 13 ghosts of Scooby Doo." In it an evil wizard wanted Daphne (the hot red head) to be his bride so he trapped her in this glass case and cast a spell on her to put her to sleep. While she slept he hypnotized her to want to marry him. When I was a kid I found this very cool...but as I got older the idea turned me on more and more. Does anyone here share that fantasy, hypnotizing someone to sleep or putting them to sleep and then up them awakaning seducinng them? Any females or males share this fantasy? Holla.

question_title: How do you manage a job, kids, and keeping the house clean?  Any methods? [SEP] question_content: I have 3 kids, 2,4,10, and work part time.  My house is a disorganized mess!  I try so hard, but I can't seem to keep it clean.  And forget making dinner.  I don't have the energy during the day!  Anyone out there in my situation with a clean house- How?  HELP!! [SEP] best_answer: My apologies. If you wanted a magic elixer to do it all, there isn't any.\n\nThe only tools available to you is discipline, get your 10 yr old to do some housework for pocket money and use your freezer to store some ready meals to pull out, nuke and put on the table.\n\nTidying up is about something that is always happening with kids. Look at what the kids play with and how and work out if a container can be used to improve tidying. For example my sons use two large containers for their Lego and soldiers and scenes. This then puts the responsibility on my boys to put there toys back in the boxes when ever it's needed. Tidying is something that should be done in a "bit here, bit there" as this is far more efficient and better appearance than leaving things and then have a large mess to clean.\n\nCleaning needs another method of "divide and conquer". Divide your house up into areas that then are completed at certain times during your week with areas like the kitchen bench completed at the begining of a cleaning session. Get yourself some labour saving devices as well to speed things up. We have 14 clothes backets, 2 or 3 spares in the laundry ready to go. One maybe for the top of the clothes hamper to stop clothes overflowing. One maybe two beside the washing machine for when washing day arrives. Clothes come off the clothes line then the folding, ironing, putting away might be a little while so their stacked and stored. Even when they are given to the kids to put away, if the kids forget or your not on top of it you limit the mess. Even putting big toys in them in the kids rooms.\n\nA dinner ready to go is about cooking your food at a time when things are easy. Examples are cooking the sauce of Spagetti Bolonaise then cool and freezing it. Buy angel hair spagetti which cooks the quickest and drag out the sauce, put it through the microwave ta-dah. There are lots of these and if you have a Croc-Pot you can load it with meat and vegies in the morning and serve with bread rolls at dinner. The very nice people in the recipe answer forum could roll out some for you as well.\n\nAs for you not having energy, would that mean your continually tired, go and see your doc about it and make sure about plenty of sleep, food and a multivitamin.\n\nHope this helps.

[SEP] question_content: does that mean he was right to split up with me becasue he wasn't in love with me naymore or should he, we have tried harder? spent some tme together? [SEP] best_answer: He was right for breaking up with you because he wasn't IN love with you.  You can definitely love someone and have fallen out of love with them.  This has happened to me, so I know.  The love can be gained back, but it has to be by their choice.  They have to want it to work.  I fell back in love, but I really wanted it to work.  Hope this helps.  Don't push them, just let them be.  You know the saying, if you love someone, set them free....if they come back to you, it's meant to be....if not, they were never yours in the first place.  Good luck!!	Family & Relationships

question_title: why do a lady think that she can keep a man by having his baby and the man does not want her anymore? [SEP] question_content: my boyfriends son's mother trapped him by having the baby after telling her that he did'nt want anymore kids and she agreed to that but when he got ready to break up with her that's when she sprung it on him that she was pregnant.  and yes he used protection but he said she had sex with him while he was drunk and sleep. But he does take care of the baby, but his mistake was giving her cash. \nso if she ever files child support on him he can't prove that he helps out on a daily bases.

question_title: I am a married Baptist. I am in love with a married Catholic. How can we ever marry yet stay Catholic? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You are both married? To other people?! Are you cheating on your spouses? \n\nIf not I'm going to guess that you are married to each other or plan on marrying each other? \n\nAs far as the religions go....WOW....That's a tough one. Both are hard core and will want you to convert so one is going to have to make up their mind. If you don't want to convert you need to explain to your significant other that it's not an option and if they don't understand oh well. I love my husband but if he told me that he had converted to Catholisism and that I had to convert or else I would tell him sorry. First people you love should ask you to go against your faith and secondly no man or woman on this earth should be more important to you than God. If you believe that all you have to do is ask forgivness and that you shall recieve redemption then certain other beliefs are going to stick in your craw anyways. But hey, it's up to you...\n\n(p.s. Before I start getting hate mail folks please keep in mind that I don't dislike or hate Catholics at all nor am I anti-Catholic in any way. All the Catholics I know are cool people. The only point I'm trying to stress is that someone who is a hard core Baptist (enough to put that title in with a question, which means it's important to them) is going to have problems with the Catholic faith in general and vice versa. Wether or not he is able to get an annulment I'm not sure it wouldn't work anyhow if one person or the other is forced to convert.)	Family & Relationships

question_title: Why does IM face ooks yellow sometimes and it looks grey otherwise...Thanks...? [SEP] question_content: In my mail list, sometimes the contacts have yellow IM faces, but other times it looks grey. Why is That?

He'll make fun of me sometimes, i know hes kidding most of the time but it gets old and annoying. thats a sign of insecurity. i dont know what to do because he tries to cover it up but its obvious.\n\nim afraid to talk to him about it. i dont want him to get mad. [SEP] best_answer: Communication is the base of any good relationship. He may have insecurity problems and god knows what else, but if you are afraid to address the issue with him, how do you expect this problem to be solved? Relationships take lots of work, communication, dedication and understanding. The truth is nobody is perfect and at some point in any relationship some things need to be addressed in order to be fixed. Sometimes professional help is needed. But you need to acknowledge the problem and let the other person know. Failing to do so will make your life miserable and you will end up taking !@#$ from future people you dont have to.

[SEP] best_answer: Don't name names, but I would run an ad in the local paper stating that a woman is bent on destroying my reputation, and ask the readers to ask your side before they believe her.  This will tell the people you must be telling the truth, and she is not going to want to take it this far and should back off. I know it sounds a little out there, but if she is a trouble maker, sometimes publicity is the only way to shut them up, and you don't have to mention names to make her face beet red. You want to put your name of course, and they will know who you are talking about without you getting a lawsuit.	Family & Relationships

He says he doesnt want to complicate things and that nothing is wrong with him.  I am totally frustrated and upset - I want to have a complete relationship.

What do you think?  is it me or him? What would you do?  I  guess I should mention age ..We are in our 30's. [SEP] best_answer: Maybe he wants to wait or he is just scared of taking such a big step.  You can never see what is going to happen and he wants to be careful becuase he doesn't want to mess up what u have. Just be there for him and tell him that its okay and you'll wait for him.

question_title: There is a women at my work that I am very interested in asking out.? [SEP] question_content: We work together in the same dept. in side by side cubicles. She is single and I am seperated/divorcing. We speak all the time about outher things then work. I have not been dating or single for 14 yrs and I am not sure if I am getting the right signals from her. She smiles and stops me all the time. How do I go about asking her out with out making a fool of myself. [SEP] best_answer: Making a fool of yourself is the fun part of asking girls out.  You think they are too good for you and you think that you can't approach them and then you come up with an elaborate way to ask them and then she's like "sure."  And you are completely blown away by the fact that she is totally knows how you are stressing for days about asking her out (they have a gift dawg).\nAsk her to hang out at like happy hour then a movie and then tell her that you enjoyed your time with her and would like to spend more one-on-one time with her.  At the very least you'll boost her ego for making her realize (by you asking her out) that you think she's amazing.  At the end of the day, isn't that a great gift to a friend?	Family & Relationships

I was in that situation and my friend actually suggested that I get with her ex, because it was so obvious that we had chemistry. Sometimes girls fall so hard for guys that we become blind to others feelings though, so make SURE your friend is okay with it. But even if she isn't, if it's meant to be with the guy, it will be.

[SEP] best_answer: We should all keep our own strenghts, thats what makes us individuals.

question_title: Why do Male Child molestors get more time than Female Child Molestors? [SEP] question_content: Just from watching the news and stuff it seems like a female that has sex with a underage child will be treated reasonably different than if a male does it. To me it's just as disgusting either way. I could be worng so if you can correct me go ahead no need to be rude about it. [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately men are perceived as more aggressive, even brutal sometimes when it comes to sexual gratification. Some really sick men even have sex with the dead. Women on the other hand are seen as 'weaker' vessels? So they are given the benefit of the doubt ...maybe she was 'over powered' ! The circumstances of each case differs of course . I doubt whether such molestations from women were ever envisaged. But I agree with you its disgusting whoever does it. As the frequency of arrests mounts for women the existing laws that do not adequately address the issue would definitely have to be amended. I know there are no separate laws for men and women. But by the judges shed their personal prejudices and be bold enough to apply punishment across board evenly.	Family & Relationships

question_title: White minority? [SEP] question_content: Is it possible for a white person to be considered a minority? lets say a white person lives in an all black neighborhood (like the south side of chicago) and they never see anyone else but black people. would they be considered a minority? Has anyone ever been considered a minority like this? [SEP] best_answer: Sure, white people can be considered a minority; it just depends on the scale you're looking at.  If you're talking about the United States, you will never hear white people referred to as a minority category, even though I think I recently heard they have fallen below 50% of the population; it's just that no other ethnic group has a greater percentage.  But if you're looking at a neighborhood, or even a city or state, it is quite possible for white people to be the minority.  I'm white, and I used to live in Harlem, so I was definitely a minority.  I got called "whitey" quite often... but then maybe I asked for it, as I was training for long-distance road races at the time, running through Harlem in really short shorts and no shirt!  Anyway, I think it's a valuable experience for everyone to be put in the position of being a visible minority at least once in their life.	Society & Culture

question_title: man date women but has serious secret interest exclusively in men who are women from waist up?

But I have met people who have interests in crossdressers, transexuals, and women, but not in men.\n\nIt seems that in these situations, the men have a great attraction to women, but also have an attraction to the penis.  However, they feel no attraction to average men.  In this case, the person has to find people who are similar enough to women to clearly not be men, but who also have a penis.	Society & Culture

Never, never, never!"  :-))\n\nBut That Which Is always...IS. Throughout the day, my heart rises spontaneously in thanksgiving and gratitude, for my luck (Oh! No, no, no! That is ANOTHER question!)  :-)) For what I have been given, for all that I have, for the very good people who love me, for the incredible, sustaining beauty of the natural world.\n\nSometimes I am not sure to Whom I am praying, but my heart rises, anyway!\n\nThe only serious (the save-my-butt stuff isn't really serious, in my opinion) prayers I say are to ask for knowledge of God's will, and the power to carry it out.\n\nSometimes I toss in a request for strength, and understanding.

They were just shacking up and had alot of illegitimate kids...but seriously...read the following article.\n\nThe following is an Article published six or seven years ago in Green Egg.\n\n*We Are the Other People*\n\nby Oberon (Otter) Zell\n\n"Ding-dong!" goes the doorbell. Is it Avon calling? Or perhaps Ed McMahon with my three million dollars? No, it's Yahweh's Witlesses again, just wanting to have a nice little chat about the Bible... Boy, did they ever come to the wrong house! So we invite them in: "Enter freely and of your own will..." (Hey, it's Sunday morning, nothing much going on, why not have a little entertainment?) Diane and I amuse ourselves watching their expressions as they check out the living room: great horned owl on the back of my chair; ceremonial masks and medicine skulls of dragons and unicorns on the wall; crystals, wands, staffs, swords; lots of Goddess figures and several altars; boa constrictors draped in amorous embrace over the elkhorn; white doves sitting in the hanging planters; cats and weasels underfoot; iron dragon snorting steam atop the wood stove; posters and paintings of wizards and dinosaurs and witchy women, some proudly naked; sculptures of mythological beasties and lots more dinosaurs; warp six on the star-filled viewscreen of my computer; a five-foot model of the USS Enterprise and the skeleton of a plesiosaur hanging from the ceiling; very, very many books, most of them dealing with obviously weird subjects... To say nothing of the great horned owl perched on the back of my chair and the Unicorn grazing in the front yard. You know; early Addams Family decor. And then, of course, it being late in the morning, you can expect Morning Glory to come wandering out naked, looking for her wake-up cup of tea. Morning Glory naked is a truly impressive sight, and the Witlesses look as if she'd set titties on stun as they stand immobilised, hands clasped over their genitals. With the stage set and all the actors in place, the show is ready to begin.\n\nTheir mission, of course, is to save our heathen souls by turning us on to "The Word of the Lord"- their Bible. I guess they figure some of us just haven't heard about it yet, and we're all eagerly awaiting their joyous tidings of personal salvation through giving our rational faculties to Jesus. Every time they come around, I look forward to trying out a new riposte. Sure, it may be cruel and sadistic of me, but hey, I didn't call them up and ask them to come over; they entered at their own risk! This time should be pretty good. After letting them run off their basic rap while lovely Morning Glory serves us all hot herb tea, I innocently remark: "But none of that applies to us. We have no need for salvation because we don't have original sin. We are the Other People."\n\n"Hunh? What?" they reply eloquently. It's clear they've never heard this one before. "\n\nRight," I say. "It's all in your Bible." And I proceed to tell them the story, using their own book for reference: (Genesis 1:26) The [Elohim] said, "Let us make humanity in our own image, in the likeness of ourselves, and let them be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all the wild beasts and all the reptiles that crawl upon the earth." Elohim is a plural word, including male and female, and should properly be translated "Gods" or "Pantheon." (1: 27) The Gods created humanity in the image of themselves, In the image of the Gods they created them, Male and female they created them. (1:28) The Gods blessed them, saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and conquer it. Be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven and all living animals on the earth."\n\nNow clearly, here we are talking about the original creation of the human species: male and female. All the animals, plants, etc. hav	Society & Culture

So much more logical than NOTHING created SOMETHING.  I don't have enough faith to be an athiest. [SEP] best_answer: Great question. I am an atheist, but have never said there is "no evidence of god" there is just not enough proof for me. Also, say god is real. Then he must of just been there, so why couldn't the world?!

question_title: What is Mardi gras celebration about?  What to do on mardi gras day? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Party, party, party!!!  It is a pagan holliday where people get very drunk and act like wild animals.  It is also called Fat Tuesday.  It is the Tuesday just before Lent or Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holliday where people promise to give up something they really enjoy for 40 days till Easter.  It is most popularly celebrated in New Orleans.  There is a carnival atmosphere where people get very intoxicated in the streets of New Orleans.  Guys buy beaded necklaces and give them to girls for flashing their breasts.  \n\nFor me as a Christian, I think it is kinda sad.  I look forward to celebrating Easter as the time when Christ died for me and rose again.  I think that a devout Catholic should be ashamed of themself if they were to go out and act like this, then go to confession, followed by Ash Wednesday where they make a "sacrifice" to show how much they love Him.

question_title: Are most Atheists introverts or extroverts? [SEP] question_content: Extroverts are more people-oreintated, need company of other people to feel good and thrive on rapid communications and large crowds.  Being isolated for too long drains their energy.\n\nIntroverts are opposite, they thrive on being alone with themselves and usually are very deep thinkers.  They think everything through before saying or acting on anything.   Introverts are not anti-social, but being around people for too long drains them.\n\nI am an introvert.  I am curious to see if atheists are more one or the other? [SEP] best_answer: I'm an introvert, I don't rely on approval from others and I don't like being with people who drain me, especially people who don't put any effort into being interesting or entertaining and behave like sponges.\n\nI can enjoy being quite social and extroverted in a big way for short periods but I need my down time alone to think...I'm mostly very serious and even when I ask silly questions here it's because usually they are associated to something of deeper significance...though I do throw in a red herring just for fun every so often to annoy certain people or wind them up.

Aker, Amun, Kuk, Atum, Baba, or Nun.\nHere is your choices for the second one. Anat, Hathor, Isis, Neith, \nNut, or Ptah.\nHave fun with this one. :). And remember 10 points to who gets it right. [SEP] best_answer: Aker is an earth god who presided over the borders of the underworld.\nAmun is associated with the primordial air.\nKuk is associated with the primordial concept of darkness.\nAtum is the primal creator, associated with the sun.\nBabi is a baboon god.\nNun (also spelt Naunet or Nu) was the deification of the primordial water abyss.\n\nAnat is a war goddess.\nHathor is the personifaction of the Milky Way, often depicted as a cow.\nIsis is most famous for being the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus.\nNeith is a goddess of hunt and war.\nNut is the personification of night.\nAnd Ptah isn't a goddess at all, but the first god.\n\nSo the answer to 1 is Nun and the answer to 2 is either Anat or Neith.  But I would have to lean more towards Anat, as Neith is also considered a goddess of weaving.\nHope this answers your question!	Society & Culture

By 1844, cop showed up in print, and soon thereafter the -er suffix was added, and a policeman became a copper, one who cops or catches and arrests criminals.

question_title: was Hamlet in love with Ophelia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, I think he was, and that was why he got so upset about her not getting too close to him.  He knew he was having a tough time mentally, and that he could not be involved with her.  He probably did not realize she would commit suicide herself as a result, but then they were, after all, pretty young.  Young people have a tendency to add so much drama to things, because a given experience is new to them, however old it is to the world.  Adolescent angst is a real thing, and I suppose it's not that surprising that suicide seems to be a major sorting mechanism among the young.  Those who believe themselves unfit for life choose death.  It's only rarely a wise choice.  I won't go into what those rare circumstances might be; each must decide.  But as I say, it is very rarely wise.\n\nTo be or not to be, that is the question.  You have heard the line so many times, you can recite it without thinking. But it pays to think about it:  are you going to go ahead with your life, and make of it all you can, or are you going to label yourself a loser and throw yourself away?  \n\nBefore you decide, please listen to me about suicide:  my loved one of over 20 years chose that way out on December 16, 2005.  I'm obviously still in the process of "getting over it," to the extent I ever will.  It is the most horrible experience of my life, and Please, God, it will always be.  I don't want to tempt any fates, but I cain't hardly get worse than being in the same apartment, and unavailable to a last-minute attempt to stop him, when someone commits suicide.\n\nBut even without that; even starting with discovering the body.  Or worse, having someone just disappear down some John or Jane Doe coroner's report, the loved ones never being sure, or only being notified after it's all been in the hands of the professionals (coroner's office being just the start, of course).  It's all heartbreaking, no matter how understanding and forgiving you can be about the person who took that way out of what they felt was intolerable.\n\nBut it was not really intolerable.  He just stopped tolerating it, and I have a hard time remembering that I forgive him for that.  But even though I do, really, I am in a far worse position now, and he probably believed he was doing me a favor, taking a burden off my hands.  That's hardly ever true in a case of suicide.  It's more an excuse.	Society & Culture
question_title: Why do people kill people to prove that killing people is wrong? [SEP] question_content: The death penalty is stupid and doesn't really punish the pertrator. Wouldn't life sentence be a better option? Life would take away their freedom, where as death gives them freedom. [SEP] best_answer: Valid point, but look at it this way. The government is already spending way over budget on its prison facilities. And who has to pay for these facilities? You and I and everyone else reading this. It costs a lot of money to shelter and feed someone for 60+ years. \n\nNot that I completely agree with the death penalty, it has its faults. But where do you expect all of that money to come from?

[SEP] question_content: do you like see people and go ... gay. or is it like an observation type thing? because I think this theatre kid at my school is gay but I dont want to ask him... :*( I am new. [SEP] best_answer: You recognize a bit of yourself (if youre gay) in others, you can relate to what they are doing.  Straight folks relate to what there gay friends are like, so they might not always be as accurate.\n\nIts not just mannerisms and stereotyped behavior, its presence.	Society & Culture

question_title: why do barbershops have that blue and red circulating symbol outside? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "The modern barber pole originated in the days when bloodletting was one of the principal duties of the barber.  The two spiral ribbons painted around the pole represent the two long bandages, one twisted around the arm before bleeding, and the other used to bind is afterward.  Originally, when not in use, the pole with a bandage wound around it, so that both might be together when needed, was hung at the door as a sign.  But later, for convenience, instead of hanging out the original pole, another one was painted in imitation of it and given a permanent place on the outside of the shop.  This was the beginning of the modern barber pole."	Society & Culture
question_title: Why is it that people use profane words when they talk? And what do some of these words mean anyway? [SEP] question_content: For example, the F"-word, the B-word, the A-word, the Sh-word??? [SEP] best_answer: The individuals that use such words feel that this is the only way they can get people to understand them.  Many use it as a way of letting off steam, but all it does is give an adverse opinion of the user and sums up their capacity to communicate.  As far as their meanings, there are many but you can bet that those making use of said words do not know their exact meaning but just their twisted definition.	Society & Culture
question_title: In what states can gays and lesbians get married? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't think any state does. I think it's a federal law that they can't. Some states however can get civil unions.\n\nMy opinion is that not allowing gays and lesbians to be married is steping on our constitutional rights. The only way they can justify why they can't get married is what. Due to thier beliefs that it should only be man and woman. I'm sorry but this sounds like a religious view to me; and in the U.S. we have freedom of religion. We also have Seperation of church and state, so what is thier reason for this.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: why do they not understand that God put each of us here for a reason, and just because you dont know that reason, you think you should 'rescue' us?\nWhy are they so high on thier horse that they have to 'teach us' the right way to be? Did they never stop to think that perhaps God put US here to teach THEM?????\ntolerance and loving one another was what  Jesus taught his whole life.\nThink about it. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know...maybe they see us as a softer target for 'saving' than say a devout muslim or hindu.\n There are so many things in the bible that are conveniantly ignored by the bible-thumping folks...like the sin of eating of shellfish, the 'good' things about slavery, the not having short hair etc.\n\nThey just pick and choose what they want to follow from the bible.. and insist on trying to control our lives with their misguided morals.\n\nIt just makes me sick the way they like to quite neatly put us in the same box as murderers, pedophiles and rapists.\nBecause these criminals 'love' their victims....\nDon't you get it you narrow-minded fools....these crimes of murder, child abuse and rape all involve one consenting person and one VICTIM.\n\nGay/lesbian relationships consist of TWO CONSENTING adults, loving or having consensual sexual relations with eachother.\n\nHow could an all knowing God punish people for loving eachother.\nShouldnt God be frowning upon you these bigoted bible-thumpers for not loving their neighbours?

question_title: If really there is God, why not God click His hand to combine all religion to give peace a chance? [SEP] question_content: How come we say a loving God if He leave His people killing each other ... leaving some people to starve while others have too much to waste. What God's power for? Is God a sadist? Then religion say ... it's people's fault of having no faith in God! Blessed are the poor & suffering for they have place in heaven. A graceful exit without any basis by moving social feeling and consolation. \n-\nNow, is it a choice to be born in Africa ... or in the rich countries? The answer is nope! Is it a choice to be a christian or muslim? Nope! Every one has no religion from our mother womb. It so happened in the environment of our upbringing. It's unimaginable to become a Pope if one was born from the hinterland of Afghanistan. And to be Osama, if one is born from pius christian family in Rome. [SEP] best_answer: God doesn't leave people to kill each other, unless they choose to.  God did not make man a robot but a creature who can choose right or wrong.  He doesn't want people to starve but many starving nations do not believe in Him, nor call on Him for intervention.  However, missionaries are going into those places and doing a good work.  Others who are Christians and being tortured are victims of an evil power over them in the form of govt.  They are martyrs for their faith.  Many of us have prayed for our brothers and sisters in Sudan for years and we see our prayers answered.  Other Christians have gone in and rescued those being tortured as slaves by the govt.  They are receiving help.  It doesn't matter where you are born, you can always chose to believe in God.  God knows us even before we are designed in our mother's womb.  I came from a non-christian home but I chose to follow after Him, seek Him, serve Him.  I am not exempt from trials, persecution and sorrows of life but I have divine joy and peace because of the hope He brings me.  It is all a matter of faith.  Either believe or not believe.  I'm one who says there are vast rewards to having faith where there is otherwise total hopelessness.  Press on!	Society & Culture

It's a reflection of their own insecurity or feelings of worth, of feeling "loveable" and you can't change that no matter how hard you try.	Society & Culture
question_title: what kind of body will the raptured people have in Jesus' Millenium reign on earth? Is it a glorified body? [SEP] question_content: What about those not raptured but saved during the Tribulaton--what kind of body will they have--any different?? Bible verses?? [SEP] best_answer: The raptured and resurrected saints will be given their own bodies, but our bodies will be perfected.  (1 Cor. 15:42-45 and 50-56.)\n\nThose who are saved during the Tribulation, and live through it, will keep their bodies and live for at least 1,000 years. A wicked person born after the Tribulation (during the Millenial Reign) will die before they're 100 years old.  See Isaiah 65:20.\n\nThose who die during the Tribulation, after having been saved, will also have their own perfected human bodies.\n\nThere are several references to the "perfected body" teaching, but our primary example is ALWAYS Jesus Christ.  We are taught our resurrection will be the same as His; we also know He was resurrected bodily and looked the same as He did during life.  The account of the Transfiguration (before His death) is a good example; read also the account of His appearance to Thomas.\n\nI hope this helps.  Peace.	Society & Culture

question_title: in todays society how is the expectations  and responsibilies of a women different from a few decades ago? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Expectations are higher.

question_title: did you hear about that study that did a double blind test on the effectiveness of prayer on heart surgery? [SEP] question_content: patients. it found that people who were prayed for did no better then people who weren't. but oddly enough people who were prayed for and then told that they were prayed for did worse. [SEP] best_answer: An interesting study. I think there might have been an element of stress with the people who knew they would be prayed for - like performance anxiety - and stress can adversely affect heart patients. \n\nThe study you refer to was about church groups praying for strangers in hospitals, and there's a general consensus that this type of prayer has no effect whatsoever. But there seems to be a psychological benefit in well wishes from people we know - like a virtual hug - and most of us respond well to that.	Society & Culture
question_title: Is there a group of Catholics that wear clothing that looks a little like the KKK attire? [SEP] question_content: I mean no offense by this question, as obviously KKK people are intolerant and I think they are intolerant of Catholics too, so I'm not implying that Catholics are intolerant of course.\n\nBut I did see some Catholic pictures and these people were wearing this clothes that looked very similar to the KKK sheets.  Who are they and why do they wear those? [SEP] best_answer: I don't remember the reason why the robes which look similar to ones worn by the KKK are use, although I am 90% sure it is to ensure the modesty of the pious. \n\nThose who do this live in spain, the robes are worn during holy week.  They are NOT connected to the KKK at all.	Society & Culture

question_title: Christians, what do you think about these Atheists comments? [SEP] question_content: Reading the Bible is the fastest way out of believing in god. \n\nAthiesim tends to come through STUDY and THOUGHT, rather than a BLIND BELIEF system.\n\n\n  Atheists question what they don't understand, instead of blindly following others like sheep.  \n\nUs Atheists actually take time to research our beliefs instead of allowing someone in a church or anywhere else to tell us what to believe \n\nmost christians are only told about the happy fluffy benevolent god. While us atheists have looked at it ourselves and seen god for what he relay is a violent, racist, sexist, petty, jealous fictional character. Say no to jesus \n\nMost athiests have read their way out of xtianity. SO they obvioulsy know more about the bible than the typical xtian, who hasnt ever read thier bible all the way through even once, let alone the ten times or so I have. [SEP] best_answer: We need Atheists to increase the faith of Christians.	Society & Culture
question_title: I do not understand how Muslims think the New Testament is corrupted but some believe some of it? [SEP] question_content: I read Muslims say the New Testament is corrupted, but then they also say that Christians have lost the way: Jesus said "I am the way, the truth and the life": notice the I AM there.  So how have Christians lost the way, and Why would God allow his word to be corrupted; or do you mean that it is misinterpreted, so much of it is clear that it could not be misinterpreted.  There is large agreement between Jews and Christians on the Old Testament, is this also true for Muslims; I think it is because a Muslim asked me if I read the book Ezekiel, so I went back and re-read it.  And I am sure they believe in the accuracy of Genesis because much of it is copied out in the Quran, even more detail is given on some stories of Genesis, which may be inaccurate details.\n\nSolution: we need to see how much we agree at least.  There are many misunderstanding on ethical values.  I agree for instance that it is wrong to make an image of the prophets, or anything; but not all Christians understand that [SEP] best_answer: I believe the content of New Testament is the revelations from Allah to us\n\nRevelation 22:7,10,13,19 \n“Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.” \nHe said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand"\n"I am the Alef and the Tav, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."\n "If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book. "\nالأصحَاحُ الْحَادِي وَالْعِشْرُونَ\n«هَا أَنَا آتِي سَرِيعًا. طُوبَى لِمَنْ يَحْفَظُ أَقْوَالَ نُبُوَّةِ هذَا الْكِتَابِ»\nوَقَالَ لِي:«لاَ تَخْتِمْ عَلَى أَقْوَالِ نُبُوَّةِ هذَا الْكِتَابِ، لأَنَّ الْوَقْتَ قَرِيبٌ.\nأَنَا الأَلِفُ وَالْيَاءُ، الْبِدَايَةُ وَالنِّهَايَةُ، الأَوَّلُ وَالآخِرُ».\nوَإِنْ كَانَ أَحَدٌ يَحْذِفُ مِنْ أَقْوَالِ كِتَابِ هذِهِ النُّبُوَّةِ، يَحْذِفُ اللهُ نَصِيبَهُ مِنْ سِفْرِ الْحَيَاةِ، وَمِنَ الْمَدِينَةِ الْمُقَدَّسَةِ، وَمِنَ الْمَكْتُوبِ فِي هذَا الْكِتَابِ.\nFor Christians, Don't you ever doubt the Revelation of Allah written in your Bible eventhough you are insulted for trusting it.

question_title: Why do people believe in a afterlife now more than any time in history? [SEP] question_content: I was watching a show on the science channel last night that was studying near death experiences.\n\nBut they were saying more people now than any other time in history believe in the afterlife.\n\nWhy do you think this is considering we live during the technological age and know so must about everything? [SEP] best_answer: That is the misconception. Since the beginning of time people have always believed in the after life. Now, we are just more free to express. In ancient times some countrys considered it to be forbidden to speak of any such thing. Some felt if u spoke of the after life u were possessed or a witch or just 2 fries short of a happy meal. Some believe it just gives others something to believe in and makes losing someone easier to deal with. I personally believe that we all have a place to go to whether it be heaven or hell.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you go strictly by one-man-one woman -- no.\nIn the overall human population, women outnumber men by a small percentage (about 52% to 48%).  That leaves a few million women out in the cold when it comes to husbands.\n\nThe higher ratio of women to men has been around ever since there have been humans (we all start out as female after conception, it takes a specific genetic and hormonal "kick" to make a male) -- it's one reason plural marriage (polygamy) was the rule in ancient cultures, it allowed all the women in a social group to have husbands.

If I had made a stink out of it and got the police involved, I more than likely would have been subjected to it again.

If we did that to black it would be considered racist.  What is the purpose of BET (Black Entertainment Television)?  If we had a WET (White Entertainment Television) channel, it would be racist.....what a crock. [SEP] best_answer: Many African Americans are prejudiced.  I lived in Cincinnati for three years and noticed a disturbing trend of many black people blaming their problems on white people.  \n\nI agree with what you stated about there being all types of "black-oriented" channels and clubs that specifically target, and refer to, their people; this is a great example of a double standard.  I have noticed the same thing with other races having exclusitivity in regards to organizations: Asian and Hispanic television stations and social clubs for example. If there was anything that referred to white people, it would definitely be considered racist.  We have the liberal, PC-minded spineless masses to thank for not standing up for OUR rights. Amen!

Assuming that some will agree that prostitution is a sin which can be forgiven, then how is it then that gay relations, be an unforgivable sin?  Would not God love all his children without prejudice?

The media, who is always looking for short cuts and not the whole story, calls the participants Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThe conflict is about whether the British territory (probably the wrong word) of Northern Ireland should remain British or should become part of Ireland. \n\nThe majority of people in Ireland are Catholics. The majority of people in England and Northern Ireland are Protestants. There are actually Catholics and Protestants on either side.\n\nThe terrorists on either side if the issue are not Christian in any sense of the word.\n\nWith love in Christ.	Society & Culture

question_title: Should we not want DEMOCRACY IN HEAVEN? [SEP] question_content: In the bible god has ruled and lost control of mankind many times than he acts out by changing languages ( TOWER OF BABEL ), mass murder ( THE FLOOD )  to control mankind.\n NO ONE PERSON  ( GOD )SHOULD HOLD ALL POWER, [SEP] best_answer: God didn't lose control.  He made people able to choose right or wrong.  Being people, we often choose wrong.  \n\nAlso, there's about a million reasons why God should be in charge: he made everything, he knows everything, he is perfectly just, he's all-powerful, he's all-present, he's outside of time (so he never runs out of time), and besides all this, he loves us!\n\nThe reason that he changed the languages at the tower of babel and wiped out the earth's population during the flood is that he is just and fair.  See, the hard thing to understand is that God deserves to be the Ruler over everything, including us, and when we rebel against him, we are the ones who are wrong.  That's the definition of sin-- rebellion against God.  So because the people building the tower of babel and all the people on earth(except for Noah) were rebelling against God, God in his infinate justice punished them, because justice demanded it, and he had the right to do so.\n\nIt's hard for us to understand, especially because we innately know that a person would be wrong to wipe out the world's poplulation or punish people for trying to userp them.  But because God is God, he's right to do so.\n\nIn fact, we all sin, and the just punishment for sin is eternal separation from God (otherwise known as hell).  No person on earth could possibly earn their way to heaven, because the requirenment for getting into heaven is perfection, which none of us has ever, or can ever, acheive.  So if God is just, he should punish us with eternal separation from him.  However, God also loves us, and he wants to spend eternity with us in heaven.  So, God came up with a plan, The perfect plan.\n\nHe sent his son, Jesus Christ, down to earth, to be born in a stable in Bethlahem.  Jesus is the only person who ever lived his entire life without sinning once.  He never sinned because not only is he 100% man, but he is also 100% God AT THE SAME TIME.  During his 33 years on earth, Jesus proved that he was God's son, and the savior of the world by preforming miracles and fulfulling thousands of prophecies that were given to the Jewish people hundreds and thousands of years before he was born.\n\nAfter living perfectly for 33 years on earth, Jesus came into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, knowing that he would be put to death that Friday.  He could have stayed away from Jerusalem, or called angels down to stop his execution at any time, but he didn't.  He willingly gave his life because he knew that his death was part of God's plan.  Jesus was to live a perfect life, then die on the cross as punishment for the sins of every person who ever lived.  Jesus was whipped within an inch of his life, mocked, spit upon, forced to carry a wooden cross up to the hill where he was crucified on it, pierced by nails in his hands and feet, finally hung on a cross, where he was taunted and ridiculed until he died.  But far worse than the physical torture, Jesus, who had never sinned, took on all of the sins that you and I and the human race have ever committed.  He had to feel the guilt and shame of things he had never done, and he had to be separated from God.   Finally, Jesus died.  Jesus did all of this willingly for you, and he would have done it even if you were the only person on earth.  He loved you so much that he would rather die this horrible death than go through eternity without you.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there!  Jesus was laid in a tomb, where he stayed for three days, but on the third day, he came back to life!  This is the real meaning of Easter! After rising from the dead, he stayed on earth for forty days and appeared to more than 500 of his followers before ascending to heaven.\n\nIf you don't wake up tomorrow, do you know for sure where you're going?  Because of Jesus' sacrifice, your sins can be forgiven and you can be made right with God, know for sure that you will go to heaven when you die, and start 	Society & Culture

If you could prove something scientifically it would be a state of fact or otherwise it would be an opinion. The definition of a belief is that it cannot be proven. I propose you let those know about your religious experiances who want to listen to you about them. The others are not ready to do so and thus just let them be.	Society & Culture

question_title: If we want black and white to get along better should we stop making chess sets? [SEP] question_content: Are just pawns in the Man's game?\nWhat kind of horsey moves like that?\nWhich is more powerful the rook or the castle? [SEP] best_answer: When I was little I had a chess game with bright yellow and lime-green pieces lol!! Now I wonder, was it designed by aliens??? \n\nDid you know chess is the oldest skill game in the world. It was first played in China, Persia and India. The Arabs invasions to Persia and then Spain helped spread the game accross Europe. \n\nEuropeans gave chess pieces the names we know today. \nThe game represents the way common people and nobles lived in midieval times.\n\nThe Pawns represent laborers. \n\nI think in our world we still have 'pawns', think about the mulit-million dollar companies outsourcing to take advantage of cheap labor in other countries. \n\nAre pawns only in men's games? well, I don't quite know how to answer that question... but if we take a look at mother nature you can find that bees have 'pawns' (or the worker bees) and the life of bees are somewhat structured like this midieval game, so to answer your question I guess it all depends on the insect or the animal you are studying... including humans lol!!\n\nThe castle piece on a chess board is the home, or the refuge, just as it was a home in medieval times. In chess, each side has two castles, or rooks, as they are sometimes called. \nSo which is more powefull the rook or the castle? neither it is the same piece with a different name\n\nThe knight on a chess board represents the professional soldier of medieval times whose job it was to protect persons of rank.\n\nI don't think a regular horse would move in an 'L' but I always imagined that the horse was jumping...\n\nInteresting your comparison between racial 'wars' and chess wars. However, I don't think eliminating this game from the shelves would help in the hostility between races.\n\nHere is what the other pieces represent:\n\nThere is a bishop in the game of chess, who represents the church\n\nThe queen is the only piece on the board during a chess game that represents a woman, and she is the most powerful piece of the game.\n\nThe king is the tallest piece on the board, and is as well defended on the chessboard as in medieval life.

If we were god's children, we wouldn't think up things like semi-automatic weapons, chemical weapons, or atomic bombs.  If you want to get biblical, I believe we are Adam's children.  Genesis says that Adam and Eve deliberately disobeyed god and chose to go their own way.  When they did that, they ceased being god's children and became independent of god. I think that makes more sense, just for the plain fact of how we're living nowadays. \n\nSo to answer your question, no, I don't think this Jesus fellow was like you.	Society & Culture

question_title: Do you honestly believe that if illegals were to be given amnesty that>? [SEP] question_content: the way we live and our culture would come to an end.They are already here.So any effects that you would feel,you have already been feeling. [SEP] best_answer: The problem is that the legalization elements have been all entwined in the guest worker program which is a really bad program.  One Senator ran projections of how many poor immigrants would come here under the program (on TOP of the current rate of immigration and on TOP of the current illegal immigrants) and he came up with 185 million to 217 million poor immigrants in the next 20 years.  Even California Senators Boxer and Feinstein who have been pushing for legalization as their main goal in the program voted against this element of the program. (They lost.)\n\nCan  your school and neighborhood fit and support that many poor immigrants?  Mine can't. Do you see that many jobs around? I don't.  This is a big business idea to keep wages depressed for unskilled and semi skilled labor into the indefinite future.\n\nIf the border is truly secured, I want to deport felons and want illegal immigrants to actively start learning English as a condition of legalization.  However, as you say, they are already here.  The problem is that if you say you want legalization people now say 'I want the guest worker program' and most of them don't have a clue what is in it.\n\nIf there is a way to frame the bill during conference into qualified illegal legalization plus MAJOR border security, I would be in favor of it.  To tell the truth, though, I'd rather have no bill at all than the Senate Bill in its current form.	Politics & Government

question_title: What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching. Knowing how to take the test is more important, under this system, than knowing what is on it. Further, the act has been severely underfunded. The act requires more qualified teachers (aka ones with more education), but more education means higher pay, which is something many school districts can't do.\n\nI think more importantly than any of those problems, there's the issue of how to measure improvement. Under the act each class is compared to the previous class, meaning this year's 2nd grade is compared to last year's 2nd grade. Now, obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair. People don't like to admit it, but some people have different base levels of intelligence. Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably, but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is, on average, not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of. Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers (comparing last year's 2nd grade scores to this year's 3rd grade scores). That is obviously the better way to do it, but making the switch is going to cost money, something the act has failed to provide.	Politics & Government

question_title: who are the biggest whiners of them all? [SEP] question_content: hippies?  democrats? [SEP] best_answer: I would say hippies, but on the grand scale it is the Democrats. They all seemed to like The Patriot Act when it first came out after 9/11 and then as soon as there started to be questions and a little bit of an uproar, the Democrats turned their backs on it and started to complain about it. But even while they only whined they never came out with a counter bill or proposal to The Patriot Act. If they disliked the Patriot Act so much then why not come up with their own plan to secure the US. Sure, Bush might not have done the most wonderful job but at least he did something. The Democrats after almost 6 years after 9/11 has announced that they are drawing up a plan to secure the US. That's very nice but where were they 6 years ago? It's time they stop whining and actually think before they jump on the "let's all hate Bush" bandwagon.	Politics & Government

I mean i pay as much taxaes as any other american and recieve less benefits. So why is it that my being here is such  a problem for so many people. [SEP] best_answer: It doesn't matter where you go in the world most immigrants are treated the same, people don't know who else to blame when the there country isn't doing so well. And most immigrants are prepared to work and study really hard and some people are jealous when they see immigrants doing really well.	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the state of New York the age of consent is 17, and has been for a number of years. Which just means that it is legal for a 17-year old to be sexually active.\n\nBut, in New York you still have to be 18 to be considered an adult. This did not change to 17. You need to be 18 to vote, purchase tabacco, serve your country, obtain credit without a co-signer, and live on your own without obtaining an emmancipation.\n\nBut, you can be tried as an adult before you turn 18. So long as the court feel that you were acting as an adult when you committed the crime.\n\nHope this answers your question.	Politics & Government

question_title: Can a president be vice president after two terms in office? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: NO HE CANNOT.  \n\nThe Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution reads:\n\n"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."\n\nNow, it may not be as cut-and-dried as it looks.  The 25th Amendment says that a 2-term President ineligible to be *elected* again ... but it doesn't explicitely say that he is inelligible to *be* President again (i.e. if he were in the line of succession).  So he may not be disqualified from being Vice-President.  However, most constitutional scholars agree that the intent is to disqualify a third-term President by any means.  It is amazing to me that people who draft Amendments don't fix the wording so these things are completely unambiguous.\n\nInteresting Trivia:  Before the 12th Amendment (1804), the Vice-President was the second-place finisher in the Presidential election ... so the President and Vice-President were invariably from opposite parties.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't know if he will, but he shouldn't pull out until Iraq is ready.  Like it or not, people die in war.  The truth is that the casualties of this war are miniscule compare to vietnam which took over 700 Americans on average each day.\n\nThe United States is not the conquering nation that it is portrayed to be in the media.  If we were we would own Japan, half of Germany, and we would still have the panama canal.  We actually have a history of rescuing the people of countries from dictators.  Japan was under an Emperor and in five years after WWII we unilaterally helped the people form a democratic government run by the people of Japan. West Germany took longer (30 years) because we chose to work with the UN, but we formed a democracy there too and then left.    There are many more problems to deal with in Iraq than in Japan or Germany.  We are actually getting things done quickly in Iraq despite enormous difficulties caused by warring sects and the restrictions of the religion of Islam.	Politics & Government

We are baffled. An abortion after birth has occurred sounds a lot like murder to us and my daghter was told that this person still is teaching. Any answers? [SEP] best_answer: PRINCETON, N.J. -- April 1999 -- More than 100 protesters denounced Princeton University on Saturday for hiring a philosopher whose extreme views include allowing parents to end the lives of their severely disabled infants. \n\n"Nazi Germany did the same thing to the disabled, judging their lives not worth living. We object to that," said John Scaturro, 49, who protested near the Ivy League school along with his wife and young daughter. \n\nUniversity officials stood by the appointment of Peter Singer, a professor whose academic work they say will contribute to scholarship and ethics debates at Princeton. \n\nSinger, a professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, was appointed last year to the Ira W. DeCamp Professorship of Bioethics at the university's Center for Human Values. He is to begin work in July. \n\nThe 52-year-old academic is widely considered the father of the international animal rights movement yet has argued parents should have the right to euthanize newborn children who have severe handicaps. \n\nIn his books, Singer has said that children less than one month old have no human consciousness and do not have the same rights as others. \n\n"Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person," he wrote in one book. "Sometimes it is not wrong at all." \n\nHis appointment at Princeton has drawn fierce opposition from pro-life groups, the disabled and others.	Politics & Government

question_title: Are you think human right is observed in Iran? [SEP] question_content: What is the human right for iranian?Are you think human right is observed in Iran [SEP] best_answer: No religious state is observant of human rights.  The rights of humans as human beings begins with separating religion from the state.  People cannot be forced to participate in or contribute to a religion that they do not believe in, and cannot be prevented from practicing a religion that they believe in.  When the state demands that all its people practice a religion and forbids any other, it not only is violating human rights, but is totalitarian and dictatorial.\n\nThat is why the US Constitution's list of things that are forbidden to the government begins right away with "Congress shall pass no law establishing a religion, nor prohibit the free exercises thereof."\n\nOther human rights that a government is wrong to prohibit include but are not limited to: freedom of speech, of the press, of peaceable assembly, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances.\n\nYou will find more information on the rights of humans here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights\n\nI don't think Iran meets the criteria for a state that recognizes human rights, and I don't think that it recognizes that it doesn't.

question_title: Why do non-smokers want to be around smokers, just to have it banned in clubs and pool halls???? [SEP] question_content: In the Chicagoland area it is a ban in nightclubs, bars, pool halls and every where else that smokers goto to have fun. Its the same in Madison, Wis. There is a smoking ban just about everywhere you go. If you are a non-smoker then dont frequent places where smokers are and vice-versa for smokers. Everyone has the right to smoke if they want. They say smoking causes second hand Canser, well if that is so then seeing people eat to much causes eye canser. You all know what I mean. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think that smoking should be banned in bars and in clubs. If they are banning things that are bad for you they wouldn't be able to drink there either. I think that if you are so health oriented you shouldn't be in the bar so if you don't want to be around smokers don't go in the bar. Drinking and smoking go hand in hand and some people that drink like to smoke only when they drink. I think it should be up to the bar owner. If the waitresses don't like being around it , get another job at a bar that doesn't allow smoking.	Politics & Government

question_title: Did you know One Million Sex Crimes Committed by Illegal aliens in the United States-? [SEP] question_content: Would you like to know about the dark side of Illegal Immigrants in the United States ? \nhttp://www.drdsk.com/articles.html#ImportingViolence\nAfter conducting a 12 month in-depth study of illegal immigrants who committed sex crimes and murders for the time period of January 1999 through April 2006 , it is clear that the U.S. public faces a dangerous threat from sex predators who cross the U.S. borders illegally. \n\nThere were 1500 cases analyzed in depth. They included: serial rapes, serial murders, sexual homicides, and child molestation committed by illegal immigrants. Police reports, public records, interviews with police, and media accounts were all included. Offenders were located in 36 states, but it is clear, that the most of the offenders were located in states with the highest numbers of illegal immigrants. California was number one, followed by Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, New York, and Florida. How many are here for a better life and how many are not? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not at all shocked. In fact, I've seen it happening in my area for many years. Illegal hispanic men 'dating' and impregnating girls from the age of ten on up. Not to mention that I've heard many of them say that any unescorted female going about her business was 'asking for it'.  But things are changing a little around here. Every pregnant girl under the age of sixteen is referred to the DA as a rape victim and perpetrators are getting an average of five years in prison. I'm glad something is being done to stop this.\n\nSome of the ones going to prison did not impregnate the girl. Many of the idiots freely admit to having sex with underage girls because they think nothing will be done.\n\nCrazybird's answer reminded me of something my ex-husband told me. He is from a small village in Mexico. He said that when a man wanted to find a wife (if he couldn't find one at home) he and his friends would go to a neighboring village and take a woman. They would bring her back and force the 'marriage' on her. Her family would not object because they considered it to be too late to do anything about it.	Politics & Government

question_title: Do illegal immigrants get all these benefits that people claim they do? [SEP] question_content: If thats the case, where do I turn in my citizenship and join the rich? How ignorant can one be to believe that they get all of these claimed benefits?  Shame on you and your lies. [SEP] best_answer: Illegal immigrants -- or legal foreign tourists for that matter -- get Constitutional guarantees (Bill of Rights) like anyone else in the USA -- unless Pres. George W. Bush has designated them "enemy combatants".\n\nThey do not get very many "benefits" of financial value, except emergency health care (mainly: traffic accidents and childbirth). Their children born in the USA are US citizens, and the US Supeme Court held, particuarly with respect to education -- free schooling -- that they cannot be denied benefits based on their parents' status. Which makes sense apart from the Constitutional issue because it would mean raising a generation of illiterate citizens!\n\nParents of babies born in the USA get no benefit (other than as above) from that fact -- they can be and are deported. In one case (you can Google "Myrna Dick") a judge held that a woman alleged to be in the US illegally (she had been brought to the USA from Mexico at age 9 and married an American and was pregnant) could not be deported until after her baby was born. A good -- but charitable -- holding I think; difficult to justify on the grounds given (that the "fetus" is American). But it delighted some anti-abortion activists.	Politics & Government

I think everyone should have the same rights and I am sick of hearing how they think they have less rights when they actually have MORE.  They will get a job even if less qualified and I have seen first hand how they can sit around and do nothing and cannot be fired, by law, because company would be in trouble if they fired them.

question_title: From oregon to cali? [SEP] question_content: I was in a accident on the I-5 in oregon. My wife fell asleep at the wheel. Now i got rushed to the er because i had glass all over my face, the nurses cleaned me up and said i was good to go and checked me out, I came home and found a piece of glass still lodged in my head, and another still in my lip now my question is do i have grounds for a lawsuit against the hospital for not removing the glass from my head, btw the glass is located just above my eye, and in the inside of my lip that was the most horrible day of my life. and whats worse is that they just didnt even fix me now i am being charged 500 dollars for the doctor in san diego to take that out, because my insurance doesnt cover it. so i am just curious because i feel that the first hospital should cover my bill for not doing their job. [SEP] best_answer: Have the hospital submit the bill to your auto insurance carrier (your wife's if it's different). It is still the same accident. And while you could sue the hospital for not getting the glass out I'm fairly sure you wouldn't win. Think about it - your face was covered in blood and glass is clear. They probably couldn't see the glass for the blood and swelling. Just be glad that enough people can pay for health care and insurance (you included if you pay for these things) so that there was someone available to take you to the hospital, check your injuries and then a hospital with a doctor on staff who could treat your injuries. Not every country has such care. \n\nI'm not an advocate of biting the hand that feeds you - on in this case, the hand that treated you.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: OK Check this out, 4 year scholarships are for some unknown reason hard to get, probably because everyone applies for them right out of high school and because of that they can raise their standards to whatever they want.\n\n2 and 3 year scholarships are given out by the PMS (professor of Military Science) a LTC at each school.  So go to college, take the first year ROTC classes and you WILL get a 3 year scholarship.\n\nIf you are in it for the money you can do what I did and enlist in the National Guard and get a 2 year scholarship in the SMP Program (simultaneous membership program).  There is a chance you will deploy during the first 2 years but when you become a Scholarship Cadet you can not be deployed but the gives you more college money than the 3 year scholarship (or did when I went to school)	Politics & Government
question_title: Jail Time?? [SEP] question_content: Im due anytime now and the father of this baby is in trouble with the law. 2 weeks ago he saw a man he was having problems with walking down the street, he stops the truck, grabs him by the back of his shirt and starts going no more than 20mph. He lets go of the mans shirt and the man is holding onto his arm. Finally he grabs onto the bed of the truck. The father of my baby slams on the breaks and makes the man loose his grip, he falls to the ground and the father of my baby drives on and runs over his legs (accidently) with the back tire. He has had around 10- 15 assaults in the past 8 years. This charge is Assault with a deadly weapon Inflict serious injury. The charge is a felony now. I guess where he has had so many. My question is, what do you think he will get? I live in the state of NC, House arrest? Jail time? Probabtion? Im so worried Thanks Ya'll [SEP] best_answer: No, not jail time, PRISON TIME.  Felonies with priors, especially violent prior, also may be considered in most states with enhanced sentencing.  In other words, they can add years to a sentence for alleging their priors, same type crimes, and frequency of crimes.  \n\nBasically, the dad is a REPEAT OFFENDER and will be subject to the court designating it as aggravated assault with multiple priors.  \n\nI am sorry to say, dad is looking at a few years in the State Penitentiary, not just local county jail. Good luck with the baby and I hope things work out well for you both.	Politics & Government

question_title: Do you think globalization is at risk as the West has second thoughts? [SEP] question_content: I saw today that Democrats are saying they might need to 'revisit' the idea of free trade agreements, and I know I sure no longer think globalism is an automatic good, as I had assumed it to be.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nhttp://www.globalenvision.org/library/8/1266/1/ [SEP] best_answer: The reality is that globalization is a positive for all players involved.  Right now, the rich countries are enjoying all the benefits without taking any of the risks and globablization does not benefit every single person anyway.  The concept is that if country A can make everything cheaper than country B, both countries can benefit by letting each do what it does best.  A may pay more to B for some things than they could make it themselves for, but A will make more money by selling other products to B.  B makes money, both by selling its goods and by purchasing A's products.  The down side is that each country must focus on its specialty and re-deploy resources from industries where it doesn't have a significant advantage.  That means that you really shouldn't be making clothes or growing wheat in N. America or Europe.  That is something that can be done better in S. America and Africa, freeing up American and European capital and labor to focus on industries where it has an overwhelming advantage.  But if you are a farmer or work in a clothing factory, you probably see if differently.	Politics & Government

That will be from Iran's Hamas, next will be freighters in all of the US shipping ports having nukes in lead shielded boxes in the fuel oil tanks of merchant ships. That will effectively take the US completely out of it in the first 30mins of WW3 Now after that North Korea will take South Korea and China will take Japan and as much of Russia as possible. Europe will wisely sue for peace with China as the new World Super power. After things calm down a bit negotiations between the EU and China will take place. The former US will be divided up between the two based upon the premise that France will not nuke what is left. During these negotiations the EU and China will also plan a lightning take over of the middle east which will also be divided up between the two powers. When all is said and done there will be peace and technological progress unheard of before.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why is the president in Washington D.C and not in any other city? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The President's Residence (first called the White House by Teddy Roosevelt) was placed in Washington, D.C. because of a deal made when the US was very young...\n\nAs I understand it, originally the two major candidates for the Capitol City of the new Republic were Philadelphia (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) and New York City (which was - and is - our largest city) - both in the North. At the same time, there was a problem concerning the war debts the Thirteen States had (remember, they considered themselves 13 COUNTRIES back then). So a deal was struck: in exchange for the rich states allowing national "assumption" of the war debt (and so helping the poorer states out), they would move the Capitol to a (then) brand new location in the South, on the Potomac River.

question_title: are bail bondsmen archaic and should they be eliminated from the criminal justice system? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think we need them because most people that use them have to put up most of what they own to get out of jail and if the person want to try and flee the bail bondsmen have bounty hunters that will go after them at no cost to the tax payers,  it is less of a problem the police are over worked and short handed as it is so it can be hard for them to go after someone not that the don't try.  but it helps out the police because there are people actively hunting the guy that fled.  Most officers that recover a fugitive end up not knowing they have the person until they check there id with dispatch.  so it is a great help in recovering people that have fled.  Also by being able to bail out of jail a person is better able to actively work on there case.	Politics & Government

question_title: In a legal case, say, A Company V. B Corp.,does that imply A wins the case? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The order of the parties in case reporting is quite a complex question.\nUsually for the trial level case the party listed first if the party bringing a legal motion and the party listed second is the one defending.\n\nThe same is often true for the appeal level cases, The party who lost on the trial level and is now bringing a motion to appeal, is listed first. This leads to interesting namings:\nSay A sued B (case is called A v. B)\nSay A won and B appealed the case to the Court of Appeals -- now the case is called B v. A. \nSay the court of appeals reversed and held that B wins. Now A appeals the case to the Supreme court -- now the case is A v. B again.\n\nHowever there are weird cases -- when the party that won appeals the case (say because they think that the damages are inadequate)\nOr when both parties appeal the decision.\n\nIn cases like this each court has it's own policies.

And for you ultra-conservative narrow-minded idiots get a life. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think the government needs to be in the business of telling people how to rear their children.....or educating them, for that matter.  I believe that is one reason our public (government run) schools are so bad today.  The other reason is that people do not know how to discipline their babies.  They either them them run wild or they yell at the to shut the f**k up. This is beginning to really get out of hand when children are having babies.  The fathers are many times no where around.   Who suffers?  The child.\n\nThe elderly pay into the medicare system their whole life and when they need help caring for themselves, we "shelve" them in a nursing home.  Some, but not all,  of these places are nasty and the staff is mean.  A senior either has to be wealthy and pay for private care, have excellent long term care insurance, or apply for medicare.  I have never understood why we treat our elderly worse than animals.\n\n\n\n\nArmygirl91--remember you will be old one day.	Politics & Government

And, well if everyone knows that it was fake, why even do it?  Are we watching these things for entertainment value, like pro wrestling? [SEP] best_answer: Bush is very effective at this.  You can only go to his functions if you agree with and worship him.  Everyone gets background checks months in advance.  He has a script to read and every person in the audience who gets to ask a question has their part of the script.  Bush can't think on his feet or at all really, so he would never be able to answer somebody's question if he didn't already have the correct Public Relations answer.  \n\nOther elected officials do this somewhat, but not to the same level as Bush.

question_title: Tax cuts for the 'Rich'? [SEP] question_content: Can anyone show me the 'tax cut for the rich' that all the liberals seem to talk about all the time?\n\nCan any of you liberals show me the specifics of the tax cut?  Or do you just say it because you think it sounds good? [SEP] best_answer: Example 1:  Capital Gains Tax cut.\n\nCapital Gains tax was cut by republicans from 27 percent to 15 percent.  The capital gains tax is a tax that you pay on a certain type of investment income called a "Capital Gain" an example of a capital gain is the profit you make when you buy stock and it goes up in value and then you sell it.  Capital Gains is one type of income that is not made by working.  \n\nCapital Gains taxes are paid by people who make lots of money on capital invetments, by definition they must make more than they lose on their other capital investments in order to pay the tax.  Capital Gains taxes are not placed on retirement investment such as 401K with a few exceptions.\n\nMost middle class people make a tiny percent of their income through capital gains, this is because most middle class people ahve their stock in a retirement account which doesnt pay capital gains.  Most "RICH" people have already maxed out their retirement acocunt contributions and make a much larger share of their income on capital gains.  \n\nSo when there is a capital gains tax cut, the Rich benefit the most.  Their investment income (that they make from NOT WORKING) is now taxed at a much lower rate than most americans WORKING income, including their own.  Many rich people have also figured out a way to turn their regular income into Capital Gains income through creative (but not illegal) accounting, so they are also getting a tax cut on their normal income. \n\nThis is an example of a TAX CUT FOR THE RICH.  Massive tax cut for the rich, hardly anything for middle class.\n\nExample 2:  Dividend Tax Cut\n\nCongress passed a Dividend Tax cut this year, reducing the tax rate on another type of investment income (a type of income that doesnt involve WORK), where people who own shares of stock and other assets receive cash payments for each share they own.  Repulbicans slashed the top divided rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.  This is now much lower than the income tax rate that the same people would pay on their income if they worked for it.\n\nAgain, regular people don't own enough stock to get very many dvidents.  Througought my entire life, I think I've made about 1000 dollars on dividends.  THE RICH benefit greatly from these tax cuts, since many rich people, especially older rich people, recieve a lot of dividend income.  \n\nGeorge Bush, on his 2005 tax return, saved about 26,000 dollars from these tax cuts.  I didn't make enough of this investment income to even qualify.  Most americans don't.\n\n\nExample 3:  Estate Tax\n\nFinally, the republicans tried unsuccessfully to cut the ESTATE TAX down to 0%.  The estate tax is a tax that people like Paris Hilton pay, when they inherit more then 2 million dollars from a dead realative that for some reason, has not already transferred his entire fortune to his children already.  If you don't inherit more than 2 million dollars then you don't pay the tax. If you inherit 2 million and two dollars, then you only pay estate tax on the 2 dollars in excess of two million.  \n\nIt is not a tax on the dead person, it's a tax on the person taht recieves all that money by inheriting it. (NOT WORKING)\n\nI don't think i have to explain why the middle class doesn't pay this tax.\n\nSo there are three examples of "TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH" That most people will never benefit from.  I hope that is clear.  The basic philosophy of republicans seems to be that the higher your income and the more income you make from not working, then the more you should get back in tax cuts.  \n\nI hope people realize how unfair the recent republican tax cust have been and vote this November.

question_title: why goverment doesnt want hispanic people in here ?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't think the government doesn't want latino here... the government doesn't want any more immigrants in the U.S period! since the influx of immigrants is getting to a point where it's creating problems for the economy of the country as a whole.  Why is that? well, all these people even though they're here in the country illegally, and I'm sure that their sole intention is to do well and to be able to help their family back home and to do better for themselves... however, if things doesn't turn out the way they hope it would be, and they're not getting much support from the government, some of those immigrants will ended up doing anything possible to survive, that being said anything whether good/bad to make a living and I believe that's what the government is trying to end.  It is sad because after all, the U.S is made of immigrants and to be able to stop something that a whole country was built by.. is really not a solution.  I think that although their action is understandable by trying to restrict the influx of immigrants, however... other methods could have been used to help those who sees the U.S as their only way to a better way of living.

[SEP] question_content: i believe america is one of the biggest polluters in the world ,i maybe wrong.by the way i am not moaning about americans .i just wondered if big company's decide policies [SEP] best_answer: The Kyoto Accords are actually less stringent than those proposed by several large US corporations. The reason the US has opted out of the Kyoto Accords is primarily because the accords call for a standardized implementation across all industries, which would be 1) extremely expensive; 2) not really reduce the overall emissions. The Kyoto Accords would not credit industries or companies that have already implemented more advanced and beneficial pollution cutting measures, and do not allow for a phase out period for industries to gradually close older, less environmentally friendly plants.  While it seems that America is ignoring environmental policy by not following Kyoto, the overall level of pollution will be reduced by not signing on. Also, the cost savings can be used to help retrofit some existing plants, and build new more environmentally friendly ones while adding jobs to the US economy.	Politics & Government

[SEP] question_content: I was just wondering if they can take my phone away legally. Can they hold it from me? If I am 18 are they even allowed to call my parents? [SEP] best_answer: Yes they can, just as they can search your locker or car (if on school grounds) without your permission.  Your age doesn't allow you to break the rules, even if you where 60yo and going back to get your HS Dipolma they could still take it away from you.  They can of course call your parents, even if you don't live with them.  This continues into college with one exception for college.  College can only give out information such as you were caught with alcohol/drugs, and not academic information such as how you're doing in class.	Politics & Government

I was a volunteer on the Ford Jr campaign...\nThe crook label...he has an Uncle who is in the State House who was indicted in a local case last year....He has an Aunt (Ophelia) who was under investigation due to voting irregularities and there was a recall in that particular race which she eventually won. His father was indicted for a business deal in 95 , but he was cleared of wrong-doing...So that is where that tag comes from. \n Harold Ford Jr has impeccable credentials,He is honest, He has never been involved in any corruption. He is clean as a whistle . He is a Christian which appealed to most people here. He is a Conservative Democrat: Also attractive to locals. He voted against partial bith Abortion, Supported 2nd amendmant, Voted against Gay marriage. He is the most conservative Democrat in the State....\n His problem: He was a black man running for Senator in The White South....Sad isn't it...We have really come a long way... We are just not there yet....I have no doubt...If he had been white and had the same positions politically ...He would have been elected....\n People here would never admit that it was race nor would Mr. Ford because, that does not help him at all ..it would only hurt him to appear to play the race card.....I live here...I am white...He was hands down the most attractive candidate...He lost...Why? \nYou decide.....

question_title: Why, since Bush became president do people seem to have digressed in race relations? Why is it ok? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Usually race relations in this country has more to do with black and white than anything else.  The reason why there is such a divide with the Bush administration and most black people is that black people typically are not the wealthier crust of society (or a Bush).  Exception of course is extended to Clarence Thomas.  Whereas Bush has nothing against white/black, his actions often signify a reverend indifference to matters of social-economic class, his tax cuts, specifically capital gains; which he hopes to make a 0% tax bracket which would cost nearly a trillion dollars to an already over stretched budget in under a decade reflects an elitist ideology that neglects to realize there are people who haven't been coddled their entire lives.  He bought his way out of military service similarly to J.P. Morgan, been bought out of every trouble and jam, drinking, drugs etc; have been bought companies on a repeated basis to only have them fail or depreciate in value before he sells them, sometimes illegally.  And handed the presidency as a legacy on a strictly party line vote, well kinda, 7 declared republicans were on the bench at the time of the decision in 2000, though Stevens and Souter often are most likely the most liberal republicans in the history of the world.  \n\nWhen Katrina hit, it was evident of Bush's misunderstanding of the situation, he has no regard for any lower class than his own, his failure to appreciate the situation that some people couldn't simply drive their car and leave to their vacation homes seems to astound such an egalitarian as Bush.  What New Orleans exemplifies is a class divide that has existed since the nascent of this nation that made blacks 3/5 a person without 3/5 of any rights.  As a result, the black population has been left at a lower economic social class, even after gaining equal rights as of 1863, they suffered he indignity of decisions of Plessy that allowed Jim Crow laws to exist for over a hundred more years.    \n\nHe also has a tenative view on immigration,  or hispanics, being not a 'true conservative' but a new age business conservative, President Bush fails conservative ideology as budget, programs and socialistic aspects of his administration which does not provide welfare for individuals but businesses.  i.e. airlines, car manufacturers, energy companies that were given billions of taxpayer dollars instead of the laissez faire capitalism he professes with regulation aspects.  He allows immigrants a free pass into the US as a way to undervalue the amount of American labor without any system of nationalization to his invisible hand market approach that increases the labor pool while devaluing the labor class and increases in inflation relative to job salary compensation.  \n\nIn essense, whatever is mathematically more solvent is what he will do, though this calculation doesn't reflect the American budget but rather the fact that the US has tripled in billionaires since 2000 yet overall compensation of jobs has fell and jobs themselves dissolve.  Bush by no extent is racist, just ignorant.	Politics & Government

If the baby's life is not interrupted, he or she will someday become an adult man or woman.  The label of "fetus" is to signify what stage the human is in just like toddler or adult.\n\nSo the question is why can you leagal kill them?

question_title: can he really get away with this? [SEP] question_content: Ive been seeking advice about this for a long time . But tonight things finally came to a head.My sons dad has been a loser for a long time. I left him three days ago because I guess I was opening my big mouth so he choked me in front of our son and bruised my thigh. I was bitching I guess cas Im tired of him hanging out in the hood , hes 28.. also some girl answered his phone toight told me she thought he went to jail for crack.He got out in an  hour guess they didnt really find the crack just got him for driving with out liscence. He denies the crack thing  and tells me Im stupid,That im ruining our family.Weve gotten into arguments in the past and Ive slapped him and yelled alot Im afraid hell use that against me . I have a huge bruise on my leg but Im scared to go to the police cas its already been this long they wont do anything, then he'll just laugh at me and tell me how stupid i am again.Call somebody who cares he told me when i  called last [SEP] best_answer: As long as you still have the marks, make a police report! This man (for lack of a better word) is trying to control you, and sounds like he has succeeded up to this point! Don't be afraid of him, because you can be protected!! You don't have to put up with abuse from anyone! If he's into crack and has another woman, you should just hold your head high, and walk away from a bad situation. It'll only get worse if you let it! When you make your police report, you can also request a restraining order. In my town, you'd be directed to contact Victims Assistance, and they will have the restraining order for you as quickly as tomorrow! Don't let him get away with anything! He needs to be locked up! Good luck to you! :)	Politics & Government

question_title: How would you protest leagally and not get in trouble wit anyone?

Most towns require organizers of any event, whether it's social or political, to get a permit.  This is usually to help the town deal with traffic, garbage pickup and other event-related realities.\n\nWhat you need to do is be clear on your issue and have a clear plan - are you protesting solo, like Cindy Sheehan? Or do you plan to organize a group?  \n\nWhat you do, where you do it and who you want to convince makes a difference.\n\nWhen our neighborhood was struggling to get the town to turn abandoned land into a town park, my neighbor and I called up every one of our neighbors to ask them to come to the town board meeting.  \n\n80 people showed up and we got our town park - many officials were against this because they didn't want tax dollars to go to that park, but because a lot of people showed up - those officials had to give in to the will of the people.

question_title: Keep talking Americans!!?

If you don't want to be here in America and don't like our laws, then go back to where ever you come from. I support tighter security on the border and illegal's should all be shipped away! Our jobs are being lost to these people because employers would rather pay Jose $5 hr than paying Mark $8 hr. They don't pay taxes and get free stuff from the government all the time. Born american! Buy american! Who's with me? \n\nAdditional Details\n\nApr 28, 2006 at 6:21 am\nI never said anything about legal immigrants. I saw the flyer stating that there needs to be less security on the border and what not. That is BS! Lots of countries suffer from poverty. Sorry about ya, we have our own poor to take care of! Illegal aliens is what my problem is! Coming over here and expecting me to learn your language?? No, you need to learn mine and speak English. We are an English speaking country! And for those wondering...I do have native american in me. So let's not get started on that! I also have dated a mexican, but he was born here and was LEGAL! Oh yeah, he spoke English too!\n\nApr 28, 2006 at 6:26 am\nWell, it's so nice to know that so many people want Illegal citizens here! Way to be proud of what you have...and become a minority! Glad to know that you want America overpopulated with non-english speaking people. Who don't pay for a damn thing in this country, but ship money back to their homeland to support families there! I have a feeling...i'm not the ignorant one...but the realistic one! [SEP] best_answer: I completely agree with you on everything!  My grandparents had to learn English when they came here, so did all the other immigrants that came at the time they did.  So why shouldn't the Spanish speaking immigrants have to learn it?  Are they too stupid?  Or too arrogant?  Maybe someone else is happy to have their taxes go to some lady that waddled across the border, had her baby here, and now collects welfare "for the baby" but I am not.  I say if they want to be here, go through the legal process, learn the language, and get a job and pay taxes like the rest of us.\n\nAnd oh yeah - while you like in the US, you fly the US flag.  That's another thing - they claim they are so oppressed where they are from, yet they want to wave the flag of where they re from and be "loyal" to where they came from - well they should be loyal to the country that gives them the things their own country won't!

question_title: This is an immigrant nation? [SEP] question_content: arent we all immigrants here, hell, the native americans should more right than most of us here. [SEP] best_answer: NO!!\nOMG!! S.O.S.!!(same old $h*t) The dinosaurs were here then the prehistoric man walked across the Bering Straits during the last Ice Age (15,000 to 30,000 years ago)and became the oldest KNOWN inhabitants of the North American continent. The Europeans came, saw and conquered the Native Americans (cruelly and unjustly). There were no laws on immigration at that time.  The Europeans formed a government, voted, elected leaders, passed laws, built this country from a wilderness. Those people passed a law later on immigration. That law says you must enter by legal means. Documents must be filed, legally processed, they must pass citizenship tests and be sworn in under oath before a person can be a citizen. It is an expensive, time consuming process. It is that way for a reason. People must be screened, their criminal records checked, medically checked for disease.\n\nI am a Native American. See that word "AMERICAN". That means I am a citizen of the USA. I am a natural born citizen. Those people who's ancestors came here are natural born citizens, too. They are NOT immigrants. You might be, but they aren't. Immigrants are people who were not born citizens. They are from another country. If they become citizens and have children here, their children are NATURAL BORN CITIZENS, not immigrants, either. Immigrants have been welcome in the USA. But our country can not take 800,000 immigrants every year and have the resources to sustain that many people. We must reduce immigration of all kinds back to 200,000 people per year or this country will be another third world nation by 2050. I don't think even the illegals would like that.

I used to make more, but 9-11 happened and my dream job ceased to exist. However, I became a republican because the platform of the party more closely reflected my personal, professional and political beliefs. I NEVER vote a straight party ticket, and always try to vote for the candidate I feel is the most qualified. In order to determine the qualifications of each candidate, I visit their websites, listen to political ads, watch debates and read profiles in the local paper. I try to be as informed about each candidate and their political stance on each issue before I determine whom to vote for. I have voted for democrats several times including in two presidential elections (Clinton).\n\nI regularly write my senators and representatives, both at state and federal level, in order to express my approval or disgust over their actions. I then vote my approval or dissatisfaction during the election. Most recently, I helped vote a republican mayor out of office because he was out of touch with the local citizens and was no longer a benefit to the community.\n\nI do not understand why you feel it is appropriate to take a fatalistic view of the world and decide certain "things are never going to end." I believe things can change if people want them to, particularly if a large group of people make a collective statement.\n\nI do not know anyone personally who advocates the eradication of wholesale segments of the population because of religious or sexual preference. \n\nI support proportional tax rates, to a point. No one should have to pay 80% on capital gains. There would be no incentive to earn money. Why would anyone invest $1 only to receive an additional 20 cents, regardless of how hard it was to make the 2nd dollar? You would bring the capitalist system to a halt.\n\nRepublicans normally support sound fiscal policy and the elimination or reduction of taxes. This is not always the case, as evidenced by some of the current administration's actions. You can't decry social inequity and then ask those who are the most industrious members of society to accept a system that forces them to work harder for less money because you want to give their hard earned money to people who aren't willing to work as hard.

Too many branches (like infantry, MP, Armor) will not let anyone change branch to what they want but that same Soldiers time is up and they can get out, that's a good way to keep people!  Also for everyone who can't stand his job their is someone who wanted that job.  When they asked me what I wanted last year I said "If you can get me working with Iraqis I will do 2 years in Iraq" Well they sent me to Atlanta and now they can't pay people to go on these Iraqi training teams.  I think the only way to fix this is to set up an army message board so Soldiers can trade assignments when they are coming out.\n\nGet rid of all the useless slots in echelons above reality.\nMy current unit in Kuwait probably hurts the war effort by wasting manpower in a HQ building that does little if any real work and it counts as a deployed tour.  I would cut every sections personnel in half and move as much of the work back to the states as possible so at least people could be getting their stabilization while in this lame job.

I got into an accident with a car i bought from an auction but no one else was envolved. I missed my last trial date and they put a warrant out for me. Eventually they caught up to me and threw me in jail for 3 days for contempt of court. November 16th is my rescheduled trail date. I am so broke and was wondering do you still think it was be a good idea to get a lawyer? [SEP] best_answer: Your story is a bit confusing, but, I'll answer based on my personal experience. It is rarely a "bad" idea to have proper legal representation when going into court. Most people are simply not qualified to fully understand court proceedings well enough to competently represent themselves. There is also the emotional factor, which can hinder a person from representing themselves in a concise manner. \n\nMy personal experience with this scenario was a real eye-opener. I naively believed that the judge would be patient and helpful as I struggled to make myself heard. I was wrong. The courts are so overloaded, that most judges have an enormous case load to get through on any given day - and they want to keep things moving along at breakneck speed. They want to hear legal language and concepts, not layperson "stammerings".\n\nYou say you are "so broke", so, I don't understand how you can possibly afford a private practice attorney, especially at this late date. Most private practice attorneys - at least the ones who are worth anything - are so busy that they can't take on new cases on such short notice - and certainly not without a sizeable retainer. Your best bet - and maybe your only one - is to contact Legal Aid in your area and request as quick an appointment as they can give you. You'll have to fill out a bunch of financial forms to see if you even qualify, based on their guidelines. Be prepared with things like paystubs and all court documents.  If they do agree to represent you, take the help. At the very least, you'll receive informed legal advice, which, unless you are a pre-law student, would be pretty tough to come by on your own.\n\n Remember to dress appropriately for court, be incredibly respectful to the Judge, behave with remorse, and, for the most part, unless spoken to directly by the Judge - keep your mouth shut. I made the stupid mistake of letting my emotions get away from me, and, in one instance of speaking while the Judge was speaking, I lost everything. Maybe some judges are tolerant, but, my experience has been that most are not. Good luck to you.	Politics & Government

question_title: How did the movie "Deja Vu" end?  I had to leave the theater after Claire pulled the gun on him in her apt. [SEP] question_content: The movie theater had to be evacuated--a popcorn machine had caught on fire-- so we missed the end of the movie!   Doug had just rescued Claire from Carroll (exploding ambulance, etc...) and they were in her apt. when she pulled a gun on him and said "You're not really a cop... how did you know about my clothes, etc..." and she called his office to see if he was really an agent... Then the fire alarm went off and we left.  \n\nWe would REALLY appreciate a detailed description of what happened after this... I don't think it was very far to the end... \n\nHelp, PLEASE!  ;) [SEP] best_answer: First after she pulled the gun, she called his office and another cop gave a description of him. Then they rush to the ferry and plan on trying to get the bomb out. The girl was supposed to wait until the ferry left, while D.W. went on board to stop the bomb. As the bad guy left, D.W. went abroad the ferry. But while the bad guy was getting ready to leave on his motorcycle, he noticed the SUV and went back to the ferry. The girl saw this and in return jump back abroad the ferry.\n Now with all three of them on the ferry, D.W. was told by security to get up top, that the bottom was off limits. He agrees and looks for another way. The girl tryin to alert D.W. is caught by the bad guy. She is once again tied up and put in the SUV. D.W. now returns back to the SUV and begans a shoot out with the bad guy. With the security also firing at them both, D.W. ended up killing the bad guy with a shot in the head, with his last bullet. Then security comes at D.W. and he jumps in the SUV with the girl, now they only have a couple of minutes until the bomb goes off. So while the cops are trying to stop the SUV, they take off fliping over the edge. While under water the girl is saved by D.W. but he didn't get out and drowns or blows up with the blomb, which miss the ferry. So after all this, the present day D.W. shows up. And she asked him the same question he ask her while she was holding the gun. He responded the same and stop a second thinking that he felt Deja Vu but then shook it off and the movies end with them living the docks. I hope this helps	Entertainment & Music

question_title: How do you put in a new string in a squire telecaster? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Take a replacement string of the same gauge (thickness) and push it through the spare hole at the end of the metal bridge plate. Pull through until the stopper blocks it moving any further and then feed the end through the tuner peg hole. Ensure that the string is aligned into the groove at the end of the neck and allow some slack into the string before tightening - about enough to get a finger between the string and the fretboard. Tighten the string around the pole using the tuning peg - I tend to wrap it once above the string then the remaining times below. Tune up, then stretch the string by placing your palm over it near the lower frets and pulling the string gently away from the fretboard with your playing hand. Tune up again, repeat the process, then plug in and rock out!	Entertainment & Music
question_title: Does anyone know any jokes or even riddles? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: An old guy walks into a bar and asks for a bottle of forty-year old Scotch. The bartender, not wanting to give up the good liquor, pours a shot of ten-year Scotch and figures that the guy won't be able to tell the difference. The guy downs the Scotch and says: "This Scotch is only ten years old! I specifically asked for forty-year old Scotch." \n\nAmazed, the bartender reaches into a locked cabinet underneath the bar and pulls out a bottle of twenty-year old Scotch and pours the man a shot. The guy drinks it down and says, "That was twenty-year old Scotch. I asked for forty-year old Scotch." \n\nSo the bartender goes into the back room and brings out a bottle of thirty-year old Scotch and pours the guy a drink. By now a small crowd has gathered around the man and is watching anxiously as he downs the latest drink. Once again the guy states the true age of the Scotch and repeats his original request for forty-year old Scotch. \n\nThe bartender can hold off no longer and disappears into the cellar to get a bottle of prime forty-year old Scotch. Soon, the bartender returns with the bottle and pours a shot. The guy downs the Scotch and says, "Now this is forty-year old Scotch!" The crowd applauds his discriminating palate. \n\nAn old drunk who had been watching the proceedings with interest, raises a full shot glass of his own and says, "Here, take a swig of this." \n\nThe guy takes the glass and downs the drink in one swallow. Immediately, he chokes and spits out the liquid on the barroom floor. "My God! That tastes like piss," he yells. \n\n"Great guess," says the drunk. "Now, how old am I?"	Entertainment & Music

question_title: who loves axl rose? i do and who else? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually, to put it simply, he is a little bitch. He broke up Guns N' Roses, which could have been the greatest hard rock band ever. They were never even allowed to flourish. Even though I love the Use Your Illusions, I'm still mad at Axl for moving away from the "I'll Kick Your Ass" hard rock of Appetite for Destruction. He has been promising an album for ten years, but he never does release anything. I admire the man as a lyricist, musician, and a vocalist. His range is amazing, but I'll never respect the dude as a man. he's not really a man anymore anyway. Have you seen the amount of plastic surgery that he has gotten? He looks like that thing from the Alien series.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Which do you prefer Yahoo or Google? Why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends for what purpose. Overall, I think one needs to assess what it is that they want. I think yahoo for e-mail purposes is extremely user friendly and I like the new BETA format that e-mails can be viewed and accessed in. I am able to organize my e-mails and my spam for that matter alphabetically in yahoo and can just select several e-mails at once to delete or easily drag e-mails into folders. I also like that yahoo has made it really easy to compose e-mails. As you start to type someone's name, yahoo will automatically narrow down the possibilities of who you are trying to e-mail and bring up a drop down menu of names you can select. On google, I like the fact that I can chat directly within gmail. I also like the fact that my instant message exchanges are automatically saved on gmail. Overall, I think the searching is more extensive on google. It really just depends on what you want to use them for. Good luck!	Entertainment & Music

If anyone has seen it, would you please explain the ending to me? [SEP] best_answer: Yeah the ending was a bit confusing.\n\nObviously there was a dimensional thing since the Rose and Christopher Da Silva occupied the same space at the same time one point, but they couldn’t see each other and the climate/atmosphere were different. So was it Alessa the whole time as Sharon Da Silva in the real world trying to get back to Silent Hill? If so, perhaps after the problem was solved she couldn’t go back into the real world and kept Rose with her.

Basically, you need to eat little and often to get your stomach used to food....eating a lot in one go will overload the stomach and could cause you to vomit.  You  need a well balanced diet, plenty of fibre, fresh fish,  fruit and veg and lots of fluid, preferably water, though fruit juices and herbal teas are good too.

question_title: what is the cure for R.L.S. (restless leg syndrome)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How is restless legs syndrome treated?\n\n\n\nAlthough movement brings relief to those with RLS, it is generally only temporary. However, RLS can be controlled by finding any possible underlying disorder. Often, treating the associated medical condition, such as peripheral neuropathy or diabetes, will alleviate many symptoms. For patients with idiopathic RLS, treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. \n\nFor those with mild to moderate symptoms, prevention is key, and many physicians suggest certain lifestyle changes and activities to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Decreased use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco may provide some relief. Physicians may suggest that certain individuals take supplements to correct deficiencies in iron, folate, and magnesium. Studies also have shown that maintaining a regular sleep pattern can reduce symptoms. Some individuals, finding that RLS symptoms are minimized in the early morning, change their sleep patterns. Others have found that a program of regular moderate exercise helps them sleep better; on the other hand, excessive exercise has been reported by some patients to aggravate RLS symptoms. Taking a hot bath, massaging the legs, or using a heating pad or ice pack can help relieve symptoms in some patients. Although many patients find some relief with such measures, rarely do these efforts completely eliminate symptoms \n\nPhysicians also may suggest a variety of medications to treat RLS. Generally, physicians choose from dopaminergics, benzodiazepines (central nervous system depressants), opioids, and anticonvulsants. Dopaminergic agents, largely used to treat Parkinson's disease, have been shown to reduce RLS symptoms and PLMD and are considered the initial treatment of choice. Good short-term results of treatment with levodopa plus carbidopa have been reported, although most patients eventually will develop augmentation, meaning that symptoms are reduced at night but begin to develop earlier in the day than usual. Dopamine agonists such as pergolide mesylate, pramipexole, and ropinirole hydrochloride may be effective in some patients and are less likely to cause augmentation. \n\nIn 2005, ropinirole became the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of moderate to severe RLS. The drug was first approved in 1997 for patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n\nBenzodiazepines (such as clonazepam and diazepam) may be prescribed for patients who have mild or intermittent symptoms. These drugs help patients obtain a more restful sleep but they do not fully alleviate RLS symptoms and can cause daytime sleepiness. Because these depressants also may induce or aggravate sleep apnea in some cases, they should not be used in people with this condition. \n\nFor more severe symptoms, opioids such as codeine, propoxyphene, or oxycodone may be prescribed for their ability to induce relaxation and diminish pain. Side effects include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and the risk of addiction. \n\nAnticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and gabapentin are also useful for some patients, as they decrease the sensory disturbances (creeping and crawling sensations). Dizziness, fatigue, and sleepiness are among the possible side effects. \n\nUnfortunately, no one drug is effective for everyone with RLS. What may be helpful to one individual may actually worsen symptoms for another. In addition, medications taken regularly may lose their effect, making it necessary to change medications periodically.

They just told me to basically do anything to get her in. I don't want to wait until she hurts herself. She moved out and took all of my belongings. I was trying to help her, my family sent her up here for me to deal with, after I had just lost my 5 1/2 year old daughter that she and I both were in our car and got hit by a drunken driver. He didn't serve any time, just has to go to DUI classes and tell his story as a disciplinary action towards him. I just didn't see any remorse from him when he said sorry to me.

But I don't know what else to do but file a police report. What should I do dashweiler. I miss her, but she drives me crazy with the way she acts. My mom was murdered when I was twelve, and would not want me to give up on my sister. Now i'm cryin [SEP] best_answer: once you file a police report, an ATL (attempt to locate) bulletin will go out for her, and if she is an adult once the police (or someone who knows they are looking for her) finds her then the most they can do is a welfare check to make sure she is not a risk to harm herself or others. if they see that she is based on any actions by her or on the info they have from you, they will take her to a facility to be evaluated and the doctors there will determine whether or not to commit her.

question_title: Is 125 pounds normal for a 5'1'' tall 22-year old girl? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "A recommended weight according to height is the wrong answer. Thats right weight is extremely overrated. It's about your muscle to fat ratio. What matters is keeping your body fat percentage under about 35% for a woman and 25% for a guy. \nWhy? Muscle weighs more than fat. If your body composition is 80% muscle then you may possibly weigh more than the recommended weight. This doesn't mean you are overweight, and it certainly doesn't mean you are unhealthy. \n\nI am an example of that, I am 6'6 250 lbs with 13% body fat (good for a guy). According to the charts I'm overweight, but if you see me you would guess I am about 200 lbs. Thats what muscle mass does it makes you look a lot smaller than what you weigh.\n\nThink of this a muscle cell is a thick dense heavy rubber band.\nThink of a fat cell as a water balloon that can shrink or expand with no limit as to how big it can be.\n\nThe water balloon would take up way more space than rubber bands, but wouldn't weight as much. This is how people can look small but if they are muscular they could weigh more. \n\nIn truth the height and weight chart was something created in the 1950's and it was based on a 150lb person who was sedentary and lived near the equator. Which means its relevance to most Americans is none. Trust the BMI ratio more, which is the ratio of muscle to fat, that gives a more accurate measurement of how much weight is appropriate for you. \n\n\nBMI indicates your health risks by comparing your height and weight. Males with a BMI above 27.8 and women over 27.3 are considered overweight. Males with a BMI less than 20.7 and women below 19.1 are classified as underweight.\n\nThere are limitations to BMI so it's important to realize that it is only an estimation of body fat. People who have valid reasons for maintaining weight outside of normal ranges (pregnant or breast feeding women, competitive athletes, body builders and people who are chronically ill) may experience inaccurate BMI values. People with a high percentage of muscle mass may appear overweight using BMI because muscle is more dense than fat.\n\nHere is a link to calculate your BMI: http://apexfitness.com/html/tools/fit_calc/bmi/ "	Health

question_title: Does anyone else have scoliosis and get neck, head and back pain? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Just because you have a scoliosis does not mean that is what is causing your symptoms.  Sometimes having a slight scoliosis is actually a good thing (your spine will be better able to handle the compressive forces put through it).  I suggest you ask your doctor for a referral to a Physical Therapist.  Your PT would be able to examine you and determine the cause of your symptoms as well as to determine what kind of scoliosis you have (structural vs functional).  Your doctor can also obtain spinal x-rays which can help to determine the severity.	Health
question_title: sleeping problems? [SEP] question_content: i have a problem with getting a recouperative sleep. i sleep alot, on weekends i can sleep for 12 hrs one day and then not at all for the next 3 days.. and im always tired in the day time.. is there any reason for this or am i just being a domber azzel? [SEP] best_answer: I don't normally promote products but in this case, I believe it might benefit you. It is not a pill or any consumable product. In fact, it's an ebook called, Powerful Sleep. I am only recommending the book because it's from a legitimate author and has worked very well for several people who have visited my website (which is about men's fitness). \n\nLet me explain what the book is about and why it might be worth considering. It is written by Kacper Postawski, a sleep science researcher. He studied insomnia to try to find a cure for this very common and life-disrupting problem. During the course of his research, he made some intriguing discoveries about why some people sleep 8, 10, 12 hours a day and still feel tired and why oversleeping like this is actually bad for you. \n\nHe points out in his book that controlling sleep quality, sleep cycles, light-dark cycles, circadian rhythms and lifestyle factors (exercise, stress, light exposure, drugs, alcohol, caffeine, etc.), are possibly more important than the quantity of sleep itself. In other words, it's not so important that you get "X" amount of sleep per night as it is to get quality sleep per night. In his book, he reveals information on psychological "triggers" and simple techniques that will help you fall asleep instantly, sleep soundly and wake up energized - automatically. \n\nPeople who have read the book have told me that they actually get less sleep than they did before and yet they feel more awake and energized. The reason is because they are getting quality sleep for the first time. Just because you get 8+ hours of sleep does not mean those are quality hours of sleep. Most people can get the quality of sleep they need with as little as 5 or 6 hours. This book explains how that is possible and teaches you how to get the quality sleep you need.\n\nKacper also points out that for some people they truly do need 8 hours of sleep. Sleep is an individual matter and in this book, he shows you how to determine what your ideal sleep time is and how to get that quality sleep every night.\n\nIf you're curious about the book at all, visit his website (link provided below), and you'll get the first two chapters of the book for free. All you have to do is answer the question on the home page and then the first two chapters are emailed to you instantly. You'll be able to tell after reading the first two chapters if it's right for you or not. Good luck to you!\n\nTravis	Health
question_title: gas and bloating relief? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: OK -- the bloating is not in your stomach, which is where the simethicone helps.  Instead, the bloating is in the intestines, which could be 1 of several things.  For me, it was too much carbonation.  I drank 3-4 cokes a day.  By knocking soda out of my life, gas and bloating are pretty much gone.  It could also be iron supplements, lactose intolerance, or gluten intolerance.  I suggest you try 1 week elimination diets ... no soda for a week, etc. ... and find the culprit.  Last resort, it could be IBS, but only after a doctor checks you out.	Health

question_title: Sexual effects of aging? [SEP] question_content: I am 45 years old and still get erect easily enough, but when I have sex it only lasts for like less than a minute. I know its not impotence because I get fully erect, but it seems it has become more sensitive and I end too quick. I did ask my Doctor and he said this was normal with aging but I thought it took longer when you get older not shorter. I never had a problem with pre-mature ejaculation, so whats the deal ? Anyone else know what Im talking about ? [SEP] best_answer: I'm 43 and i found that i lasted longer because i'm more in tune with my body. It helps to be with the right partner someone you have feelings for. I can't just have proper sex with people i don't really know anymore. What i found that effected my performance where: alcohol, smoking, guilt, worries, nervousness and depresion. I had to clear the reckage of my past and get in touch with myself.

question_title: How do you cure a cold or flu or fever? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: All three of these are different... Here are my recommendations: \n\nCold: \nAs mentioned above, folklore tells us that we should feed a cold. Experience has taught me that the best thing to feed a cold is usually chicken soup. It doesn't have to be homemade - even Campbell's will work - but homemade does seem to be best. Keep up the fluids - drink water, hot tea, ginger ale, anything to keep hydrated. Hot tea seems to work best for me. Take vitamin C, and zinc - you can get tablets at your local pharmacy, or a multivitamin will do in a pinch. Get plenty of rest, too. If your head is stuffed up or you're congested in any way, prop yourself up a little bit on a couple of pillows so that you sleep with your head higher than your chest. Doesn't have to be a lot, just a little will do the trick. And if you can, sleep on your back this way. Don't know why, but it seems to help with the drainage of all that mucus. \n\nFever: \nAgain, referencing the folklore, starve a fever. If you've got a fever, you probably don't feel like eating anyway. Fevers you have to keep a closer eye on. I've always felt like they're more dangerous than a cold. Anyway, again, stay hydrated - drink water, iced tea, ginger ale - you're probably not going to want anything hot. As a rule of thumb, if you get hungry, eat something. Try something light at first to make sure...a piece of dry toast or some crackers. Take your tempreture whenever you think of it to make sure you're not boiling over. If your tempreture gets too high, go to a doctor. \n\nFlu: \nStay warm, and stay close to a bathroom for starters! Stay hydrated - gatorade, tea, water, ginger ale is great. There's something about ginger that helps settle my stomach, so ginger ale and ginger tea (if you like either) are usually good to have around. Get as much rest as you can. Do whatever you can to stay comfortable. Peptobismal has always been a wonder drug in my family... Immodium for diareaha (sp?) is really good, too. Again, chicken soup if you can keep it down. Don't know what it is about that chicken soup, but it does seem to help.	Health

question_title: How do I treat my swollen gums? [SEP] question_content: I have braces so brushing is not very effective anymore, and my gums are all swollen up. However, I floss (like the orthodontist told me to) and soak my mouth with peroxide (I heard it helps to get rid of bacteria), but my gums are still swollen. \nAny advice? [SEP] best_answer: Did the orthodontist give you any proxabrushes?  They look like little Christmas tree shaped bristles.  These work great to get all the plaque out from around the brackets.   Also using an electric toothbrush (like a Sonicare) helps massage the gums and remove plaque.  Some of the inflammation could be from moving the teeth, if you had a lot of spacing and the teeth are moving closer.  But usually it comes down to not removing all the bacteria.  Ortho requires meticulous oral hygiene.  I am sure I dont hae to tell you that all kinds of stuff gets caught around the brackets!!  \nI wouldnt rinse with peroxide for very long, long term usage can actually harm the tissue.  Instead ask your dentist or orthodontist if they can give you a RX fro PerioGard, or if they have it available to purchase in office.  This rinse kills bacteria better than any over the counter rinse.  If you dont want to use that rinse try Breath Rx rinse or the new Crest Pro Health rinse.  I would stay away from Listerine because it contains a lot of alcohol which actually dries the tissue.\nInterested if you are experiencing a lot of bleeding along with the swollen gums.  This is the telltale sign that it is due to bacteria and plaque more than movement of the teeth.\nKey is brush, floss, proxabrush, rinse.  Also try a waterpik that flushes bacteria and debris from around the brackets and gums.  \nGood Luck, remember it will be over eventually and then you will appreciate how much easier it is to clean your teeth without all that stuff!!

question_title: Vasectomy Reversal? [SEP] question_content: Does it really work ?  Is there anyone out there that had a Vasectomy Reversal and worked for them ? [SEP] best_answer: A vasectomy is done to be a permanent thing.  Since I'm not qualified to give advice in this manner, here is some info I'm sure you will find useful..\n\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2925082881023986001&q=vasectomy\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasectomy/HQ01049\nVasectomy: The right form of birth control for you?\nVasectomy provides a permanent form of birth control for men. Is it right for you? \nVasectomy is a surgical procedure that permanently makes a man unable to father a child (sterile). It involves severing and sealing the two tubes (vasa deferentia) that carry sperm from your testicles to your seminal fluid (semen). After the procedure, your semen will not contain sperm, so when you ejaculate during sexual intercourse, you'll be unable to get a woman pregnant.\nWorldwide, about 50 million men have had a vasectomy. Each year, approximately 500,000 American men undergo the procedure. More American married couples rely on it for family planning than on any other method except female sterilization (tubal ligation) and birth control pills (oral contraceptives). Because a vasectomy often can't be reversed, you need to carefully consider the pros and cons before choosing it.\nWho is it for?\nMost men who seek vasectomies have been married for at least 10 years. If you're considering a vasectomy, it's essential that you and your partner both want a permanent form of birth control. Vasectomy may be an option if:\n·You and your partner agree that you have all the children you want\n·You and your partner are unable or unwilling to use another birth control method\n·Your partner has a health condition that makes pregnancy unsafe\nYou may want to forgo vasectomy if you're:\n·Unsure about having children in the future\n·In an unstable relationship\n·Motivated primarily by a desire to please your partner\n·Young, with many life changes ahead\n·Single, divorced or separated\n·Counting on having children later by having the vasectomy reversed or freezing your sperm\nIt's not uncommon for men to consider vasectomy in response to a stressful situation such as an illness, financial setback, death in the family or birth of a child. Because the stress may be temporary, however, it's better to seek counseling or psychotherapy to help you cope than to undergo a surgical procedure you may later regret.\nBefore deciding on a vasectomy, you and your partner should consider its long-term implications. Ask yourself how you'd feel if you had a vasectomy and:\n·One of your children died\n·Your financial situation improved so that you could afford another child\n·You and your partner separated or divorced, or your partner died\nHow do you prepare?\nDoctors usually perform vasectomies in an office or family planning clinic. The cost ranges from $150 to $1,200, about one-quarter of the expense of the more complicated tubal ligation surgery used for female sterilization. Most insurance policies cover at least some of the cost.\nAfter choosing a doctor, meet with him or her to discuss the procedure, risks and potential complications. It's best to include your partner in this initial consultation.\nIf you're worried that a vasectomy might somehow make you less of a man, now is the time to bring up such concerns. Your doctor can reassure you that sterility won't affect your virility. Because the testicles continue to produce the same amount of the male sex hormone testosterone after a vasectomy, the procedure should have no effect on your sex drive or your ability to get an erection. A vasectomy will not affect your body composition and other male characteristics. You'll still have the same muscle mass, facial hair and voice. Nor should a vasectomy noticeably reduce the volume of your ejaculate, since semen consists almost entirely of fluids produced by the prostate and other glands.\nTwo weeks before and after your vasectomy, don't take aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motr	Health

question_title: Why am I having such a hard time starting a diet? [SEP] question_content: Eveyday I plan to "start fresh" with a diet/exercise routine and it doesn't happen! Now I am feeling that with the holidays coming up, I should just wait until after the holidays to start but that is what happened last year! What would be some of the psychological issues to not being able to start a diet? [SEP] best_answer: Hmm...sounds like you aren't ready for a huge change.  That's OK.  It's scary to start something dramatic, especially if you know that you're going to have to maintain a new lifestyle if you want to change forever, which essentially means the first day of your diet is the first day of the rest of your life.  That's daunting.  And you probably figure you can't do it, so you might as well not do anything.  Pretty typical response, I've even suffered with it myself.  Sometimes I basically feel like, "oh, I've cheated once, I've ruined everything, I might as well go eat a cheeseburger."  hehe. :)  \n\nAnyways, for you, I'd recommend starting small.  Just start making an effort to do something so easy, that you know you'll be able to do it.  This could be as easy as making and effort to work out for 30 mins or an hour just one day a week, and making an effort to eat just a couple healthy meals per week, and not sweating the rest of the meals.  Once you've done that for awhile and you've accepted it as a part of your routine, add another exercise day, more healthy meals, etc.  Keep transitioning slowly until you've gotten to at least 4 days of exercise and mostly healthy meals every week. \n\nDoing it like this is NOT going to cause a dramatic change in your body very quickly.  It's going to be slow and you should not expect a lot of weight or inches to be lost like this.  But, several studies have proven that weight that is lost more slowly has a better chance of being kept off for the rest of your life.\n\nMake sure that whatever life change you want, that you can live with it.  A diet is useless if you hate every minute of it.	Health

question_title: Grammar OCD? [SEP] question_content: I was wondering if it's possible to have a grammar OCD? I have no idea if I'm obsessed or obsessed to the point of OCD. When I'm sitting in a lecture, if there's a misuse of something such as their/there on the powerpoint slide, I'll stop listening and focus on that and try to distract myself, except usually that causes me to think about other similar mistakes that people have made around me recently. By the time I'm remotely focused again I've missed a chunk of the lecture.\n\nNow for example, I just had a massive argument with an American friend over the common misuse of lay/lie and I couldn't just stop and shut up, or back off. It frustrates me and stresses me out to the point that until I started typing I was alternately tapping my pen repeatedly on the desk and tugging on my clothing. Most of the time I try to keep my mouth shut but it doesn't usually work. \n\nSometimes I'll refuse to watch a movie/listen to music if it has bad grammar!\n\nCould that be an OCD or am I just obssessed? [SEP] best_answer: Well... There is no such this as AN OCD. There is such thing as OCD. I have OCD, and a thing about grammar. OCD should be looked at as one big disorder, not little quirks here and there. If you have more things like this, for instance the arrangement of your room, then you could look at symptoms for OCD.

[SEP] best_answer: Muscle mechanics\nThe gluteus maximus, the large muscle in your buttocks, works together with the two muscles on your outer hip, called your hip abductors. The hip abductors are the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. Attached to your pelvis and the top of your thighbone, the gluteus medius - with the assistance of your gluteus minimus, located under it - moves your leg out, away from the center of your body.

question_title: does anybody have a pair of mbt trainers and if so do they work? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Shoes with this 'rocker' shape make the muscles in your legs work differently, and it can be useful, but only if you use your foot correctly in the first place. Similar shapes have been tried in running shoes now and then, but the more gradual 'footstrike' uses up energy and slows the runner down.\n\n(that's actually beneficial; it makes you work harder and protects you from injury, but most runners will sacrifice safety and long-term health if it makes them faster!)\n\nLots of people try to run only on the ball and toe of their foot; if you do this, then the rocker shape could make your foot roll forward faster than you're used to (leading to injury).\n\nFell Running (running in moorland & rough countryside) is very good for your leg muscles and joints. That's because your foot placement varies all the time, so the different muscles all learn to support each other, instead of constantly operating in the same sequence as they do when you run on a smooth surface. \n\nTypically, a Fell Running shoe is LESS padded and curved than a normal road shoe. This allows the runner to FEEL the surface better, and adapt to it more easily. In this type of running, the foot might be placed on the ground in a totally different position for EVERY STEP. These variations teach the leg muscles to cooperate very effectively.\n\nIf you slow down your usual running, and try to run in different 'styles' (the categories are designed to sell more shoes, not help your running), you will improve the way your leg muscles co-operate. \n\nIf you buy more than one pair of running shoes, try to get contrasting styles (eg a pair for over- & a pair for under-pronation, or a heavy pair and a lightweight pair) and use them alternately, carefully adapting your style to each. Don't run too fast (if you do, you're likely to revert to your usual habit, and you'll lose the benefit), and try to 'roll' your foot onto the ground, so that it makes little or no sound. \n\nYou can try running slightly toe-out and slightly toe-in, as well. You'll notice that this feels different in each 'style' of shoe, because your foot position encourages you to pronate differently too.\n\n(Running fairly slowly and quietly, with an exaggerated heel-and-toe action and slightly higher knee-lift, should replicate any benefits the 'rocker' shoe can give you) \n\nThese drills will activate the muscles around your calf and shin differently, as well as some of the muscles in your thigh, making you a more versatile runner, and defending your knee, ankle and hip from accumulating damage.\n\nIMPORTANT : while you're not used to the drills, you're vulnerable to overuse damage in muscles you've been neglecting. Introduce the drills gradually, and reduce your session mileage AND your overall mileage until you're very comfortable with each drill.	Health

question_title: what are good remedies for the stomach flu? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: What is stomach flu? \nStomach flu is a viral infection that affects the stomach and small intestine.  It is also called viral gastroenteritis.  The illness is usually brief, lasting 1 to 3 days. \nHow does it occur? \nGastroenteritis is caused by swallowing certain viruses.  The body fluids of infected people contain the virus, sometimes even before their symptoms begin.  The virus can be spread by direct contact with an infected person (for example, kissing or shaking hands) or by sharing food, drink, or eating utensils. \n\nThe virus enters the stomach and intestine and inflames the lining of these organs.  As a result, the stomach and intestine are temporarily unable to perform their usual functions.  The virus can also cause food to move more rapidly through your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. \n\nSome bacteria and other tiny organisms called protozoa can cause infections that have symptoms similar to those of stomach flu. \n\nWhat are the symptoms? \nWhen you have stomach flu, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: \n\n• fatigue \n• chills \n• loss of appetite \n• nausea \n• vomiting \n• stomach cramps \n• diarrhea \n• low-grade fever \n• muscle aches.\nThe illness may develop over a period of hours, or it may suddenly start with stomach cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea. \nHow is it diagnosed? \nYour health care provider will review your symptoms.  He or she may examine you and order lab tests to rule out more serious illnesses, such as appendicitis, and to detect complications, such as dehydration. \n\nHow is it treated? \nThe most important thing to do is to rest the stomach and intestines.  You can do this by first eating nothing and drinking only clear liquids.  A little later you can eat soft bland foods that are easy to digest. \n\nDuring the vomiting phase of the illness it is best to have only small, frequent sips of liquids. \nDrinking too much at once, even an ounce or two, may cause more vomiting. \n\nYour choice of liquids is important.  If water is the only liquid you can drink without vomiting, that is okay.  However, if you have been vomiting frequently for a long time, you must replace the minerals, sodium and potassium, that are lost when you vomit.  Ask your health care provider what sport drinks or medical products could help you replace these minerals. \n\nOther clear liquids you can drink are weak tea and apple juice.  You may also drink soft drinks without caffeine (such as 7 UP) after letting them lose some of their carbonation (go flat).  Chilling the liquids may help you keep them down.  Avoid liquids that are acidic (such as orange juice) or caffeinated (such as coffee) or have a lot of carbonation.  Do not drink milk until you no longer have diarrhea. \n\nYou may start eating soft bland foods when you have not vomited for several hours and are able to drink clear liquids without further upset.  Soda crackers, toast, noodles, applesauce, and bananas are good first choices.  Avoid foods that are acidic, spicy, fatty, or fibrous (meats, coarse grains, vegetables) and dairy products.  You may start eating these foods again in 3 days or so, when all signs of illness have passed. \n\nSometimes treatment includes prescription medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting or diarrhea.  Nonprescription medicine is available for the treatment of diarrhea and is very effective.  If you use it, make sure you use the dose recommended on the package.  Before you use any medicine \nfor diarrhea, always check with your health care provider first. \n\nIf you have been vomiting for more than a day or have had diarrhea for over 3 days, call your health care provider.  You may need to have a physical exam to rule out more serious problems and to check for dehydration.  You may also need to have lab tests to determine whether bacteria or protozoa are causing your illness. \n\nDehydration is a potentially serious complication of stomach flu.  It can occur if your body loses too much fluid because	Health

question_title: what is a placebo effect? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It's the effect that people get when they believe they should get one.\n\nBasically, it comes from the expectation that something good should happen.  \n\nThere was an experiment once, where they wanted to determine if the level of light over the work area could effect production.  They went into the area and changed the light bulbs to a higher wattage.  Work production increased.  Ahha! they thought.  Higher light increases production.  Then they went in and changed the light bulbs back to the original ones.  You might think that production dropped, but in fact it increased again.\n\nThe people were reacting to the attention they were getting.  The feeling that someone was paying attention to them increased their production.\n\nSo, the placebo effect is one that we perceive someone is concerned about us, and the "medication" we are getting should make us feel better.  And it often does, even if there is no medication in the pill.  \n\nA company researching a new medication would want to give a placebo to a group of people they were testing to ensure that it was their medication and not the "placebo effect" that was causing the improvement.

They are usually red or may sometimes have a white coating over them. You might get them on the inside of your lips, the insides of your cheeks, the base of your gums or under your tongue. Canker sores are different from fever blisters, which usually are on the outside of your lips or the corners of your mouth.\n\nAnyone can get canker sores, but women people in their teens and 20s get them more often. Canker sores may run in families, but they aren't contagious. Doctors don't know what causes canker sores, but they may be triggered by stress, poor nutrition, food allergies and menstrual periods.\n\nCanker sores usually go away without any treatment. For pain relief, you can try taking ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) or acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol). Other medicines, such as Anbesol, Oragel, Orabase and Zilactin-B, might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating, drinking or brushing your teeth. You put these medicines right on the sore.\n\nYou can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid. After it's mixed, you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out. If you do this every 4 to 6 hours, your canker sores may hurt less.\n\nSome people think that sucking on zinc lozenges, taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex, using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster.

question_title: What do you know about a new medicine (drug) for autism discovered in Australia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Beware of any treatment called a 'miracle cure'... Autism is such a pervasive disorder, that a single drug is unlikely to ever 'cure it'. It may be that some of the symptoms may be reduced, but considering that autism affects the development of a child's brain, it is unlikely that anything (in the near future) will be able to 'undo' developmental pathogenenes. \n\nThis article shows the current state of mind concerning 'miracle drugs'\n\nNovel treatments for autistic spectrum disorders.\n\nLevy SE, Hyman SL.\n\nChildren's Seashore House, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, 1914, USA. Levys@email.chop.edu\n\nIn no area of developmental pediatric practice is there more controversy regarding the choice of treatment than related to children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM) are often elected because they are perceived as treating the cause of symptoms rather than the symptoms themselves. CAM used for autism can be divided by proposed mechanism: immune modulation, gastrointestinal, supplements that affect neurotransmitter function, and nonbiologic intervention. Secretin as a therapy for autism is discussed as an example of how a clinical observation rapidly grew to a widespread treatment before well-designed studies demonstrated absence of effect. The plausibility for behavioral effect was not substantiated by clinical studies. CAM used for treatment of autism is examined in terms of rationale, evidence of efficacy, side effects, and additional commentary. Families and clinicians need access to well-designed clinical evidence to assist them in choice of therapies. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nHere's another article that may interest you:\n\nAutism, an extreme challenge to integrative medicine. Part 2: medical management.\n\nKidd PM.\n\nAutism and allied autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) present myriad behavioral, clinical, and biochemical abnormalities. Parental participation, advanced testing protocols, and eclectic treatment strategies have driven progress toward cure. Behavioral modification and structured education are beneficial but insufficient. Dietary restrictions, including removal of milk and other casein dairy products, wheat and other gluten sources, sugar, chocolate, preservatives, and food coloring are beneficial and prerequisite to benefit from other interventions. Individualized IgG or IgE testing can identify other troublesome foods but not non-immune mediated food sensitivities. Gastrointestinal improvement rests on controlling Candida and other parasites, and using probiotic bacteria and nutrients to correct dysbiosis and decrease gut permeability. Detoxification of mercury and other heavy metals by DMSA/DMPS chelation can have marked benefit. Documented sulfoxidation-sulfation inadequacies call for sulfur-sulfhydryl repletion and other liver p450 support. Many nutrient supplements are beneficial and well tolerated, including dimethylglycine (DMG) and a combination of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and magnesium, both of which benefit roughly half of ASD cases. Vitamins A, B3, C, and folic acid; the minerals calcium and zinc; cod liver oil; and digestive enzymes, all offer benefit. Secretin, a triggering factor for digestion, is presently under investigation. Immune therapies (pentoxifyllin, intravenous immunoglobulin, transfer factor, and colostrum) benefit selected cases. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids offer great promise. Current pharmaceuticals fail to benefit the primary symptoms and can have marked adverse effects. Individualized, in-depth clinical and laboratory assessments and integrative parent-physician-scientist cooperation are the keys to successful ASD management.\n\n\nConcerning chelation therapy, although it may well be effective in some cases, it has some serious risks: one boy died during threatment: http://www.post-gazette.co	Health

A dollar in year one worth more than a dollar in year five. Mathematics calculation only confirm this common sense.	Business & Finance

It can also be a dirty green or tan transparent which indicates the anhydrous ammonia wasn't cooked out all the way, or light pink transparent that actually can mean it's pretty good purity but the cook put in a small impurity to turn it that color kinda like a trademark.

question_title: What was the worst job you ever had?  Or, who was your worst boss? What happened? [SEP] question_content: At a place that I worked, they actually took away your vacation time if you were late coming to work because of a snowstorm.  They said they had no idea if you were being truthful, for all they knew you could have been applying for another job.  Once, when the building had no power because a transformer blew, and they were told everyone had to leave the building, they told us were would be docked or have to use vacation time, because we could be using that time to look for other jobs.  \n\nThe worst ever was when there was a bomb threat.  They never told the workers, we only knew when we noticed everyone was outside (it was a multi-office building) and someone went out and asked.  They said there was a bomb threat, and management left the building "as a precaution" but we were to keep working.  Needless to say, we all left the building, then we were told we were being charged vacation time for the time we did not work until the building was cleared for everyone to go back in. [SEP] best_answer: i worked for a doctor that had medical supplies that expired in the early 80's in his office that he would not let me throw away. (this was in 2001). he would also take the use latex gloves out of the biohazard bag, and put them back in the box to be reused. there are alot of other things, but i could be here all night. needless to say, i only worked there about 2 months, until i could find a new job.

question_title: Just married - need to change witholdings? [SEP] question_content: We just got married last month. I already owe this year, because when my son got a job and moved out last year, I forgot to change my witholdings at work (my fault). I was claiming Single 5 (Head of Household).\n\nIf I change my status to Married at this point, will I be taxed more heavily or will it be better for me?  What would work best for me?  Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: You should probably change your withholding so that it is more in line with your new situation.  If done correctly, it will end up so that you get more in your paycheck each week, but a smaller refund next year.\n\nBecause you are now married, you need to either file "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately".  It is tough to tell whether your tax will go up or down without more information, it you were going from single to married, total tax between you/spouse would probably go down.  But since it's HOH->married, it might go up.\n\nTypically, couples are better off filing jointly than separately, but that must be decided based on your circumstances.  I'd try both ways, and file whichever way gets you the lowest taxes.	Business & Finance

If you can produce economic value (outcome) worth $1,000 a week, then they will pay you that amount.\n\nPeople make the mistake of going into business while NOT focusing on the value they must create. It's like a guy who's trying to date women, and has on his forehead the words "I want sex."\n\nWell, that's not the way to attract women, and so, similarly, someone who only wants to make money will NOT attract neither customers, investors nor business partners.

question_title: what is the best way to get a first time morgage that is afortable? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I am actually a mortgage consultant. You can goto my site if you would like, and enter your info, and I can email you with any info. But for now, to make a mortgage affordable, put down as much as you can. The more down, the less the payments will be. Most people cannot put down 20% these days, which is fine. It is very common to do two mortgages, one for 80% of the sale price, and then another for the rest minus down payment, using two over one that is more than 80% removes PMI, which is Private mortgage insurance, which is almost always required for a loan above 80% of the value of the home. Also, with an adjustable rate mortgage, like a 3/1, which means the rate is fixed for 3 years at a low rate and then can fluxuate once a year after that, that is good for first time buyers. Or even a 5/1 , working the same way. That way, you get a lower rate, and if you move within 5 years great, whihc is the average for first time home buyers, and if you decide to stay, you can always refinance, when the rates are low again. If you want some more information, just goto my site, and I will email you back. In the box down the bottom, make sure you let me know that you got the link from here. I cannot help in all states, but I can def. help you out informationally.	Business & Finance
question_title: Do you think high quality,large,well cut diamonds are a good investment??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, diamonds are not a good investment if you plan to buy an "investment grade" diamond, and lock it away in a dark safe deposit box. First of all, you are investing in a commodity that is controlled by a benevolent dictator (monopoly) in a foreign land. I'm talking of course about Debeers company that controls the price and distribution of over 80% of the world's diamonds. There is no free market price at the source of diamonds. Debeers sets the price and controls the quantity of diamonds available. No one knows how many diamonds are stored in Debeers' vaults.\n\nPeople who buy investment diamonds from a broker, friend or relative usually pay such a high price over true wholesale, that it might to take forever to see any real appreciation; this is especially true for those laymen who believe they really know the four C's and a lot about the diamond market. Wheeling and dealing in diamonds should only be attempted by experienced, professional diamond dealers. Diamonds pay no dividends or interest. My opinion is that diamonds are for wearing, not investing.	Business & Finance

question_title: What happenes if you default on a 401K loan? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you fail to pay your 401k loan, then you are taxed on it as if you would have taken a regular distribution. (Tax + Penalty for early distribution).\n\nThe amount that you owe is deducted from your total 401k amount.\n\nFor example.  If you take a 401k loan for $1000, and you have $3000 in your 401k and you quit your job, then the $1000 is deducted from your $3000 leaving you with a $2000 401k total.\n\nThe $1000 is also treated like a "distribution".  In other words, it's treated like an early withdrawal.  So at the end of the year, you owe a 43% penalty on the $1000, or $430 in taxes.  (33% income tax [or whatever your income tax rate is], 10% penalty).\n\nFurther more, since that $1000 is treated like regular income, it may push you into a higher tax bracket.	Business & Finance

This is not too expensive to do.\n\n2) Contact a major corporation who plays in the area of your idea/invention, to partner with them (they will typically (caveat) not steal your idea like some smaller companies may).\n\n3) Have the major corporation make the investment in product development by negotiating a contract for royalties on any sales of the final product, plus prohibition on selling the idea to any third party.\n\nYou're in business!!

[SEP] best_answer: First, you have to determine what you want to do on the Web. There are many ways to make money on the Web, and you need to choose the best way - what you can do, what your resources can afford, and what you think is needed. \n\nThe Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\n\nHere are the main business models you can adopt:\n\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \n\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\n\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or PowerHomeBiz.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\n\na. Advertising - From the article "How to Generate Advertising Revenues for Your Web Site" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol28/adrevenues.htm , there are several ways you can earn money from advertising:\n\n1. Join an advertising network. Advertising networks are organizations that aggregate Web sites that offer advertising space, and sell banner ads (and other advertising options) across them. Traffic requirement is often a minimum of 5,000 monthly impressions, although many do not accept sites hosted by free page services. \n\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \n\n2. Participate in contextual advertising networks. Contextual advertising are text ads delivered based on the content of the web page using an automated system. \n\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/\nYahoo! Publishing Network (currently in beta and available to US publishers only) http://publisher.yahoo.com/ \nIntellixt http://vibrantmedia.com/site/web_01a5.htm \nQuigo Adsonar http://www.quigo.com/adsonarexchange.htm \nIndustryBrains http://www.industrybrains.com \nCommission Junction Evolution http://www.cj.com\n\n3. Sell advertising for your site directly. This is admittedly a more difficult route for a small business site wanting to earn advertising revenues. But hey, as they say: "no pain, no gain!" \n\nb. Affiliate Programs - you sell other people's products that your audience may be interested in; and you get a certain commission after the desired action was done (whether a sale, a lead, subscription to email newsletter, or however this is defined)\n\nc. Paid online content. Hoovers.com or WebmasterWorld.com Supporters forum all require paid subscription before accessing the information\n\nd. Content licensing and syndication. Some publishers such as the Associated Press get paid every time their content is published elsewhere	Business & Finance

question_title: How do you feel about people with HIV? [SEP] question_content: How do you feel about people with HIV? Do you try and understand them, help them, stay away from them? What are your feelings on this. [SEP] best_answer: You know, I think the best way to answer that is to know someone going through it.  For instance, say your sister is your best friend in the world.  Everthing is fine until one day you get a call from her saying that she has be tested positive for HIV.  What's the first thing that will go through your mind?\n\nNow add the fact that the reason she has HIV is because she was in a collision a year or so prior and was injured. She needed a blood transfusion and showed no symptoms.  She and her wonderful husband decide to have a child and as a routine check finds out that she was HIV positive.  Now what do you think?\n\nWell, I think that if the person I've known all my life suddenly came down with a disease like cancer or had a heart attack, I wouldn't stay away from him or her, but try to understand them and help them if they need help.  I also imagine what it would be like not having them in my life just because I stayed away from them knowing they had heart disease.  \n\nYes, I know that things like HIV can be passed on. But seriously, how are they going to pass it on to me?  \n\nIn essence, I think that if someone has HIV, I should treat them as someone who doesn't, as long as I'm not planning on sleeping with them:)\n\nI hope that answered your question. :)	Business & Finance
question_title: How does one deal with companies who buy old debt and try to get you to pay? [SEP] question_content: I have an old credit card account from 6 1/2 years ago that apparently an attorney orgagnization bought the debt and is now trying to collect. I have to question the validity since the original amount was about $1,800 now that are trying to say I owe $10,000. [SEP] best_answer: Dealing with old debt \nBy Lucy Lazarony • Bankrate.com \nDon't let an old debt come back to haunt you. \n\n\nSome debt collectors are unearthing old debts, debts that are five to 10 years old or more, in the hope of squeezing some fresh money out of unsuspecting consumers.\n\n"I had one guy who got a call on a debt 14 years later," says Gerri Detweiler, author of "The Ultimate Credit Handbook."\n\nA collection call on an old debt can be tricky to handle, and if you handle it wrong it could lead to big trouble down the road. \n\nFirst off, it's important to realize that an old unpaid debt can't hurt you nearly as much as a new unpaid debt. \n\n- advertisement - \n \n \nAn unpaid credit account will mar your credit report for seven years. But once your debt passes the seven-year mark, you're in the clear. \n\nWith newer debts, debt collectors may call and threaten to sue you day in and day out. With an older debt, any debt collector that threatens to take you to court is breaking the law.\n\nThat's quite a difference and it all hinges on whether the debt a collector is haranguing you about is beyond the statute of limitations for delinquent debt in your state.\n\nOnce a debt is older than the statute of limitations for debt in your state, a debt collector no longer has the right to sue you for payment. You may still have a moral obligation to pay back the debt, but you can't be sued over it.\n\n"They can still ask you to pay, but they can't threaten to sue. If they do, it's a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act," says John Ventura, a consumer attorney in Brownsville, Texas, and author of the e-book Stop Debt Collectors Cold.\n\nLet's say you still owe some money on an old credit card account left over from your college days, 10 years earlier. And let's say the statute of limitations for credit card accounts in your state is five years. \n\nA debt collector may call you and ask you for payment for this forgotten account, but he can't take you to court or threaten to sue you over it. If he does, he's violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. \n\nAnd since the debt is more than 7 years old, it's no longer listed on your credit report.\n\nWatch your step\n\nEven though a debt collector won't ever admit it, you're the one with the advantage here. But one little misstep could change all that.\n\nIn some states, making a partial payment to a debt collector or even acknowledging that you owe the money is enough to make an old debt new again.\n\nIf this happens, the five-year statute of limitations on your debt starts all over again. A debt collector has five more years in which to sue you for payment. And a non-payment on your new-again debt could be reported on your credit report. Then the advantage transfers to debt collectors.\n\nThe best way to handle a collection call for an old debt is to say as little as possible. Don't agree to pay. Don't acknowledge the debt. \n\nIn her book, "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts," attorney Robin Leonard offers the following advice: \n\n"You should never talk to the collection agency about it at all, even if they call at a permitted hour of the day. Just hang up the phone or put the receiver down and walk away."\n\nThe best way to respond to a collection notice on an old debt is in writing.\n\nUnder the law, a debt collector must send you a written notice telling you the amount of money you owe and the name of the creditor. If within 30 days of receiving this collection notice you write a letter back disputing the debt, a debt collector may not contact you.\n\nIt's a good idea to send this letter via certified mail so you'll have proof that the debt collector received it. Under the law, a collector may only renew collection activities if proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill, is sent to you. \n\n"Definitely seek a	Business & Finance

What are my tax consequenses, do i still have to report this amount? how? thanksDUCATION. [SEP] best_answer: Yes, you have to report it.  It was already reported to the IRS from the financial institution on a 1099r.  They would have sent you one also.  If you don't have it, you need to contact them and get it.  When you took the money out, hopefully you told the financial institution that you were taking out the money for education.  You needed to do that for them to put the withdrawal in the correct box on the 1099r.  \n\nI am a financial advisor, not a tax professional, so to make sure that everything is correct, I would advise you to have a tax professional take a look at everything.

I don't push my service onto others I give out cards and flyers and offer discount prices to introduce my touch, but thats about it. What else can I do to attract potential clients? Thanks in advance! [SEP] best_answer: As long as you're licensed in the state in which you are seeking clients (some people aren't), I would recommend checking with chiropractors and at figure salons. Give free talks about massage to the Optomists, Rotary club and Chamber of Commerse. Also, put an ad in the paper offering discounts for multiple massages, or couples. Write an article about massage and offer it as filler to the local paper. Offer massage at all the senior citizen places. (Remember, seniors are more delicate, so you have to go easy.)Lots of massage therapists make a wonderful living by specializing in massaging seniors. My Dad's masseuse got Christmas bonuses from her clients adding up into the thousands. She was really terrific. She was the only one of his caregivers that he remembered in his will. Do you know what she did with the money? She sent flowers to his children and his sister. You could be as beloved as our Marnny. She works 30 hours a week massaging seniors and makes a good 60K+ per year. Use your imagination. There are probably hundreds of other ways to promote your  business. Have you thought about donating a massage to a fundraiser in exchange for the names and phone numbers of the people who entered the drawing? Do you offer "M"bucks for referrals? (That's massage bucks, good for application toward a massage.) How about offering coupon books as gifts for friends and relatives? You could make a killing around this time of the year, because what do you get the guy who has everything?? Have you spoken to Human Resources Directors at local stress-inducing businesses? What a wonderful benefit to receive as a reward for a job well done! You could wind up with more business than you can handle! (That's when you raise your prices and hire help!) If you have a portable massage chair, what about traveling massages for executives? That's just a few ideas. I hope you do well in your search for clients!	Business & Finance

I did nothing wrong.  When I reported her to her boss he came and said he talked to others who worked there and no one else had a problem with her which I know isn't true, but they were afraid for thier jobs.  The thing that makes this so heartbreaking is that this is a nursing home and she stated very clear she doesn;t do the family thing and she hates children. I worry about all the little residents that I love. [SEP] best_answer: You should look into the ethics standards section(s) of the Joint Commission agency, this agency regulates almost every aspect of a health care facility and there practices. Also you can get OSHA involved, this agency also deals with the health care but only in the "safety"  aspect. I have learned that the word safety also implies not only to hazardous materials and situations but to safety in the "work environment" in that a coworker can conduct themselves in a threatening way (as to) and there by creating an unsafe working environment. This is not a word play, it is a fact. you should look into this.	Business & Finance

question_title: how long do you have to keep inactive employee files? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Many in business have asked the title question, often in frustration. Even in this electronic age businesses run on paper; consider how much information exists both electronically and in hard copy. Paper, which we seem to have in excess in business, will be with us for some time. And the piles keep getting taller and the files fuller. Can't we ever get rid of some of this?\n\nWe can partly conquer the paper plague. The problems lie in determining what must be retained and for how long and deciding how to get unnecessary material separated from the rest.\n\nThe employee records of interest to most businesses fall into two categories: the financial side of employment and all other employment documentation. The financial side is the more orderly; business owners find the most variation in record-keeping requirements among documents kept in personnel files. Some of the confusion arises from the fact that different Federal laws specify different retention periods for the same documents.\n\nFinancial Records\nCompensation records -- amounts and payment dates, straight time and overtime hours and pay, pension payments, benefits plan payments and other additions and deductions -- should be kept for four years. Affecting most employers, the four-year requirement is specified in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and Federal Unemployment Tax Act and by Federal Income Tax Withholding. The Equal Pay Act and Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) designate some of these documents for three years' retention, but the longer period applies in practice. The Equal Pay Act and FLSA also require that daily work schedules, pay rates and weekly compensation be retained for three years; these are not addressed in the laws designating four years' retention. Likewise, tax records -- wages subject to withholding, taxes withheld and other tax information -- are subject to the four-year requirement.\n\nNon-financial Records\nAccording to FICA, Unemployment and Withholding, basic employee data -- name, address, gender, birth date, etc. -- must be retained four years. Personnel files are maintained for active employees, so this requirement is reasonably interpreted as needing to keep these records for four years following termination. One exception under FSLA, applicable to many small businesses, involves work permits for minors; these be retained until the employee leaves or reaches majority age.\n\nRecords of Actions\nRecords of actions such as promotions, demotions, transfers, layoffs, recalls, terminations and such must be kept for one year per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). But for all practical purposes these are part the personnel file for the duration of employment and longer.\n\nSafety and Health Records\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) mandates the longest retention periods. Records of exposure to toxic substances and blood-borne pathogens must be retained for the duration of employment plus 30 years. OSHA sometimes designates even longer periods for exposure to certain substances, and some states have "right-to-know" laws requiring retention of exposure records for the duration of employment plus 40 years. We can consider 4 years as the standard for compensation and tax information, but a personnel file can hold documents having legal retention periods of one to five years and 30 to 40 years after termination. There are about a dozen federal laws specifying these retention periods.\n\nAccumulated Records\nWhat to do about accumulated records? Simple for financial records: discard compensation and tax records after four years. Obvious? Perhaps, but one can sometimes be surprised upon discovering dusty caches of such records much older than four years.\n\nThe answer isn't as simple for documents held in personnel files. We have good reason to keep records of employment actions for the duration of e	Business & Finance

question_title: why is suicide so looked down upon? [SEP] question_content: I don't judge you for your choices, so why judge others for theirs? [SEP] best_answer: It would seem that what is meant by the term "looked down upon" would reflect the need of a proper angle into appraising such a question by the poser (addressing the question).\nSuicide is the taking of a life by the "self." \nIt seems that from a legal aspect the taking of any life is against the norm of explicit rule of law and this would be an action or inaction to prevent a murder, and thusly possible under our society's law. \nIt (the commission of the act itself) is also a terrible contingent upon the future of the surviving significant others.\nFrom another angle (spiritual) in many religions such an act is considered to be a crime (sin) against a creature of God; however not a condemnation.\nIn my opinion these views are not derogatory but on the contrary it is a reach by the 'social norm' to extend humane buttress unto an individual so inclined.

question_title: do you think its ideal to engage in a restaurant / bar & grill  business? [SEP] question_content: I am  single, young professional and with my exposures on business I can rate myself on the 3 level when the rating is 1 to 5 for experience. Now now, I wanted to gather some figures on whether I should go on and make a move for food business or have to eye another prospective project. I am passionate eating but havent got the cracks on cooking. I work for certain food chains before as a management trainee. Now I am working in a trading company... tell me your idea... I am most willing to listen. [SEP] best_answer: If you're looking to make your first venture into the business world as an owner, I suggest one of two things:\n\n1) Forget the food business, it's the most complicated industry out there. In no other industry are you expected to be a warehouse and a manufacturer, with parts that are perishable, be a retailer, run a delivery business, and sell service also.\n\n2) If you insist on the food business, especially with no experience, find a very, very well structured franchise to buy into. Forget the cost, it's a drop in the bucket when you weigh out the chances of success or failure compared to trying to build a concept from scratch.\n\nThe risks of getting involved in the food business are evidenced by the failure rate of restaurants. These failure rates don't even take into account all the country club, college and university food services that lose money every year and have to be subsidized by other departments. There are unsubstantiated rumors about the food industry that place failure rates as high as 90% in the first year. Though that is a gross exageration, the failure rate in the restaurant world is high, just ask your banker, accountant or lawyer. They deal with it every day. There's a reason restaurant loans are among the toughest to get approved for. According to a report in Restaurant Startup & Growth magazine, based on information gathered from the National Restaurant Association, it's estimated that around 57% of restaurants don't live past the five year mark. Of these, the main casualties are independent restaurants. While 7 of 10 independent restaurants will likely fail, 7 of 10 franchise restaurants will survive. As there are many, many people out there that don't realize the value that real structure will bring to their restaurant, and increase their chances of survival, the greater number of independent restaurants opening compared to franchise restaurants pushes the total restaurant failure rate to 57%.\n\nMost other businesses contain elements of only one or two different industries. With a simpler business, it is much easier to focus on marketing and growth than with a restaurant. Inside a restaurant, most your day is filled with operational procedures, and you CAN NOT work ON a business if you are working IN the business 60 hours or more a week.\n\nBrandon O'Dell\nO'Dell Consulting\nRestaurants/Retail/Bars\nwww.bodellconsulting.com	Business & Finance
question_title: On the job injury pay? [SEP] question_content: If a person has an on the job injury, is the employer required to pay the employee their full wage during time off due to the injury, in California? [SEP] best_answer: I have been a workers' comp. paralegal for 20 years - IN VIRGINIA.  Here you are entitled to 2/3 of your weekly pre-injry gross wages if you cannot work at all.  If you can work light duty and you have a wage loss, then you are entitled to 2/3rds of the difference between what you were making before you got hurt (average weekly wage gross) and what you are earning after the injury.  BUT-laws vary widely from state to state.  I'd go to Ask.Com and look up the California Workers' Compensation Commission or Industrial Commission.  All states have these websites and I'm sure the info. that applies to you is on there.  Good luck, and I hope you are better soon.	Business & Finance

question_title: When dealing with sound, you some times see RMS when it comes to wattage. What does RMS mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Great question.\n\nLiterally RMS means Root Mean Square, it is a simple way to take the average of a varying electrical signal.\n\nAs you know, a pure musical tone looks like the up and down pattern of waves when you drop a pebble in a calm pond. This shape is called a sine curve.\n\nSine curves vary from negative to positive values so if you add them up to take an average they would "cancel out".\n\nThe trick is to square (multiply by itself) each value before adding them. This turns all the negatives into postive values. No cancelling! Then you take the MEAN (the average). Then to get back to a "normal" number, you take the square root.\n\nThe problem is that in audio power, the average power in watts is really just a direct average of the actual power output. Since power is always positive, there is no need to use the RMS averaging method. Really you just sample the power for a while and average it the regular old fashioned way.\n\nHowever, because you can get a quick approximation of the power output of a system from the RMS value of the electrical current of a sine curve, marketers in order to make you feel awed have taken to calling audio power "RMS power". It is really just average power though and is a fairly meaningless measure of goodness. For instance you might have two systems with equal power, and one could sound like a dollar-store radio! LOL! but so true!\n\nThis is just marketing silliness. But it sounds good doesn't it?	Business & Finance

question_title: how to make partitions 4 ur pc hard disk? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For my PC HDD for the very first time i did it by booting my pc with a windows 98 boot cd. From the boot option i chose boot with cd-rom support. Then in the command prompt i typed fdisk. When it ran i chose to create primary partition first and then i chose no to use part of my HDD and gave a size like 25%. When it was done i chose extended DOS partition to create other three logical DOS drives. For the extended DOS partition i chose to use the rest of my HDD for it. When done it asked me to create logical drives in it. I gave 33% for the 1st and 2nd one and the rest for the last one. when done i exited the fdisk program and rebooted the system and started installing windows 98.\n\nNow the above option is for the first time if u have no other PC. If u have one more HDD with operating system in it or another PC then u can attach ur new HDD to that PC and partition it with third party softwares like PQ Partition Magic.\n\nIf u want to install Windows 2000 or Windows XP in that HDD just boot ur PC with ur Windows 2000 or Windows XP bootable CD and do partitions in it when prompted. It is very easy. It will show u what to do in detail on ur screen.\n\nPlay Safe...	Computers & Internet

question_title: I need an ip address to go around the internet without being blocked.? [SEP] question_content: See in my school EVERYTHING is blocked. The only way you can get around is if you find an ip address to hide behind walls to use myspace or etc.\n\nWe had an ip address with this program that let us use myspace but unfortuantly too many people started using it so they blocked the ip address.\n\nI need an ip address to get around NOT websites urls. Anyone can help? =) [SEP] best_answer: This is my new standard format response for myspace users. First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldn’t have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more “internet friends” you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they won’t mind. Lastly, if this standard format response does not apply to your particular myspace question, oh well, I guess I won’t have you on my top five list, huh?

If you have anything else inside like sound cards or TV capture or anything, remove it temporarily.  Try to re-install XP like that.  If that fails, go into your system BIOS (usually press F2 key right at computer startup time) and select safe defaults for all your BIOS settings.  Reboot and try installation once again.  I assume you are using an original certified copy of Windows XP on CD.  If all this fails, you may very well have something wrong with your motherboard.  It is also possible, though very unlikely, that both your RAM sticks had something happen to them at the same time.  You can get a RAM tester to run from a floppy disk.  See the sources below.

[SEP] question_content: how do u erase ur hard drive and if u selected the convos on msn and yahoo to not be saved does it still save it to the hard drive? explain how to erase and if it does? [SEP] best_answer: First, do you really want to reformat your hard drive? Rather than type out a step-by-step, go here. http://www.cyberwalker.net/faqs/how-tos/reinstall-faq.html. I like this site cuse you can look at the FAQs and see if you really need to reformat. If you have options set not to save, it will not save. Reformatting doesn’t “erase” anything; it just changes the file extensions so that they can’t be found in the conventional way. The only way for files not to be found is to destroy the hard drive itself. Yeah, you can get wipe Disk, that would take care of any spyware, worm or trojan problems.	Computers & Internet

(i would prefere to do it this way if possible due to the fact i have to move the mini disc player from another room which is hooked up thru my amp. but can i just do it the way discribed above.if you suggest going thru my amp would be better...what leads do i use and where do i put them in and out? (i would have to move this also).. if you have any other ideas i would be very grateful. thanks all. [SEP] best_answer: OK... this is called Sound Capture. The way it works is this: you connect an audio lead from the headphone jack socket of your MiniDisc player to the Line In jack socket on your computer's sound card.\n\nYou then start up the "Windows Sound Recorder" program. Find it by going to All Programs > Accessories > Entertainment > Sound Recorder\n\nNow, as a test, start playing a track on your MiniDisc player - the sound should come out of your PC's speakers - make sure your sound is turned on with the volume up.\n\nNow go back to the beginning of the MiniDisc track you want to capture. Click the round red Record button in Windows Sound Recorder, then within a few seconds press Play on your MiniDisc - the capture should begin... and when the MiniDisc track ends and fades out, click the Stop button in Windows Sound Recorder.\n\nNow click File > Save As in Windows Sound Recorder, and save the file as a WAV wherever you like.\n\nThis is the general way of capturing sound. It isn't a transfer of the original digital file, so there may be a small drop in quality, but it will still be good.\n\nPlease post again if you need more detail.\n\nDC :)	Computers & Internet

question_title: csma/cd jam signal? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If a collision is heard, both of the senders will send a jam signal over the Ethernet. This jam signal indicates to all other devices on the Ethernet segment that there has been a collision, and they should not send data onto the wire. (A second indication of a collision is the noise created by the collision itself.) \n\nAfter sending the jam signal, each of the senders will wait a random amount of time before beginning the entire process over. The random time helps to ensure that the two devices don't transmit simultaneously again.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how to use openGL in C#? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The C# Graphics Library (hosted on Sourceforge), has code which wraps the OpenGL Application Programming Interfaces.  Another option is to use "SharpGL", another wrapper written by Dave Kerr and hosted on CodeProject.\n\nIf you wish to create your own wrappers for OpenGL in C#, you will need to use Platform/Invoke to call the API functions that are exported from the GL Dynamic Link Libraries.  This requires using the System.Runtime.InteropServices library and special declarations for the function exports (and parameters) using attributes to declare them.\n\nSeveral of these Platform/Invoke declarations have been provided by the community on the PInvoke.NET Wiki.  I've included the links to all three resources below.	Computers & Internet

When the initial setup is complete, you can create address book entries for all of your buddies, in which you can enter their real names.

question_title: what is an infinite loop? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A non terminating infinite loop is usually considered an error.\n\nHowever there are some applications which are infinite loops on purpose. The are usually servers for event driven applications. Consider web servers. They loop infinitely until a request comes to them. They process the request and go back to their loop waiting for the next request.\n\nInfinite loops can be nasty, so early computer theorist wondered if there was a way to detect them. In fact certain problems could be solved if we could tell if a program went into an infinite loop or not.\n\nAlan Turing, one of the founders of computer science, provide the "halting problem." It answered the question, and he proved that one couldn't write a program which could determine if a general program contained an infinite loop or not.\n\nThe proof (by contradiction) goes along these lines.\n\nAssume program, P, exists, and it reads another program, p, and tests it for infinite loops. It exhibits the following behavior:\n\nP(p) prints "Halts" if p halts.\n\nP(p) prints "Does not halt" if p does not halt.\n\nPretty straight forward assumption... ok?\n\nNow, let's modify P to make a new program P', that does almost the same things as P, but just slightly different.\n\nP'(p) goes into an infinite loop itself if p halts.\n\nP'(p) halts if p goes into an infinite loop.\n\nBasically, P' does the opposite of p.\n\nSince P' works on any program, let's run the following:\n\nP'(P') - basically have P' test itself. What does it do?\n\nIf P' halts, then P' doesn't halt.\nIf P' doesn't halt, then P' halts.\n\nIt can't do something and not do that thing at the same time. It's a contradiction, which unravels back to the assumption that P can exist.\n\nTherefore P cannot exist.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How do format my system and not loose any data? [SEP] question_content: My system gets hung up frequently and I keep getting the blue screen sometimes.So I've decided to format my C: which is my main drive. I have a windows 98 SE currently installed. Don't have the install CD, but I have the whole windows 98 installation files in my D drive. I've got things like mp3, important documents & photos, MS Office, Visual Studio, Photoshop, etc on my main drive. Is there an easy way to format my system and re-install my current version of windows? [SEP] best_answer: No. There is no eay way. Perhaps the easiest is to simply buy another hard disk (if you can actually install one in your hardware) and install a fresh copy of the operating system on it, making it the a new c drive, but this raises some particular issues. Some applications (and many operating systems) require that certain files (configuration stuff, for instance) be on the same drive from which the system has booted (or on which the application is installed). So changing to a new drive like this will involve some obscure issues dependent on not so obvious details of how this or that program (including the operating system) was designed and implemented. \n\n==========\nThere are some things you'll have to think about here, before you do anything at all. I'll assume you aren't going to get a new hard disk, and discuss the problem as you laid it out. Namely, reformatting the existing C drive and reinstalling your system on it. \n\nDo you really need to reformat? You may be able to reinstall Windows over itself, and if a damage Windows file is part of the problem, escape without the major pain of reformatting. \n\n========\nFirst, without the installation CD (or copies of all the files from it) you're sunk. I'm not sure from what you say whether you have a copy of the CD on your second drive or not. If you don't ... Trouble lies that way. \n\nSecond, You must backup everything you have on the C drive that is not reinstalled from the distribution disks. And you must be certain that whatever backup method you choose will be able to actually read the backup formatted files after the reinstallation. It is not unusual, sadly, for some backup programs to be unable to actually read in the backup files it creates. \n"Backup" includes the operating system (Microsoft has dropped support for 98 and for SE, so you would be well advised to update -- my suggestion is to 2000, but some folks are willing to settel for 2000 Lite -- ie, XP. Or even to make this your opportunity to switch to a vendor who poses fewer problems -- the main option as I write this is one of the kind_of_Unixen), Linux -- my favorite is the SuSE distribution). And "backup" includes application files as well. Identifying just which files these are, and where they are is not always easy. Clearly all your pictures and documents you've written and would qualify, but applications (and operating systems) usually have several configuration files, history files, backup files, index files, ... which it will save time to have copes of. But, if an application doesn't provide for saving these and reinstalling them over a fresh installtion of the application, ...  There will be problems here as well. You might have to reconfigure some or all of your applications (and the operating system too) after reinstallation. this is a pain, but may be unavoidable...\n\nThird, you must be certain that any new hardware you've installed will be recognized by the Windows boot routines at reinstallation time. It might be wise to start a reinstallation (with the intent of cancelling it essentially immediately) to test whether the BIOS will call up the Windows installation routines from wherever they are, and whether they will be able to find the new hardware. Since hardware support (ie, drivers and design troubleshooting) for 98SE has mostly been dropped, increasingly more hardware will not be supported for 98SE.  Without support, you'll have to write your own drivers -- not recommended.\n\nFourth, you must, when reinstalling, configure your software in ways which are compatible with how they used to be configured, lest there be odd (perhaps fatal) happenings from the incompatibilites. Some things don't matter -- like icon colors or the shape of the cursor, but some will.\n\nFifth, keep a record of what you did and why at each step of the way, starting before you begin backing up. Include all instructions (and options) and the immediate re	Computers & Internet

question_title: how personal storage area network works, how good they are, and is it worth the money? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Defining SAN:\n\nStorage networks are distinguished from other forms of network storage by the low-level access method that they use. Data traffic on these networks is very similar to those used for internal disk drives, like ATA and SCSI.\n\nIn a storage network, a server issues a request for specific blocks, or data segments, from specific disk drives. This method is known as block storage. The device acts in a similar fashion to an internal drive, accessing the specified block, and sending the response across the network.\n\nIn more traditional file storage access methods, like SMB or NFS, a server issues a request for an abstract file as a component of a larger file system, managed by an intermediary computer. The intermediary then determines the physical location of the abstract resource, accesses it on one of its internal drives, and sends the complete file across the network.\n\nMost storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and devices, though they do not use its low-level physical interface.\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nSharing storage usually simplifies storage administration and adds flexibility since cables and storage devices do not have to be physically moved to move storage from one server to another. Note, though, that with the exception of SAN file systems and clustered computing, SAN storage is still a one-to-one relationship. That is, each device (or Logical Unit Number (LUN)) on the SAN is "owned" by a single computer (or initiator). In contrast, Network Attached Storage (NAS) allows many computers to access the same set of files over a network. It is now possible to combine the SAN and NAS using a NAS head, such as the gateway manufactured by ONStor\n\nSANs tend to increase storage capacity utilization, since multiple servers can share the same growth reserve.\n\nOther benefits include the ability to allow servers to boot from the SAN itself. This allows for a quick and easy replacement of faulty servers since the SAN can be reconfigured so that a replacement server can use the LUN of the faulty server. This process can take as little as half an hour and is a relatively new idea being pioneered in newer data centres.\n\nSANs also tend to enable more effective disaster recovery processes. A SAN attached storage array can replicate data belonging to many servers to a secondary storage array. This secondary array can be local or remote.\n\n\nSAN types:\n\nSANs are normally built on an infrastructure specially designed to handle storage communications. Thus, they tend to provide faster and more reliable access than higher level protocols such as NAS.\n\nThe most common SAN technology is Fibre Channel networking with the SCSI command set. A typical Fibre Channel SAN is made up of a number of Fibre Channel switches which are connected together to form a fabric or network.\n\nAn alternative, and more recent (2003), SAN protocol is iSCSI which uses the same SCSI command set over TCP/IP (and, typically, Ethernet). In this case, the switches would be Ethernet switches.\n\nOne alternative to iSCSI is the ATA-over-Ethernet or AoE protocol which embeds the ATA protocol inside of raw Ethernet frames. While a raw Ethernet protocol like AoE cannot be routed without something else performing the encapsulation, it does provide a simple discovery model with low overhead.\n\nConnected to the SAN will be one or more servers(hosts) and one or more disk arrays, tape libraries, or other storage devices. In the case of a Fibre Channel SAN, the servers would use special Fibre Channel host bus adapters (HBAs) and optical fiber. iSCSI SANs would normally use Ethernet network interface cards, and often specialized TOE cards.\n\nStorage area networks are of two kinds - centralized storage area networks and distributed storage area networks\n\n\nCompatibility:\n\nOne of the early problems with Fibre Channel SANs was that the switches and other hardware from different manufacturers were not entirely compat	Computers & Internet

question_title: How do I get MS Excel '97 to display exponents properly, as in 7y "squared" (with a small superscripted 2)? [SEP] question_content: The help files say to use e+, e-, E+ or E- "in a section" (whatever that is) to display a signed exponent. [SEP] best_answer: You found the part of the help manual about formatted a number to see it in scientific notation (mantissa * 10^exponent) where Excel uses E instead of the "10 to the power" notation.\n\nI don't have Excel 97 handy, but two approaches worked in a later version:\nMake the text appear the way I wanted (with superscript exponents) in Word, then copy and paste it in.\nType the cell contents 7x2, then edit the cell, highlight just the "2" with the mouse, choose Format / Cell / Font and mark it "superscript."  Excel only changes the highlighted text.  \n\nWith both of the approaches, the cell contents are still "7x2" as a text string.  Excel does not see the superscripted 2 as an exponent.  As you probably know, in an Excel formula ^ is the exponentiation symbol.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how to share microsoft outlook  with others? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Although Outlook is not designed for multiple users, it is possible to set it up for more than one user.  First, configure it to download multiple email accounts.  Then, set up rules to direct mail addressed to individuals to seperate subfolders in the inbox.  When someone responds to their mail, it will default to be from the email that received the message.  When starting new messages, Outlook will default to the primary account; other users will need to click on "accounts" and choose that the message be sent from their account.  This isn't an ideal solution, but can work.  Outlook will not know where to distribute messages that have been sent via blind copy, and sent messages will all be in the same folder, although users can move sent messages into their own subfolders.\n\nAn alternative way to have two people share one computer is to have one user utilize Outlook for their mail, and the other user utilize Outlook Express, or Thunderbird by Mozilla.

question_title: when something is deleted on your computer,it's still on your hard drive .right? [SEP] question_content: If its still on your hard drive, when time passes and more memory is taken up on the computer, is the old (deleted) data over written on the hard drive and forever unaccesable, or is a program needed to get rid of it.\nAnd also, does defragmentation also rewrite the memory space and rid the info. [SEP] best_answer: When you first delete a file, it does still exist on your hard drive. However, the space that the file took up on the drive is now free to be reused by other files. This does mean that a new file can overwrite the old file, making it difficult to read or retrieve. However, even when a file has been written over, it is still possible to retrieve the underlying data. I have read that in some cases, experts with advanced tools can retrieve files that have been overwritten five or six times. There are programs out there that make sure data is really deleted by overwriting a file up to a hundred times with random data. This is probably overkill, but I'm sure it's effective. In most cases for normal people, such extreme measures should not be necessary.	Computers & Internet
question_title: what is drum printer and what is its merits and demerits? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A drum printer is a printer which uses a rotating drum, some small 'hammers' and a large inked ribbon to print text on paper. The printer has a drum in which all the printable characters are etched on to it.  The characters are actually RAISED up NOT etched in to the drum. The drum will be postioned parallel to the paper and ribbon and spins at a very high speed. The hammers will be positioned behind the paper. In other words the paper is in between the drum/ribbon and the hammers. \n\nAs the drum spins the respective hammer(s) will hit the paper pushing the paper against the ribbon and against the drum. This will then leave the imprint of the character on the paper. These printers usually have many of these hammers, some in the order of 24-48.  The drum has the characters etched on it in multiple rows usually skewed to the left by one character position.  See below:\n\n ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI...etc\n BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI...etc\n CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHI...etc\n\nThis format allows for every character to be in every position at any ONE rotation of the drum. When the particular character at a particular point needs to be printed, the respective hammer 'fires' striking the paper against the ribbon then against the drum. In this operation you can have as few as 1 hammmer firing or as many as al l of them...it just depends on what needs to be printed.\nHope this helps.  I have left out many particulars but this should be enough to give you a basic idea.	Computers & Internet

It’s a format that web sites and blogs can use to send updated headlines to you via services like My Yahoo!. My Yahoo! gathers the content you select from a variety of sources and displays it for you in one convenient location. Syndication means you don't have to visit each site individually to see what's new -- you simply scan headlines or brief article summaries and click to read the full text. That’s the "really simple" part. And it’s "really simple" for publishers to make their content accessible this way too.\n\nTo use RSS, you will need a special RSS news reader or aggregator that will allow you to collect and display RSS service. RSS news readers allow you to view the service you select all together in the same place and, by automatically retrieving updates, stay current with new content soon after it is published.\n\nThere are many different news readers available, many for free.

Aikido is very laid back and has a natural, non-aggressive feel to it.\nIf you want a little more aggression, try jiu-jutsu (the Gracie forms are great for winning tournaments) or judo.\n\nAnd if you want to have fun and try something really different, try capoeira.\n\nAll these styles and more are available for view at wikipedia.org, and most of the major styles have websites (ie. www.aikiweb.com for aikido)	Sports

question_title: Why is Michael Jordan the best basketball player ever? [SEP] question_content: I don't agree that he is... but tell me WHY YOU think he is.  Is it the number of 'rings'? Is it his scoring? Was it the shoes? What was it that made you believe Michael Jordan was the best basketball player in the history of the NBA?  I don't hear a lot of substanitive argument, just statements that people seem unwilling to defend or debate.\n\nSo come on, give it your best shot!   \n\n(After over 700 answers, this is my first question, and I'd really like to know why people believe what they do).  Thanks in advance for your responses! Have a good one!!! [SEP] best_answer: Well, let's see..... he can jump really high. Or maybe it's because he doesn't miss any shots. No, that can't be it. Perhaps, he's the best because he won slam dunk contests. Plus he pioneered the long baggy shorts. No, no, no....I think I got it:  ITS BECAUSE ESPN SAYS SO !!!!  Yeah, thats it.\n\nSeriously, sorry to break it to you folks, but Michael Jordan is not the best player of all time. There is no legitimate argument, period. He might be one of the most exciting players to watch, but in terms of all around talent, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are far and away much better. \n\nThe reason some people say Jordan is the best is because there has been no athlete in the past two decades who has been more over-hyped, more promoted, and more marketed than Michael Jordan. He could not possibly live up to those standards. Between movies, shoes, cereal boxes, fast food and everything else he's advertised, who hasn't heard of Michael Jordan ? \n\nHe came along at just the right time. David Stern became commissioner and heavily marketed the NBA to corporate America. What better face to put on it but Jordan. He played a flashier style of b-ball, be was polite and accesible to writers and fans. In other words, he was family friendly. But he played for the lowly Chicago Bulls.\n\nSo maybe if we increased the number of playoff teams from 12 to 16, the Bulls might make the playoffs and we can have Michael on t.v. more. And maybe if we added a slam dunk contest to the all-star game, people can see even more of Michael. Plus, we now have a 24 hour sports channel so nobody can possibly miss his high flying dunks and acrobatic moves.\n\nNow, I 'm not trying to take anything away from Jordan. He was a great player FOR HIS TIME. He had great talent and was exciting to watch. But as far as dominating the league, that didn't happen until Bird and Magic had gone and the league expanded to 27 and 29 teams, thereby depleting the talent pool.	Sports

question_title: pacman pacman.? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone agree with me that the pacman will eat barerra alive? manny Pacquiao ofcourse. [SEP] best_answer: Barrera will definitely avoid being knocked out.  He won't fight like Morales did.  Morales was too aggressive.  Pacman and Roach called it correctly that Morales would try to finish the match early because he fears he wouldn't have the stamina for an extended battle.\n\nBarrera however is a different case.  Remember when Pacman beat him the first time, it wasn't a knock down.  The man was standing when his corner threw in the towel.  I'm guessing this means he can take Pacman's punches (although it reduced him to a punching bag).\n\nI think Pacman will get UD victory over Barrera this time.  The judges will probably not look very favorably to Barrera running away.\n\nSantana-\nWhy did you say that Pacman is avoiding Marquez.  As I recall, Pacman did ask for a rematch and it was Marquez who said no.  But in any case, I am willing to concede that Pacman might have lost that fight.  But he has learned a lot since.  He came into that fight overconfident thinking that he has nothing left that needs improvement.  But that fight and the fight against Morales showed him what the skills are that he lacked.	Sports

question_title: Why are the Detroit Pistons losing to the Miami Heat, Detroit is a far better team, but they are being beaten? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I may not get the best answer for this, because you are obviously a Pistons fan and I am not, but there are several reasons, and if you are open minded, you will see that I am right.\n\n1.  Detroit is the 2006 version LA Lakers of the 2004 NBA Finals. A favorite to win, yet so cocky that they believe that they cannot lose.  The media has only perpetuated this. i.e. Even after almost falling to the Cavs (the Cavs?!) most people had them as favorites against the Heat.  Had the media pegged the Pistons as even or underdogs, that may have motivated them some, but as Flip Saunders has said himself, Detroit feels like the "Fat Cats."  \n\n2.  Miami only had their "core" together for 9 games (8 or 9, im not sure) this entire season.  Thats not much for a team that was assembled about 7 months ago.  They are just now finding out how to play as a team.\n\n3.  No one thinks about the fact that Detroit and Miami have the same record in the second half of the season.  Thats right, Detroit DOES NOT have a better record than Miami in the second half of the season, and the Heat, have a far better playoff record than the Pistons.  As Shaq has said, "the regular season don't mean nothing."\n\n4.  Miami is a deeper team than Detroit.  Look at Detroit, after McDyess and maybe Hunter, they have no one coming off the bench that is a threat.  Detroit was deeper last year, but foolishly made a trade with the Magic that only made them worse.  In effect, Detroit gambled that their starting five would not get injured or fatigued.\n\n5.  As a Piston fan, you're tired of hearing this, I'm sure, as I am tired of saying it, but lets face the facts, Wade and O'neal would have gone to the Finals last year, had they not BOTH been injured.  \n\n6.  The Pistons never admit that they need to adjust anything.  Example, whenever the Pistons lost games this year it was attributed to "boredom" with the NBA.  C'mon, boredom?  Their "If it aint rought it aint right" slogan is a cop out.  And whenever they lose (especially to the Heat) they give no credit to Miami, which has infuriated, and motivated them.  Admittedly, the Pistons ARE the best comeback team in the NBA, but do they LIKE going down 3-2 or 3-1, I dont think so.\n\n7.  The emergence of a true superstar.  Dwyane Wade is becoming a super-superstar in front of their very eyes.  The best defense cannot stop him, no one can stop him.  Dwyane Wade is becoming the Flash.\n\nHaving said all that, I will also tell you what every other Heat fan won't.  I am scared shitless, that SOMEHOW Detroit will win the series.  I mean if they win the Next 2 games, game 7 is up for grabs, and Phoenix did it earlier this year, and San Antonio almost did it.  So although it is not likely, it is possible, that Detroit will win.  I know it and every Miami fan on the planet knows it.  But thats where we differ, Miami fans and players admit that they can be beaten, whereas, Detroit fans and Pistons will still think they can win, even after they've lost.  I hope this is Miami's year, and it SEEMS like it, but if anyone can beat them, it's Detroit.\n\nGO HEAT!	Sports

[SEP] question_content: j'aimerais le savoir car je dépenserai plus de calories en faisant de la course à pied.\nJ'aimerais avoir des détails précis, d'allure, de temps, etc [SEP] best_answer: Augustin f a raison. Cependant, il y a des différences de définitions selon qu'on utilise l'un ou l'autre mot. Du moins pour ceux qui pratiquent, c'est l'usage.\nFaire du jogging signifie que l'on coure régulièrement mais sans but autre que la forme. Toujours la même allure sur un temps donné (30, 40 ou 60 minutes).\nFaire de la course à pieds signifie plutôt qu'on s'entraîne d'une manière diversifiée. Plusieurs fois par semaine et à allures variées sur des distances et durées différentes à chaque fois. Tout ça pour améliorer ses performances et faires des compétitions.\nVoilà, personnellement, la différence que je fais entre les deux.\n\nAu fait, El Pechin, fartlek, c'est suédois.\n\nPetit ajout à propos de ton autre question, Cordelia, un type qui fait de la course à pieds selon la définition sur laquelle nous somme d'accord, fais du jogging (ou un ptit footing :-)) POUR RÉCUPÉRER !

question_title: Can females play on male sports teams in college? [SEP] question_content: Kathy was a student at State College. The student population was 45% male and 55% female. There were 9 male varsity sports teams and no female sports teams. Kathy wanted to play on a college team, but did not wish to leave State College to go elsewhere. Does she have any other recouse? [SEP] best_answer: If they let women play on men's teams, then they would have to let men play on women's teams, so the answer is, no.  It is not their fault which school that any player chooses to attend.  By law they should have women's varsity sports.  Have her check again to see which ones are available.  If they don't have the one she wants, she could petition to have it added.	Sports

[SEP] question_content: I noticed the teams wearing the Puma soccer shirts look more sweaty than the teams that wear other brand such as Nike or Adidas.  Wouldn't it slow you down if the shirt was clinging to your body? [SEP] best_answer: no its more stream line.. they have different fabrics in both of their uniforms.. (reserves and homes).. because the heat reacts differently in different countries.. but when it clings to your body the air doent flow through it causing a reduced draft (meaning they dont get held back as much and they can run faster)	Sports

question_title: Which MLB stadiums are considered hitters parks? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: espn.com has a link that provides park factors for each season from 2001 to 2005. This is an objective measure and can be broken down by runs, hits, 2b, 3b, HRs or bbs.\n\nPark Factor compares the rate of stats at home vs. the rate of stats on the road.\nA rate higher than 1.000 favors the hitter. Below 1.000 favors the pitcher.\nPF = ((homeRS + homeRA)/(homeG)) / ((roadRS + roadRA)/(roadG))\n\nFor the 2005 season the top 5 hitter ballparks for runs were:\n\n1. Coors field (Rockies)       1.285\n2. Citizens Bank (Phillies)    1.161\n3. Great American (Reds)       1.128\n4. Turner Field(Braves)        1.095\n5.

question_title: i have a shimano deore mega 9 crankset. can i use an xt 8 speed rear mech or does it have to be a 9 speed? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You probably need to repost and clarify a few things-  do you mean crankset (which is the front three gears) or cassette (which is the gearing on the rear wheel, usually 7 - 9 speeds)? Also, by rear mech, do you mean derailleur, or rear cassette?\n\nI can tell you this - when Shimano moved from 8 to 9 speeds they changed the chain, so a 9 speed crankset and an 8 speed cassette might be problematic.\n\nIf you are only worried about your rear derailleur, then you should not have much of a problem - just set your adjustment screws correctly and go.

Or perhaps you think they'll go the other way with Mike Fisher of the Senators? [SEP] best_answer: I think Brind'Amour will get it simply because of his leadership and play all the way up to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  Generally teams that go further in the NHL Playoffs do get a higher look at being given awards.  It's more prestigious for them, they worked harder for it.

question_title: the lenth of cricket bat & weight of ball? [SEP] question_content: send details of these questions. [SEP] best_answer: The rules of the game limit the allowable size for a bat as not more than 38 in (965 mm) long and the blade may not be more than 4.25 in (108 mm) wide. Bats typically weigh from 2 lb 8 oz to 3 lb (1.1 to 1.4 kg) though there is no standard. The handle is usually covered with a rubber or cloth sleeve to enhance grip and the face of the bat may have a protective film.\nFor men's cricket, the ball must weigh between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (155.9 and 163.0 g) and measure between 8 13/16 and 9 in (224 and 229 mm) in circumference.

question_title: names of emmitt smith's children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Sometime in Emmit Smith's academic career, he received a paper with his name spelled "Emmitt" (notice the two T's). Emmit liked it, however, and decided to start spelling his name the same way. Thus was born the new Emmitt Smith. His father is Emmit Smith II and as a child, to avoid confusion, he was nicknamed "Scoey." He married Patricia Southall, on April 22, 2000. She is a former Miss Virginia, and the ex-wife of actor/comedian Martin Lawrence. Their son, Emmitt IV, was born on Smith's 33rd birthday, May 15. His entire family was on-hand and present on the sidelines that fateful October day in 2002 when he surpassed Walter Payton for the NFL rushing title.\n\nOn August 14, 2006, Emmitt James Smith, Sr., his grandfather died in Pensacola, he was 82.\n\nIn September 2005, Smith signed on to serve as a studio analyst on the NFL Network show, NFL Total Access.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, at halftime of the Cowboys-Redskins game (broadcast on Monday Night Football), Smith was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor with his longtime teammates Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin.\n\nSmith becomes eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, and it is widely expected that he will be inducted on his first attempt. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nIn 2006 he became one of the celebrities on the third season of Dancing with the Stars - Videos - [1]. It premiered on ABC September 12, which ended his time with NFL Network for the time being. He was partnered with Cheryl Burke, who danced to last year's championship with Drew Lachey. He drew mostly rave reviews from the judges and was a fan favourite as well. He did better at the Latin dances than the ballroom numbers, and suprised many people with how light he was on his feet. He chalked up his success on the show to his ability to accept coaching. On November 9th, 2006, he entered the finals of Dancing With The Stars along with Mario Lopez.\n\nOn September 30, 2006, he was one of the first four Gator legends inducted into the Florida Football Ring of Honor, alongside Steve Spurrier, Danny Wuerffel, and Jack Youngblood.

question_title: What's More Entertaining? College or Pro Football? [SEP] question_content: With college you have rivalries that are much more bitter. You also seem to have a lot more team spirit.

question_title: What shoes are good for rock climbing? [SEP] question_content: Rock climbing is just a casual hobby, so I don't want to fork out the money on professional climbing shoes.  Can I use sneakers or some other kind of shoe?  What actually makes a good climbing shoe?  I will be using mostly indoor walls. [SEP] best_answer: ive been an avid rock climber for almost ten years...get rock climbing shoes if you intend to climb regularly.  there is nothing more scary than placing your foot on a ledge no wider than a centimeter and feeling your feet slipping around inside your shoe.  talk about a major sphincter check.  plus climbing shoes are designed to place the toes in the most powerful position to allow for adequate stepping and their soles are made of sticky soft rubber so slippage is minimized.  going barefooted may seem logical, but stepping on sharp points of rock and placing all your weight on it can be excuriatingly painful.  plus, sweaty feet equals slippery feet.  there are large numbers of climbing shoes that are quite affordable as well.  look at brands like mad rock, evolv, mammut, or search websites like REI.com.  ive seen shoes as cheap as 50 to 60 dollars.....about the same cost as running shoes.....if youre going to climb regularly, this is the best advice i can give you, from one climber to another...good luck and aloha	Sports
