question_title: Do Football Matches ever take place between inmates and officers in a REAL prison - either UK or USA? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I have never heard of that, but I do know that there are numerous UK prisons who have football teams in local leagues.  Of course, they play all their matches at home.  I never refereed one but I heard that they are good games to referee because the inmates enjoy letting off steam (so you get a good game) but are generally respectful to the referee and their opponents, in the interests of keeping their remission.  That, of course, also makes for a good game.	Politics & Government
question_title: raising the minimum wage, what will it do? [SEP] question_content: will the minimum wage really help the poor? what if businesses lay those people off because they dont want to pay them that much, or they cant pay them that much? what if, after raising the min. wage, employers decide/find out that they are paying more to certain employees than they are worth? after this, wont the employers have more incentive to hire illegal mexicans, who will soon have amnesty because of this president who is a poor representative of any political party? wont raising the min. wage raise prices? if i were Republican, i would try and get the president "kicked out" of the party somehow, like the Dems did with Lieberman. \nthe Dem politicians and bush are doing this for unions, they know its not good for anyone. if you disconnect union contracts from minimum wage increases, the Left will cry like a baby. its not about the poor, is it? unions with too much power are helping to destroy this country... [SEP] best_answer: There are misconceptions about the minimum wage.\nLiving wage - Minimum wage was not designed as a living wage and never will be. It is a benchmark for workers entering the system.\nIncreased cost of goods and services - Many people believe incorrectly that you can raise the minimum wage and it will help the poor or lower middle class. This is not true. Raising the minimum wage causes the cost of doing business to increase. Therefore the price of good and services will also increase thereby rendering the surplus gained from the wage increase null and void. Employers are not going to just absorb the added cost and take a hit on their profit margin.\nJob creation - When the cost of doing business goes up less new jobs are created. Employers forced to pay higher costs will require existing employees to do more while hiring less new labor force.\nSmall Business - Small businesses tend to be primary employers in the most devastated areas of society.  Many have small profit margins to begin with and when faced with higher labor costs find themselves unable to remain in business. Further less new small business is created.\n\nCan we absorb an increase in minimum wage? Yes we can. We have done it in the past, but it is frivilous to believe that there will not be consequences for this action and that the people it is designed to help will actually benefit from it. Most workers do not remain at minimum wage. They get raises or gain experience and move into other better paying positions. The simple fact is that if you have a worker who remains at minimum for years at a time, they are either unmotivated to improve their circumstance, or they change jobs often. Take exception to this statement if you will, but it is a fact none the less.	Politics & Government

Instead Mr.Gul Mast from (incharge, Police Station Wazir Bagh(Hazar Khani, Peshawar)) advised me that he will first catch the engaged criminal in the crime and then he will recover the stolen.

question_title: Should I be seeking legal counsel? [SEP] question_content: This October I put a down payment of or $1000.00 ( $800 towards payment of the dog and $250 as a deposit). We were told to put a deposit because these dogs sell out very quickly.We had to wait till November to get the dog cause it was to young to leave her mother.\nAt the time of payment I NEVER RECEIVED A RECEIPT OR SIGNED ANY CONTRACT.They said they would mail a contract/receipt at a later date cause their printer was down.\n\nIn late October I lost my job and had to pay off some bills. We decided to hold off on the dog and get the full $1000.00 back to help pay the house payment, etc...\n\nI have contacted the sellers twice and both times they have given me the runaround. First saying that they would contact me at a later date to talk about refunding my money. The second time we spoke they stated that they might return my money. \n\nShould I give them a deadline to return my money? And if the deadline passes should I look to legal counsel?\n\nAny advice would appreciated, Thanks [SEP] best_answer: You should have definitely gotten something in writing before you turned over any money.  You have a contract with this person and they probably have the upper hand because you gave them the consideration and they need to give you the dog.  If they don't give you the dog you can sue them, however, if they are willing to give you the dog I'm not hopeful you'd get your money back instead.  Of course there may be loopholes, and I don't know all the facts, so if it doesn't work out you should at least consult an attorney. Good luck and sorry to hear about the job.	Politics & Government

question_title: Coast Gaurd or USMC? [SEP] question_content: I made lots of mistskes in the past 2 years. I am now 20 yr old and just got my G.E.D. and I have good ASVAB scores. I want to join the Marines, but they are now telling me I need 15 Community College credits, the Coast Gaurd will take me as is.\nI am having a hard time deciding between the two because I work a 40-60hr a week job as an X-Ray technichian at a Cement Plant and I don't have the time to take the classes. Anyone have any EDUCATED input? [SEP] best_answer: The United States Coast Guard is an excellent choice. You can get college while serving and it is just as much a part of the United States Armed Forces as the Marines and the others. \n\nADDED: \n\n"As for being seasick.. I live in Maine and I worked on a lobster boat for awhile. I don't get seasick easy, but on a small (26 foot) craft, In a storm, I get sick." \n\nVery few people don't get seasick in a storm on a 25 footer. Heck I remember a friend who was on a destroyer in a nasty storm once, he said everyone and the captain turned green and that was no small boat. \n\n"I should also add that If I join the Coast Guard I want to bust drug dealers in the Gulf of Mexico, if I join the Marines I would like to join as infantry so that I can advance rapidly."\n\nIn the military you can request duty, but regardless of the service, they assign and you go. The key to advancing as fast as possible is to do the job right, study for the promotion exams and put your time in grade. Be ready when each opportunity comes up. \n\nOne of the best things I can say about the Coast Guard is that in time of war, they fight the battles with the Marines, Navy, Army and Air Force, but they also have two other missions in war or peace. They save lives in maritime and boating accidents or coastal disaster (they were there when Katrina clobbered the coast). They also do drug enforcement on the coast and high seas. Now for being the smallest of the Armed forces, that is saying a heck of a lot because they put 200% effort in what they do.  \n\nAs Jeff said, "Go see Kevin Costner's The Guardian movie" and you can get a real good idea of what adventure is really about. \n\nIf I were you, I would go for the Coast Guard. Coasties are not only great people, but also some of the most courageous people on this planet.  \n\nCheck out their web site for comprehensive information: http://www.uscg.mil/	Politics & Government

question_title: What types of food were provided for you by the military when you were in the field? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: C-rations, which were not nearly as tasty as MRE's!  Canned fruit cocktail was a favorite because it needed no prep.  Most entrees were designed to be heated first, this was difficult at times, so we ate them cold, grease and all.  Pork and beans were also a favorite because you could eat it either way without having to gag it down.  Beef patties were difficult because when you opened a can of this slop, the grease was all coagulated.  Man, if you didn't heat em up first, you sure didn't have need for stool softeners for the next week or so.\n\nThis was before easy opening cans, so everything had to be opened with your special GI can opener.  Most of us carried this silly little thing in the lapel of our utility shirt.  You didn't want to loose this thing or you wound up beating the can over rocks or stabbing it with your K-bar.  Boy, that was no fun!\n\nC-rations were good for barter.  The natives thought it was a feast.  Hell, they would trade some of their sought after wares for c-rations.  Machetes, watermelon, goose eggs, even San Miguel beer were items they would surrender for C-rations or mosquito nets.  Yes sir, those were the days!	Politics & Government

Is this legal?\nThe condo is going for $700,000 and they will give me $50,000 back at the close of escrow\nI understand that it is my $50,000 that they are giving me, but this sounds a little fishy.\nShould I be concerned, and is this deal on the level?\nThank you for your time,\nGeoff [SEP] best_answer: Sound fishy to me too.  I think they are trying to show an artificially high sales price to use to convince others to pay more for similar units than they would otherwise pay.  Even if it is legal, if you borrow the $50,000 in your mortgage, you will probably pay around $100,000 in extra interest over the life of the loan.	Politics & Government
question_title: Does your husband continue to pay child support even though he lives with you and the children? [SEP] question_content: Let's say you and your husband were separated - you had the children and he lived elsewhere.  You obtained a child support order against him - he starts paying as ordered.  At some point, you reconcile and he returns home but continues to pay child support.  Because he essentially provides you the money, via the State, for child support and that amount is constant and budgetable - do people simply live with that arrangement?  I'm not aware of any law which automatically ends child support if a separated, married couple reconciles. [SEP] best_answer: Actually I Knew a couple personally who divorced and had a little boy. After I think it was 1 year or a bit more the man moved back. For whatever reason they lived together (but they didn't remarry) They were quite content as things were. He was still paying his child support and had no problems with that. Nor did she. Too them they said it was like a bank account that he was responsible for and it was just for their daughter. So while he still payed the child support it was all going into this savings account that just had his wife and daughters name on it. Sometimes they used the money for birthdays or doctor's bills. But he said it was helping him focus on the fact that those child support payments were going directly to that account and in essence that account would be used for her colleage education.  So they just lived with that arrangement. But it was their choice and they made it work. (It's been 7 years and they are still doing the same thing).	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: If you are a person from a country outside Japan, you have to reside in Japan for five years consecutively to make yourself entitled for the citizenship of Japan. The five years duration can be reduced if you are married to a citizen of Japan. There are some other requirements also that you will know when you contact them.\n\nOne of the main concerns for foreigners is that Japan does not allow multiple citizenships, and if you want to become a Japanese citizen you have to renounce your past nationality. Sometimes this clause hurts people deeply and has made them think twice before going for the citizenship of Japan. \n\nIf you want to know more about the procedure to get the citizenship of Japan, you can visit the website of Government of Japan, which provides the information in detail about the procedure.

question_title: What are some classes involved in a Criminal Justice Major? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't know what you plan on doing if you want to be a criminal justice major - but I'd like to give you some advice from personal experience.\n\nIf you plan on being a police officer, or federal law enforcement (FBI, Secret Service, DEA, CBP, etc), and you need a college degree - pick your SECOND favorite major besides criminal justice.  The service you pick will train you on the law enforcement stuff.  All they care about is that you have a college degree.  You can intern with a police department or something during college to display your interest.\n\nIt makes you much more well-rounded and more valuable to them if you have a degree in accounting, business, or some sort of science (particularly chemistry or biology).  I even know a guy who majored in nuclear engineering who is a police officer (and has invaluable knowledge about hazardous materials and the potential threats of nuclear terrorism).\n\nHaving another degree also makes it easier in the future if you should decide to use your law enforcement experience and enter private business.  I've been stuck in law enforcement for a little while after trying to make a career change because ALL of my education, experience, etc is in law enforcement.\n\nI've advised many college students along this same path but no one really wants to do it.  They will have to learn it from experience.\n\nI attended the school with the courses that the previous poster listed.  It is actually the University of Maryland, and I've taken many of those courses.  Please feel free to email me if you have ANY qustions about being a criminal justice major or police work.

Mr Rajiv gandhi was a first victim of sonia gandhi.\nHis father was a prisoner in USSR.\nUSSR gave huge amount and Life of his father to her just for that work.\nUSSR was willing to have a person in indian government.\nRajiv gandhi was a soft target.\nLove affair of Sonia-Rajiv, Their Marriage, Murder of sanjay Gandhi, Murder of indira gandhi, Rajiv became PM, Murder of Rajiv Gandhi.....Everything was planned by USSR and Sonia.\n\nQuatrochi was a boyfriend of sonia gandhi.\nAnd this is the same person who was involved in Boforce Scam.\nSonia gandhi dont want to be PM of india because she knew that she has to die after that.\nNow Manmohan singh will be no more.\nRahul or Priyanka will be the next PM of india.\nThen he will be murdered after 15 yers of that.\nThen second child will become PM and he/she will also be murdered. Then may be husband of Priyanka.......\nThis is all like a chain reaction.\nNo one knows any secret of any murder.\nBecause KGB is smart enough. They kill the person and subsequently they break the link of evidence.\nThis conspiracy will go far and far...\nNatwar Singh also know many secrets so he may also be murdered. Natwar singh met Subrahmanyam Swami and he provided all the evidences he knows about sonia and rajiv.\nSo i think you can hear bad news about natwar singh.\nMadhav  Rao Scindhia was also a lover of Sonia gandhi.\nRajesh pilot was too.\nBoth were having qualities to become a PM of india but what happened ? They were barriers for sonia gandhi.\nThey were also killed in some accidents.\nEveryone who feels that he may be PM in congress, is murdered.\nNatwar singh was a senior leader and so he was willing to be a PM. Arjun Singh also want to be a PM.\nBut both are neglected in congress.\nNatwar singh is out.

question_title: What happens when a military family cannot find housing when they PCS, such as in the case of mass gains? [SEP] question_content: We are an Army family moving this summer from Germany to Ft. Riley, KS.  There are thousands of families also being moved to this area.  On post housing has been totally depleted, and off post housing is also scarce.  Because there is such demand, I anticipate landlords taking advantage and raising rents, etc.  Higher cost of living will mean higher BAH, but not right away.  We are a growing family with a teen son, a toddler and another baby due in December.  What happens if we can't find a place to live?  Short term housing is bound to be at a premium as well.  We don't make enough money to save a lot for move-in costs... This situation is very troubling.  I worry that we'll be forced to pay much more than we can ever afford or worse, that we'll be without a place to stay.  Does anybody have any experience with such a move? [SEP] best_answer: Been there, done that!  This is more typically a problem at OCONUS locations but as you are learning, the misguided consolodations pushed through by the current administration are impacting things on the home front as well.\n\nUnfortunately there is no easy solution for you.  The military answer is usually to expand the local commuting area.  Normally a one hour commute is considered "local" and all assigned military personnel are required to live in this area.  When housing is in short supply, the local military commander usually expands this area to 90 or 120 minutes.  That solves his or her "problem" but does nothing for you.\n\nIf you haven't been assigned a sponsor yet, get in touch with your gaining unit and have one assigned.  They will start the search for you prior to your arrival.  Also, contact the housing office at Ft Riley to get the ball rolling there as well.\n\nYou may want to consider giving your sponsor a limited power-of-attorney to sign a lease for you.  It should contain a clause limiting the maximum rent, deposit, etc.  Yes, going sight-unseen sucks, but at least it's a roof over your head.\n\nIn severe circumstances, the post housing office may coordinate all off-post rentals and assign rental housing to incoming members.  When this happens, you're typically allowed one "free" refusal of "adequate" housing so think carefully about what's offered, bearing in mind that the least desireable properties are usually reserved for the "second choice" list.  Based on your family size, you'll probably be limited to 3 bedrooms so refusing a 3 bedroom home as too small won't be justified.	Politics & Government

question_title: i asked a question about Guantonomo Bay.? [SEP] question_content: i asked a question about Guantonomo Bay. It seems that a lot of you think this is a POW camp. You do realize that the bush administration has ALWAYS maintained that this is not the case, Right? I mean, you do know this? don't you? \n\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~echelonxq/info_intelligence/prisoners_taken_to_Guantanamo_Bay.html [SEP] best_answer: Cuba -- will that bug ever get squashed.  Americans have had a presence in Cuba since the Eisenhower Administration.   We are on Cuban soil; hence, anything done to anyone on Cuban soil is not covered under the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, or the Geneva Convention Rules on Prisoners of War.\n\nAs long as America ships prisoners to countries that are not obliged to honor the Constitution, prisoners can be treated any way the captors want to treat them.  So, does that make the prisoners in Cuba any less "terrorists?"  We will never know.  \n\nI don't know if you understand this or not-----"you do know this, right?"----but America is no longer run by the people, of the people, and for the people.  America is being run by, of, and for the corporations who can pay enough money to keep this war going so they can get rich on the government contracts George Bush is giving to all the people he bankrupted in Texas.  I guess that's one way to pay off your debts!\n\nIt's sad, though, that the lives of honorable, courageous, and loyal Americans are being bought and sold to the highest bidder in the Bush Administration.

question_title: What's the foreign legion?  Is it something the US military has to worry about? [SEP] question_content: I don't think these people could be as tough as US soldiers. [SEP] best_answer: The French Foreign Legion is an arm of the french army it is made up entirely of foreigners except for the regular french army officers in command.  1 out of every 10 new recruits that make it through training will be killed in action in their first tour of duty.  They are best known for their attempted overthrow of the french government, and the battle of dien ben phu(spelling) when in french indio china.  Their training regiment rivals that of the SF programs that we have here in America, desert training, and jungle training are conducted in hot zones.  The french send these guys in first mainly because they are not french citizens, you can compare them to the SAS, SBS, and SF here in America.  You just dont hear a lot about them but they are currently involved in operations in Chad, as well as in south america.  I wouldnt worry about them they are mostly sent out on suicide missions, because the french dont care about them.	Politics & Government

question_title: My friend wants to ask you this.  i was wondering why the american people never get to vote on issues,.? [SEP] question_content: i realize that we vote for our elected officials and they are supposed to be our voice, but somehow i don't always trust them to have my best interest at heart, so i think that "we the people" maybe should be allowed to vote on issues, that way we are getting what the people want....straight from the horses mouth so to speak. [SEP] best_answer: I agree with you.  Many states have an initiative process where people are allowed to vote on issues -- my state, California has this and there are always a lot of issues on the ballot for the people to vote on.  There are many issues where the politicians in Washington somehow are out of step with the people as a whole.  A nation-wide initiative process would be a great solution to this.

question_title: Military Housing..? [SEP] question_content: Can someone give me a link to pictures of an example of Air Force and/or Army base housing for an enlisted married w/ no kids? [SEP] best_answer: It all depends on the base really. You will most likely get a two bedroom appartment thats about 900 sqft. You can also apply for off post houseing and they will give you BAH or Basic Allowance for Houseing which is money they give you for a house depending on the area plus the troppers rank determines the amount you get a month. My suggestion is buy a house then you can retain that money rather than renting and leaveing with nothing.	Politics & Government

question_title: Immigrants to the US? [SEP] question_content: Why must we keep our boarders open for all immigrants? Why can't you just stay in your own countries and not mooch off the US? [SEP] best_answer: DEAR HEAVENS!!  To the person who said something about forefathers, your logic is not flawed ~ it is non-existent!\n\nWhen the SETTLERS came here, they came to SETTLE.  Did they do the indigenous peoples wrong?  After a while, without question they did.  However, that is not the point right now.\n\nThe point is that there was, at *that* time, ROOM here.  People could go carve their world out of pieces of wilderness, risking life and limb on a daily basis.  They could worship freely; they could hunt and feed their family without fear of being sentenced to death for it; and on and on it goes.\n\nWe no longer NEED any more people here.  We're loaded to capacity as it is.  Every Country should do its best to improve itself and the citizens of that Country should HELP ~ not go elsewhere and burden another Country.\n\nIn answer to the actual question:  I don't think we should keep our borders open.  In fact, I think they should be closed until our current crises are repaired.  Once repaired, we could re-open our borders with more stringent and specific laws.  As another Responder said on another question, if we need an example of how to limit immigration, we need look only so far as the Mexican Constitution and their requirements for citizenship.\n\nTO TOPCAT420:  Amen!  I have difficulty justifying "fixing" things for other Countries when we have so much fixing we need to do right here!  I have long been a believer in restoring more lands to the Native American people, along with any and all mineral rights thereto.  And that's why i said we are loaded to capacity as it is!  We have enough for now.  We need to right a whole list of wrongs committed against the Native Americans, we need to stop children starving here in the U.S., we need to clean up our own interurban areas .. we have a LOT to do at home, for ourselves and by ourselves, before we can consider re-opening borders and helping others.\n\nThe U.S. has helped others until we've helped ourselves right into a hole.

[SEP] best_answer: You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html	Politics & Government

question_title: should we kick politicians out of office? [SEP] question_content: I think all we need is a committee from each state to run things. I havent seen a politician yet that isnt crooked, just think what we dont know whats going on thats making them richer and us poorer [SEP] best_answer: Politicians can be kicked out when they are voted out in Elections.\n\nRecall Elections can be held for Governor and most other offices although a Recall cannot be held for President.\n\nIn order to remove the President the House has to Impeach him (Impeach is not a removal by the way, Impeach means a Trial gets to be held, 2 Presidents were Impeached but never removed cause they were aquitted).\n\nHowever when an Impeachment Trial is held a certain number of Senators have to vote Guilty but 51 Guilty votes do not remove him (it requires somewhere from I think 60 - 67 votes).\n\nSo to those want Bush removed in an Impeachment Trial dream on cause even if the Democrats got the Senate there would not be enough votes to remove Bush.\n\nHeck in the Clinton impeachment trial 55 Senators voted him Guilty on one Impeachment article but it was not even enough to remove Clinton (plus some Republicans did vote him Not Guilty).

question_title: why would someone not get bail for child pornography?

You see, even criminals, hate Child Porno Perverts, and kill them.\n\nSo as you can see this person has all the reason in the world to flee and try to  avoid going to prison.	Politics & Government

question_title: When a police officer shoots at a suspect, how does Internal Affairs get involve.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In any O.I.S. (Officer involved shooting) there's an automatic review and investigation.  ANY time an officer's weapon goes off, there'll be an ivestigation. The I.A. investigation will take first the statements of the officers who were there, then the civilians. It's conducted with a bit more discretion than a criminal investigation, but the methods are pretty much the same. If there's no evidence of misconduct by the officer, he'll be cleared of any wrongdoing. \n  The biggest difference from this scenario, and most civilian related shootings, is that there's not only criminal consideration, but also procedural investigation. If the officer's not committed any crimes, they still have to determine if he's violated the protocol of his department for an officer to discharge his firearm. He may be cleared of a crime, but excercised poor judgement. In these cases, they have to decide whether or not to push for discipline.	Politics & Government

Not all UK citizens hold passports and it would be absurd for such persons to be discriminated against on those grounds.  However, it seems reasonable enough for someone registering for a course to show proof of identity, including proof of identity with a photograph of the individual concerned.  I would therefore take such proof along with me, leaving my passport at home, and I would kick up a fuss if they demanded a passport and make it clear that I proposed to write to my MP.  I would also hang on jealously to my proof of ID.	Politics & Government

My father weighs 600 lbs and he can't even walk any more , but it is not a criminal act , although it is one of the seven deadly sins of the bible known as glutiny, no one else can be held responsible for someone eating their selves to death. cause even if someone else is giving them the food , they pretty much have to feed them til they are full or it won't let them rest at all. p.s  I am a big guy too. but  i am perfectly capable of everything anyone else does with a lot of ease.  i work a factory job and work 12 and 16 hrs a day and can't lose weight for the life of me , i don't consume that much food. some people are naturally heavy , and those are the ones that are the most misunderstood.

And while everyone is busy stressing over this bill, are they watching what the Justices will do with Roe v Wade? The Patriot Act? What is going on in the Middle East? It seems like when this administration(and I use the term administration losely)gets backed into a corner they always seem to find a smoke screen to divert the attention away from the really big pile of s*** they left in the middle of the living room. [SEP] best_answer: I think it is election year politics. I think they will all talk tough and then when it comes time to vote, this bill will be so watered down and ineffective that it will actually add to the problem rather than solve anything. Illegals need to be removed from this country. Illegals need to be turned away before they can get into this country. Our borders need to be secured for more than this reason.

The media will find out and make issues of this kind of stuff.  So we get losers like spoon fed Bush’s, Kerry’s, and Gore’s.   But the American people care more about X-Box games and who Brad Pitt is dating then border control, social, or international issues.  We (I am also an American) have become a nation of fat, lazy, morons…now there are a few exceptions I would say 30%-40% of Americans still care and have some brain power, but the masses don’t even have the mental power to understand and formulate opinions on issues like social security or border control.  If you ask an American what’s your opinion, its “I don’t know” “I don’t want to offend anyone” “I don’t want to look bad” Until Americans stop being idiots, sissies, and greedy, this trend will continue…..

question_title: What is Bayes's Theorem? Can someone explain in simple terms.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bayes's Theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities. It figures prominently in subjectivist or Bayesian approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic. Subjectivists, who maintain that rational belief is governed by the laws of probability, lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their models of empirical learning. Bayes's Theorem is central to these enterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of subjectivist position. Indeed, the Theorem's central insight — that a hypothesis is confirmed by any body data that its truth renders probable — is the cornerstone of all subjectivist methodology.\n\n\n Bayes's Theorem.\n \n PE(H) = [P(H)/P(E)] PH(E) \n\nIn an unfortunate, but now unavoidable, choice of terminology, statisticians refer to the inverse probability PH(E) as the "likelihood" of H on E. It expresses the degree to which the hypothesis predicts the data given the background information codified in the probability P.\n\n                                                               Bayes's Theorem (2nd form)\n \n PE(H) = P(H)PH(E) / [P(H)PH(E) + P(~H)P~H(E)] \n\nIn this guise Bayes's theorem is particularly useful for inferring causes from their effects since it is often fairly easy to discern the probability of an effect given the presence or absence of a putative cause. For instance, physicians often screen for diseases of known prevalence using diagnostic tests of recognized sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of a test, its "true positive" rate, is the fraction of times that patients with the disease test positive for it. The test's specificity, its "true negative" rate, is the proportion of healthy patients who test negative. If we let H be the event of a given patient having the disease, and E be the event of her testing positive for it, then the test's specificity and sensitivity are given by the likelihoods PH(E) and P~H(~E), respectively, and the "baseline" prevalence of the disease in the population is P(H). Given these inputs about the effects of the disease on the outcome of the test, one can use it to determine the probability of disease given a positive test.\n\nSpecial Forms of Bayes's Theorem\n\n\nBayes's Theorem can be expressed in a variety of forms that are useful for different purposes. One version employs what Rudolf Carnap called the relevance quotient or probability ratio (Carnap 1962, 466). This is the factor PR(H, E) = PE(H)/P(H) by which H's unconditional probability must be multiplied to get its probability conditional on E. Bayes's Theorem is equivalent to a simple symmetry principle for probability ratios.\n\nProbability Ratio Rule. \n PR(H, E) = PR(E, H) \n\nThe term on the right provides one measure of the degree to which H predicts E. If we think of P(E) as expressing the "baseline" predictability of E given the background information codified in P, and of PH(E) as E's predictability when H is added to this background, then PR(E, H) captures the degree to which knowing H makes E more or less predictable relative to the baseline: PR(E, H) = 0 means that H categorically predicts ~E; PR(E, H) = 1 means that adding H does not alter the baseline prediction at all; PR(E, H) = 1/P(E) means that H categorically predicts E. Since P(E)) = PT(E)) where T is any truth of logic, we can think of as telling us that.\n The probability of a hypothesis conditional on a body of data is equal to the unconditional probability of the hypothesis multiplied by the degree to which the hypothesis surpasses a tautology as a predictor of the data.\n\nAnother useful form of Bayes's Theorem is the Odds Rule. In the jargon of bookies, the "odds" of a hypothesis is its probability divided by the probability of its negation:	Science & Mathematics

question_title: why does coke explode? [SEP] question_content: how does a volume of air's temperature, density, and moisture content affect its pressure? [SEP] best_answer: The Climate.Pressure increases if temperature increases and volume stays the same. This is because the molecules are moving faster and colliding harder with the sides of the container. The greater the mass of air in the container, the greater the number of molecules in the container and the higher its density. The air molecules in the container collide against the sides of the container, so the more of them there are colliding against sides of the container the greater the overall force on the sides of the container. If the temperature is high enough the moisture is vapor or steam and if the moisture doesn't condense on the sides of the container then the moisture molecules are also colliding with the side of the container. On the other hand, if the air in the container is cool enough that the moisture does condense then the moisture is no longer exerting outward force on the container (or at least there's much less of it still moving around as vapor and colliding with the sides of the container).\n\nWhen you're talking about a body of water with gas (carbon dioxide) and sugar in it, like Coke, if the bottle is still closed then you have a volume of air above the soda that exerts enough force on the soda to prevent the gas from coming out of the soda at all until you open the bottle. Once the bottle is open, think about surface tension. That's the reason the carbon dioxide is released slowly when you open the bottle. If you disrupt the surface tension the gas can release all at once.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Could it be that SALT was the stuff that made us Humans different than Apes / monkeys ....etc? [SEP] question_content: hi all , i know the the brain operates / thinks by sending electrical impulses between neurons to process information.\nThe basic supply of energy / content of each neuron to generate electricity is Sodium , potassium , i think , correct me. So there could have been a common ancestor to both humans and apes a long time ago, then a group of ancestors ate seafood, this increased those ancestor's neuron firing levels, thus making them to process information more faster, in due course of time, they became smarter.\n\nIf u notice, apes / monkeys...or even animals / tribal people eat raw meat / veggies....etc, they don't add salt to food. may be if they add salt to their food they would have become smarter. Notice people who eat a lot of salt are more short tempered, think irrational, that's an example of eating more salt. what's ur answer, does salt make u smarter ?, i'm on to something here, i think it's a discovery of the century, the link to evolution.....etc, nobel prize plzzz :) [SEP] best_answer: Ya, I don't see any link between salt consumption and the evolutionary development of intelligence.  All mammals (humans and primates included) have dietary sources of sodium.  None of us could survive without it.  Besides, I'm pretty sure that fish consumption was not a source of sodium for the earliest humans.  In terms of human history, the art of 'salting' fish to preserve it was a rather recent development.\n\nAlthough neurons rely on sodium and other ions to propagate action potentials, these ions are not a source of energy.  Neurons rely primarily on glucose for energy, and in the absence of glucose, they will metabolize ketone bodies for energy.\n\nIt seems more likely that our intelligence probably began to evolve with basic 'analytical' skills, such as tool making and other simple feats of engineering.  It's possible that the development of 'fishing' methods contributed to our intelligence, as this would have required early humans to develop specialized tools and techniques.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: For Professor Beatz...? [SEP] question_content: What do you believe about evelution, and what do you find ubeilivable? This question is so that I can better understand were you are coming from with your posts. [SEP] best_answer: Ow!  My toes!  ;) (kidding)\n\nI think it's ludicrous that people are treating the theory as if there's any real debate among scientists on the matter.  Global Warming is far, far, far more contested than is evolution; yet in the popular press, you'd never know it.\n\nWhat I get sick of is all the crap about "missing links" or whatever.  Quite frankly, I don't give a rats @$$ about the fossil record.  Sure, it was important to Darwin when he formulated the theory, but one can't really expect that the fossil record should be any where near complete, and all the arguments against evolution focus on this field.  I studied molecular biology, and it is in molecular biology that you'll find way, way stronger support for the theory.\n\nWhen I list the sorts of evidence that come from molecular biology (Homologous proteins, the near universality of the genetic code (eg the relation between codons and amino acids), genetic drift in non-essential parts of homologous proetiens, DNA technology that can show relationship, developmental homology (ie ontogeny and it's relationship to phylogeny), etc) I get people acting like I presented no evidence because they couldn't even understand that the list I've given actually is evidence.  It takes a long time to understand the manner in which DNA becomes a protein, and the way that proteins fold, the way they work, and the way their related.  Until you understand that, the "Big Picture" is not clear.  But to those that *do* understand the Big Picture, it becoems obvious.\n\nI can't explain to a starving thrid world farmer why it's in his interests to become literate, along with the rest of his village, so they can better understand how to, say, help prevent epidemics in the short term (by being able to understand routes of transmission better) or bring about democracy in the long term.  But living in the industrialized west, the benefits of literacy are manifest.  The person who doesn't understand science seems to me in many ways to be like that starving farmer.\n\nPeople who understand science will dictate the fate of much in the world, and they will have the power to do much good.  By not making an effort to learn science, you set yourself back greatly.  But by actively attacking science--like the starving farming burning a public library, or like the Haitian who steals the copper wires set up to build an electrical infrastructure that would bring long-term prosperity in exchange for a short-term benefit in selling scrap metal--the skeptic zealots do themselves and the entire Christian faith a great disservice.\n\nIn response to your additional questions:\n1-4 are NOT--repeat, they are NOT--aspects of the theory of evolution by natural selection.  This is exactly what I'm talking about--people are criticizing a theory they don't even begin to understand.\n\n1) refers to the Big Bang theory, not evolution by natural selection.  2) is a theory of planetary formation, not a theory of speciation.  3) and 4) are aspects of a theory of abiogenesis, which is different from evolution.  Only 5) actually regards evolution.\n\nEvolution by natural selection dictates that small variations between members of a species accumulate over the long term to become major changes, resulting in speciation.  And yes, I believe that that happened.\n\nI have issues with the big bang, but those are not relevant here--they are for reasons of physics that go beyond what I can explain right here.\n\nPlanetary formation, while not a part of evolution, is largely unavoidable.  All matter has mass, and this results in gravitational attraction.  If dust is in space, it will collapse in on itself.  Physics-wise, this is about as mind-blowing as the fact that water + dirt = mud.  It would be a greater stretch of the imagination to imagine such formation not occuring, because the laws that dictate such a formation are at work all around us all the time.\n\n	Science & Mathematics

If you have ever watched National Geographics dialog on the ten commandments and the box that was made for it; you would see that there has to be something else in the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n"And the tables were the work of God." "And he gave unto Moses ... two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God." "And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables." Exodus 31:18; 32:16.\n\nWe know it had a home in Bethel (Judg 20:18, 27), Shiloh (1 Sam 1:3, 25; 3:3, 4:3), Kiriath-jearim (1 Sam 7:1-2), and Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:12-17). The Bible also says that the ark was carried from (and returned to) Jerusalem, when David was fleeing from his son to Transjordan (2 Sam 15:24-25, 29).\n\nWhen God's temple in heaven is opened, what a triumphant time that will be for all who have been faithful and true! In the temple will be seen the ark of the testament. . . .These tables of stone will be brought forth from their hiding place, and on them will be seen the Ten Commandments engraved by the finger of God. These tables of stone now lying in the ark of the testament will be a convincing testimony to the truth and binding claims of God's law. 7 BC 972 (emphasis supplied)\n\nJust my theory!

question_title: what can we learn from transits? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Transits of Venus across the Sun were state-of-the-art science back in the 18th century.  That's because they were a way to calculate the size of the Solar System.   By the middle of the 18th century, Newtonian mechanics had allowed us to make a model of the Solar System where everything was correct, except that we didn't know how big it was.  Everything was done as angles from the Earth, and so the whole thing could have been bigger or smaller and still kept the same angles.  This uncertainty prevented us from knowing the size of the Sun and the distance to the stars.\n\nBut if you observed a transit of Venus from two places far apart on the Earth, like England and Tahiti, you would see the disk of Venus cross the disk of the Sun in a different path.  This would allow you to calculate the distance to Venus in comparison to the size of the Earth, which was by then well known.  Expeditions were sent out by the European powers to observe the transits of Venus from "remote" places.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How it WOULD be possible for us to see our past? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: travel into the future is possible by einstein theory as one approaches the speed of light.  \n\nTraveling into the past is a different story though, access would have to be open from the past for this.  There is no way to create a portal to the past, someone from the past would have to create the portal to the future where the future person could pass.  \n\nIt is argued though that this would only open a door to another dimension and another universe independent of our own universe.  If you think about it, the fact that someone could 'travel' to the past is direct evidence that other parallel universes exist.  If you were to travel back into time history and events would inevitably be changed from occurences known to us in the present, therefore you must be in another universe.  \n\nAnother way to see the past is to create a large gravitational force bending space time such as a blackhole, and align it so that the light traveling from where you are would be bent back to a location where you could observe it.  This would be like viewing T.V. though, because you could have no interaction.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why does Neptune emit more energy than it receives from the Sun? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Neptune is not the only planet to emit more energy than it receives from the Sun.  The real quizzer here is why does it emit SO MUCH more.  Previous answers reflect upon the mass-energy relationship to the creation of new stars and I would suggest that though the theory is solid the example does not fit- the mass is way too small for Jupiter or Neptune to ever become stars and the physical process does not resemble this activity in the least.\nPlus we are talking about energy emission here and not energy consumption.  Energy emission falls into several major categories that are included in the answer for this basic question.  The real answer comes from the type of energy being created- magnetic, electrical, kinetic, etc.\nOne such energy source reflects upon radio energy which many scientists have projected occurs from dissimilar metals in relative close contact to each otther and seperated by chemical "ice' such as sulfuric acid or a strong catalyst of this nature.  Neptune may be a large portion of active magma below the surface as well.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: How do heavy objects rest on a table without its molecules giving way and colapsing the table? [SEP] question_content: Atomic bonds are said to result from electromagnetic energy attracting and holding atoms together. \nYet, tremendous ongoing energy expenditure is required to hold the structure of a table together under the weight of a heavy object.\n\nWhere does this energy come from? How quickly does\nthis subatomic power source drain as it expends all this\nenergy? [SEP] best_answer: That's a very good question.  No one really knows how the atomic nucleus holds together but this is generally not the reason for objects not falling through tables.  That is primarily due to the repulsion between the electrons in adjacent atoms.  In highly ordered systems of long-chain molecules or crystals the electrons are fairly densely packed and mostly impenetrable.  However the mechanics of this get more complicated above the molecular level.\n\nAs for your other question, as far as I know most atomic nuclei never spontaneously decay, except for the heavy elements like uranium.  There are many theories why this is the case, but I don't think any have managed a definitive answer.  \n\nThe energy for this bond might well be the mass of the particles themselves, since after all, e=mc^2.\n\nCheck out String Theory if you want a more comprehensive answer, but I warn you, it's a lot of very complicated math.

question_title: I have missed out on a lot of school due to hospitilization and I'm lost in chemistry? [SEP] question_content: I am currently working on balancing chemical and formula equation and we are doing something with oxidation numbers. I understand the basics, but when she throws on single and double replacement equations, I'm lost again. If someone can explain this to me that would be great. Thanx in advance [SEP] best_answer: In a single replacement reaction, an uncombined element (such as zinc, Zn) reacts with a compound (e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl), taking the place of one of the elements in the compound (hydrogen, H, in this case). the result is a compound that includes the formerly uncombined element (zinc chloride, ZnCl2) and an element that was part of the former compound but got replaced (hydrogen, which is now in gas form, H2).\n\nTo balance the equation, you need to Cl's for each Zn, so you put one Zn and 2 HCls on the left and see what comes out on the right:\n\nZn + 2 HCl  ->  ZnCl2 + H2\n\nZinc replaced hydrogen. Single replacement reaction.\n\nIn a double replacement reaction, you have two compounds, and the elements "change partners."\nExample: Zinc Carbonate (ZnCO3) and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)\n\nThe most powerful oxidizing agent in the combination (Cl) will combine with the most powerful reducing agent (Zn). This leaves the less powerful oxidizing agent (carbonate, CO3) to combine with the less powerful reducing agent (H). Again, we will need to Cls for each Zn, so the equation balances as follows:\n\nZnCO3 + 2 HCl  ->  ZnCl2 + H2CO3\n\nZinc has replaced hydrogen, and hydrogen has replaced zinc.\nAlso, chlorine has replaced carbonate, and carbonate has replaced chlorine.\n\nResult: double replacement.

question_title: Cosidering Carbon dating cannot accurately date specemin of known age, how can it be trusted to millions? [SEP] question_content: When living beings/objects are tested with carbon dating they are found to be much older by carbon dating than their known age.  (ie. living clam shells dated at 200,000 years old) how then can it be trused to millions of years to date the dinosaurs? [SEP] best_answer: Usually it's an isotope of uranium or rubidium that's used to date something that is millions of years old.  These elements have much longer half-lives than C-14 and take much longer to decay.  Often more than one element is used to date an artifact for certainty.  In other words, the object will be dated using uranium, then with strontium, and the results checked against each other.\n\nRadiocarbon dating is not accurate for very recent artifacts and anything older than 60,000 years.  So, whatever this story is about living clam shells being misdated, it's not surprising nor does it disprove radiometric dating.  Variation in carbon levels make it difficult to accurately date a contemporary object.  Also, people sometimes state that all radiocarbon dating is wrong because of a few errors, this is misleading since it is very easy to contaminate objects with recent carbon and skew the results.

question_title: physics problems? [SEP] question_content: how do you find an object's initial velocity if only an initial high, the range and the above horizonal angle are given?\nFor example, if an object is fired at 10m above the ground with the angle of 40 degrees obove the horizonal and lands 15m away? what is its initial velocity? [SEP] best_answer: The answer involves a bit of algebra and is easy to lose track of where you are.\n\nConservation of energy says that\n\n0.5*m*v^2*sin(q)^2 + m*g*h = m*g*H\n\nwhere H is the height at the peak of the object's travel, q is the initial angle, h is the starting height, v is the magnitude of the velocity, and g is the gravitation acceleration. Also, we know that\n\n(1): H - h = 0.5*g*T1^2\n\nwhere T1 is the time is takes to reach the top of its travel. This expression was obtained based on the fall from the peak to the starting height h. Using this expression and the conservation of energy expression\n\n(2): T1 = v*sin(q)/g\n\nThe remaining distance h is covered in a time T2 given by\n\n(3): h = v*sin(q)*T2 + 0.5*g*T2^2\n\nGiven the range of travel (L) we know that\n\n(4): v*cos(q)*T = L\n\nand the relation among the individual times is\n\n(5): T = 2*T1 + T2\n\nT1 is counted twice for the upward and downward motion of the arc. That is the time to reach the top of its travel from its initial height and to return to that height..\n\nUsing expression (5) and replacing T2 in expression (3) we have\n\n(6): 0.5*g*(T^2 + 4*T1^2 - 4*T1*T) + v*sin(q)*(T - 2*T1) - h = 0\n\nFrom equation (2) we can substitute for T1\n\n(7): 0.5*g*(T^2 + 4*v^2*sin(q)^2/g^2 - 4*v*sin(q)/g * T) + v*sin(q)*(T -2*v*sin(q)/g) - h = 0\n\nSimplifying this becomes\n\n(8): 0.5*g*(T^2 - 4*v*sin(q)/g*T) + v*sin(q)*T - h = 0\n\nUsing Equation (4) to replace T\n\n(9): 0.5*g*(L^2/(v^2*cos(q)^2) - 4*sin(q)*L/(cos(q)*g)) + L*sin(q)/cos(q) - h = 0\n\nwhich, after rearranging, becomes\n\n(10): g*L^2/2 - (h*cos(q)^2 + L*sin(q)*cos(q))*v^2 = 0\n\nor\n\nv^2 = g*L^2/(2*(h*cos(q)^2 + L*sin(q)*cos(q)))\n\nGiven the values you mentioned above, v = 9.125 m/s.

[SEP] question_content: find an equation of the line through the point (3,5) that cuts off the least area from the first quadrant [SEP] best_answer: so the equation of a line which cuts off an area from the first quadrent is y=mx+b. this line has a negative slope. \n\nthe area cut off is therefore a triangle. area of triangle is .5*base*height. height for the triangle is b and base is (-b/m).\nthese values were obtained as follows:\n\nheight is simply when x=0, so y(height of the triangle)=0+b.\nbase is when y=0, so 0=mx+b. x(base of triangle) = -b/m\n\n\nplug these into the equation for area gives A=-.5*b^2/m.\nbecause they pass through pt (3,5) 5=m*3+b\n\nsubstitute b into the equaiton for area. this gives u a formula for area in terms of m only.\n\ndiffernetiate A in terms of m. ie. find dA/dm\n\nset dA/dM =0 and solve for m.\n\nto test whether this is a maximum or minimum for area, u should find d^2A/dm^2 ie. second derivative and see if it is positive or negative. \n\nnow u have a value for m which u can plug back into 5=m*3+b to solve for b.

question_title: How do I measure the temperature inside a microwave oven? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You could put a microwave safe thermometer as other have suggested.  \n\nHowever, theoretically in the absence of water, the temperature inside the microwave oven shoudn't change ata ll.  Microwaves cause water molecules to vibrate more and that causes heat.\n\nIn reality this is what will/could happen:\n\n1.  Your microwave safe thermometer probably has a minute amount of water in it, so it will itself get hot and give a false reading. (like a bowl gets hotter than the food in it!)\n\n2.  If the thermometer does read correctly, it might see a slight temp increase from the fan, lights, and magnetron operation.\n\n3.  The walls of the oven may have some water and they will heat up causing a slight temperature increase.\n\nI would expect to see a little temperature increase, but nothing like a traditional electric or gas fired oven.

question_title: what are some of the disadvantages shared by all renewable-energy sources such as solar cells and . . .? [SEP] question_content: wind turbines? [SEP] best_answer: Well, in some cases (like solar cells) the cost can be prohibitive. Retrofitting a house with enough solar energy to participate in a buy-back program can cost $35,000, which would mean (at the current pricing structure) a 20-year ROI. Most folks in the US move every 5-10 years, so you would never realize that "payoff".\nIn other cases, like biodiesel and ethanol, the distilling process can take almost as much energy to produce, overall, as it will harness. Sure, you get portability with the non-fossil liquid fuels, but the energy to make the stuff still has to come from somewhere else, and right now, that means coal, nuke, or oil power primarily (at least in the USA).\nOther disadvantages include unreliability, slow recharge times, limited range, and limited performance when compared to fossil fuels. Even wind power (which is fairly cost-effective) is not terribly reliable, depending on a variable power supply (wind). If generation points were distributed more broadly around the country, there might be more reliable average generation, but a still day still means "no power." \nThere is no doubt that "renewable sources" are a possibility, but the state of the art right now is about at the "finger painting" level.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why is the plate tectonics theory so important? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The beginnings of the theory of plate tectonics date to around 1920, when Alfred Wegener, the German meteorologist and geophysicist, presented the first detailed accounts of how today's continents were once a large supercontinent that slowly drifted to their present positions. Others brought forth evidence, but plate tectonics processes and continental drift did not attract wide interest until the late 1950s, when scientists found the alignment of magnetic particles in rock responded to the earth's magnetic field of that time. Plotting paleomagnetic polar changes (see paleomagnetism) showed that all continents had moved across the earth over time.\n\nSynthesized from these findings and others in geology, oceanography, and geophysics, plate tectonics theory holds that the lithosphere, the hard outer layer of the earth, is divided into about 7 major plates and perhaps as many as 12 smaller plates, c.60 mi (100 km) thick, resting upon a lower soft layer called the asthenosphere. Because the sides of a plate are either being created or destroyed, its size and shape are continually changing. Such active plate tectonics make studying global tectonic history, especially for the ocean plates, difficult for times greater than 200 million years ago. The continents, which are c.25 mi (40 km) thick, are embedded in some of the plates, and hence move as the plates move about on the earth's surface.\n\nThe mechanism moving the plates is at present unknown, but is probably related to the transfer of heat energy or convection within the earth's mantle. If true, and the convection continues, the earth will continue to cool. This will eventually halt the mantle's motion allowing the crust to stabilize, much like what has happened on other planets and satellites in the solar system, such as Mars and the moon.

They both contain the functional group characteristic of esters, polyester is just made up of many ester molecules linked together.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: How big is the world (universe)? [SEP] question_content: And what is in the outer place of the universe? [SEP] best_answer: From the physics point of view, our universe thus far is approximately 15 billion light years and expanding every second. Light year is the distance that light with the speed of nearly 300,000 Km/s travels in one year. This distance equals 9, 500, 000, 000, 000 Km (that light travels each year). Now, imagine how big our universe is!!\n\nAbout the second part, The space-time (space and time are inseparable) make our universe. They are both dynamic and the  fact that universe expands means both the space and the time expand. Now, in what do the space and time and our universe expand? This fact is not like other daily facts in our life, it is not possible to assign a place for space-time so that our universe expand in it. We cannot say there is something outside our universe because it is meaningless. These concepts are complex and require in-depth studies and deliberating.\n\nI hope these would be a little helpful...

question_title: Why is it bad to look directly at the sun? [SEP] question_content: What does it do to your eyes? And I mean this seriously, no junk please, just the true facts [SEP] best_answer: The Sun is very bright and by focussing the light onto the back of your eye (the retina) with or without a telescope, you are putting a lot of energy (both optical light and infra-red) onto a tiny area. At some point in your life you may have tried to set paper on fire using a magnifying glass, so just think about that being done to the back of your eye. It isn't nice. Even more scarily is the fact that the retina of your eye does not have pain receptors, so you will not even feel the damage being done. It may not even become apparent until later.

question_title: What does a person whose been blind since birth dream? [SEP] question_content: they have no visual reference, so I was wondering what and how they dream. [SEP] best_answer: very detailed answer with links to look at:\n\nhttp://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=99188\n\nanother link:  \n     "The answer, simply put, appears to be "no." When people born blind were questioned about what they "see" in dreams in several studies, their answers indicate that the experience of vision first is needed before it can be translated into a dream. Those blind for a lifetime instead experience other keenly developed senses in their dreams--i.e., the sensation of moving around, the emotion of joy, etc.\n\n     Dream images of the blind instead seem to be reconstructions of objects based on sensory input such as touch and sound, just as occurs in waking life. But can these images be accurately described as visual? Can an object be recreated in detail if the dreamer has in fact never experienced seeing it?\n\n     Other studies indicate that individuals blind at birth do see visual images. But it can be argued that these images are constructs based on input from other senses (and on what the dreamer has been told by the sighted about what these objects look like)."\n\nhttp://vision.about.com/od/severevisionloss/f/blinddreams.htm	Science & Mathematics

question_title: the strongest oxidizing agent among the following is, oxygen, hydrogen, lithium, fluorine? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Oxidizing agents remove electrons from other atoms to complete a stable outer octet.  Therefore, oxygen and fluorine are oxidzers.  (Hydrogen and lithium, because they can lose electrons more easily than accept them, are reducing agents.)\nSo, of the two oxidizers which is better?  It will be the one that is more electronegative.  Electronegativity increases left to right on a row in the periodic table*.  F is therefore more electronegative than O, so the winner is F.\n'Chemistry is full of exceptions and this rule does not hold for the noble family (VIIIa) because their electron structures are fully satisfied.

question_title: What is the universe and what is it made of? [SEP] question_content: its a science class assinment i was wondering what you people on the web were thinking.......i need someone really smart or high in education to ansewer me. [SEP] best_answer: There are only about 100 kinds of atoms in all the Universe, and whether these atoms form trees or tyres, ashes or animals, water or the air we breath, depends on how they are put together. The same atoms are used again and again. Structure determines not only the appearance of materials, but also their properties. \n\nOur universe consists of all known mass, energy, space, and time. Evidence suggests that our universe began as an incredibly hot and dense region referred to as a singularity. The science called cosmology studies and hypothesizes on how the universe has evolved from singularity to its present as well as possible future states. The dominant theory of universal evolution goes by the familiar name of big bang (or big bang cosmology). At its simplest the big bang refers to a explosive expansion of the entire universe, starting from singularity and continuing to today. Thus, the big bang encompasses all of the events in our universe that have occurred subsequent to singularity. Particularly, all of the energy and mass in our universe was formed within and subsequent to singularity. Every atom that ever was and every atom that ever will be (such as those in our bodies) was created in the course of the big bang.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: how do fireflies light up? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Fireflies or lightning bugs make light within their bodies. This process is called bioluminescence and is shared by many other organisms, mostly sea-living or marine organisms. Fireflies light up to attract a mate. To do this, the fireflies contain specialized cells in their abdomen that make light.\n\nThe cells contain a chemical called luciferin and make an enzyme called luciferase. To make light, the luciferin combines with oxygen to form an inactive molecule called oxyluciferin. The luciferase speeds up the reaction, which occurs in two steps:\n\n   1. The luciferin combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is found in all cells, to form luciferyl adenylate and pyrophosphate (PPi) on the surface of the luciferase enzyme. The luciferyl adenylate remains bound to the enzyme:\n\n      luciferin + ATP -------------> luciferyl adenylate + PPi\n\n   2. The luciferyl adenylate combines with oxygen to form oxyluciferin and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Light is given off and the oxyluciferin and AMP are released from the enzyme's surface:\n\n      luciferyl adenylate + O2 -------------> oxyluciferin +AMP + light\n\nThe wavelength of light given off is between 510 and 670 nanometers (pale yellow to reddish green color). The cells that make the light also have uric acid crystals in them that help to reflect the light away from the abdomen. Finally, the oxygen is supplied to the cells through a tube in the abdomen called the abdominal trachea. It is not known whether the on-off switching of the light is controlled by nerve cells or the oxygen supply.\n\nThe luciferin-luciferase chemical reaction has been used for years to measure the amount of ATP produced in cells and by various chemical reactions. Recently, the gene (section of DNA coding for the protein) for the luciferase enzyme has been isolated, placed in the genes of other organisms, and used to follow the synthesis and/or expression of other genes (i.e. used as a reporter gene).

question_title: What is the main ingredient in steel? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Iron is the primary element in steel. Carbon is added in an amount generally around to 0.2% (by weight). Structural steel is often made of steel identified as "A36" with the following composition (by weight):\n\nC: 0.26%\nCu: 0.20%\nMn: 0.75%\nP: Max 0.04%\nS: Max 0.05%\nThe remaining ~99% is iron (Fe).\n\nAs you can see, carbon is actually a closer third in amount (by weight) after Fe and Mn. However, the amount of carbon has large effects on the steel properties and is therefore the amount of carbon is a common way of classifying different steels.\n\nSteel actually has a number of different structures, and the amount of carbon is the important element in determing which structure, along with the way it was formed (or heat treated after first being formed from a liquid).\n\nThere are a wide range of elements added to steel and different process and treatments used to achieve the desired properties.

question_title: wh sun is not attracted towards earth since? [SEP] question_content: gravitation [SEP] best_answer: The sun and earth exert equal gravitational forces on each other. If you ignore all the other interacting bodies, the sun and earth rotate about a common center of mass (which is actually located inside the sun). Contrary to what one answerer said, the earth is not in a "tenuous" or precariously balanced orbit. Our velocity in solar orbit is about 18.5 miles/sec. If we added (or subtracted) a bit of speed, say 1 mile/sec, our orbital shape would become more (or less) energetic and more elliptical. We might not like the climate change but we wouldn't fly off or crash into the sun. The velocity and the distance between the bodies determines the orbit. Change one or the other and you have a different orbit. Remove all velocity and you crash into the sun; add a huge velocity increment and you escape. (Note that if you're in a circular orbit you are traveling at escape velocity * 0.707, so that tells you how much faster you need to be going to escape.) This intrinsic stability enabled early experiments in putting objects into earth orbit before precise velocity control was available. The orbits weren't beautiful (and earth orbits will always decay due to atmospheric drag) but they were otherwise stable.	Science & Mathematics

Iron filings do not work well; they are too big. Good sources for small magnetic particles are:\n\n* magnetic inspection powder from welding shops\n* particles from burned steel wool (after mortar and pestle)\n* particles scraped from the surface of video tapes\n* particles "mined" from sand with a plastic bag and a magnet (see external links)\n\nThese fluids are not very stable, however. The particles will tend to clump and the fluid properties will be lost quickly. Fluids created for professional purposes use emulsifiers to suspend very small oily (octane or kerosene) magnetic particles in water. The particles are very fine; less than a micrometre in diameter.

question_title: Is food heated in a microwave oven carcinogenic? [SEP] question_content: Microwave oven works wonders for me but I came accross in the web that says the unnatural heating of the microwave oven disconfigures the protein, etc., such that these can become carcinogenic. Am now considering throwing my microwave in the garbage! [SEP] best_answer: Nearly everybody in industrialized nations have been using microwaves on a daily basis for the entire duration of the 80's up until now.  Fewer, but a substantial amount of people have been using microwaves when they were not as dirt cheap in the 50's, 60's and 70's.\n\nThink about it; if there were a true carcinogenic threat from food cooked in a microwave oven, wouldn't we see a big increase in cancer patients starting in the 80's and increasing up until now?  Wouldn't somebody have figured out the carcinogenic threat already?	Science & Mathematics
question_title: wie geschieht Versteinerung? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hey does your question mean - how does fossilation happen\n\nMost fossils are found in sedimentary rocks, those rocks produced by the accumulation of sediment such as sand or mud. Wind and other weathering conditions wash away sediment on land, depositing it in bodies of water. For this reason, fossils of sea creatures are more common than those of land creatures. Land animals and plants that have been preserved are found mostly in sediments in calm lakes, rivers, and estuaries.\n\nThe likelihood that any living organism will become a fossil is quite low. The path from the organic, living world to the world of rock and mineral is long and indirect. In the best conditions, fossilization will occur if an animal or plant dies and is quickly covered over with moist sediment. This prevents the animal or plant from being eaten by other organisms or from undergoing natural decay through exposure to oxygen and bacteria. The soft parts of an animal or plant decay more quickly than its hard parts. Teeth and bones are therefore more likely to be preserved than skin, tissues, and organs. Because of this fact, most fossils come from the time period dating to almost 600 million years ago, when organisms began to develop skeletons and hard parts.\n\n=====================================\nAm not too sure of my German\n\nDie meisten Fossilien werden die von der Ansammlung der Ablagerung in sedimentären Felsen, die Felsen gefunden werden hergestellt wie zum Beispiel Sand oder Schlamm. Wind und andere Verwitternbedingungen waschen weg Ablagerung auf Land, deponierend es in Gewässern. Aus diesem Grund sind Fossilien von Seenkreaturen gemeinsamer als jene von Ländernkreaturen. Landen Sie Tiere und Pflanzen, die bewahrt worden sind, sind gefunden größtenteils in Ablagerungen in ruhigen Seen, Flüssen, und Gezeitenmündungen. \n\nDie Wahrscheinlichkeit, die irgendein lebender Organismus ein Fossil werden wird, ist ziemlich niedrig. Der Pfad vom organischen, Welt zur Welt von Felsen und Mineral lebend, ist lang und indirekt. In den besten Bedingungen wird Versteinerung stattfinden, wenn ein Tier oder Pflanze stirbt, und ist schnell über mit feuchter Ablagerung bedeckt. Dies verhindert das Tier oder die Pflanze, von durch andere Organismen gegessen zu werden, oder erlebend von natürlichen Verfall durch Aussetzung zu Sauerstoff und Bakterien. Die weichen Teile von einem Tier oder Pflanze verfallen mehr schnell als seine harten Teile. Zähne und Knochen sind daher wahrscheinlicher, als bewahrt zu werden, enthäutet, Gewebe, und Organe. Wegen dieser Tatsache kommen die meisten Fossilien vom Zeitraum datierend zu fast 600 Millionen vor Jahren, als Organismen begonnen haben, Skelette und harte Teile zu entwickeln.

question_title: why current does't flow when there are no free electrons? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The flow of current is caused by an electric field being applied to a material if there are electrons which are not tightly bound to the atoms in the material. \n\nIn a metal, an electric field will apply enough force to the electrons to allow them to move from one atom to the next, as long as there is a free electron to replace it. The free electrons may come from a battery, or a loop of metal wire spinning in a magnetic field, for example. The bond of the electrons in the outer atomic shells to the nucleus is not so strong.\n\nOn the other hand, for an insulator, even very high electric fields will not encourage the electrons in the outer shells of the atoms to leave the atom. They are tightly bound to the nucleus.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: mirror reflection- how physics explain the light  rays hitting bouncing back A MIRROR? [SEP] question_content: A ray of light, a bunch of photons, hit a commom mirror, made of glass and a silvery paint behind. What happens then? Why the photons bounce back? Why the photons are not absorbed by the surface of the mirror? Why they bounce back in right angles?\nUse mathematics if you want. [SEP] best_answer: The experimental fact verified by experiments with light rays and mirror show that the happenings follow certain laws: If the light ray hits normally it comes back by the same path. If obliquely then it comes back obliquely equally inclined to the normal at the point of incidence and in the same plane of normal and the incident ray. But if you do experiment in which you also measure the intensity of light incident and reflected, then you find that the intensity of reflected light is slightly less. This shows that some light is either absorbed or scattered following no specific laws. Now this is the experimental fact. Now explanations. Explanation depends upon what you assume light to be made up of. If photons, then you know what happens to the table tennis ball when it hits the table without spinning. Same thing should happen to photons. That is how Newton explained  the phenomenon considering light as consisting of particles. He called them corpuscles. But photon is not an ordinary particle in bulk. It is supposed to have dual nature. Its total energy is equal h multiplied by some frequency which is a wave characteristic. Ordinary particle can have all velocities ranging from zero to velocity of light. But photons move with only one  velocity. So in case of bulky table tennis balls we say that they follow these rules of reflection which can be derived from mechanics but lose their little kinetic energy to the table and as sound. In case of photons this is not possible. So we say that if a bunch of photons are incident on a polished surface, there exists a maximum probability of following the laws of reflection, but the probability of the photon getting absorbed or getting scattered in any other direction is vey low but not zero. Similar expalnation can be thought of following the hypothesis that light is electromagnetic wave then we have to take the example of the mechanical waves and see how em wave is differen from them.

question_title: all about adsorption refrigeration? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The absorption refrigerator is a refrigerator that utilizes a heat source to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling system rather than being dependent on electricity to run a compressor. These refrigerators are popular where electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable.\n\nThe basic principle of how these refrigerators cool their interior is the same as in conventional compression refrigerators. Both use refrigerant liquids that boil at low temperatures to achieve cooling. A large amount of energy is needed to turn the liquid into gas, and this is absorbed from the surroundings, cooling them. The difference is in how the gas is turned back to liquid to use it again for more cooling. A conventional electric refrigerator uses a pump to compress the gas back to liquid; a gas absorption refrigerator uses another liquid to absorb the gas and then has extra stages to separate the pure refrigerant liquid out again for re-use, this extra part being where the heat source is involved.\n\nVariations exist, but the usual pattern of gas absorption refrigerator uses ammonia as the refrigerant and water as the absorber, with hydrogen gas included to adjust the pressure in the system. The exact mixture and pressure has to be correct to give proper cooling at normal temperatures.\n\nThe cooling system consists of four main parts: the evaporator, absorber, generator and condenser. The evaporator is where chilling happens as the liquid ammonia evaporates, absorbing heat from its surroundings to enable the liquid to turn to gas. The ammonia gas passes on to the absorber, where it dissolves in water. The solution flows down to the generator where the external heat source is used to bubble the ammonia out again. This gas is purified by condensing out water vapour before rising to the main condenser. The condenser has big fins on the outside which let air cool it sufficiently for the ammonia to flow out of the bottom as a liquid again, down into the evaporator.\n\nThe hydrogen plays an interesting part in making this cycle work. Why does the ammonia which turned to liquid in the condenser then evaporate at essentially the same temperature and pressure in the evaporator? Because the evaporator also contains hydrogen gas, and the partial pressures exerted by the two gases mean that the ammonia liquid will evaporate (Dalton's law applies). The hydrogen is present in the absorber too, but is not absorbed as it does not dissolve in the water.\n\nThe ammonia, water and hydrogen system is closed. The water in the absorber is actually a weak solution of ammonia carried out of the generator when the ammonia bubbles out by a "bubble pump" like the pipe of a coffee percolator. There is no other pump in the system, liquids flowing back down under gravity and the gas pressure being the same throughout the system.\n\nThere are other gas absorption refrigerators which use only ammonia and water with a heat source applied intermittently, possibly just once a day. These have a pressure valve between the condenser and evaporator so that the generator and condenser are pressurised when the generator is heated. The liquid ammonia is forced slowly through the valve from the high pressure side into the evaporator where it evaporates in the lower pressure. The pressure differential will last for some time after the heat source is removed, so active cooling occurs for longer than the time the heat is applied. When the pressures have equalised, the ammonia solution from the absorber can flow back into the generator ready for the cycle to start again.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can Energy be transformed or is it a misnomer? [SEP] question_content: Energy is a phenonomena and cannot be transformed into another Phenomena? [SEP] best_answer: Well, it would help if you were more familiar with English. "Phenomena" is plural. "Phenomenon" is the singular form.\n\n"Energy" has a number of different meanings, and comes in many varieties. In a general sense, energy is the characteristic that allows work to be done. The classic energy path for life on earth is: sunlight (nuclear fusion energy) is converted by chlorophyll in plants (chemical energy) to a form of sugar which the plant uses to grow. Animals eat (applying mechanical energy) the plants, which are transformed by chemical energy into sugar used for motion and for growing. Motion is mechanical energy at work.\n\nEinstein showed that energy and matter can be transformed into the other, with a tremendous release of radiation, another form of energy, and heat, also a form of energy.\n\nLiving organisms, in fact, convert what otherwise would be "wasted" energy into work and changes, so that entropy (a measure of how much energy there is in the universe) is reversed by living things.

question_title: In a diploid set of chromosomes, one member of each pair of homologous chromosomes is derived from the fathe? [SEP] question_content: In a diploid set of chromosomes, one member of each pair of homologous chromosomes is derived from the father (paternal), and the other comes from the mother (maternal). If 2n = 6, what is the probability of obtaining a gamete in which all the chromosomes are paternal ones? [SEP] best_answer: Meiosis consists of 2 nuclear divisions that reduce the # of chromosomes to the haploid # (n) in preparing for sexual reproduction. \n\nThe fertilization of the haploid cells, sperm and ova (gametes), is the diploid cell (zygote) which gives a 50% chance of daughter cells being maternal or paternal for each chromosome. not sure on the 1/8 chance of paternal chromosomes.\n\n# of possible combinations = 2 to the nth power (2 ^n)\nso, if 2n=6, then n=3 and there is 2 ^3 = 8 number of combinations.\n\nJust FYI, In humans with 23 pairs of chromosomes, a gamete  could have 2^23 or 8,388,604 possible combinations of chromosomes from that parent. Any couple could have 2^23 ×  2^23 or 70 trillion different possible children, based just on the number of chromosomes. \n\nIn addition, crossing-over, in which the two homologous chromosomes of a pair exchange equal segments during synapsis in Meiosis I, can add further variation to an individual’s genetic make-up.

question_title: What is the best way to get over an abusive partner? I still love him a lot and can't seem to get over him! [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I was in a very abusive relationship and then jumped into another one (verbal only).  To break the cycle I turned to group therapy and individual counseling.  You don't need an abusive partner, respect yourself enough to realize that anyone who treats you like this doesn't love you.  \n\nGet as far away from this situation as possible.  It's not unusual to still love them, but remember, it's an unhealthy love and therapy can help you learn that.  It's weird but you need to retrain yourself in how to find someone who is healthy.  It probably stems from something in your childhood, and you need to work thru that.  Good Luck!	Family & Relationships

question_title: you just tell me what is love? [SEP] question_content: I don't know about love. What is love . So pls tell me what is love. [SEP] best_answer: True Love ....\n\nIt's as mysterious as the stars it was written on, as elusive. It is everything it's hyped about to be. It's worth taking every risk, it's worth fighting for, and the problem is if you don't risk all then you risk even more. Love is kind of an elixir that lures us out of reality and into the realm of fantasy. It's like a drug creating an altered state of consciousness.\n\nLove is the moment when an unfavorable act becomes favorable, when you make excuses for some one else's mistakes, when you learn to tolerate, when you learn acceptance, when sacrificing becomes the beauty of life. \n\nIt's the courage to tell the truth especially when you believe its unspeakable.\n\nIt's the time when seeing some one, being seen by some one and thinking about some one feels good, when you learn to find happiness in the smallest of moments.\n\nThat's love--when you learn to put down your ego and love some one more than that.\n\nLove is forgetting your self and remembering some one else. \n\nLove is choosing your partner exactly as he is, and supporting him in his choices. It's honoring your partner's truth and wanting best for him.\n\nIt's not controlling or possessing but rather respecting and trusting.\n\nIt does not mean owning some one, getting some one, rather it means being happy in your loved one's happiness.\n\nLove means living without judgments. It means treasuring your beloved and never taking him for granted. \n\nLove means being able to forgive and learning to give more then you get. It means reaching out when you don't want to, communicating rather than assuming and asking questions rather than jumping to conclusions.\n\nIt means working things out rather than fighting, fighting rather than leaving, and staying through the hurts and disappointments, knowing that through commitment all can be healed. \n\nFalling in love is like being enveloped in a magical cloud. The air feels fresher, the flowers smell sweeter, food tastes more delectable, and the stars shine more brightly at night. You feel light and lofty as though you are floating through life, and your problems and challenges suddenly seem insignificant and easily surmountable. Your body feels alive, your skin tingles and you awaken in the morning with a smile on your face. You are suspended in a state of supreme delight.\n\nLove is a feeling and an action that arises from the most primal place within us. Making a relationship however, is a process that is learned. A relationship is the vessel that carries the precious cargo of love through time.\n\nRelationships are like a precious antique lamp; it takes a little polish and some effort to restore it to its valuable condition. A relationships love and luster will only improve with age if you continually give it the care that keeps it beautiful. But once you uncover its essential beauty it will bring you joy for years to come.\n\nAfter having said all this I want to say that you have to make the decision on your own, on one hand love is magic, on the other it's time tested relationship worked hard and furiously at.

question_title: Why.......? [SEP] question_content: ....do some people call me weird?  I have an online business, and I think it comes from knowing when I meet a freak and calling them on it, but I don't think I'm weird.  I did have counseling when I got divorced, which necessitated an evaluation (he contested the divorce), and it came out fine.  I do know I think for myself, can spot a freak in a New York minute, even on email, and am very direct, so when I call someone on something, sometimes they call me weird.  I think clearly, speak very directly and succinctly (and in general terms for the purposes of protecting my privacy at times), and read people very well.  I wonder if it's just some being pissed when I call them for what they are? [SEP] best_answer: Sometimes people think you're weird because they don't know how else to react. Being a strong, outspoken person puts people off a little bit, especially if they don't know you. They don't expect that particular reaction. You seem to have your walls built up pretty high which seems to indicate the pain you've gone through. A lot of people have been through counseling and in no way does therapy make you weird. You need to realize that other people are going to say things and you don't need to listen to them because a lot of times, people just don't have any other reaction. Be confident in who you are and you'll be fine!	Family & Relationships

question_title: Do I go or do I stay? [SEP] question_content: I am totally in love with the best guy in the world, theres just one problem, he lives in Maine and I live in SC. We both want this to work, i mean come on we have had 4 yrs of conversation to seal the deal, but i have 2 kids and are very close to my family and freinds and he has 1 child and he is also close to his freinds and family. I am totally mixed up on what to do and any great advice would be so appreciated.  He is the love of my life. [SEP] best_answer: you have to revaluate your relationship with this person. If you are truly in love ….well it would be a horrible mistake to leave. However, are you sure it is not just because you want this to work which is making you feel as if you are in love?? Talk to your family about this problem and ask their advice (since they know you better then me). Work it through with this guy and see if there is a compromise. Make sure the sacrifice is not only one sided otherwise it might haunt the relationship in the future. Make sure you know this guy and understand who he truly is because people can seem different over the net or phone??. Think and ask for guidance from those closest to you. And most of all discuss it with all the people which will be affected.	Family & Relationships

question_title: have you ever seen ppl being bullied or ignored because they are asian or black? [SEP] question_content: i have seen some asian girl being ignored in the class by other white girls. do you have a similar experience and how did you feel about it? [SEP] best_answer: firstly, are you sure you're not one of those girls? Don't take offense, im not trying to insult you. It's just that you referred to her as 'some asian girl'. If you feel bad about her being ignored, that's a good thing. it means you have a heart. but just think about how she must be feeling. Try talking to her, be nice to her. Mind u, i'm not saying to be nice out of pity. but if you never try speaking to her, you may never know what sort of a friend you're missing out on.\nAt my school, we had a lot of international students from the asian region. They could all speak english pretty well, but they tended to keep to themselves. But i still spoke to some of them and some of them ended up becoming quite good friends of mine. Don't be afraid to break through the barriers. loneliness is one of the saddest things a person has to face. There is too much going on in this world for us to tolerate racism. It's when we allow racism to succeed that we get events like the Holocaust, and the Stallinist purges.\nReach out to her. She's human too, and for all you know, friendship from you could be just what she needs. Never underestimate the need for friendship. Don't worry about what other people think of you if you do this. Being nice to someone has its own rewards, and it's the right thing to do.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: I just got a boyfriend and he sems ,to like me but my friend was going to break up with him.But when he said that he wanted to be my boyfriend, I told her and she was all moody. Later on I said I want be his girlfriend if you dont want me to. She said no and, said that she was mad at him, beacuse he said he would never break up with her. And she also said that she did not trust him.\nShould he be my boyfriend?  Should I trust him. [SEP] best_answer: Just because things went wrong with his relationship with your friend doesnt mean it wont work out for you and him.  SHE could just be telling u things to make u not trust him so you dont go out with him.  NEVER EVER listen to other people!  always go on your own judgement and what he tells u himself!  She was all moddy because she is still hurting  from the break up.  So of course she will be moody and a little upset for awhile.  I say things could work for u and him as long as u stop listening to other people and judge him for himself!  Good luck to u	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do girls try to steal other girls's boyfriends? [SEP] question_content: There are a lot of girls after my boyfriend!! Why do they do this? [SEP] best_answer: You didn't state your age, but...\n\nSince your boyfriend has a girlfriend (you), he has been "tested and proven."  Meaning he has something going on and is dateable.  Plus, people often seem to want what they can't have.  If he hasn't shown signs of being unfaithful, then best to not worry too much about it.  It will only keep burning at you inside until you become angry and resentful.  Then your boyfriend might start taking a more serious look at these other girls.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I have a really close guy friend that always gets shot down by girls he likes. How can I help him? [SEP] question_content: He sometimes seems even depressed. We once liked each other, but we are better just being friends. Does our friendship have anything to do with him not getting girls? U know, because his best friend is a girl. I just don't know how to help him. I want to so badly though because I hate to see him so sad. [SEP] best_answer: Hey:\nI understand just how he feels. I have this friend that "sweet" talks and when I turn around he gets beat up by another girl.\n\nThis is the answer. You hook him up with someone. Tell him how funny, sensitive or sweet he is with another girl to make her go out with him. You'll see how that will change in anything.\n\nAnother is that find a beautiful girl who matches him. Who has a lot in common with him. That would work just fine. \n\nAnother one is that make him go out with a girl that likes HIM. That will help even more.\n\nWhen it doesn't work in one of them, cheer him up.\nWell, nice writing.	Family & Relationships
question_title: i need help about a guy i just started talking to? [SEP] question_content: ok i just started talking to this guy i really like him so far he seems to be everything im looking for,family,wounting more kids,not hanging out,cuddling,things like that but he some time wount call me back or when he dose if he gets mad he will jus t say im hanging up ,and hang up.or if we are on the im he will just hang up what should i do how to tell if he really is serious about this ,i have asked him and he sayes he wounts to be with me and that he is serious but how can i really tell [SEP] best_answer: It is so obvious that he has no respect for you. Luckily you just started talking to him so it will be easy for you to stop talking to him. How can you "really like him" if he doesn't call you back, hang up on you on the phone and IM, blah, blah, blah. If he really liked you, he wouldn't be doing those things. He sounds mean. He's lying when he says he wants to be with you. You don't want to be with someone who is already like that when you just started talking. What more will he do if you let it go on longer?\n\nI don't mean to hurt your feelings. But it's easier for someone on the outside to really see what is going on.\n\nAny guy who really, I mean really likes a girl will do anything to make her happy. Men want to make women happy. If you're not happy, he's not the right one. I wouldn't be happy if anyone (whether it's my fiance, or boyfriend, or husband, or friend) hangs up on me. It is disrespectful.\n\nYou need to have higher standards.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I am a married 43yr old married woman who haqs lost her sex drive can anybody help me? serious question? [SEP] question_content: I hve been married for 2oyrs some good some bad not sure if i am post menaporsel [SEP] best_answer: You are probably near menopause, and this is normal.  You are a little past your prime (30's something), and your hormones are doing a number on your libido.  Don't worry.  Talk to your spouse about it for support.  Maybe you're feeling unattractive.  Feeling attractive can make you feel incredibly sensual.  Go get a massage at a spa.  Get a make over.  Some new bras and panties.  Something they'll remind you that you are still a force to be reckoned with.  Remember Demi Moore is in her 40's and has Ashton Cutcher doing his thing with her.  You can remain a sexual person all the way up into your ninety's.  It's all in your mind.  I recommend just standing alone naked in a mirror, and see your self being pleasing and pleased with the one you love.  You first have to know what's going on with you sexually.  You can also talk to your doctor, but I wouldn't recommend meds, because of all the stinky side affects.  I hope you continue your journey as a sexy, beautiful woman.	Family & Relationships

question_title: My wife suffers from anixety.  How can I be helpful to her and understand her in this state? [SEP] question_content: We have been married for 13 years. I have suffered from depression. We both have medical help for our illness. What really would be helpful from a spouse when you suffer anixety? [SEP] best_answer: I have anxiety and my husband doesn't suffer from anything...You have a head start...depression is somewhat like anxiety. If she is a girly-girl (like me), give her a good amount of affection, all the while telling and re-telling her that you love her. Sometimes, if my husband's voice is very calm and loving, it will calm me down. She just needs to know that you are there for her. And don't do like my husband and think it's funny for her to freak out so you egg it on. Simply telling her everything is going to be okay...isn't enough. If she starts freaking out too much, just hold her...that's a soothing thing to do. It has been proven to relieve stress. I hope this helps.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Can someone please help me out? [SEP] question_content: Ok so in the past I have wanted to be a teacher and my parents and family have been so proud of me making that decision and getting the grades and everything I even used to play school when I was younger. Now I have decided I want to become an actress but I really dont think my family supports my decision since they all want me to be a teacher. I dont think they believe I can do it but I really want to prove them wrong. I hate to disappoint my family and friends but this is my dream now and my friends say to follow my heart and my heart says to go out there and do the best I can and work on becoming an actress. I'm really confused and it hurts that my family wont support my desicion. What should I do? [SEP] best_answer: Oh dear. A classic case of keep the family happy or follow the dream. Of course you must follow your heart. Your parents have probably been talking for years about your good grades and the dreams they had for you. Our desires alter as we grow and change. What was right for you up to recently may not be right for you any more. That's fine. That's life. Your family are disappointed, because they were focusing thier hopes and dreams on only you; what matters are your hopes and dreams. Give them time, they sound lovely, and very likely will come round. They will be as proud of you as an actress as they would have been as a teacher. I think they'd be proud of you anyway.

She's kind of anti-social and drinks a lot, im really social but don't have to rely on substances.\n\nshe's always been with guys who have been assholes to her so im the first that just cared about her.

How do I get her to see that this is not about her but about what my husband and I want to do? [SEP] best_answer: She knows but she needs time to soak up all that information,and  she needs time to figure out how to tell you how much you will be missed.And she needs time to figure out how to apologize to you, then on top of all that she will then have to figure out how to let you go and grow up without it breaking her heart. Give her a break you just gave her a lot to think about and probably in a short amount of time. but alas i think things will work out sooner than you know, you have a very special Aunt. count your blessings.

question_title: Ladies over 22 please help!? [SEP] question_content: I have known this girl for two years, she’s 34 and I’m 30. She lives about an hour away. We went out a couple of times awhile back. First time she had an old friend get in the way, and they pursued a relationship. The second time she indicated that if I lived closer she would pursue a relationship but didn't want a long distance relationship. We kept in touch and emailed almost daily, pretty much excessively as many as 20 times a day (considering we both have office jobs, that wass pushing it I think). About 3 months ago I told her (casually) that I was seeing somebody. She immediately suggested that she was coming to my town and wanted to hang out for awhile. We did. She asked how things were going with the g/f, and I told her they were ok and that we were reaching the make or break point of the relationship. I asked her if she was seeing somebody, and she hesitated (what does the hesitation mean) before saying that she had been seeing somebody for a year. I told her I was happy for her. We had a nice innocent time together. On that following Monday I emailed her and said that I was happy for her that things were going well for her. It’s been a month and she hasn’t really kept in touch at all, not like she used to. Any ideas on what her intentions were and what the heck she is thinking now? Thanks gals, I appreiciate it [SEP] best_answer: Well she may be moving on she already stated she don't want a long distance relationship, and know that you have a "girlfriend" she may be trying to find her own that pause mean she has been dating but nothing serious.  But you opened up the possibility she can find someone too. You guys are good friends but I think the time isn't right for the both of you.  Not to say if you visit her she want come see you or vice versa, but i don't know what's going on in HER mind she would have to tell you that and just ask ! Email her and ask her for her honest opinion if you want more from her then you both can come to an agreement of what this relationship is truly going to be just friends or lovers!!!

question_title: i really2x wanna know the best way to get many friends..? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hi Shady, I hope you don't take this in the wrong way, but I also have seen (and answered) your questions on weight loss as well. I am becoming concerned for you, look, life is not about being the most beautiful, or the most popular. Only very shallow people obsess over these things. I am concerned that you may have an unhealthy view of yourself, which may bring you to harm, if not physically, then possibly mentally. A few tips: \n1: there are no physically ugly people in this world, only attitude ugly people,\n2: You do not need a lot of friends, I personally only have about 4 really close friends who I love and cherish very much and I know if the chips were down, then I could rely upon them, whereas if you have hundreds of friends, then to each of them you are worth 1/100th of their love and respect,\n3: If people do not love, respect and admire you for who you are (personally and physically), then they are not your friends and do not deserve the time and effort you are obviously willing to put into making them like you.\nPlease, please, learn to love you for you, then people will learn to love you as well. Please send me an email, I am in Australia, but would love to correspond to see if I can help you. Jay	Family & Relationships

My ex came along for the drive cuz I drove cross country with our daughter and a lotta cash. Now he's leavin in 5 days and super depressed about it. I know he's goanna miss her but he has to go. I'm goanna miss him. I love him but with circumstances it just won't work out. Is there anything any of you can advise to make the separation easier on all of us? He's going 2000 miles away and very anxious as to when he'll see our daughter again. And she's going to take it very hard looking for daddy and he won't be there...any thoughts? [SEP] best_answer: Hi Dakota:\nSo sorry to hear all your pain.....but the good part of this is I hear lots, and lots of love going on here.  Wow.  Glad to hear it...and keep it up.  \n\nDon't worry.  Keep busy with some other passion, other then him, and all will be fine.   I discovered all sorts of interesting passions when I was alone.....I actually started to really find me and my daughter, and we had lots of fun, and when my love came back, well he was really happy to see the 'new' me.  I had matured and become 'more' attractive to him because I had another passion.  and our daughter learned from seeing me function and find myself more steady!  She is now much older, but she is very independent now as a result.\n\nIt is hard, and I know you can do it, because lots of us out there did what you are doing.   So, dive out on the internet and look up some of your passions--be it painting, walking, hiking, drawing, find something fast.  and your honey will appreciate you all that much more.\n\nTrust me on this one,\n\nluv Ava	Family & Relationships

Don't be afraid to ask a guy to join you for a meal or a walk. Keep it casual. The thing I see most often is a guy or a gal who are only interested if they see you as a potential mate.(and start planning their whole life on the first date)  Avoid that pitfall.

question_title: How soon is too soon to have sex with someone you met yesterday? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Why, Why, Why, do you want to have sex with someone you don't even know? There is a name for a person like that. A "SLUT" or A "HOOKER". A "SLUT is someone who has indiscriminate sex with whomever. A "HOOKER" does the same thing. The only difference between the two, is that at least the hooker is smart enough to get paid for the service. PLEASE wait until you know this person! Have enough respect for yourself not to take these kinds of risks. And yes, it is a HUGH risk. Disease is spread rapidly by indiscriminate sex. If you don't believe me, just look at animals, and the rate of rabies. This is why our pets MUST have their rabies shots every year. As humans we don't get rabies. However, we do get diseases that are just as bad or even worse. I BEG of you PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR YOURSELF!!!	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is this the correct thing to do? [SEP] question_content: Two weeks ago I confronted my boyfriend about txt msgs he had been recieving on his cell.  He told me who they were from.  He was being sneaky about the msgs, hiding it from me.  But when I confronted him he told me everything.  He asked me if I wanted him to stop talking to her he would.  I told him the next morning that I wanted him to stop talking to her.  For the past two weeks I havent seen her send him a txt msg with the exception of last night.  She sent him one and he lied to me about it.  I only know this because I checked his cell this morning.  I confronted him about it and he told me that he has gotten msgs from her but hasnt responded.  Then he told me that she had sent him an email, a RiverSongs greeting.  He kept that, didnt delete it.  Do you think that it would be bad of me to email her and tell her that I am my boyfriends girlfriend and that we are expecting twins and that I wish she would stop emailing him and txting him? [SEP] best_answer: I don't think it's good for you to contact women through your mans' means of communication.\n\nThis isn't a problem with the woman, it's actually your man. He's responsible for what he does. \n\nI know you won't check me as 'best answer', but I'm telling you right now, he isn't trying that hard to keep you. You are having twins with him and you two haven't tied the knot. I'm guessing that if he asked you, you'd be ecstatic, right? \n\nStep outside from your body for one second and take a look at this picture:\nThere is this woman who wants this man. They get together and have the boyfriend/gf title for ages... she gets pregnant. They remain unmarried. Now there is another woman texting msgs to this father-to-be. The gf gets jealous and protective of her relationship with this man and their children to be...\n-questions: Wouldn't a man who was very devoted make this right and concrete for the sake of his woman and his children... and get a marriage certificate? Why does this other woman have his #? Why did the gf allow herself to become pregnant with this man's children with no true contract or guarantee of relationship and put their future children in this position?\n\nPeople who give advice about getting your stuff straight  when starting things like families give it because they want things to go smoothly for you.. not cause problems like the ones you are having. Sure, your man is probably lovable and an all around ok guy... but so what? You are having this problem, and the only one that can fix it is him.\n\nI don't mean to send out a bitch answer like this, but I hear this stuff all the time from people like my cousins. WHY do us women get pregnant and just HOPE it'll all work out... then complain to others when it doesn't? We all lie in the beds we make. Your #1 obligation now, is your children. Your man isn't a winner.\n\nSo to answer your question, again, don't email her. She isn't the problem... regardless of any lack of respect which she may have for his future children's lives. The problem is him and he should fix it. The real underlying problem is the foundation which you two built and somehow deemed fit to start a family on.	Family & Relationships
question_title: How can tell my boyfriend I'm not in the mood....? [SEP] question_content: He's so hot..He's always on the go. But sometimes I don't feel like doing it. How can tell without hurting his ego? [SEP] best_answer: Sometimes a significant other needs to understand that there are two important people in a relationship, not just one.  If he is a worthy boyfriend he will find a matue way of accepting your needs and desires, even if those needs slow him down a little.  It's certainly not an unreasonable request you have.  Reading between the lines of your letter (if that's possible) I sense that between the two of you, you tend to give more importance to the other person's ego, needs, etc, than your own.  Men can sense that and men will take advantage of some ladies if you continually put him first and you last.  I would rethink your positioning in the relationship and not feel guilty about imposing you own rules, desires, comfort level needs.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What age is considered old for a woman? How about a man? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: We are supposed to enjoy and live our life normally and never think of how old are we and when are we going to die. Nobody knows how long he is going to live to tailor his life accordingly. Some people married after the age of 70 or 80 and they begot children and lived happily.

[SEP] question_content: we have been friends for a while were apart for 7yrs and now closer than ever I fell in lv w/her first I never thought I would with the same sex.I've been in lv before w/men I am 40 and this is all new to me I was not raised to be like this but can't control my heart.we get along so great better than w/our own mates.who we talk about a lot and we get treated bad fr them.she has told me she wants to be held&kissed but don't wanna start a new relasp w/someone else and get hurt again.we see each other a lot and sometimes when we look into each others eyes nothing else matters I wake up thinking about her and all day until I go to sleep.our mates are out of town and we are both lonely.she has told me she trust me more than anybody else she knows how I feel and in my heart I know she feels at least something more we have told each other we loved each other many times but says she feels our frdsh is like sisters or good friends but the signs she gave me I know is more than that.isTHSDENEIL? [SEP] best_answer: Hi angel. I am sorry that you are going through a tough time with your mate, and that your friend is also. \n\nI want to start by warning you that I am a lesbian, so I may be a bit biased on this matter. If you are looking for opinions from straight people, feel free to move on.\n\nIt sounds a lot like you are feeling real emotions and a connection with your friend. I can't tell without meeting her whether she is feeling the same way about you, but I would definitely suggest following your heart. Don't let society's ideas keep you from doing what your heart tells you is right.\n\nI would suggest not just coming out and saying "I want to be with you", or by kissing her. You really dont want to destroy the wonderful friendship that you have.\n\nAn example of a more subtle way, would be this: Next time you are talking together, and you are discussing your troubles with your mates, find a way to give her a hug, and hold the hug for a good bit longer than you need to. Then, pull back and look her in the eyes with tears in your own eyes, and a smile on your face, and just say. "Thanks, I needed that, and I love you." Then, hold her gaze with your own, and see what her reaction is.\n\nThis way, if she has no feelings for you in that way, she is free to consider it as simply an in-need-of-comfort hug, and she won't be insulted by the action. However, if she is feeling the same way, she shouldn't be able to resist the eye-to-eye look you will be giving her, and she will kiss you.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful experience with your friend, and whatever happens, please don't let your friendship suffer.

Height doesn't really matter much either. As for you training her, if you are not a professional wrestler how can YOU train her?, most likely there is some kind of wrestling school somewhere around where you live, get her REAL training, check the Internet for local schools, if she does not get proper training she could seriously injure herself or even worse someone else.

I would say it all the depends on the individual in question.  How long have you trained and what it is your educational background?  Do you have knowledge of the business side of things?  Do you have a business license?\n\nI (only) have a single black belt, but I have been training in various martial arts systems for over 17 years.  Does that mean that I have not mastered more than "the basics"?  Am I one of those people who train and train but "never seem to get anywhere"?  Maybe, maybe not.\n\nI have taught martial arts only as private lessons.  But I have assisted in countless demonstrations, seminars and training camps for my teacher.  It would appear that at first glance I still have not "acheived" the privilege of opening my own school.\n\nHowever, I have two college degrees, and have been a public school teacher for 12 years.  And if I have learned anything through all of my experiences, it's that being a successful martials instructor has as much to do with business acumen as it does with knowing the lore of the art.\n\nWho is to say who is ready?  Only the individual can truly say.  All one really needs to do is to apply all that training that has gone before to the goals now set in sight.  90% of all martial arts training is a contingency plan (what do you do if...?).  So what are the contingencies of running a business?  Answer that and you should be ready.\n\nBest of Luck.  I hope to be in that position myself in the near future.\n\nVT	Sports

question_title: what are the benefits of martial art to yourself? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I just picked up an article from a web site regarding the benefits of martial arts,hope this article can answer your question promptly.\nWhat are Martial Arts?\nMost of us are familiar with the term martial arts, whether it be from personal experience or from watching television shows or movies featuring the moves of this dazzling sport. Technically defined, martial arts are systems of combat and self-defense. Developed in various countries including China, Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines, martial arts systems have been around for centuries. Martial arts are now becoming more and more popular, especially amongst North Americans. Practiced not only as a way to learn self defense, martial arts allows followers to increase personal fitness, reduce stress, and improve mental health.\n\nHealth Benefits of Martial Arts\nMartial arts aren’t just about self-defense anymore, although this can still be a major benefit to practicing these sports. Instead, more and more men and women are turning to martial arts because of the vast array of health benefits associated with these fitness systems. Some of the health benefits that regular practice of a martial art can bring you include:\n\n\nincreased muscle strength \nheightened stamina \nweight loss and weight maintenance \nimproved flexibility \nbetter posture and balance \nimproved agility\n\nWhen combined with a healthy diet, regular practice of a martial art can even help to lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. But the benefits of martial arts aren’t just physical – these sports also work wonders for your mental and emotional wellbeing, helping to:\n\n\nreduce stress \nimprove concentration \nincrease self confidence\n\nWhat Is Involved in Martial Arts?\nEach system of martial arts is different, however, most combine some of the following features:\n\n\nForms: Most martial arts involve the practice of various forms, which are poses or movements performed in a routine. These routines can be practiced alone or with a partner and may involve kicking, jumping, or punching. Forms are typically non-combative. \nSparring Most martial arts feature some type of sparring, whether it be light, moderate, or heavy contact. Sparring involves fighting with an opponent while protected with foam padding and other protective gear. \nSelf Defense: The major goal of most martial arts systems is self-defense. The moves that you will learn will increase your ability to defend yourself against another person’s advances, and help you to deal with physical confrontation.\n\n\nTypes of Martial Arts\nThere are dozens of different martial arts systems that you can become involved with. Here are a few of the most popular martial arts:\n\nKarate\nKarate is perhaps the most well known of all the martial arts systems. It is also the most widely-practiced martial art in North America. Originating on the island of Okinawa in Japan, karate literally means "open hand." This is because all of the movements involved in karate use the hand as the main weapon. In karate, participants focus all of their energy into one contact point in order to overcome their opponent. Most karate movements involve striking with the hands, feet, or elbows, however, the sport also involves some grappling. Karate is excellent for those who want to increase their overall fitness levels and improve their upper body strength and fitness.\n\nJudo\nJudo was derived from the martial arts system, Jujutso, and literally means the "gentle way." Judo teaches students how to use the strength and ability of their opponents in order to win the advantage in a match. It typically involves grappling, throwing, and rolling the opponent. Judo is excellent for those who are looking to improve their fitness levels without bulking up too much. It is particularly well-suited to women and people of smaller physical stature.\n\nTaekwondo\nTaekwondo was created in Korea in the 1950s as an offshoot of karate. It emphasizes kicking t	Sports

question_title: Where are the cards and pad kept? [SEP] question_content: In the USA vs. Italy match I saw that he has his red card in his left breast pocket. I am guessing he has his yellow card in his right breast pocket. Where do they keep their match pad?\n\n(resubmitted after posted in wrong category) [SEP] best_answer: You can put it where ever you like. Cards today can be written on as opposed to the past.\nSome refs keep both cards together, some keep the red in the back shorts packet, some in the left breast.\n\nIt doesn't really matter, so long the individual remembers where he put it. Even if he forgets, it makes no difference, you can always check before pulling out the card.\n\nThe famous Dutch referee Mario van der Ende, usually kept both cards together. Whence a foul was committed, everyone will be in suspense as he takes both cards out and then only, flashes the yellow. The look of relief on the offender's face, adds spice to the game.	Sports

question_title: I would like to get into the martial arts but one that does not require years of practice can anyone help me.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a few things that you need to be aware of before going down this path. There are lots of people who will try to convince you that system X or system Y are the most effective, and that you can learn these systems in days or weeks. Not to put too fine a point on it, but these claims are utter horse poopoo. If you want to be skilled in a system, it is going to require some effort on your part. That being said, it is quite possible to become quite effective in relatively short order IF AND ONLY IF you are willing to put in the effort to get there. Also, before I go any further, please understand, I'm not saying these systems are better than others. Some systems have a different focus than others. That's not better, it is just different. Much like comparing apples and bananas, one isn't better than the other, they're just different.\n\nOk, with that out of the way, let's dig into the meat of your question. The first thing you need to decide is what is  it you want to get out of it? Are you looking to be able to protect yourself and others quickly and effectively? Or are you interested in competing in full contact fighting? Or are you just interested in doing it for yourself because it is something you think you'd enjoy? How you answer the above questions will dictate to some degree the best answer for you. \n\nIf you are strictly interested in effective self defense, there are some suggestions that I would make based on my personal experience. The Filipino systems of Kali, Escrima, and Arnis really hit the ground running, so to speak. They, along with the countless flavors of Indonesian Pencak Silat (pronounced pent-jahk see-laht), and some of the Chinese systems such as Wing Chun, Chung-I Chuan, and San Soo, are very much focused on turning you into a multi-faceted fighter in relatively short order. I prefer these systems because they don't focus on just one particular area. They incorporate bare hand techniques, weapon techniques (sticks and daggers are particularly common), and grappling techniques. If you are interested in primarily bare hand techniques, you could also include Muay Thai (aka Thai boxing). The big difference between these systems and similar systems is their overall philosophy. One of the systems that I do personally is Taiji Quan. Very, very effective combat system. However, the guiding philosophy is that they expect that you'll be studying Taiji for the rest of your life. As a result, though you do become extremely effective in combat, it comes with time and isn't a major focus from the start. The systems I mention above, though, focus on making you at least competent in as short of a time as possible. \n\nIf you are interested in full contact fighting, then I would recommend going in the direction of something like Shootfighting or Brazillian Jiujitsu (aka Gracie Jiujistu). I've known people who practiced both of these styles and can attest to the fact that they became relatively skilled rather quickly. The big distinction between these styles and the first group of styles that I mentioned is that the self defense oriented styles include many, many techniques that would be patently illegal in full contact fighting. \n\nI hope this provides some information that you will find useful. Again, I can't advise you strongly enough to avoid the systems that will tell you that they will teach you to become a whirlwind of death in 30 days or similar nonsense. Anything worth doing takes effort and practice, and if it was easy, everyone would do it. I've spent most of my life in the martial arts, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. It has been a great experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too. Good luck!	Sports

question_title: I purchsed a Taylor Made driver a while back and discovered some thing is loose in side the head.  Need help.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This has happened to me a few times. \n\nThe "thing" loose inside the head is a piece of the epoxy broken off and just rattling around in there. It won't hurt anything, it's just kind of annoying. \n\nBack in the old days I drilled a small hole in the back of my driver and shot some expanding foam in there....that worked then, however I don't think it will work now. \n\nYou can take it to a PGA pro and they can take the head off and shake out your little rascal, but my advice would be to just leave it in there and keep on slappin it!

Marcus Vick shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as those three. Most people are saying he won't even go in the first day (4 rounds)! While he has some potential, there's just to much downside to him. He's gotten in way to much trouble at VT and he left on bad terms so you can't expect any recommendations from the coaches there.

I'll do sprinting,100m, range of motion/centre of mass includes and is achieved through a combination of stride rate and stride length.the mechanics of correct sprint posture the forward lean with the head and shoulders directly above the hips, the ball of the foot should strike the ground creating foot flexion, which allows the calves to contract creating knee lift which incorporates the quads, hams, and glutes. It depends greatly on the athlete and which race they are running.

question_title: How do you condition yourself and your body for Track & Field? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I ran track and field and cross-country year round for three years. You have to condition yourself for three things: the stress on your body, the stress due to time management, and the stress on your nerves at meets.\n\nThe best way to condition your body is to have a good coach and to have open communication with him. Also, someone who is close to your skill level (or better) to train with is a necessity for both safety and to improve. Make sure that you have a balanced diet, sleep enough, don't smoke and keep drinking down to a minimum. Drink a LOT of water. \n\nIf you're in high school or university, you'll find it difficult to keep up with school work and maintain a social life when you're concentrating on track. Let your teachers know that you're on the team; not that you can expect them to treat you differently, but you should always let them know when you'll be out of class or late for sport events. Surround yourself with people who are supportive and understand that you want to succeed, and that it will take time and effort.\n\nI never really succeeded in overcoming my nerves. I would cry, throw up and pass out at track meets. There are so many people; so much is going on; the starter's gun is going off, people are running around. The best thing to do is realize that you're prepared, you are fully capable of doing it, and it will all be over soon.\n\nBy the way, which event are you running? I did the 400m and the 800m, so if you're doing pole vault or javelin, my answer may not be too helpful. Good luck!	Sports

question_title: what is wrong with WWE............? [SEP] question_content: what the fuck is wrong with WWE?Why they r constantly bringing new faces and pushing them making the old ones job to them?\nKane has been used as a jobber recently.He deserves to b the World champ or at least a maineventer.But they r making him loose to MVP every week. They tell that WWE is a fans show then \nwhy dont they give the fans what they want to see?????Moreover Benoit is holding a mid card championship.Why????The same guy that was part of the mainevent at WM 20,is being used as a midcarder now.How stupid Vince and the board is.Kane,Benoit and Undertaker also helped Vince to win the Monday Night Wars and now he is using them to put the young guys get over????Why??They consider Batista as their big draw -good.They didnt know how to use Lashley,Terkay and Khali.So they were send to ECW.Isnt this disgusting????Do u agree with me.Give your own point of view... [SEP] best_answer: 2nd shift guy, it's called tivo, or a vcr...get one and start taping.  I work the third shift and tivo is my best friend~\n\nOnto the issue:\nI think we have to severly grasp the inevitable here...Kane, like Undertaker and Benoit are on track to retire within at least 5 years top.  Wrestling has evolved over the years and wrestlers take more physical aggrevation than wrestlers of the past (in my opinion).  I believe that soon Undertaker will retire, which is what I thought was happening when they brought in Khali...I thought he would be the new phenom.  I don't think it's that they don't know how to use Lashley or Terkay or Khali rather they are trying to get these people a different exposure and more time on the camera so that people can begin to notice them better.  I mean who doesn't want to see Khali go up against Big Show??  Terkay against Lashley for the ECW Gold?? In a TLC Match??? Oh man, the possibilites are endless with ECW because of their phenomenal stipulations!  \nOn the whole Kane vs. MVP vs. UMAGA situation, I see this as a storyline that's gearing up to get Kane's character to a whole new level.  I feel that someone is will address to Kane that he used to be feared and monstrous and that because of the cheap wins by MVP and twice beaten by UMAGA is becoming unfeared which will lead to Kane to go on a sabbatical and return as the true Kane Mask and all!  At least I hope that's what's going to happen because all of these cheap wins by MVP are dissapointing!\nAlso, it wasn't just Kane and Undertaker that helped Vince win the Monday night wars (Benoit couldn't have helped by the way since he was WCW when Monday Night Wars were critical!), it was the evolution of DX, the Charisma of The Rock, and Mick Foley and Eric Bischoff (which by the way these two were the ones really responsible for WWE to win the Monday Night Wars, which I'll expain in a statement below) and of course STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN!  \nThe new faces that are being pushed are to attract new viewers and the younger generation and I have to agree that Vince is doing what is necessary for us to continue to have programming of the WWE and to have it on basic cable~\n\n"The Cure"\nKeMo\n\nwww.angelfire.com/crazy/bwa\n\nPS: ***Further explaination on Mankind and Eric Bischoff being the real reason for winning Monday Night Wars for WWE***:\n\nJanuary 1999, the WWF had begun catching up to WCW in the ratings. On January 4, 1999, a live Nitro was scheduled to air alongside a taped edition of RAW. (Wow does anyone remember when they used to do taped editions??LOL)\n\nDuring what was likely the most competitive night in the "Monday Night Wars," Bischoff instructed Tony Schiavone to remark, "And we understand that Mick Foley, who once wrestled for us as Cactus Jack, is going to win their world title. Huh! That should put some butts in the seats." Bischoff's intention was to spoil the main event, causing fans to lose interest in RAW and stay tuned in to Nitro. Instead, there was a significant backlash; Nielsen Ratings showed that within minutes of the announcement, nearly 300,000 Nitro viewers switched the channel to RAW so they could see the title change (WCW had been ahead in the ratings until Schiavone's remark). Although both shows broke quarter-hour ratings records that night, and Nitro beat five of RAW's quarter hours, it proved to be a decisive turning point in the "Wars" (even though Nitro ratings were still very solid, in the 4.5-5.0 range, Nitro never again beat RAW in the ratings).

question_title: How did the World Cup originate? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A group of visionary French football administrators, led in the 1920s by the innovative Jules Rimet, are credited with the original idea of bringing the world's strongest national football teams together to compete for the title of World Champions. The original gold trophy bore Jules Rimet's name and was contested three times in the 1930s, before the Second World War put a 12-year stop to the competition.\nHeld since 1958 alternately in Europe and the Americas, the World Cup broke new ground with the Executive Committee's decision in May 1996 to select Korea and Japan as co-hosts for the 2002 edition.

question_title: is it safe to be in a tent while it's storming/lightening? [SEP] question_content: Going camping, slight chance of pop up t'storm.  Is it safe to hide in the tent while this goes on?  Seen it in movies but that is a movie! Just generally thinking, metal poles, electricity, I am just not sure.  If you say yea it's ok please tell me why. thanks [SEP] best_answer: Actually, in the great outdoors, it doesn't really matter where you are.  You may be sheltered from the rain, but lightning is always another factor.  Though the chances of you (yourself) being struck by lightning is very slim to none...you can't rule out the possibility of it striking a tree, for example, and running through the ground and hitting you that way.\n\nThey say that the best thing to do while camping and sheltering in a tent is NOT to lay down to avoid exposure to ground currents.  You also want to be away from the tallest things around you, however, you do not want to be the tallest thing around.  If you are in an exposed site (i.e.no trees)that would make your tent probably the tallest thing around you.  In which case you should abandon everything and get somewhere (such as your car) that provides better shelter.	Sports

I'm confident that I can make a good showing on the tour if I can bowl in as many tournaments as possible. [SEP] best_answer: sponsorship for a pro bowler is a hard thing to come by.. but not impossible.. you won't find one here.. you must approach all the usual suspects ( ball and shoe mfgs ) - and don't burn any bridges... local business folks who know you and might need a write-off - it's not your skills but who you know or get to know that will end up being a sponsor - you have to sell yourself - you have to do all the legwork - congrats on your good showing - hang in there !

question_title: Who is a better overall basketball player, Dwyane Wade or Kobe Bryant? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Overall, Kobe Bryant is a better player.  \n\nWade is awesome at getting to the basket and has his midrange bank shot.  He's also a bit quicker than Kobe, but thats about it.\n\nBryant has been one of the best defensive guards in the league for many years.  Wade's good but no where close to how clutch Kobe is (how many 3's has Wade made while being triple teamed in the last second?).  Kobe also has a better midrange and 3pt shot than Wade; overall he has a bigger selection of shots and moves to choose from.  Bryant is a better floor general, and seems to have a bigger desire to win.\n\nBryant also has more NBA experience than Wade will have, since he started when he was 17-18 years old.  I've watched Bryant hitting shots while being Quadruple teamed (hitting shots while double teamed almost the whole game).  The whole Series between Dallas and Miami, whenever Wade got double teamed by Harris, Howard, or Terry he couldn't make squat.	Sports

I use Clickbank.com along with google adwords to carve out a good side income. There are a lot of people raking in the bucks as I know a few personally who do over $200,000 per year. It has taken me 3 years to make money and now I do about $3000 per month with adwords and another $1500 per month with google adsense.\n\nI too suggest getting some books to read.

Here, they wont let anyone work more than 24 hours a week, which means they dont have to provide any benefits like health care.  But they expect you to be available at any time to work any shift as needed.	Business & Finance

question_title: How to open dispatching company? [SEP] question_content: I want to open family run business and I want to know how.

What kind of forms and licences I have to have to be abble to functioning as independent dispacher(s)? I do have good relationships with 4 owner/operators in my area and one brooker from neighboring town. What else you recomend to "have to have" in my case?\nI realy appreciate efforts to help me and my family. I legaly imigrated in US 14 years ago and I am hard worker and fast learner. [SEP] best_answer: Dispatch for what type of transportation? You talk about pizza delivery, and for that I can not help you. You also talk about a broker and owner operators, which is heavy haul trucking. For this you will need your DOT authority. You can not "just dispatch", you will need to operate under your own, or another person or company's authority. If you want your own operating authority, there are many services that will help you get this for a reasonable fee. You will still need the money to pay the owner operators, advances for fuel, insurance ($750,000 to $1,500,000, depending on what type of operation you will run) and various other things. You REALLY need to know the business before you jump in. It has a very high failure rate for several reasons. 1. Under capitalized 2. This business is full of individuals that do not operate ethically. If you are not careful, your money will be gone, and they will still be operating, with someone else they can take advantage of.

However, with the ease of online banking and my cash flow cycle, I always make multiple payments, about 2 - 4 times each month.  When a credit report is pulled and shows the last payment I made on an account (assuming it was the month prior), does it show the actual amount of the last payment -- which may be $30 -- or the total of all payments over the course of the month, which is more along the lines of $300? [SEP] best_answer: No, all it show is what the minimum payment is and the new balance.  Balances are what is important if you are concerned with your credit score.  Any revolving acct that has more then 50% of the balance used will impact your credit score	Business & Finance

question_title: How can I find out if property was left for me by someone and I was never notified?

How could i find out if the grantee name is mine or just a coincidence without the people in the house finding out?\n\nThe property was listed as trustees deed one year and lis pendens another year exact same pin number. What do both mean? The treasurers office has the house listed but when i checked for the owners name only a p.o. box was given with no full name and two initials.\n\nIf the house was left to me, and i was never notified, could one of my father's children or someone else have been given rights to it? The grantor is a bank, and i have had no contact with my dad.\n\nThere was another named listed with mine on the trustees deed information. My mother says my father had a son with that same name. [SEP] best_answer: Ok, well to start, you'd have to check back in the title (public records of the county where the property is located) to see if the property was part of a probate.  \n\nA trustees deed means the house was foreclosed on.  (The number you're referring to is called an APN number by the way  :)\n\nGo back in the county records and see what information you can get from the recorded documents.  If there is a title insurer listed on the most recent deed, try to contact them.  If nothing else, the information you receive may be able to lead you to an attorney who handled your fathers estate and you can ask questions from there.	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: hey i need a web site or knwledge of the redwoods, ie i need to know what are some future plans of the redwoods [SEP] best_answer: RE: your request "need to know what are some future plans of the redwoods"\n\nRedwoods or other trees don't make plans, but I know what you meant. :)\nLook at this for a starter: http://redwoods.bullhorn.org/news/20000717/internet_sem.html\n\nThis is the kind of answer your teacher is probably looking for.  Big corporations raping the forests, etc.  While a lot of that line of thought is true, it is not usually as bad as they claim.  You might gently suggest there is some sign of hope by using the idea of "sustainablility" of the forests (IE, replanting redwoods as they are cut, similar to how the pine forests in the southeast have been placed millions of acres of land in regrowing pines as a method to continue to provide us with building wood and paper producst). \n\nFind more interesting information just by typing in your question into Google and read all you can.

question_title: is there a code in the bible? [SEP] question_content: i read the book decoding the bible and it scared me.  how true is the coding of the bible?  and why have so many of the codes been true. [SEP] best_answer: Most definately not.  Here's why.  First of all, when you go to the bookstore and bye a book named 'the Bible', you're buying a translation of an anient text. By its very nature, a translation is not the original, thus any anient codes woud be lost by the simple fact that it is translated.  Next, the Bible is very old, and was written before the age of computers, so when you needed a new Bible, it had to be written by hand.  Mistakes were no doubt made, along with mistranslations.  Again, more of any ancient code would be lost.  Finally, there are today several flavors of the Bible floating around.  Do a Yahoo! Search for, say John 3:16 and you'll find at least 4 'versions' .  Essentially the same text and meaning, but one might have a comma, or the other may use an archaic form of spelling as opposed to modern.  Thus, any code that depends on character placement would be lost the instant you insert an extraneous coma or a different spelling.  Last, the reason many of these 'codes' appear to be true, is because people are very open to interpretation.  Further, the codes themselves have been found mostly by using powerful computers with complex  search algorithms.  Given a sufficiently manipulative search pattern, even a desktop computer can cull words and phrases out of a book that are in 'a code'.  Case in point, my friends and I wrote a program in ADA (a computer language) that could find 'codes' in random texts.  We even manipulated my college report card to reveal 'you will fail', which was 'hidden'.  Of course we had to run the report card through a dozen algoritms, but as soon as we 'found' one that worked we called it a 'code'.	Business & Finance

What should I do? HELP! I'm trying to rent out a place but now I may not be able to. [SEP] best_answer: There are no guarantees with a temp job.  Lots of companies dangle the carrot of permanent employment to keep their temps in line.  They may or may not hire you permanently.\n\nFrom being a recruiter, I can tell you this.  If you work hard, don't miss work, get good reports from your supervisor, the temp service will find you another job when this one ends.  Just be careful of becoming a permanent temp, that does happen.\n\nWork for a few months, increase your skills, then, while still working, look for a permanent job if it is obvious that your temp assignment is not going to go permanent.\n\nGood luck & congrats on the raise!

[SEP] best_answer: That is crazy. I work in real estate and I can not tell you how frustrating it is to have to explain something about a LOAN to a LOAN officer. I know it's not your fault, but it would help you do your job better if you understood some of the basics about the lending industry. I think you should talk to your boss, and see if they will begin taking time to teach you things little by little. I think that your boss will be happy that you are interested in being better at your job. If that doesn't work, try to educate yourself by watching and listening as much as you can and reading about your companies various loan programs, etc.\nI think it's great that you care. Most people don't, and it's not fair to the clients or to the other businesses you work with.\nGood Luck!	Business & Finance

The borrower can access the equity, never make a payment as long as they live in the home, and maintain full title to the home.\n\nBefore Reverse Mortgages, one would have to sell a home to use the equity without payment - but then they had to buy another home.\n\nUpon the borrower's passing the loan must be settled.  heirs generally have 3 months to decide on a plan, but can get extensions depeding on circumstances.  Sale of the home or refinance are the most common ways to pay off the loan (just like a regualar mortgage) and the remaining equity goes to the estate or heirs etc.	Business & Finance

question_title: If you could go back in time, what period would you go to? Would you want to live there? Why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would go back to about 400,000 years ago in what is now Southern Iraq or to about 33,000 years ago in the same area.  That is because I am VERY curious about what was going on there...\n\nHowever, I would NOT want to stay there and would DREAD going back in time to ANY place on the earth.  Most all previous times in nearly all places were very, very dangerous compared to living now.\n\nThe time we are born into is the best one for us.  \n\nNo matter what time a person is born into, it is their duty to WORK in THE PRESENT MOMENT of their time in order to make a BETTER FUTURE.\n\nYou can find out a little bit more about this on my blog  http://360.yahoo.com/ki_te_moana	Business & Finance

question_title: I have been cheated on the internet. I was defrauded over the internet. Can someone help me? [SEP] question_content: Hello. My name is Sunny(Jasnain Singh). A person emailed me some days ago saying he works for an Art gallery in England. He wanted to cash his payments here in US $'s and keep 10% of it and send the rest through Western Union or Moneygram. The first payment I sent was not picked up, but the checks came out to be counterfeit. I have returned that money to the bank because my account was in -. But I've sent one more payment and it has been picked up and now the person wont contact me. If I dont get the money back, my account will be in - again, and its around -2000.00$'s and I will be doomed. How can I resolve this. Im afraid if I file a complaint on Internet Fraud website then they might call my house and ask me all sorts of questions. Please anyone help me. I am very worried. Thank you. [SEP] best_answer: Hate to say this - but you're screwed bro. There is not a damn thing you can do about it - you gave them the money, plain and simple. especially since it is across international borders...\n\nListen up people - if the "deal" sounds too good to be true,thats because IT IS! No one from Africa wants to split $10M with you if you send your bank acct info. No one wants you to cash their checks and keep 10%. Get real - dont be a fool. The reason that these con games work is because people are generally GREEDY - if you werent in such a hurry to make the free cash, you would have thought about it for a minute. You got what you deserved. You got fooled by a con man becuse you were gullible to believe that he really wanted you to cash checks. \n\nChalk it up to experience and DONT DO IT AGAIN.

question_title: How do you stuff a human being? [SEP] question_content: I've heard of stuffing turkeysss. But not chicken or horses or cows. Or anything else. Most importantly, I just wanna know how to stuff human beings. And I don't mean by them eating so much food. I mean how do you stuff them like a turkey. :) [SEP] best_answer: Simple. Firstly, take a scalpel and cut from the anus to the base of the neck....then remove the spine from the base of the neck to the tail bone.  After doing this you'll need to remove all the internal organs....Of course leaving the heart & liver is good for taste and keeps that "scary" factor in the meal.  Then, take two loaves of bread, a bag of croutons, two  bags of dried cranberries, some cut up parsley, celery and parsnip and through the cut in the back shove all these things in using a small gardening shovel.  You want to make sure you don't put the bread in all at once as putting it in little at a time is best.  After this, use cat gut to suture the cut and throw it in a kiln for about six hours.  Your human will come out soft at first, but let it cool for about 30 minutes and it'll be good to eat!!  It's best with human baby feet and marshmellows as a garnish.

question_title: Why does it say..? [SEP] question_content: Why does the song say ''Father Abraham had many sons, I am one of them, and so are you"?\n\nI thought only Jews and Arabs were decendants from him?? [SEP] best_answer: Actually, you are correct.  The muslims come from his wife Hagar and his first son whom he kicked out and God's angels protected.  Then the Jews came from his "main" son through Sara(h).  The reason I say "main" son is because this is the child through whom Christ would later be a descendant of and he is listed as an ancestor of Christ Jesus, that is why this child is the important one.\n\nChristians are indeed considered "the seed of Abraham."  However, not in the physical sense, but in the heavenly or spiritual sense.  We are inheritors of Abraham, to be "numbered among the stars" meaning that just like the stars our numbers are to seem great as his spiritual descendants.  So christians are Spiritual Israelites, not real Israelites.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: little Saigon, little Vietnam, Chinatown and so on, that area looks dirty like a third world country, the property values go down, crime goes up and no one other that group want to visit.\nmost of the Latino shopping centres I've been to look like dangerous barrios.\ni hardly ever see a place look nicer than before. it's no wonder people don't want their town to turn into a (little third world).\ngo ahead and call me a racist because that's what people do when they have no argument. [SEP] best_answer: Its interesting to note that in many dangerous neighborhoods, wherever a muslim mosque opens up (in a rented building or whatever) crime usually goes down and in general the place gets cleaner.  many can attest to this phenomenon.\n\nwhere i live, theres a road that has all these indo/pakistani shops. its where all the south asians live, and property values are actually one of the highest in our area, in part because a lot of indians are rich and so they all want to live near this area.\n\ni think places get dirty and stuff because a lot of the immigrants that come are uneducated, whereas A LOT are very educated and good, hard working people.  in the end, don't generalize, it has more to do with economic reasons than anything else.

question_title: Rephrasing my "curse words" question....? [SEP] question_content: Ok, I got a lot of good answers from many people, but it really didnt answer my question, so lemme rephrase:\nWho ever said that the "f" word was the mother load of all "curse words?"  Whose to say that 1000's of years ago the word "goodness" wasn't a curse word?  \n\nI guess what I'm asking is, are there really such things as curse words, or has man come up with these no-say words just to be stupid?  Is it something that we are just taught from our parents? or is there some actual logic behind it?\n\nIf anyone can give me something realistic on "cursinig" then I'd be apt not to use these words.  But, as of right now, I do not believe that there are actual curse words, and therefore, I use them.\n\n(I appologize for the many questions, but they all really boil down to the same one!) [SEP] best_answer: There are two ways "society" trys to control its own behaviour in order to prevent utter chaos; The first is by imposing a legal code, or a set of laws that "everyone" has agreed are things you should be punished for doing, like killing other people or stealing stuff.  The other set of rules is the more arbitrary one of a "moral code".  It is within this second set of unenforced (and generally unenforceable) rules that definitions of what is and isn't cursing develop.  Regardless of what anyone tries to tell you, morality is entirely a cultural construct.  There is nothing but opinion that makes one word bad and another acceptable.  You can say "fudge you!" or "f*ck you!" will equal vehemence and mean exactly the same thing, but one will get you kicked out of WalMart.\n\nIt does not really make any sense, but if you want to get ahead in this world, the easiest way to do it is to go along with the morality of whatever society you happen by birth to be a part of.  These "rules" and acceptable behaviours serve as a model of behaviour that is supposed to make everyone less "uncomfortable", so you are right, "curse" words is a completely made-up notion.\n\nOn the subject of what is acceptable to some societies but not to others, you might enjoy this one VERY strange example:\n\nhttp://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art38424.asp\n\nTry putting THAT in a nativity scene in the US!

Is there a high incidence of violence against LGBT people? any information would be great. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I live in Lubbock. I am a straight man who agrees with your idea's about the town. It is everything you would think Lubbock to be. Very religious. Very closed minded. There is so much religion in this town that if you were to just walk in the city limits and breath the air of righteousness in Lubbock, you would be saved. Forget getting dunked in holy water. This city is so conservative and religious that if you live here for a minimum of 3 weeks, you will automatically get a VIP pass to the pearly gates. St.Peter will let you go on up to the front of the line. He will look at you and say " (your name), you had to put up with hypocrisy, closed mindedness and bigotry in your tenure at Lubbock. go ahead. The master will see you in a moment" I do not know too many gays, but I bet it would be very difficult to be one in Lubbock. I would imagine that they develop a strong shell, if they survive Lubbock.

question_title: Question regarding who you date? [SEP] question_content: I have read on here that if you choose not to date someone outside of your race, then you are racist.

[SEP] best_answer: Good point. Some people would contradict themselves with this.  I personally think that being with someone outside of your race is wonderful. However, if someone chooses to be with someone of their own race, it is their personal choice, and does not make them racist right off. If they want someone the same race for morals and that they share similar beliefs, I would not consider them racist. But if they want someone the same race solely because of their color, etc, that is a bit racist.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why do blacks have english last names if their ancestors most probable came from Africa and not from England? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When slave owners "bought" African slaves, they "changed" their African names to "good" Christian names.  African slaves were not given an option to keeping their family names or naming traditions; in many instances they weren't able to decide their own children's names .  When the slaves were set free and able to chose their own names, they didn't know what their original African family name  was.  Many of them continued to use the slave owners name because that was what they were accustomed to.  Some African-Americans have rejected what they consider to be slave names and have adopted either Arabic or African names.	Society & Culture

question_title: Do you think I should take my g/f with me on Mother's day? [SEP] question_content: My step-mom does not like the fact that I am a bisexual woman, but I really like my partner. Her own mom lives too far away for her to visit. I want my family to get used to the fact that I want this relationship to work, but is this the wrong way to do this? I am 29 years old and do not live in the same house as my folks. [SEP] best_answer: I think I would find another time to introduce your partner to your step mom. It is mothers day, and not the right time to spring something like this on her. You did say that your step mom doesn't like the fact that you are a bisexual woman. You didn't say how the rest of your relationship with her goes. \n\n Make the day about your step mom, and set aside another day entirely where you can slowly start to integrate your partner into the relationship you have with your step mom. I am all about the two of them meeting, getting to know eachother....because this will help your step mom see that you are simply in love..and it doesn't matter with what sex. However, it would be very disrespectful to take her to your step moms on mothers day. And your step mom would be fully in her rights to be upset. Pick your battles and you'll have an easier time fighting them.	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: Funny! They let you type on the internet in prison? You probably stole the computer and are beating someone up as you type. \n\nI hope you can see my sarcasm as well. I am also an atheist. It is funny that people believe that morals and right and wrong come from a god. I guess Christians believe that people before Jesus came had no morals since they had no religion tell them what to do.\n\nThere's nothing more rewarding than being a happy, hard-working person who pays the rent (no mortgage or family yet!) and is kind to others and loves his friends or family, and does it all without having a god tell me what to do.

question_title: what is the oldest language in the world and why do we all not speak it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Linguists do not know. The oldest recorded WRITTEN language is Sumerian. Before that no languages were written (as far as we know) and therefore, by definition, left traces only in the spoken languages which they evolved into.\nIt is now pretty much agreed that Homo Sapiens evolved in Africa and spread from there. Anthropologically speaking, the 'oldest' races of humans are - quite possibly - the Khoi-San peoples of Southern Africa. Their languages have features that linguists speculate make them likely to be extremely old:\n1. They are extremely complex\n2. They have (phonetic) systems that are significantly more complex than any other languages. (Among these features are the wide varety of speech sounds - up to 147 as opposed to 44 of Standard English. These include many 'click' sounds.)\nThe Khoi-San peoples were displaced by later herdsmen migrations and invasions over the last thousands of years and survive in small pockets in Botswana and elsewhere).

question_title: what characterizes the western world? [SEP] question_content: what are the Europeans lifestyles,thoughts, values and interests [SEP] best_answer: I think the main thing that characterizes the western world in comparison to the eastern is the idea of the sanctity of the individual.  Possibly because of Christianity, or possibly for more esoteric reasons, individualism has been more important that collectivism throughout western history.  Freedom is more important that tradition and structure.  These are basic judeo-christian values which spring from a belief in free will and the responsibility of the individual to live up to a moral standard that started with the Ten Commandments.  Coupled with curiosity, imagination, ambition and even greed, it has created much of what we consider to be western culture.	Society & Culture

question_title: Atheist Support for Global Morality Vote? [SEP] question_content: For atheists:  The world continues to produce flawed societies (Nazi Germany, Rhwanda) where a majority rises with a distorted collective conscience of right and wrong--and atrocities occur.  To systematize a code of morality, would you support a global vote on right and wrong?  This concensus could educate those with damaged personal conscience, and reduce the capacity of powerful personalities to sway societies into violent value systems.  "Universal Truth" is off the table for the atheist--so shouldn't we have a worldwide vote to at least establish a global definition of right and wrong?  Majority rule is all there is, so wouldn't a global morality vote be the best? [SEP] best_answer: Why would this majority rule then be correct? As in, who gives you the right over someone else? You'll force them? That doesn't make sense. Beyond this, I'd love to see a transcultural model that actually works. It won't. Because guess what? Are you going to let everyone practice religion? Whatever one they want? Even if it goes against your code? If you don't, this won't work. Also, if you apply certain moral codes, and someone doesn't ascribe to them, so what? What are you gonna do? Punish them for bad morals? If you don't, then what was the purpose in the first place? If you do, then you have become an oppressive society. And before you become one of those you had better be sure you know what you're doing. Another point, because everyone believes it doesn't make it right. What if you wanted to amend it later on to say that killing is OK? Would it then be OK? If you have a universal standard of morality, then it can't change, otherwise what's the point? If it can't change, then majority rule is not the determining factor of universal moral guidelines. So what makes your first majority any more special than the ones to come? This is illogical, impractical and unfeasible at best.	Society & Culture

My logical guess would be that the train goes in different directions during different parts of the day. When the train is going one direction, they have to bring it back at one point.

Are you thinking yeh, this guy is great, but there might be the next best thing around the corner?  Are you looking for that someone that in a crowd everyone would be envious of you with him on your arm?\n\nSo many guys complain they cannot find love, when the possibilities are right next to them, because they see themselves with an ideal that exists only in magazines or in porn, so many guys sell themselves short.\n\nand it is not directed at just you , it is also on the other side someone might feel the potential with you , but still hold onto the idea of this perfect image.\n\nSo really know what you want in a person.

Even, "an angel of light":\n\n2CORINTHIANS 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.\n\nFor this reason, you can not judge an angel by his appearance. Only the Holy Spirit knows which angels are loyal to Him, and which are rebellious. Only those washed by the blood of Christ can be baptized with the Holy Spirt. Only those who believe in their heart, and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God come in the flesh as a man can be cleansed with the blood of Christ.\n\nAlso, no matter how many angels anyone has seen, we do not put our faith in them, as they did not die for us. We keep our faith in Christ:\n\nCOLOSSIANS 3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.\n\nDo not worship angels, for Christ is the only God:\n\nEXODUS 34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name [is] Jealous, [is] a jealous God:	Society & Culture

The need to spread something... \n\nPeople (or computer viruses!) that are put in quarantine are there because they could spread disease easily to other people they could come in contact with, changing (converting) other people's health state from healthy to sick.\n\nIn religious terms this is called proselytism. Here's wikipedia's definition: proselytism generally describes attempts to convert a person from one point of view to another, usually in a religious context.\n\nReligion therefore, and in the light of your two words, behaves like a virus.

question_title: Who are/were some of the most influentual gay people ? [SEP] question_content: and why do you think so ? [SEP] best_answer: birdman,\nI think that one of the most influencial Gay people in all the annals of history is . . . . King James (Prince James) who was responsible for the translation of the King James Bible. He was about as Gay as anyone could be. \n\nIt's not like there weren't any bibles before that, there were. The Great Bible was the main bible of the time, but the King James became more used sometime after that. \n\nBut look at it's influence upon so many people, for so many years. I have no doubt that King James was a saved man, though Gay, and could quote verses and argue effectively with the clergy of the day. He would look forward to the chances that he got to do so.\n\nStrangely enough, those that are most strict with their condemnation of Gays, use the King James Bible, while saying proudly that they use the "inerrant word of God" the King James 1611 version. \n\nAnd they don't.\n\nNo. The 1611 King James Bible had the Apocrypha in it. The Puritans decided that it should not be in there, and so it was taken out.\n\nSo the Fundies that condemn Gays are:\n1) Wrong about the Bible.\n2) Wrong about condemning Gays, rather than presenting the Gospel to them\n3) Are using a Bible that was funded lovingly by a Gay \nking.\n\nI call that VERY influential!

Just think about that. If you look at the way our genome is complexed together to make us work, you'll realize that it's nothing more than an accumulation of 'organized' proteins. These proteins are synthesized in accordance with a blueprint, which happens to correspond with each one's unique genetic code. Nothing more, nothing less.

question_title: Why are there more male atheists than female atheists? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: 1st off people who argue over wether men or women are smarter are stupid. there are many forms of intelligence and men and women(biologically) tend to think differently. therefore both genders bring differnt aspects of intelligence to the table.\n\n i am a male atheist and people who suggest that most people who are athiest are victims of "God couldnt have let this happened to me, therfore there is not a God." are very incorrect. I was raised christian and i became atheist because i simply consider religion too lacking in the facts department and therefore does not satasify my need to have proof before i belive in something. some people like to think that we have souls and that there is more to life then actually life. but i belive that this is our only life and we possess no soul. i came through the conclusions through solid logic and reasoning and am still trying to find the whole truth of the situation.\n\nas for why there are more men then women athiest(no one can really say since they are only one person and not the whole athiest community...) but i think it is because men are raised to be strong and independent(which leads to independent thinking) while females are raised to be friendly, kind, giving, and somewhat reliant on others(either emotionally or in some cases finacially). therefore, i think women tend to accept religion better then men because our society suggests that relying on someone or something such as religion for emotional support is more acceptable for women than it is for men, and to me emotional support seems to be the main reason for following a religion (even if it is just to lower the anxiety of death)	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: The bible, written by people who personally knew Jesus, teaches that the early years of Jesus were spent in Egypt. However, he was educated as a hebrew in judaism.  I understand what you are thinking and why.  There are many universal truths sensed by everyone in every faith.  So if truth is really truth, it will agree with the universal truths found in other religions.

She wants to put it on a CD or DVD; the music needs to be continuous between slides (i.e. 1st song starts w/ slide 1, song 2 starts at whatever slide song 1 ends at, etc.)\n\nWe also have the songs as MP3 files. Is there an easy way to link to them and put them in a folder to record on a CD, or to embed them? I see how we can link to an MP3 for a single slide, but not to one that will run over as many slides as it takes, and then to have the next song start right away. [SEP] best_answer: You might consider using windows movie maker.  If you save the slides as pictures you can import them into movie maker, add music and have your own slide show with music in the background (you can also do effects like fades between slides). You can them put the final video on DVD or cd.  Hope that helps, let me know if you have any more questions.	Computers & Internet

For laptops/notebooks with an external display port, you can hook up a second monitor to the port, and use both that and the notebook monitor (you will have to make a change to your graphic settings, depending on your installed video card).\n\nFor a desktop, install a second video card.  Open Display in the Control Panel, and click the monitor icon for the monitor you want to use in addition to the primary monitor.  Select Extend My Windows Desktop onto this Monitor checkbox, then Apply, then Ok.  If you don't see that checkbox, your card may not support multiple monitors.  Make sure you have hardware that supports multiple monitors before you purchase any equipment.

question_title: Shell Script to check if another instance of Java App is running? [SEP] question_content: I want to know how from Unix Shell Script I can check if another instance of a java program is running. [SEP] best_answer: Historically, the "ps" command read the argv[] array from\neach process to determine its invocation arguments.\nHowever, each process could alter these argument strings\nand thus "lie" to administrators and other users as to which\nprocess was running (as well as which arguments were being\nused).\n\nTo counter this, SysV kernels copy (the first 80 bytes of)\nthe command invocation into a save area in the process\ntable, and *that* is what "ps" uses.   This is why you're\nonly seeing the first 80 characters of the command.  On the\nbright side, you know the data is accurate; on the down\nside, you only see 80 bytes worth.\n\nTo solve your problem with the long command, you can step\nback and use the old mechanism.  You could fall prey to\nsomeone "spoofing" the command line; however, for normal\nprocesses, you'll be able to see the entire invocation.\n\nOn Solaris, the old version of "ps" is in /usr/ucb/ps and\nyou should invoke it with the "-auwwx" option.  The "w"\noption means "wide".  A single "-w" goes to 132 characters,\nbut if you specify *two* "w"'s, then it will print as many\ncharacters as it finds in the argv[] array.  Thus use:\n\n/usr/ucb/ps -auwwx | grep MyJavaProg\n\nIf you're using a different Unix, the path might be\ndifferent, but you might look for either alternate\nversions of "ps" or special options which extract\nthe information from the process rather than the\nkernel.\n\nAn alternative to get the same information is to use the\n/proc utilities.  For example, on newer releases of\nSolaris, the command:\n\n/usr/bin/pargs <some_process_id>\n\nwill print the command line arguments **taken from the\nprocess itself** (not the kernel).  So you could scan all\nprocesses via:\n\ncd /proc\nfor i in * ; do\n/usr/bin/pargs $i\ndone\n\nNote, however, that you will NOT be able to inspect\nother user's processes this way unless you have\nsufficient privilege (ie. execute as "root").  Presumably\nother UNIXes (and Linux) provide similar /proc utilities,\nso the syntax might vary, but the concept should be\nthe same.	Computers & Internet

question_title: VB.NET code to store the primary key in a datagrid when edit button is pressed? [SEP] question_content: I have a data grid on a web application.  My grid fills up fine and I have a delete  button that is part of the gird.  When it is pressed it deletes the select row and everything is fine.  But once I add a second button to the data grid I get an error.  When I try to click either button.  So the delete button now wont work. I use   PID = Integer.Parse(e.Item.Cells(1).Text) to store the primary key field.  This works fine with the delete button alone but I want to use the same code line in the editcommand so i can store the Primary Key for later use but when I have 2 buttons attached to my form it give me an error on that line.  I just need to store the primary key in that row.  Like I said I works great with only one button on the data gird but when there are two buttons it will not work.  What can I do? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not exactly clear on what you're trying to do with the second button, but if you're binding the datagrid from a query, you should be able to set the DataKeyField property of the datagrid to the primary key of your query.  It will then automatically be stored for each row when the datagrid is bound.\n\nYou can then retrieve it by using a line like:\n\n            Dim PID As Integer = Val(source.datakeys(e.Item.ItemIndex))\n\nIf this doesn't help, contact me with the exact error message you're receiving and with more info about what you are using the second button for, and I'll try to help.\n\n- Rich\nhttp://www.IMAgolfer.com	Computers & Internet

Ethnography is a holistic research method founded in the idea that a system's properties cannot necessarily be accurately understood independently of each other.

question_title: Can this Wireless Access Point REALLY have a range of 34 miles? [SEP] question_content: I was looking through cdwg.com and I found this WAP that says its range is 34 miles. It is a Proxim Tsunami MP.11a Subscriber Unit, and it only costs a little over 500 dollars. Can anyone explain this? \n\nHere's the link to the product:\nhttp://www.cdwg.com/shop/products/default.aspx?EDC=517742 [SEP] best_answer: I think this is possible as I've had once installed aironet series antenna it gave me a range of about 15 miles and more the distance less the bandwidth. I'm not sure if it is possible to get the whole 54Mbps at that range maybe you'll get about 2Mbps at max if we are very generous. Moreover it's not the device but the antenna used with the device that gives the range.

Or if I pay for one, which one would be worth the $$?? [SEP] best_answer: The Best One by far is Mcaffee hands down. Norton places a heavy "footprint" on your computer everything slows down once it's installed. If you want a headache get Norton. As for Mcaffee? Don't go out and buy it from the store because it also puts too many files on your puter. Go online to their website and download the "Web Version" It's pretty cheap I think 14 bucks a year and best of all it will check for updates on it's own everytime you access the internet. It's quiet, runs in the background and is always up to date. I've tried bunches of AV, and I think this is the best!	Computers & Internet

question_title: Do you think that the US goverment looking at your search results is legal? Or is this a invasion of privacy? [SEP] question_content: I think that the goverment is wrong to look at your searches without telling you first. What do you think? [SEP] best_answer: As harmless as it may seem, & they always claim good intent. It is WRONG. It is wrong because it is just one more way for them to get their foot in the door to our freedoms & right to privacy. As the years pass... It has become obvious that slowly but surely they take a little more & more, claiming good intentions. Won't be long when we will not be able to go out after 10pm, because someone will claim that 90% of all crime takes place after a designated time. Or maybe we should all wear helmits in our cars, because it saves lives. They say it is the interests of public safety, then they make us wear seat-belts which is not public safety, but personal safety. If they keep it up, we will loose all rights to choose anything, because it is ALL bad, & they are always right. Wish they could look at themselves in the mirror to make improvements, opposed to always pointing their finger at the public at large.	Computers & Internet

[SEP] best_answer: A Turing Test (called after its inventor, Alan Turing), does not test a machine's intelligence, but it does test a machine's capability to conduct conversation in a way that cannot be distingushed from a converation with a real human. The test is conducted in the following way: A human judge is presented with a chat screen, in which he talks with two other chatters - one is a human, and the other s a computer. If the judge cannot state reliably who of the chatters is a computer and who is a human, then the computer passes the test. \n\nIt is arguable whether a computer that passes a Turing test is really "intelligent", or is able to "think", for several reasons.\n\nFor more details, see the wikipedia article on Turing Test:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test	Computers & Internet

question_title: what to do for severe backache? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on whether it's muscular or disc related.\n\nFor muscular: sleep flat on your back on a firm surface with your legs bent. Do excercises to strengthen your abdominals. Weak abs are a primary culprit in back strain. Use proper body mechanics. Not too much lifting, and when you do, bend your knees and keep the load close to you. Remember, prevention is easier than cure.\n\nDisc: See a chiropractor, they'll feel it out. Then, see an orthopedic surgeon. Get their advice before doing careful stretching, inversion therapy, and yoga, if you can handle it. Here again, prevention is easier than cure. Try yoga, and eat lots of fiber.	Health

question_title: Can Vitamins make me fat if I'm not dieting and exercizing when taking them? [SEP] question_content: I recently bought some vitamins to take when I started running again but I have not yet started to run. this is my first time buying vitamins and supplements and I was wondering If I can take them even if I haven't yet started to exercize on a daily basis but I'm afraid that I'll put in weight because the bottle says its a dietary supplement. I know nothing about vitamins and I would aprecciate some HELP thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I love how people will make fun of other people when it's most likely the first girl who's insecure about having a fat face. You look like a model in your picture. Not fat at all.Anway, I don't know what you are thinking the term "dietary supplement" to mean as I have heard this question before! The term "dietary supplement" means a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more dietary ingredients (vitamins, herbs). A dietary supplement is limited to products that are intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, and liquid form, that are not represented as conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or of the diet, and that are labeled as dietary supplements. Additionally, dietary supplements do not include products that are approved drugs, certified antibiotics, or licensed biologics. Vitamins are intended to help your body function in its optimal state. You should be taking them whether or not you are excersing. They will help in so many ways depending on what you are taking. A good multivitamin for a girl is a hair, skin, and nails formula. You will get alot of vitamins plus ones to help your hair, skin, and nails look their best (very strong, clear, etc). If you take too much hyaluronic acid (you probably aren't taking any however) you can look a little puffy. But that's only if you're taking way more than it says since this product works with water. Don't worry about gaining weight or looking puffy though with normal everyday vitamins. If you have anything out of the ordinary with your health, consult your doctor first. If you are healthy you can probably just take them and not worry about anything. Don't take too much zinc though, I've seen a lot of nausea reported cases.	Health

These things only get worse over time.Good luck, hope it all works out for You and your Son.	Health

But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.\n\nSo how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it. So it will take time to lose weight. So you have to start losing weight systematically. You can lose weight by developing the good eating habits in you and nutritious foods.	Health

question_title: how should i quit chewing tobacco? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Quitting “Cold turkey”- People can and do quit chewing on their own. The health professional can be very helpful by encouraging quitting and giving support whenever possible.

Three weeks later he was wearing hiking boots on a Boy Scout trek and back packing up the side of a mountain. The skin under where the toenails used to be is tender right now because it's used to being protected by the toenail, and suddenly the toenail's not there. It will take a few days for the skin to toughen up a little. It will get better rather quickly. I know it won't seem quick to you, but it will be over soon.	Health

Look at the salt content of tinned foods, snacks, potato chips, French fries, diet soft drinks, sauces, etc. These are high in salt, don't eat them.

question_title: I want to know more on impotence due to diabetis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In men\n\n      Long-term diabetes can cause damage to the nervous system, which is involved in the complex process of erection.\n\n      This means men with diabetes may suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED) and be unable to get or maintain an erection. As many as a third of men with diabetes experience ED.\n\n      \n      Term watch\n      Erectile dysfunction is another name for impotence.\n      Some men only discover they have diabetes when they seek treatment for their erectile dysfunction.\n\n      Once diabetes has been regulated through diet, pills or insulin injections, sexual problems usually disappear and the ability to get an erection is restored.\n\n      In women\n\n      A number of women with diabetes may suffer from recurring vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina), which is usually due to yeast infection. This makes sex painful. You may suffer itching or burning sensations.\n\n      Women with diabetes may also get recurring cystitis.\n\n      There is also some suggestion that women with diabetes have problems with arousal, and just as the penis fails to become erect in the man, the clitoris in a woman may not respond to stimulation in the normal way.\n\nCan you make your sex life work when you have diabetes?\n\nIf you feel diabetes is causing problems with your sex life, talk to your doctor.\n\nWhile no-one relishes talking about sexual problems with a doctor, these issues can only be addressed if you seek help.\n\nYour doctor will try to find out whether sexual problems are caused by defects in the nervous or circulatory system as a result of the diabetes, or whether they are of a more psychological nature. Often this distinction is difficult to make.\n\nIn any case, when sexual dysfunction begins to happen on a regular basis it tends to get worse unless it is properly treated, so the psychological element inevitably builds up.\n\nAn increasing number of men who have diabetes and ED are being helped by medicines such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).\n\nIf tests confirm that your nervous system hasn't been damaged by diabetes, and there are no associated circulatory problems, there's no reason why your sex life shouldn't recover.\n\nSometimes a little help and support from your partner and doctor is all that's needed.\n\nWhat can be done about sexual problems that are not caused by diabetes?\n\nThis is a sensitive issue, but help is available.\n\nGenerally the most useful first port of call is your family doctor, who can refer you (and your partner) to a psychosexual therapist - or marriage guidance counsellor if this is more appropriate.\n\nTry not to dwell on the fact diabetes can cause sexual problems - just because it can, doesn't mean it will.\n\nAnd if you do experience difficulties, be reassured that nowadays there is a lot of help available.

question_title: Why should I drink a lot of water before blood drawn? [SEP] question_content: I need this information to be added into my chemo diary, and published soon.  Anyone that answer the question are highly appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: As far as a blood test determining triglyceride levels is concerned, for 12 to 14 hours before the test, only water is permitted.\n\nOvernight fasting is essential for an accurate measurement of blood triglycerides!\n\nIn addition, alcohol should not be consumed for the 24 hours just before the test.\n\nYou are also not supposed to take any vitamin supplements 24 hours prior to your fasting blood work. If you are currently on antihistamines, antibiotics or cortisone treatment only, you need to call the lab or your doctor for more information on how to proceed.\n\nAnything taken in, other than water, during that time can elevate the blood triglycerides as they change dramatically in response to meals. Without the proper fasting, they can easily be high enough to prompt your doctor to prescribe drugs.\n\nHowever, even fasting levels may vary considerably day to day. Therefore modest changes in fasting triglycerides measured on different days are not considered to be abnormal.\n\n(Note:  Researchers from Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Missouri have found that high triglycerides block leptin - a hormone secreted by our fat cells - from getting into the brain by impairing its transportation system (Diabetes, 2004: May).\n\nAs a result, leptin cannot do its work in turning off feeding and burning calories.\n\nIn other words, high triglycerides make the brain "think" the body is starving so we keep eating and... gaining weight. This is probably one of the reasons why so many people are becoming obese.\n\nBy lowering triglycerides then, we could help the body's own leptin to work better so we could get skinnier avoiding heart problems, cancer and diabetes - common chronic diseases linked to obesity.)

And that is who I called and that is who got me to where I needed to be and to where I am today with 2.5 years clean.  to me not a long time, but as long as I make it through today, than that is good enough.

[SEP] best_answer: While prior H5N1 strains have been known, they were significantly different from the current H5N1 strain on a genetic level, making the global spread of this new strain unprecedented. The current H5N1 strain is a fast-mutating, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) found in multiple bird species.\n\nCountries that have reported one or more major H5N1 outbreaks in birds (causing at least thousands but in some cases millions of dead birds) are (in order of first outbreak occurrence): Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Turkey, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, Cyprus, Iraq, Nigeria, Egypt, India, France, Niger, Bosnia, Azerbaijan, Albania, Cameroon, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Israel, Pakistan, Jordan, Burkina Faso, Germany, Sudan. H5N1 has been found in birds in the wild in numerous other countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Kuwait, Poland, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. Countries with massive bird die offs that do not confirm H5N1 include: Ethiopia.\n\nBird flu is any flu caused by a virus adapted to birds.\n\nIt is also called avian flu, avian influenza and bird influenza.\n\nThe only known such viruses are Influenza A viruses. All subtypes (but not all strains of all subtypes) of this species are adapted to birds, so for many purposes avian flu virus is Influenza A virus (the "A" does not stand for "avian").\n\nHowever most people use "avian flu" to mean H5N1 which is the subtype of the species Influenza A virus that is the world's major flu pandemic threat.\n\nSo "avian flu", "bird flu", "avian influenza", and "bird influenza" all mean the same thing; but are all used to mean these very different things:\n\n    * flu:\n          o flu from Influenza A viruses which are adapted to birds (the technically correct meaning)\n          o the flu acquired from any Influenza A viruses\n          o the H5N1 flu (flu acquired from H5N1)\n    * virus:\n          o Influenza A viruses which are adapted to birds\n          o the Influenza A viruses\n          o the H5N1 subtype of the Influenza A virus.

question_title: Running or Cycling? URGENT? [SEP] question_content: Which one is better and burn more calories? I'm 5'1" and 106lbs, and I need to lose 10lbs more. [SEP] best_answer: Running burns more calories. If you can combine running for 10 mins consistently then do 50 lunges, run for 10 miuntes do 50 squat jumps, run for 10 mins do 50 push ups, run for 10 minutes up/down a flight of stairs, find a hill then do 10 sprints up and down, then 10 mins consistently. \n\nVariation is also the best thing to do. It means you are placing less strain on the same muscle groups and stimulating other muscles. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.	Health

question_title: Can you comment on the long-term efficacy of Arimidex as a treatment for the reduction of estrogen in males? [SEP] question_content: I am a 45 year old male with high estradiol levels (Estrogen E2), which interferes with my body's ability to make use of my available testosterone. This condition requires medical treatment. I followed the advice of Life Extension Foundation's article "Male Hormone Modulation Therapy", and  took a 7 week trial to reduce my estrogen naturally using Chrysin and DIM, combined with absorption enhancers Zinc, Vitamin E, and peperine. Unfortunately my estradiol is still a bit high.  The article states that when natural therapies fail, the only alternative is to receive a treatment of Arimidex (Anastrazole) in a very small dose.  I recently went to an endocrinologist seeking this therapy.  She stated that Arimidex is not a recommended therapy for males with high estradiol because it is effective for only a very short time.  Not trusting her opinion, I reviewed many studies on Arimidex that indicate it is very commonly used for long term treatment.  Can you explain this contradiction?

I have a LOT of fears and suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks, for which I'm on medication and under the care of a psychiatrist.\n\nOne of my main fears seems to be a fear of the dark. I haven't always been scared of the dark, this has only been over the past year or two and seems to be getting worse. I get really panicky when it's dark - I have to have a baby's night light in my room at night or I have a panic attack as soon as I put the light off. But there are other situations which can be embarrassing - the other night I was watching TV with my flatmate and he put the light off......I managed to cope OK until he switched off the TV and we were plunged into darkness, then I got really panicky and it was embarrassing to say the least.\n\nHow can I get over this? I feel like such a baby! [SEP] best_answer: well firstly and most importantly stop feeling embarassed... i am 27 and afraid of the dark since i was a little girl... so? what? since it's not something that you have since childhood probably your generalised anxiety triggered it as well as other fears and phobias too. so feeling embarassed just makes you feel more anxious and therefore intesifies your fear of dark. leave a small light on in your room (like a baby's night light) and try one step at the time. For example try not to lock your door once or twice a week. Admit to your flatmates you are afraid of dark. When you ll do that you will find out they are afraid of other things too or maybe that they even share the fear of darkness. This will allow you to be less anxious and them being more considerate. Over the years I have realised that you have to manage your fears like climbing. Rule number one: admit the mountian is high! Rule number 2: never look at the top. Always focus on the little step you take. You ll reach the top before you know it...	Health

question_title: What can you say: Biopsy will only spread the bad cell.In this case for breast.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I have worked in mammography for over 15 years.  If you have a suspicious area in your breast, you must have a biopsy.  It can mean such a difference in your life, and your quality of life.  Biopsies will not spread breast cancer.  Read below, and check out the sources.\n\n"With some types of tumors, such as tumors of the ovary or pancreas, it is possible for a needle to carry a malignant cell to another area.  But this is not a concern in breast cancer. Breast cancer cells do not seem to be able to live independently unless they are biochemically ready to do so. This means that a core biopsy - or any other type of\nbiopsy procedure - will not spread the cancer to other areas."\n\nhttp://www.susanlovemd.org/faq/biopsy/biopsy_3.html\n\nBiopsies and/or air cannot cause breast cancer to spread. The fear of biopsies comes from the concern that sticking a needle into a breast tumor to get a sample, or using a scalpel to remove the whole tumor, can then move some of those cells to a different place in the breast (by the cells sticking to the needle or by the cells dropping from the tumor into other places). Studies have not found this to be true for breast cancer biopsies. Some people believe that exposing the cancer to air during surgery or biopsy can cause the cancer to spread -- this too, is not true.\n\nhttp://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/types/article.cfm?c=3&s=5&ss=38&id=9530	Health

I'm looking for something that can control i.e a birth control pill that isn't strong. [SEP] best_answer: There are tablets which you can take which aren't hormone based but which help to decrease the flow and the pain.\n\nMefenamic Acid is an anti-prostaglandin (prostaglandins cause the pain during your period) and you take it for a few days before your period is due and for the first couple of days of your period. It help reduce the pain, and also over time reduces the amount of blood loss.\n\nTranexamic acid is an anti-fibrinolytic and is used to reduce blood flow. \n\nBoth tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid can be used together to reduce blood flow during a period. However, the best thing really is to go onto the birth control pill - it dramatically reduces bleeding and pain.\n\nAlso, since your periods are irregular, it may be worth speaking to your doctor about having blood tests done, or possibly an ultrasound to see whether you may have something like PCOS.

[SEP] best_answer: There are many Protein supplements which are OK for vegetarians it's a bit of trial and error. I was Veggie for five years and had a heavy training programme for Martial Arts tournaments. I'm sure you're aware you need to take a GOOD multi-vitamin supplement. If you ask at any good Health shop they'll give the advice you need. \nYou'll only bulk up if you train for it, plus your body will only absorb the amount of protein it needs, the rest will pass through the body naturally.

For me, I cannot get my mind to "quiet" enough to meditate, unless I take some of my tranquilizers (I have OCD and GAD along with depression). This is not the "best" solution, but as I'm sure you've experienced, sometimes these negative thoughts and the stress from them are debilitating. \nWhat helps me most (medication aside) is doing something else.

If anyone knows any reason why please let me know. [SEP] best_answer: It can be ovulation... sometimes people get pain when they ovulate.  \n\nIt could be a cyst around your ovary.  if it is, it would be extremely painful if you ovulated and there is a cyst there.  The cyst could have also burst, and that would be VERY painful. \n\nIt could also be your appendix. Women can get mixed up because your appendix is on the right side as well.  You could have appendixitis (when your appendix gets enlarged). \n\n\nIn any case you should see your doctor bc you may need an ultrasound of the area to check for a cyst or your appendix.	Health
question_title: Do you go to dentist or oral surgeon to remove your wisdom teeth? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend has to go remove her wisdom teeth, she already made appt with the dentist but some of her friends told her that she should go to oral surgeon to get the wisdom teeth removed. They said oral surgeon is specialized on wisdom teeth and because there is nerve on the lower jaw, if the dentist don't do it right she might loose feeling on her cheek and tongue permanently... Now she is very scared. Can any one give me some professional advice? Also how many people had went to dentist and how many people went to oral surgeon to get this done, any problem afterward? Thank you so much in advance! [SEP] best_answer: I am a dentist.\n\nAn oral surgeon (properly known as an "oral and maxillofacial surgeon") undergoes 4 to 6 years of training beyond dental school.  Those who spend 6 years typically spend 2 of those 6 years earning an "M.D." degree, and thus hold the titles of "D.D.S., M.D." or "D.M.D., M.D."\n\nOf those 4 to 6 years, oral surgeons get a great deal of experience performing surgery both inside and outside of the mouth.  Third molar (i.e. wisdom tooth) extractions are but a small component of an oral surgeon's training.  Additionally, oral surgeons spend a minimum of 4 months learning anesthesia, and thus are permitted to perform sedations.  General dentists can train to perform sedations, however, most do not.\n\nExtraction of third molars does not require an oral surgery residency, but it does require proper training.  As a general dentist, I extract the vast majority of third molars because I have proper training and experience doing them.  I only refer patients to oral surgeons when they specifically request sedation, or if the case is "high risk" for a nerve injury.  I do this for liability reasons, not because I think the oral surgeon is much less likely to cause a nerve injury.

question_title: triangle gaps between my bottom 4teeth due to gum recession. any good solution? [SEP] question_content: I got a triangle gap between my bottoms 4teeth due to gum recession. I do still have the contact at the upper part of the bottom teeth, but those triangle gaps are bothering me very much. What is the best solution? [SEP] best_answer: You have to go to a periodontist.  Depending on your insurance, you might need a referral from your primary dentist.  He'll take measurements, do a perio scale (deep cleaning), then do more measurements to see if the problem is fixed.  You'll work with him to see where you go from there.  Do it soon, the longer you wait, the worse it'll be.	Health

question_title: Do you think the at 35 circumsision  is good for you to do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are doing it for a religous purpose, and you know all the reasons behind it, then the reason is up to you. There have been studies showing no medical benefit to having it done. if anything, its better to be done to adults rather than children. When they "briss" a child, they do it WITHOUT anestitics(they feel every moment of pain, and its VERY traumatic). It can cause so much pain to the child that neurologists are studying right now if there might be a small amount of brain damage because of it. Be aware, it is painfull even with pain meds, and you are PERMANENTLY removing an average of 22 square inches of the most sexualy sensitive skin on your body. again, if your doing this as part of your religion, its completely up to you. if you want some kind of "other" benefit from it, i would very much advise against it. My parents did it to me when i was a child, and i regret their decision (since it was entirely religously based, and i grew up to join a completely differing faith that believes against it)	Health

question_title: Where can I purchase a yoga dvd specifically designed for people with MS? [SEP] question_content: Looking for dvd yoga providers in UK [SEP] best_answer: On Amazon.com there's a DVD available called "Yoga for MS,"\nstarring Shoosh Lettick Crotzer. It's $29.50.\n\nAlso, here's an article on yogajournal.com that may be of some help:\n\nYoga for Multiple Sclerosis\n\nI have multiple sclerosis and have been practicing Iyengar yoga for a few months. It's been very beneficial. Is there anything I can focus on to bring more progress? \n\nBy Baxter Bell\n\n— Jessica Howland, Kihei, Hawaii \n\nBaxter Bell's reply:\n Jessica, your entry into hatha yoga with the Iyengar method was a fortuitous choice. The ability to adapt the poses with props can be particularly beneficial with multiple sclerosis (MS), since flare-ups can affect strength, balance, and coordination. \nIt’s also important for you to know about a very unique Iyengar teacher, Eric Small (located in the Los Angeles area), whose personal story of developing MS in his late teens and reclaiming his health through his study with Mr. Iyengar is almost legendary. His experience eventually led him to work with the National MS Society to create a yoga teacher-training program for teachers who want to work with students with MS. I was fortunate enough to participate in this course in 2001 with Eric as the lead instructor. \n\nStudying with an MS-trained instructor can improve your chances of moving through the practice at an appropriate pace for whatever stage of the MS cycle you may find yourself in. In addition, you will learn specific sequences designed for challenges such as fatigue, constipation, problems with digestion, lack of mental clarity, or balance. Balance, for example, can be addressed with asanas such as Tadasana (Mountain Pose), Virabhadrasana I (Warrior Pose I) and Virabhadrasana II (Warrior Pose II), and Trikonasana (Triangle Pose). \n\nFor a student with MS, there are three types of symptoms that hatha yoga directly addresses: fatigue and heat intolerance, numbness in the limbs and loss of coordination, and loss of flexibility and balance. Fatigue and heat intolerance appear to be the most limiting factors to MS students. To counter these limitations, students learn to master the breath and practice restorative postures. Both techniques cool the body and calm the nervous system. The simple breathing technique of lengthening the exhalation a little longer than the inhalation helps quiet the nervous system. It’s been observed that heat, stress, and tension can cause temporary worsening of MS symptoms, so keep the pace of practice relaxed but focused—keeping the body just shy of sweating is important. \n\nMS can also result in a daily battle with numbness of the arms and legs, muscle spasms, and loss of coordination. The system of yoga emphasizes stretching and breathing, which can release tension and improve circulation and body awareness. Yoga practice can also facilitate harmony between the muscular and nervous systems of the body, possibly resulting in more fluid movement and relief from muscle tension. As a student’s level of body awareness improves, she can begin to recognize the first signs of stress on her system before it overwhelms her. \n\nFinally, in addition to evolving body awareness, yoga increases flexibility and balance. The poses increase the range of motion in the joints and improve muscle tone, and work of most of the body’s muscle groups. \n\nYour yoga practice can be tailored according to your needs. If you are in a period of remission and your balance is intact, you can often do most of poses practiced in an ordinary class setting. During periods of relapse, stay in the groove of practicing by doing a modified practice, for example lying supine on the floor or utilizing chairs and the wall. \n\nThe effect of hatha yoga on MS is of such great interest that the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine division has funded a study of the effects of yoga on MS patients.

But, in relationship to cigerettes and other nicotine based products, marijuana will much less likely cause one because the THC can dialate your bronchial tubes, relax the smooth muscle surrounding your throat, and open your aveoli, which are the air sacks in your lungs.\n      Is marijuana going to be the best thing for your asthma?\nNo, but it is better than the use of ciggerettes. be carefull and when ever you are going to smoke you should have your fast acting inhaler with you (albuteral, ect) incase of a problem and, with a medical condition like this, smoking with a friend would be advised	Health
question_title: Invisalign or traditional braces? [SEP] question_content: Which is better and why? [SEP] best_answer: I have invisalign and they are correcting some pretty severe problems that I have had.  The most important thing is not which one you have, but which orthodontist you go to.  You see, most of the work done by invisalign is done by a computer and then approved/disapproved by the doctor.  Some dentists DDS. (not orthodontists) get certified to do invisalign because the company does all the work for them.  They just collect the money.  So, if there were a problem, the only person that could answer up would be someone who isn't an experienced orthodontist.  SO make sure you get a QUALIFIED orthodontist to do the work.  They will know what is possible and what isn't.  By the way, invisalign is only about 1K more than traditional.	Health

question_title: What are the drawbacks to getting Invisalign? [SEP] question_content: I'm considering Invisalign.  I've also looked into traditional braces (I had them about 20 years ago and don't want a metal mouth again).  Does anyone have any endorsements or cautions about Invisalign? [SEP] best_answer: I really don't know of any drawbacks to invisalign.  They are clear mouth trays that you wear all of the time, except when you are eating.  They are very hard to detect, you can hardly see them.  They seem to be a little more expensive then the traditional braces.  At our office they run about five thousand dollars, in which some insurances will cover about half of that.  The only drawback that I can think of would be lack of patient compliance.  IF you don't wear them the prescribed amount of time, then the dentist/orthodontist can't guarantee that your teeth will move the way they are suppose to.  With traditional brackets and bands they are cemented on to your teeth, thus you have to wear them.  Invsisalign is trays you can take in and out, so if you are not wearing them then you are going to waste your money.  I understand they take a little getting use to when you are talking, but this goes away in no time.  I don't know if anyone noticed, but a few years ago tom cruise wore them.  Good luck.	Health

Walking 4 times a day for 10 minutes each time will give you more benefit (higher metabolism) than one long walk.  It's a matter of changing your habits.  No soda, no fast foods.  Look up "exchange diet", or "sugar busters" they are both excellent moderate diets.  Godloveya.	Health

They are usually factorable (which means you can find it's simplified roots). These roots should look like (x-F) and (x-G) where F and G are numbers so that when multiplied together using FOIL (First Outside Inside Last), you get your original polynomial. The roots are also where the polynomial = 0, assuming you've set it to zero. If the polynomials do not factor nicely, then you have to use this formula:\n\n-b +/- root(b^2-4ac)\n--------------------\n      2a\n\n\nWhich will give you the roots. Sometimes you get imaginary roots where in the equation above you will be taking the root of a negative number.\n\nHope that helps.	Education & Reference

It can overrule prejudice and win every battle.\nI would say that lying is the worst thing you can do to your family and friends because of the pain that you can cause and because you can lose someone's trust when it's the most precious thing in a relationship.\nThen, I would say that I love them and that I'm very happy to be still alive to be able to tell them later all the great adventures I lived.

question_title: how were bic products introduced to consumers? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I remember about 1963, when I was working in an office supply, first seeing the Bic pen.

The US name was changed to Bic so that wouldn't be pronounced to rhyme with itch. His name is pronounced bick. It took a massive advertising campaign to start making it popular in the early '60's, the time I started seeing it.	Education & Reference

[SEP] best_answer: There are two ways of saying this : your teachers request, and "john's behaviour".\nIn India, where I live, people often use this horrible way of sayng these things because its more 'proper'. If you want to talk in normal English, everyday American English, use "johns behaviour". Many times people 'forget' that we have apostrophe S, and create a funny type of Enlish by putting 'of'. In french though you have to say "comportement de Jean" which means "behaviour of john". Its best to follow your teacher's way when you are in front of her or are writing something that she will read, but other iwse, use john's behaviour. Or just tell her that you feel more comfortable with normal Apostrophe S.	Education & Reference

question_title: What are some great poetry lessons for fifth grade? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When I taught fifth grade, one of my favorite activities to kick off a poetry unit (or just use as a lesson in the unit) was called a "Find a Poem" workshop.  I checked out many poetry books from the library and gathered those from my personal collection.  Then I had each student pick a partner.  The pairs worked to find poems with certain characteristics, which I had outlined on a worksheet.  The page said:\n\nFIND A POEM \n\n1. Find a poem that makes you happy.\n\n2. Find a poem that makes you sad.\n\n3.  Find a poem in which rhyme is an essential element.\n\n4.  Find a poem in which rhythm is an essential element.\n\n5.  Find a poem that makes you say, "hmmmmmm."\n\n\nThe pairs were to look through the books, finding each one from a different source (it is fun to watch the books fly around as they are swapped, traded, and explored).  They recorded the title of the book, the name of the poem, and the page number under each.  When the class was finished, we would go around the room sharing a selected favorite of each pair.\n\nThe activity is fun and gets them excited about exploring poems.  They also have to identify the difference between rhyme and rhythm in poetry.  The class gets to laugh over funny poems (which are usually the top choices when they are ready to share) and, as a teacher, it is always interesting to see what they choose for the last poem.\n\nI hope this helps as you start your plans - it's a fun activity!\n\np.s. Something else fun to have the children work toward during your poetry unit would be a "Poetry Cafe."  Have each student memorize one or two favorite poems and share them in a poetry cafe event.  You could invite parents, have them bring treats, and set up the room with tables, a black backdrop and spotlight for the students, and a stool for them to sit on while sharing their poems.  Oh yes, and the audience would not clap...they would snap, of course!  :o)	Education & Reference

question_title: China and Taiwan's relationship? [SEP] question_content: needs to be 150 words exactly [SEP] best_answer: From the beginning of the twentieth century, Taiwan has been separate from China.  First, as Formosa, it was a colony of Japan.  After WWII, Taiwan was liberated from the Japanese, and four years later China's nationalist government was defeated by the Communists.  They fled to Taiwan and established their government-in-exile in Taipei.  Still today, Taiwan's official name is The Republic of China.  Taiwan's government favors eventual reunification with China, on the condition that China is a democratic nation.\n\nTaiwan views itself as independent from Beijing's sovereignty, and most countries support this reality.  Taiwan is not recognized as a sovereign nation in the UN because of China's "One-China Policy", which states that any nation wanting trade and political relations with China cannot openly support Taiwanese independence.  China views Taiwan as a "renegade province."	Education & Reference

question_title: what effect does global warming have on the earth? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Global warming is an effect in the earth's lower atmosphere that is claimed to exist by many scientists today.  Essentially, the theory claims that carbon monoxide, fluorocarbons and other gases have damaged the ozone layer, the protective layer in the earth's upper atmosphere that protects the planet from the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  Some man-made causes of these gases are automobile emissions and bovine flattulance.  The supposed increased levels of UV radition are striking the earth in greater incidence, especially in the equatorial oceans. Hence, according to the theory, the warming oceans are changing weather patterns and melting the polar ice caps.   More severe storms and raising of the ocean levels are possible.  Detractors of the theory contend, however, that evidence for diminishment of the ozone layer, warming of the oceans and melting of the polar ice caps is scant due to the lack of longitudinal (long-term) climatological data for the earth.  In sum, it is unclear whether the changing weather patterns that appear to be happening are caused by man-made activities or part of some cycle governed by normal processes.	Education & Reference

question_title: how does geseous exchange happen inthe lungs and body tissues? [SEP] question_content: how does partial pressures of each gas determine its movement ? [SEP] best_answer: Nitrogen and oxygen make up around 99% of the total atm pressure. Carbon dioxide, water and other inert gases make up the other 1%. There is a graph called the Oxygen-Hemoglobin dissociation curve, and temp. carbon dioxide and blood pH can shift this curve to the left or right...increase in CO2 the curve shifts right, decrease it shifts left. So in tissues the CO2 levels are higher so the Red Blood Cells pick up CO2 easily and in the lungs the CO2 levels are lower than in the blood and O2 is picked up, and of course there is the Cl shift that occurs. CO2 is a byproduct of cellular respiration...energy production in the mitochondria...this is a long question to answer, there is more to it but I hope this helps.	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "Cold War" is an informal expression that, by its definition, does not refer to a period of armed conflict.  Therefore, there is no clear date on which it ended.  Historians typically choose dates that "seem best" to them in terms of saying when the period of US-Soviet confrontation came to an end.  Was it when Solidarity won Polish elections?  Was it when the Berlin Wall came down?  When the Romanians executed their dictator?  When the USSR became the CIS?  Some other event?  Those are dates you can find online, with a little effort.  Deciding which one was when the Cold War ended is going to be up to you.	Education & Reference
question_title: Why does the toilet flush backward in the southern hemisphere? [SEP] question_content: I've heard of the toilet flushing backward in the south hemisphere, but I don't know why. Why?\n\nNo offense to those down there. [SEP] best_answer: I would like to say thanks to the Coriolis effect, toilets flush clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern.  But it is not true.\nThe twisting effect of the Coriolis force is real and does influence certain large things like the movement of air masses, but the effect is so small that it plays no role in determining the direction in which water rotates as it exits from a draining sink or toilet. The Coriolis effect produces a measurable effect over huge distances and long periods of time, neither of which applies to your bathroom. Toilets and sinks drain in the directions they do because of the way water is directed into them or pulled from them. If water enters in a swirling motion (as it does when a toilet is flushed, for example), the water will exit in that same swirling pattern; as well, most basins have irregular surfaces and are not perfectly level, factors which influence the direction in which water spirals down their drains. The configuration of taps and drains is responsible for the direction of spin given to water draining from sinks and bathtubs to a degree that overwhelms the slight influence of the Coriolis force.

question_title: Can anyone help me with a persuasive speech on the Philippines? [SEP] question_content: It was suggested we give a persuasive speech on something we're passionate about. I am passionate about the Philippines. I'm stuck on how I can make a persuasive speech about that.\n\nI don't want to persuade people to GO to the Philippines, because I know not everyone can afford to ($ and time). I was thinking of more inspiring/persuading people to just CONSIDER the Philippines as a place to see/visit/experience.\n\nSome good points I have so far as to why people should consider visiting the Philippines are:\n1) Friendly people\n2) Food's delicious\n3) English is spoken by a good majority\n\nIs this an OK topic for a persuasive speech? Should I focus on a particular place in the Philippines? The time for this speech is 5-7 mins. I want to avoid "hot" topics (abortion, gay marriage, stem cell, gun control, etc.) and wanted something more fun/light.\n\nI am sticking with this topic. I would like suggestions on how to make it more 'persuasive' or at least entertaining. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: It may be said that the Filipinos are intelligent, with retentive memory, quick perception, and talents for art and science. They also are gentle, friend]y, and cheerful people, noted for their courtesy and hospitality.\n\nFilipinos are famous not only for their warm hospitality, but also for their close family ties. The parents work hard and sacrifice much for their children; in return, the children love and respect them and take good care of them in their old age.\n\nFilipinos owing to their beautiful country, are passionately romantic. They are ardent in love as they are fierce in battle. They are born poets, musicians and artists.\n\nFilipinos are a liberty-loving and brave people. They valiantly resisted the Spanish, American and Japanese invaders of their native land. They rank among the bravest people of the world. Filipino courage has been proven in the Battle of Mactan (1521), in the Battle of Tirad Pass (1899), in the battle of Bataan, Corregidor, Bessang Pass during World War II, and in many other battlefields.\n\nGratitude is another sterling trait of the Filipinos. They are grateful to those who have granted them favors or who are good to them. Their high sense of gratitude is expressed in the phrase Utang na loob (debt of honor).\n\nFilipinos are cooperative. They value the virtue of helping each other and other people. They cherish the ancestral trait of bayanihan, which means cooperation. In rural areas, when a man is building, repairing or transferring a house to another place, the neighbors come to help him.\n\nForeign writers assert that the Filipinos are indolent. In reality they work hard in the face of very adverse conditions. They work on the farms from sunrise to sunset, though not from noon to 3 p.m. due to the scorching heat. They work hard in the sugarcane and pineapple plantations in Hawaii, the fruit orchards of California, the fish canneries of Alaska, and in the oil wells of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Arab countries of the Middle East.\n\nFinally, the Filipinos are noted for their durability and resiliency. Through the ages they have met all kinds of calamities--revolts, revolutions, wars, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and epidemics. Unlike the Polynesians of Oceania and the Indians of North Central and South Americas, they did not vanish by contact with the white race. They can assimilate any civilization and thrive in any climate. Against the adversities of life or nature, they merely bend, but never break. They possess the formidable durability of the narra tree and the resiliency of the bamboo.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is 180,000 dollars too much to attend Columbia Law School? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Columbia is an EXCELLENT school.  You will likely earn $100 - 125 k your first year out, and you can start paying back your loans quickly.  Also, since it is such a highly ranked school, it will be easier for you to get paid summer internships, which may help offset the costs a bit.\n\nMany law schools have very pricey tuition - I go to Loyola Law, and they are about $32k a year, plus they expect another $15k or so living expenses.  USC is about $40k a year, with similar living expenses.  Unless you go to a state school where you are a resident, or you can find a place with cheap living expenses, you are going to end up with about the same amount of debt no matter where you go. (As to the person who suggested USF - they are actually almost as much as Columbia, and much lower ranked, so you would actually lose money because your salary would be lower coming out!)\n\nSuck it up and take out the loans... you may be eating ramen and mac and cheese for three years, but you will have an excellent legal education and will be able to demand some of the highest salaries once you graduate!!

question_title: Anyone know how residency works for public schools (college)?

But can I claim I residency with either of those family members after a year of attending the school? If I go to any of those two schools I'd plan on spending my time away from school at their houses, not coming all the way back to the East coast.\n\nThe reason I'm asking is obvious as it would save tons of money, but I'm sure that there are strict barriers behind it. \n\nCan anyone explain to me how it works? Thanks a lot in advance. [SEP] best_answer: Every state is different, hope this helps:\n\nStudents who reside in Michigan and intend to keep their permanent home in Michigan, not only while in attendance at the University but indefinitely thereafter as well, are considered domiciled in Michigan. If a student moves from Michigan during the period of enrollment, his/her in-state classification is maintained as long as enrollment is continued. If the family of a dependent student moves from Michigan during the time he/she is a student, his/her in-state classification is maintained as long as he/she continues to be enrolled on a regular school-year basis. Since normally students come to the state for the primary or sole purpose of attending the University rather than to establish a domicile in Michigan, those who enroll as nonresidents shall continue to be so classified throughout their attendance as students, unless and until they demonstrate that their previous domicile has been abandoned and a Michigan domicile established.\nA married person is considered to be an individual independent of his/her spouse.\n\nILLINOIS:\nhttp://www.usp.uillinois.edu/residency/residentreg.html\n\n\nGood luck!

question_title: Aquarius and Libra, do we make a good pair? [SEP] question_content: And i know all we have to do is work hard on the relationship yada yada yada, but i just want to know for some fun! [SEP] best_answer: When Libra and Aquarius join in a love match, their relationship can serve to heighten and strengthen both Signs' consciousness. These two connect on a high mental level; they share a love of art, people and culture; they both abhor restrictive influences in their lives. They are likely to get along well because they have such similar needs and will not require more of one another than they're both willing to give. Both Signs are also very energetic, enthusiastic types; this relationship is not likely to become stagnant. Both Aquarius and Libra are concerned with the betterment of the world and their fellow people. Aquarius is the most progressive thinker of the Zodiac, and they always have a new idea in the works. Libra is the diplomat of the Zodiac; abhorring conflict of any sort, they are born balancers (hence their Symbol, the Scales). Libra's urge to avoid conflict put together with a love of intellectual freedom can lead them to be somewhat indecisive at times; when this happens, more decisive Aquarius can step in and help Libra figure out which direction to turn. Libra can return the favor by smoothing Aquarius's occasionally ruffled feathers that result from the Water Bearer's idealistic thinking sometimes crashing down in the face of reality. Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Uranus (Rebellion) and Saturn (Karma). This combination of influences can be an interesting and productive one; Libra and Aquarius should certainly take on other projects together than simply their love relationship, because they can make great things happen using their hearts, their urge for progress and their consciousness of the greater good. These two are an extraordinary duo for standing up for social justice or radical change in the community. Both Libra and Aquarius are Air Signs. They have strong intellectual bonds to one another and constantly stimulate one another's ideas and communication styles and skills. Again, their ability to work together makes it obvious that these two Signs must take on larger projects in their life together -- they should concern themselves with the greater good. Libra can bring a certain balance to any undertaking that almost no other Sign is able to achieve. Aquarius and Libra together will also have many stimulating intellectual discussions about their interests and pursuits. Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Libra sets things into motion but may have trouble finishing them, which is what makes Aquarius's determined influence so positive: The Water Bearer has a great deal of follow-through and can take Libra's ideas and run with them to the end. These two work especially well together as they tend not to argue about who does what, who takes credit and who works behind the scenes versus out in the spotlight. What's the best aspect of the Libra-Aquarius relationship? Their ability to work together as a team. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone. Their accomplishments and love of socializing and new projects make theirs a highly successful relationship. \nBest Wishes and Good Luck :-)	Entertainment & Music

question_title: what's ya fav johnny depp movie? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Johnny Depp is my personal favourite and I enjoy all his movies, especially those made together with Tim Burton. If I must choose only one movie, then it will be Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view. This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in. What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.\n\nJohnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.	Entertainment & Music

Without your sight you wouldn't be able to get around yourself or see your children as they grow.\n\nMy grandparents are deaf and they get along just fine.

I've never actually heard of anyone loosing this sense.\n\nTaste and smell are the same to me. I could easily go without them. I don't particularly like to eat that much and I foresee that as being the biggest problem that would come of losing these two senses.\n\nSo, yes, I pick sight. :o)	Entertainment & Music

question_title: wher can I find a site that brings me happiness and hope to countinue my life? [SEP] question_content: I need to be happy and feel beauty of life by going to some exiting places [SEP] best_answer: THe path to beauty and happiness lies within yourself. You don't need to find it anywhere else. \nLet me tell you a story (er, now I have time, so don't mind). Long long time ago, when humans live happily on earth. A horde of devils came down to ruin their lives. They managed to steal happiness from humans, but they didn't know where is the safest place to hide happiness, sothat no human could find. You guess where that place is? It lies safely within yourself. It lies in the way you thought about life.\nDO NOT THINK OF ANY EXITING PLACES, 'cause there's no other way than to live on your own.\n\nThis reply is a little bit off topic, but I think it can help you. You can try finding a site to feel better, but remember that you're the only one who can make your life more happy.	Entertainment & Music

However they got to the island, they got there by dying on earth. The ones who appear alive are those who still need some kind of karmic "work" done on them, some self-knowledge to gain, or some penance to work out. Some are just plain low level human scum like the "others" who may have the idea that stealing babies or children will allow them to get off the island through their innocence, maybe they have figured out the after-life thing and they want a vehicle for rebirth, or whatever.\n\nAna was killed right after she reached a pinnacle in her self-development that she couldn't kill anymore. I am not sure about the other girl, though. Maybe she died at the rehab.\n\nAnyway, I think Michael is either trying to rile them all up against the Others or else he has been black-mailed to do this by the Others or else he has been "Stockholm-syndromed" by the Others.
