question_title: Iran Fiasco- can U guess what next? [SEP] question_content: The president of iran allowed females to go to the stadium with their faces and body covered, suddenly there are furore over the announcement. One group wants total ban on it. What are they treating their females- slaves-stones...Does the president think that he is the Holiest interpreters of Islaam. your comments please [SEP] best_answer: He probably considers himself a descendant of Ali since he is the head of a theocratic Islamic state.  As such, what he says goes.  I believe it's a major difference between Shi'i and Sunni Islam, with the Sunni being less apt to allow their political leaders to determine their mode of expressing their faith.  Islam is a religion of orthopraxy and not orthodoxy.  In such religions, one places more weight on what they do everyday than they do in other religions.  Leaders are expected to perscribe what rules of behavior are to be followed by the people of their countries.	Politics & Government

Unfortunately the British just drew country lines to suit the oil companies. Oh well.\n It will be difficult to split as the oil is not throughout the whole country.

question_title: How does one become an Honorary Consul? [SEP] question_content: What are the procedures and requirements for an American citizen to become an Honorary Consul? [SEP] best_answer: Having been an honorary consul I can tell you that depending on the duties it is very simple indeed.  State Department regulations are not applicable to honorary consuls as they have no official diplomatic status, therefore no diplomatic immunity or need to present formal credentials.  Most of their duties are merely ceremonial, cultural or social and are totally volunteer.  They are not supposed to have a staff nor are they supposed to be paid for their duties.  A major difference of an honorary consul versus a consul general is of nationality.  An honorary consul is usually of the nationality of the host nation not the represented one.  To be selected an honorary consul requires the nation making the honorary consul to nominate the person through the embassy of the host nation who send on the notice to the State Department which merely records it.  To be made an honorary consul is a great honor but a tremendous amount of work.  You need to be nominated from the country and they must not have a registered Consulate in the city where you would be an honorary consul for obvious reasons.  You would need to contact the embassy of the nation you wish to represent, offer your services to HE, the Ambassador, and see if they wish to nominate you.  They will then send your request onto their Foreign Office who will ask their respective executive branch of government for a decision.  Then they will send the decision back to thei embassy who will contact you.  Good luck!	Politics & Government

question_title: Why does no one care about Iraq's WMD? [SEP] question_content: We finnally find 500 muntions of WMD in Iraq, and what happens? Nothing.  I don't care how old they are, the weopons were still lethal, they could still kill. Why does no one care?\nIf you haven't of this news yet, see http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200726,00.html [SEP] best_answer: The story has been reported on various news media. The problem is that the version of story that Fox "news" is running isn't the whole truth. The WMD we went to war for have not been found. We did not go to war to find decades-old chemical weapons that had been buried since the Iran-Iraq War. We were looking for WMD proving an ongoing weapons capability that could pose a threat to world peace, not these aging remnants. President Bush has already accepted the findings in the Duelfer Report dismissing these weapons as irrelevant. (See link below)\n\nMore importantly, we already knew about those weapons and turned the other cheek when they were originally produced. Google "Rumsfeld" "Reagan" and "Saddam Hussein" and you'll learn all about the U.S. support of the Iraqi ruler during the Iran-Iraq War, when we supported one monster (Hussein) in the hopes of defeating another (Khomeini). We knew at that time that Saddam Hussein was using chemical weapons against his enemies and his own people, but we did nothing about it. Or more accurately, we signed a piece of paper saying we disapproved of his use of chemical agents, but we continued cutting deals with him because he was fighting a common enemy. We even sold him some of the chemicals that he used to construct these weapons because he seemed like the lesser of two evils at the time. Ironically, we were therefore partly responsible for creating the monster that he is today.\n\nAs a result, the real reason why the WMD story isn't any bigger is because the Republicans want it just big enough for their conservative supporters to hear it and say to themselves, "They found WMD!" but not so loud that people actually start asking questions about where and how these chemical weapons were manufacture or, more importantly, about who supplied Iraq with the raw materials to make them. That would make Reagan, Rumsefeld, and by extension, the Republican party as a whole look like hypocrites. So it's best to keep the story just large enough for Fox news addicts but not so large that the rest of the world hears about it.\n\nIncidentally, I don't suppose you remember what the liberal response was when Bush originally announced his intention to break international law in order to attack a sovereign nation, claiming that  we "knew" Iraq had WMD? One of the most quoted responses at that time was, "Of course we knew he has WMD! We sold them to him!!!" \n\nOnce again, if you people had only been listening to the liberals in the first place, you'd be so much farther ahead in the game.	Politics & Government

question_title: What is involved when being seqesterd in jury duty? [SEP] question_content: like the duties eating or entertainment. do i watch movies or listen to music...what?

That means you are away from family, friends, tv, radio, even religion (your bible)...basically anything from the outside world that can influence your decision. Your role is to hear all the evidence brought by both sides of the law and give a totally unbiased opinion. Being a sequestered juror is a very important thing! It will probably be very hard at first, but hopefully by the end u will feel fulfilled as a citizen.

question_title: I need some help defining what politcal party I most fit with.? [SEP] question_content: I am now non-partisan but I do have strong feelings about my political views.  For instance, I don't want more taxation and I want government out of every little thing, but I'm for protecting the environment, for social justice, no death penalty, I'm christian but don't think my religion equals my politics.  I think politicians are power-hungry and that government is too bloated. My biggest desire is to "live off the grid".  So where do I fit?  Please, no personal insults about my views.  I tolerate you, you tolerate me and remind each other this is a free country. [SEP] best_answer: There are various quizzes:\nhttp://www.politicalcompass.org/questionnaire\nhttp://www.politicalbrew.com/politest.cgi\nhttp://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html\n\nIt sounds like you're somewhere in between a Democrat/Green/Libertarian/or "Independence Party" (i.e. Ross Perot's old party).\n\nDem: Yes -- social justice env. death penalty, free exercise of religion No -- lower taxes, bloated government.\nGreen -- Environment, Social justice,  No -- Government, taxes.\nLibertarian -- yes -- "live off the grid." No -- social justice, no death penalty.\n\n(P.S. all the libertarians love to say "you're a libertarian," and people love to claim it.  The problem is that "true" libertarians get very close to anarchy.  Do you want the government to ensure quality education and health care for Americans? Do you want businesses regulated responsibly so that they do not destroy the environment or rip off consumers? Do you want to ensure that quality jobs stay in America? Do you think social security, food stamps, unemployment insurance, and the minimum wage are good ideas? Then you're not really a libertarian.  We all like to have the government "leave us alone," the problem is exactly where do we want to leave us alone.)	Politics & Government

question_title: Should the American Republican Party be eliminated, if not destroyed? [SEP] question_content: Many people opine that the Republican party is the most repressive, greedy, racist organization in the history of the planet, far more repressive than nazis, old line Russian communists and czars, and midieval huns.  In addition, people say its orgiastic support for corporate plundering and capitalism has engendered a permanent rift between haves and have-nots, glorifies nuclear power and oil over the alarming cries of most people who claim that global warming will destroy the planet, and represent an absolute, irreversible culture of corruption and terroristic actions against most decent people.  Without the republican party, many people say, we could have more inclusion of people at the policiy levels, enforce Kyoto protocols, eliminate corporations in favor of national and international co-ops of people, enforce racial and gender equality worldwide, and most of all, end tax cuts.\n\nAre all these plausible reasons, or, like me, do you think it's rubbish? [SEP] best_answer: It's rubbish.  Republicans aren't whacking millions of people like the Nazis did.  The Kyoto protocols didn't treat developing nations the same way as developed nations.  India and China are pumping much more green house gas into the atmosphere than the US, but they wouldn't have to play by the same rules.\n\nIt's generally not a good idea to eliminate people with whom you disagree.  Why not become politically active and promote your own ideas in a peaceful way.	Politics & Government

question_title: What is extortion? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Extortion is a criminal offense, which occurs when a person either obtains money or property from another through coercion or intimidation or threatens one with physical harm unless they are paid money or property. Euphemistically, refraining from doing harm is sometimes called protection. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence or a lawsuit which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence or lawsuit is sufficient to commit the offense. The simple four words "pay up or else" are sufficient to constitute the crime of extortion. An extortionate threat made to another in jest is still the crime of extortion.	Politics & Government

question_title: Is the USA going to go to a war agaings IRAN? [SEP] question_content: Is that correct for you, American Cittizen, in order to protect your self againts the Terrorism, to go to that war?\nIs it really because of the Terrorism? [SEP] best_answer: To me, the fact that Bush is investigating Iran because of possible nuclear weapons facilities has nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nEver wonder why the 9/11 hijackers were allegedly from Afghanistan, but somehow we ended up shortly at war against terrorism in Iraq (hm, more oil there....)? It seems pretty clearly to be about the oil. \n\nFirst, we also said we invaded Iraq not only to combat terrorism (with no prove of terrorists from Iraq), and to "free the Iraqi people", which really only destroyed their public facilities and started a civil war. And now suddenly we decide to inspect a neighboring, oil-soaked country for weapons, who are too poor to be making any anyway. Meanwhile, North Korea has confirmed to us that they possess nuclear weapons and would use them, but suspiciously we have no desire to touch them....nothing to gain there!\n\nI feel sorry for people that believe blindly what Bush says to the media and the people, lies that create hatred in our country against the unknown and different. It is quite possible that we will start a war in Iran, but more likely we will just disable them by destroying all they have to get at their oil and not send in what's necessary to take care of the people!

question_title: How would the Fairtax improve your life? [SEP] question_content: Go to Fairtax.org.  read and think.  If you are under 40, you should support this [SEP] best_answer: The fairtax would not only improve my life, but the life of everyone.\n\nUnder this plan, I would not be punished for saving money or selling stocks for a profit.\n\nI am not sure why Steve thinks this would increase taxes on the poor, and give huge tax breaks to the rich.  This is simply not true.\n\nThis plan, like many national sales tax plans I have seen has a tax refund for all money spent up to the poverty level, which means the poor would pay nearly no taxes at all.  This plan would give an automatic $10,000 refund for a single person household, which increases for each additional person, meaning the poor would have at least an extra $10,000 a year of income.  If you are poor than you will not buy enough goods and services to surpass the $10,000+ yearly refund, so the net effect is more money in the pockets of the poor.  Remember a sales tax is a percentage of money spent on goods.  If the national sales tax is 23% and the refund is $10,000, a single person who pays $20,000 a year on goods and services, would have paid $4,600 in taxes.  However, under this plan he would receive a $10,000 refund yielding a net gain of $5,400 each year to either spend or save, and if he were to save it, he would not be taxed on the interest earned on the $5,400 savings.\n \nThe rich are the ones spending the most money, so they will pay the most under this tax plan. \n\nThis plan is the most fair, since if you do not want to pay any taxes then all you have to do is not buy anything and you won't pay any taxes!\n\nGreat Question!

question_title: if some one gets arrested for control device, what are they charged for. what does this mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: if you mean "controlled substance" that means any kind of drug or narcotic that is either illegal or requires a prescription.  if they don't have a prescription or it's on the DEA's schedule of drugs, they can be charged with "possession of a controlled substance".\n\non the other hand, i've sometimes heard "control device" used for when someone is arrested multiple times for drunk driving.  in some states the judge will order that a device, basically a portable breathalyzer, be installed in the person's car.  this makes it so that they have to blow a clean (no alcohol) test in order to start their car.  presumably someone could be arrested for disabling or removing it.

I had a friend in one in West Central Little Rock, but I am not sure of the name.  Contact the parole department and they can probably help you (Blue pages).  If the parolee does not have a place to parole to, they will probably force him (or her) to go into a halfway house anyway rather than keep them locked up.

question_title: What will President Bush's guest worker program do? [SEP] question_content: What will President Bush's plan do, and are there any opposing plans being considered? [SEP] best_answer: Guest workers sound great in theory.  But it will be like having illegals with a voice.  Are they citizens?  No.  But they will march just like the pro-illegals marching tomorrow, and guest workers will have a legal foundation to their argument.  People will be more sympathetic:  "Oh, we invited them in."\n\nI'm against the guest worker program.  Read the following.  It's long but good, and I wrote it.\n\n----\n\n\nIllegals aliens are NOT citizens.  They have only HUMAN rights in the USA.  THAT'S IT.  They have no Constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nDeporting them is NOT a civil rights issue.  We have the right to manage our immigration policy however we see fit.\n\nAnd regarding compassion, I have tons of compassion for them.  But we have a country to run, and we can't let people just waltz into the USA.  WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO IMPORT POLITICS.  Poor, uneducated, illiterate people tend to like SOCIALISM.  I don't.  I'm not talking about good all-american bleeding heart liberalism. I'm talking about Castro quality SOCIALISM.\n\nAlso, they are massing in the Southwest by the MILLIONS.  Do you realize that the population of TEXAS is 22 million.  And the proposed legislation wants to make 12 million illegals citizens.  And MOST of those are in the Southwest.  So, don't you think the people of these states have the right to not get their vote diluted by potential SOCIALISTS. This is not about race.  I have no problem with people who are here legally.  But when you allow millions of people in, they congregate together and hold the same political leanings (like allegiance to Mexico and socialistic beliefs).  The fact that most can't speak English just strengthens their solidarity and reinforces their beliefs because they can't understand what most Americans are saying.\n\nThis has the makings of ethnic strife written all over it.  Look at Northern Ireland. Iraq. France. Cyprus. Sudan. Turkey AND Iran with the Kurds.  Quebec in France.  Rwanda.  Yugoslavia.  Chechnya.  China.  And let's not forget Mexico itself, with the indian uprising in the Chiapis.  There is a clear correlation between ethnic strife and large areas that do not integrate into the whole.  This is what will happen if we have entire cities with millions of new non-English speaking citizens spring up in the southwest.  And this will happen if we have an open border.  The 12 million that we're talking about right now is just a start.  What about the next 30 years???  \n\nThe homogeneous culture of America is probably what made America as great as it is.  It is the most populace country in the world with a homogeneous culture.  Yes, we are filled with different races, religions, and ethnicities.  But they all came in, interacted with the other ethnicities, and diffused into living side by side.  Small areas did spring up with primarily one race/religion/ethnicity -- and there was almost always some amount of strife in that area.  Fortunately the areas were small enough to not expand to the level of a national conflict.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by the "guest worker" program.  They'll still be dirt poor, but "legal."  Then they'll have a basis for petitioning for rights.  They WILL want citizenship EN MASSE.  It will be the exact same situation, but worse since they'll have been INVITED.\n\nThe best outcome would be that we can integrate them all in.  But that will not happen.  They are poor.  We are typically the product of our homes, and the homes will be uneducated and spanish speaking.  The second best outcome would be a peaceful secession.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather pay a dollar more per pound of oranges, rather than have my kids or grandkids bombed or have to fight a civil war.

question_title: Currest residents of the usa,How do you feel now? [SEP] question_content: about 9/11..note hateful responses [SEP] best_answer: I feel that when 9/11 happened that I supported going to war to track down and capture the jerk that planned these attacks, Mr. Bin Laden.  And I was a strong supporter of that.  But now, the war is about something else and I don't support it.  I don't ever recall supporting the capturing of Saddam and taking over their country and building it up brand new.  I don't think it's our business, I realize that Saddam did horrible things to the people in his country, but the country was in better shape then than it is now.  The focus of our war is no longer about 9/11, it's about Bush's personal family issues, he's not doing this for the good of our country, he's doing it for himself.  I'm starting to feel that 9/11 was planned, I think that it was a conspiracy within our government, and that our President had a certain hidden agenda.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: I experience the same from the Left wing.  Cuts both ways...there are hateful people across the full spectrum and our job is to recognize it on both sides (so we don't become subject to marginalizations for showing subjectivity) and ignore them.\n\nI have received death threats from pacifists for editorials I have written about 9/11.  I have received physical threats in my classes for speaking against various topics.  The e-mail...never ending.  That is just the way some people think.  They are not smart enough to hold a debate and think that what they are doing will intimidate the other side enough to silence the other side.

[SEP] best_answer: Most people seem to take it personally when a conflicting viewpoint is brought up.  It can be so frustrating when people are blatantly disregarding viewpoints.  I have trouble when I am trying to have a rational discussion with someone and they are obviously not looking at the merits of my own argument and just see it as an attack on themselves.    What are you supposed to do when someone is being completely closed minded and willfully ignorant?  It's difficult.\n\nThere is no more rational discourse or comprimise, only two sides of which you need to pick one.  People aren't even expected to be able to back up their own beliefs as much as attack others' beliefs blindly.  I feel your pain, and hopefully there will be a time when this can change.

question_title: did ya get cash or debt? [SEP] question_content: Everyone is getting in on the cash, except the American tax payers, they get the debt.\n\nAs President Bush embarks on a new effort to shore up public support for the war in Iraq, an uncle of the commander in chief is collecting $2.7 million in cash and stock from the recent sale of a company that profited from the war. \nA report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that William H.T. Bush collected just under $1.9 million in cash plus stock valued at more than $800,000 from the sale of Engineered Support Systems Inc. to DRS Technologies of New Jersey.\nThe $1.7-billion deal closed Jan. 31. Both firms have extensive military contracts.\nWilliam Bush was a director of Engineered Support Systems. Recent SEC filings show he was paid cash and DRS stock in exchange for shares and options he obtained as a director.\nBefore DRS purchased it, Missouri-based ESSI experienced record growth as a result of expanded U.S. military contracts — many to supply U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe contracts, some awarded on a no-bid basis, include a $77-million deal to refit military vehicles with armor for use in Iraq. [SEP] best_answer: Well we got debt too, my island is so rich they can afford to give every person living here legally and ilegally $1 mil and still have change,but what do we have instead a massive oil boom and half the nation can't afford to put a roof over their own heads, and the Government borrows $800mil to build a massive stadium for cricket ( just to give you an idea the island has 1.5 million people) and they put it in the middle of a settlement of squatters. Hospitals are short of doctors and medicine and equipment, schools are in terrible condition and the roads....well!!!! Where is the money going? Nobody knows and this is after years of being technically debt free as an island and then experiencing an oil boom.

I think Maliki's call for us to keep troops on the ground in Iraq, Saddam's death sentence, and Rumsfeld's resignation are closely tied. I have a feeling there will be more fallout to come in the next few months. Rice? Cheney? Or with any luck, Bush? I suppose that would be asking too much.	Politics & Government
question_title: Who would you like to see become U.S. President in '08? [SEP] question_content: Who would you like to see become U.S. President in '08? And 'WHY'? [SEP] best_answer: Joseph Biden. He's got the most overall experience, has worked through 6 or so administrations now, and esp. has the most foreign policy experience since he's the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Compared to most of the politicians running he doesn't just have sketchy details about what to do about Iraq, or no details, or just "pull the troops out" thus leaving Iraq in civil war, and let's face it, I think Colin Powell was right we do have some kind of moral and/or ethical duty not to just run out of Iraq and leave it in total quaqmire status, i.e. the Pottery Barn rule. Biden has http://planforiraq.com/ which details an actual plan for dealing with the situation with Iraq. \n\nHe is probably the only candidate that I have seen that could step into the job and be able to handle it well, because it's going to be a major mess by the time Bush steps out of office (well it already is, but could be even worse). Additionally, he has the extensive experience to deal with any other crisis that may come up. \n\nHe also is very diplomatic, can "work well with others", so I think he will not alienate the Republicans like Bush has alienated many Democrats. Note that the website for his campaign is called "uniteourstates.com".\n\nI also think he will be more easily electable than Hillary. I think Hillary might win the Democrat nomination, but then not win the overall election because she is an overall polarizing kind of person, you either love her or hate her kind of candidate. Some people I've talked to will not vote for her; seem turned off by her. I'm not saying that's right, but it's something that needs to be considered. I personally didn't like her whole stance on the war; she was one of the last Democrat senators that seemed to think the Iraq war was justified. \n\nI think a great pairing would be Biden and Barack Obama as  Vice President. Obama doesn't have nearly enough experience to step into the Presidency yet, but that would give him a great position to be in I would think for the following election, plus give Biden some of Obama's star quality on the ticket.  I love Obama, but heard him on Larry King with his details on Iraq, very sketchy with any details, only about 20 seconds worth, not well thought out it seemed; he just doesn't have the knowledge and depth of Biden yet. But I think Obama will be awesome in 6 or so years!	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately, many people do not understand economics whatsoever. \n\nPeople who support a minimum wage should have a maximum-earnings cap placed upon them. The earnings could be used as capital so minimum wage earners could get more schooling and develop their own businesses. Pelosi & Kerry & Kennedy are rich enough.\n\nThe minimum wage schtick is just a ploy to get votes from the uneducated.

Hopefully it would help diversify more communities, and help people learn about differant cultures and point of views. I think it would also be beneficial to the school systems that would in turn take in more money and even things out a little more. Might be a lessor crime rate and less of a gang problem as well.

[SEP] best_answer: The best way of looking at this problem is a multifaceted one: first of all the dominence of the leftist parties dominated by the unions and secondly the understanding of the voter when he puts his vote - does he actually value that vote - if not why is he allowing governance of this type.\n\nThe other aspect of looking at this problem is that labour laws are shifted more to the employee - which is good I guess if you are the employee - but does make it difficult for the employer/entrepreneur  to sack someone who is a poor worker.\n\nBut Kerala is still definitely not God's forsaken country - its a beautiful land - and it can change with more people realising that change is better than resisting it for the sake of resisting it.\n\nHave a nice day...

question_title: Please provide economic and policy arguments for and against nationwide adoption of a so-called "living wage." [SEP] question_content: The U.S. currently has in place a nationwide minimum wage which guarantees most unskilled labor currently $5.15 per hour.  Many states and/or cities with higher costs of living have a somewhat higher minimum wage.  Social activists are lobbying for adoption of a living wage which, unlike the current minimum wage policies, is supposed to give unskilled workers a better opportunity to live above the poverty line.  Please give me your best arguments for or against implementing a living wage policy in place of the minimum wage laws. [SEP] best_answer: The biggest losers when Living Wage laws are implemented are often the ones who are supposed to benefit.  This is because employers are forced by such laws to decide whether the affected employees are actually worth the extra money, and if they aren't then they lose their jobs.  And the folks who disproportionately hold minimum wage jobs are immigrants and teenagers.  For immigrants this forces them to find work that is often off the books and outside the protections of labor law.  Teenagers are also penalized by not getting that important experience that first jobs afford.  This has repercussions later in life, since future jobs and salary are contingent on experience.  Black male teenagers are the most affected.\n\nIn addition to the discrimination and unemployment that living wage laws engender, there is also the fact that such laws actually contribute to skyrocketing cost-of-living.  Think about it, if you are a small business owner who is forced to pay all your employees $10/hour then you are going to raise your prices to cover your cost.	Politics & Government

question_title: Are we voters the actual "boss" of Congress? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Every two years Americans have the opportunity to vote for the House of Represenatives and 33-34 Senators.\n\nThe problem currently,  if you want to call it a problem I do,  is that the districts have been so "gerry mandered" that the districts are pretty much set as to what political party they are going to go for.\n\nFrom what I can tell its largely based on economics.  In speaker hastert's district home ownership is like 78 percent, and in nancy pelosi, top democrat, its like 29 percent, \nthere seems to be an almost one to one correlation with home ownership and voting republican because as you look down the list and the percentage there arent that many "51% and above who go the other way - democrat"\n\nbecause of how the districts are drawn, it becomes harder for someone of the opposite party to become elected,\n\nsince the voters have a very specific criteria,  and turnout is "traditionally republican" or "traditionally democratic"\n\nthe system makes it hard because elections lately are about TURNOUT of your base,  not PERSUASIAN\n\nbeause of this the elected officials have simple messages, \n\nIm george bush,  im for safety,  im working hard,	Politics & Government

Their actions are living up to the 'axis of evil' title that mr.bush said. For the safety and stability of the innocent people of the region, their nuclear facilities should be bombed. They looked like a religeous people with great morals before. Now they look like fanatics who want to wipe Isreal off the map and are developming weapons of mass destruction. Korea is unlikely to use any of its stockpile. Iran is more likely to use theirs to kill innocent people (Israel). And if you can justify using nuclear weapons there, where would they stop?

Is there any other options that we can take?  That will allow her to enter the u.s. while waiting for a response. [SEP] best_answer: If you've already filed the I-751, you should have received a notice from USCIS extending the validity of the I-551 for another year, which you would then use to re-enter the US along with the expired greencard.  \n\nIf you did not receive the extension notice, if you were in the US, you would have been able to make an infopass appointment to receive a stamp in the passport to extend the I-551 another year.\n\nWithout the extension notice, I think your wife will be denied re-entry to the US.  Lying to the CBP and entering as a visitor will not work if her passport is scaned, as all her immigration information is available to the CBP, just by scanning her passport.	Politics & Government

question_title: what is quiet deed? [SEP] question_content: What is quiet deed, can anyone sue for it? [SEP] best_answer: An action to quiet title is a lawsuit brought in a court having jurisdiction over land disputes, in order to establish a party's title to real property against anyone and everyone, and thus "quiet" any challenges or claims to the title. It comprises a complaint that the ownership (title) of a parcel of land or other real property is defective in some fashion, typically where title to the property is ambiguous - for example, where it has been conveyed by a quitclaim deed through which the previous owner disclaims all interest, but does not promise that good title is conveyed. Such an action may also be brought to dispel a restraint on alienation or another party's claim of a nonpossessory interest in land, such as an easement by prescription.	Politics & Government

This is also before 9/11. The standards are lower now because they cant keep people in the army even today.\n\nI would go to the recruiters office and just straight up tell them what the crime was. They have a book and will look up the offense for you right there and then. It might require a waiver. If its only a couple of waivers they might work with you, if its too many waivers they wont wast their time, these waivers have to pass through their chain of command, if theres a chance someone in the  COC will  deny it they wont even look at you.

question_title: how they discovered  the dinosaur and when? and whet it was eat?how many kind dinosaurs of were there? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For hundred of years, bones were found in China, labelled "dragon bones" ground to a poweder and used as folk remedies. Discovering a dinosaur bone was not hard, identifying such bones as being from a disappeared animal required a bit more imagination, running against the "teaching" of religious beliefs.\nThe first full dinosaur skeleton discovered which was recognized as such, occured in 1858, 148 years ago (see link).\n\nAs to the number of dinosaur spieces, it must have been nearly one million.  There are 5500 species of mammals alive today, and most of them are less than one million year old (the ancestor of those mammals living today disappared, along with some speices that dies off without leaving descendants). If one assumes that dinosaurs occupied essentially all the ecological niche that mamallians do today (there were tiny dinosaurs the size of mouse, no all dinosaurs were huge) and given that dinosaurs lived and ruled the Earth from 230 million years ago until 65 million years ago (so 165 million years), and assuming that a speice lasts one million years, that is about one million indeed.\nWe will never find them all, many dinosaurs may have disappered without leaving traces that we will ever find.

question_title: Is new medical technology actually screwing us in the end?? [SEP] question_content: We've all heard of natural selection, only the strong are supposed to live on and reproduce. But with today's technology people with bad genes continue to live, reproduce, and pass on their genes to their children. [SEP] best_answer: If you mean "are maladaptive genes being increased in the population because conditions that would otherwise reduce or eliminate the potential for propagation are being corrected?"  Yes, that's a reasonable assumption.  To talk about it seems to scare some people since it raises the possibility of eugenics, or selective breeding like Hitler's people tried.  \nWhile gene mutations occur very slowly, it doesn't have to take very long for genetic frequency shifts to occur.  The maladaptive gene potential exists at low levels because it may, in certain combinations offer an adaptive trait like recessive sickle cell trait appears to reduce malaria infections.  Even if the recessive gene seems to confer no survival advantage, probability suggests that it may continue to remain at a low rate as a recessive gene within a population.  These recessive genes are only a problem when two recessive carriers mate.  Under "natural" conditions, when two healthy carriers of a maladaptive trait mate, some children may be free of the trait, some may be healthy carriers, while some unfortunate children will have inherited only the recessive genes and would be too sick, or die before they could pass the trait forward into the next generation.  Now that we can treat so many otherwise disabling, or fatal disorders, one could expect a gene frequency shift as the prevalence of these maladaptive genes rises with the now possible successful reproduction of the 100% carriers.   Genetic counseling may ameliorate some of the potential maladaptive gene propagation, but not all  - - and some people will shriek in horror at the possibility that anyone might be made to feel pressured to forgo their right to reproduce.  \nYou know that we have always been selectively breeding ourselves, and that now, more than ever, we have the potential to breed in or out those traits that we want, or are willing to allow.  The next big battle will be over whether we should be allowed to permanently alter genetic make-ups.  Maybe we will one day be able to "fix" mutations and maladaptive genes.  But should we?  Would it be wise to keep the genetic diversity intact in case it somehow confirs an advantage in the future?  Will the same crowd that opposes cloning of any kind allow genetic modification?  Is it "fair" to allow parents to select genetic moidifications of their children when other modifications such as steroid augmentation is wrong?  - - - So many ethical issues here!\nIt would be interesting to hear some of your conjectures about what the human population might be like 100 or 1000 generations from now.

question_title: A gas sample is collected in a balloon. What happens to the density of the gas sample as the sample is heated? [SEP] question_content: A) decreases\nB) increases\nC) does not change\nD) could increase or decrease, depending on how much it was heated\n\nPlease explain also. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: The density will decrease.  This is because heating the gas will cause its pressure to increase.  The rubber (or whatever fabric the balloon is made of) will respond by moving outwards.  Therefore the volume will have increased and, since the mass of the gas will not have changed, it density will decrease.  The actual amount by which it decreases will depend on the elasticity of the fabric.\n\nIt's much easier to quantify the decrease if you are dealing with an open-necked balloon (such as a hot-air balloon), as the density of the gas is, to a fairly close approximation, inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.  So, if it is heated from 200°C (473K) to 300°C (573K), its density will decrease by a factor of 573 ÷ 473  =   1·211 (or, its density will become 0·825 (82·5%) of what it was before).

question_title: is there more ways to get a different 3x3 of magic squares using #'s 1-9? [SEP] question_content: Can you make more than one 3x3 magic square adding only using the numbers 1-9?.... [SEP] best_answer: Discounting rotations and mirror images, there is only one way to make a magic square using the digits 1 through 9.  \n\nFirst, we can prove the 5 has to go in the middle:\n\nLet the numbers in the top row from left to right be a, b, and c.  Let the numbers in the middle row from left to right be d, e, and f.  (Note e is the middle box.)  Let the numbers in the bottom row from left to right be g, h, and i.     \n\nWe know a + b + c = 15 and g + h + i = 15\n\nWe also know a + e + i = 15, b + e + h = 15, and c + e + g =15.  Therefore, (a + e + i) + (b + e + h) + (c + e + g) = 15 * 3 = 45.  We can rearrange this to (a + b + c) + (g + h + i) + 3e = 45.  Since a + b + c = 15 and g + h + i = 15, that reduces to 15 + 15 + 3e = 45, or 3e = 15.  Therefore e (the middle box) must equal 5.   \n\nKnowing the middle box is 5, try 9 in a corner and you'll notice a problem - the 6, 7 and 8 can't all be placed in the square without the row or column with the 9 exceeding 15.  So, the 9 has to occupy a side box.  Since we are discounting rotations and mirror images, we can arbitrarily select box b for the 9.  This forces the placement of the 1 in box h.   \n\nWith the 9 and 1 now placed, the 8 and 6 have to go in the row with the 1.  So, we'll put the 8 in box g and the 6 in box i.  (We still haven't done anything to create a second square if rotations and mirror images are discounted.)  That forces the placement of the final four numbers.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: is a pole reversal happening right now?explain.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes, it is likely that we are experiencing a reversal at this time. \n\nThe earth's magnetic field has been decreasing in field strength by about 5% per century in recent times. This is one of the fastest decreases of the magnetic field that has ever been verified. Around 700 AD the earth's magnetic field was about 50% higher than it is now. At this rate, it is estimated that the earth could reach a zero-strength magnetic field in about 2000 years. Magnetic reversals are usually triggered when the field strength approaches zero.  Another indication that some geologists and geophysicists believe may be pointing to a reversal is that the poles have been wandering at a faster rate than is commonly seen in the rock record. This instability of the magnetic field suggests we may be close to a reversal. \n\nAlso consider that since we have never experienced a reversal this is hardly a certainty. The earth's magnetic field fluctuates quite widely during what are known as 'excursions', and these are as frequent as every 50,000 years. Our current changes in the magnetic field may result in nothing more than an excursion, which is not a reversal of the field. There have been at least 11 of these excursions since the last reversal at 730,000 years before present. \n\nI've done magnetostratigraphic work.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what function of proprioception? [SEP] question_content: physiognomy [SEP] best_answer: Propioception tells you how streched or under what tension your muscles are.  When you close your eyes, and move your arms and legs, you still know, almost exactly, where your limbs are-how far away from each other, what shape your fingers are in, etc, because propioception tells you how stretched or relaxed each muscle is.  It also tells you how heavy or light something is, based on the tension on your muscle.  It has to be learned, and is generally learned in infancy and early childhood, but athletes and weightlfters show that you can continue to hone this, and sharpen your sensation with practice.  Propioception is strongly effected by alcohol, and is why they do the "touch your nose with your eyes closed" test, because this is a fairly pure test of propioception.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Where is the oldest tree of the world is found? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Guinness Book of World Records currently lists a 12,000 year old California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) named "Eternal God" as the oldest tree on earth. Previously, the "Methuselah" Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) held the record at about 4,700 years.\n\nThe Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) was first identified as a long-lived tree by Dr Edmund Schulman following surveys in California's White Mountains in 1954. The oldest pines grow at elevations above 3,000 metres in arid, rocky areas of the Great Basin that covers the state of Nevada and parts of Utah and California. (This mountainous area of 500,000 square kilometres has no rivers or creeks flowing out of it.) They exist on the tree line in severe conditions, and often appear to be mostly dead, with only part of the trunk having living bark and leaves. This growth strategy is a response to damage from climate and lightning strikes, and allows the tree to exist on limited resources.\n\nThe bristlecones of Wheeler Peak in Nevada were believed to be older than those found in California. In 1964 a geology student called Donald R. Currey came to Wheeler Peak to study ice age glaciers, partly by collecting tree ring data. Using coring tools, he identified trees over 4,000 years old.\n\nWhen his coring tool jammed inside a massive tree, he asked for, and received, permission from the US Forest Service to cut the tree off at 2.4 metres above the ground and keep a horizontal slab for study. When this slab had its rings counted, it turned out to be over 4,844 years old. Later cores taken closer to ground level by dendrochronologist Don Graybill showed it to be 4,862 years old - the oldest living thing ever discovered.\n\nWheeler Peak is now part of the Great Basin National Park, which was created in 1986.\n\nThen a 4,600+ year old bristlecone called "Methuselah" in the White Mountains of California was considered as the oldest tree now living. Some reports have it as 4,789 years old.\n\nWe can say,today,as ref to The Guinness Book of World Records,12,000 year old California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) named "Eternal God" is the oldest tree on earth!!

question_title: Have you ever really touched anything in your life?  What do you think it was? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One of my physics professors believed we can never truly touch anything.  The outer part of every atom is the electrons.  Since electrons are all negative, when we try to touch something our own electrons would cause a repulsion of the electrons in the object we are trying to touch.  He believed that we actually feel the electrons repelling each other - not the actual object.  The electric repulsion would be too great for our hands to actually touch the object.

question_title: what is the human genome project? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Genome projects are scientific endeavours that ultimately aim to determine the complete genome sequence of an organism (be it an animal, a plant, a fungus, a bacterium, an archaean, a protist or a virus). The genome sequence for any organism requires the DNA sequences for each of the chromosomes in an organism to be determined. For bacteria, which usually have just one chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. Humans, with 23 pairs of chromosomes will require 23 separate chromosome sequences in order to represent the completed genome.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a landmark genome project and some have argued that the era of genomics is one of the more fundamental advances in human history.

question_title: If the universe is expanding, then what is it expanding into? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well there are lots of things I do not completely understand about the structure of the universe. \n\nFor example, some current theories are that our 4 dimensional space-time continuum is just part of a higher dimensional entity, where some of the other dimensions are rolled up. However, the time dimension of our 4 dimensional environment is clearly much different than the spatial dimensions, since we appear to only be able to travel in one direction along the time dimension, although many of the equations capturing the physical laws of our universe are invariant when we replace time with -time.\n\nThe expansion that people refer to when they say that the universe is expanding refers to the entire 4 dimensional space-time continuum and possibly some  of the other dimensions as well. This gets very hard to visualize. What I do is think of us as ants living on the surface of a balloon that is being slowly inflated, so the dimensions of the balloon are increasing, and distant parts of the ant's space are becoming increasingly distant. However, this is probably a very limited analogy. \n\nTo get a better picture, you need to consult someone who has thought very hard and very carefully about what the universe is, or supposedly is.

question_title: What is the circumference of planet Earth? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "Earth's bulge also makes the circumference of Earth larger around the equator than around the poles. The circumference around the equator is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers), but around the poles it is only 24,859.82 miles (40,008.00 kilometers). The circumference is actually greatest just south of the equator, so Earth is slightly pear-shaped."	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Six pointed star from a circle? [SEP] question_content: How do you make a six pointed star out of a circle from folding and using only one straight cut? [SEP] best_answer: Fold the circle in half\n\nStart to fold the half in half again, but only crease it near the 90 degree angle formed; this identifies the center of the circle.  Open it back up to where it's only folded in half once.\n\nFold the half into thirds with each of the 2 folds running through the center of the circle\n\nFold once more in half, again with the fold running through the center of the circle.  You Now have something close to a skinny triangle\n\nHolding the skinny triangle pointing up, cut from just above the bottom right corner to about midway of the opposite long side.  \n\nBTW, you don't have to actually start with a circle.  You can just start with a regular sheet of paper if you adjust the cut for the correct results. Mine came out nice!	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is a TSB tube/plate? [SEP] question_content: More specifically, what can I determine about the organism (bacteria) that was grown in the medium? Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: TSB stands for Tryptic Soy Broth. It's just a nutrient broth that facilitates bacterial growth by supplying its nutritional needs. Most bacteria will grow on TSB plates, but if they do not, that is usually a sign that the bacteria you are trying to grow has very specific needs. It can also mean that the conditions were not right for growth of that bacteria though. For example, different types of bacteria grow at different temperatures. If you take a sample from the human body and try to grow it at room temperature, you will not get much growth. Also, some bacteria are anaerobic and cannot tolerate oxygen. If you incubate your plates aerobically, these organisms will not grow.\n\nIn a TSB tube, it is easy to see how a bacterium reacts to oxygen. If you only have growth at the very bottom of the tube, your species of bacteria cannot tolerate oxygen and is termed an obligate anaerobe. If you have growth all throughout the tube (but maybe a little more on top near the surface), you have a facultative anaerobe: it grows more efficiently in the presence of oxygen, but can also grow without it. Growth throughout the tube may also mean you have an aerotolerant bacteria. Aerotolerant bacteria never utilize oxygen, but dont have a problem growing in it's presence. Last but not least, if you have growth strictly at the surface, it shows that your bacteria needs oxygen for growth, and is an obligate aerobe.\n\nIt may seem confusing, but I hope it helped!

question_title: What time range is included when weather is stated for the high and low? [SEP] question_content: Sometimes, I will see that the current temperature reported on, for example, Yahoo!Weather says "37" with a low of 40 and high of 51. [SEP] best_answer: Weather forecasting is not an exact science. There are numerous factors that effect the actual temperature. If it gives a temperature range that is generally for a 24 hour time period. If the current temperature falls outside the range then it might say "37 degrees, range 40-51" they just didn't predict accurately.\n\nNothing against the weather forecasters, that is a tough job. People who get bent out of shape over the forecast being off by 3 degrees need to find a new hobby.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: why is the moon only half but then on other days it is full moon or quater moon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It is the shadow of the Earth or rather, the part you see is the part that is not in the shadow of the Earth.\n\nThe shape the moon appears depends on its position relative to the Earth and the Sun. Depending on the timing, the shadow the Earth casts on the moon will change.\n\nSince the orbits of the moon and earth are constant, astronomers thousands of years ago have been able to predict the shape of the moon depending on the date.

question_title: Frogs can be frozen, then unfrozen? [SEP] question_content: And they're still alive???\nReally? [SEP] best_answer: The common wood frog freezes solid every winter and then, come spring, defrosts and mates. \n\nFrogs that survive freezing excite our imagination with visions of immortality. Underlining this excitement is the unexpected: our experience tells us that freezing kills. We've all read news stories of people who have lost fingers or toes to extreme cold, or even their lives. Thus, a whole animal that can survive freezing comes as a shock. Yet during the past two decades we have also read or even experienced the successes of in vitro fertilization, which involves the routine storage of sperm and embryos in a frozen state at cryogenic temperatures (-40°F or lower). So why is the survival of a frozen frog at 26°F surprising? \n\nThoroughly confused? You should be. Freezing has a yin-yang effect on biological materials—it can both preserve and destroy tissue. This paradoxical nature has led to two different fields of science and medicine built around freezing: cryopreservation and cryosurgery.\n\nSurviving the deep freeze\nLife is a complex set of electrochemical reactions. The rate at which chemical reactions take place depends on temperature, and usually the lower the temperature the lower the rate. At absolute zero Kelvin (-460°F), the rate is zero. Therefore, lowering the temperature of biological materials such as cells, organs, or entire organisms to absolute zero causes life to stop indefinitely. If a person or his or her body parts could survive the excursion to absolute zero and back, scientists and physicians could theoretically use such freezing as a vehicle to transport that person or parts to any point in the future. \n\nBecause we humans are mostly water, however, any journey into the supercool is physically traumatic. At about 31°F, the water in our bodies begins to freeze. It starts at this temperature (rather than 32°F) because biological water is in the form of a solution, mainly of ions or charged atoms. The survival of any cells during freezing depends at minimum on the rate the temperature changes. For most organisms, even the slowest cooling results in an assault on their cells that is just too great.\n\nResulting cell damage is related to the dissolved substances or solutes in biological water, to the cell membrane properties, and to the fact that ice has a very tight crystallographic structure and cannot contain solutes. When biological materials freeze, the solution between cells usually freezes first. Solutes found in the original solution are ejected and concentrated in the unfrozen space between the ice crystals. Cells usually remain unfrozen though supercooled.\n\nIn order to balance out the resulting difference in potential energy between the inside and outside of the cell, water leaves the cell through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, this loss of water causes an increase in the ionic concentration and leads to chemical damage. Interestingly, ions, not ice crystals, trigger cell injury during freezing. Theoretically, an infinitely fast rate to absolute zero would eliminate this harm. This is not possible, of course, and at higher cooling rates the supercooling of water in cells causes ice to form within those cells, which also brings about damage.\n\nNatural antifreezes\nCells in freeze-tolerant wood frogs experience the same mechanism of freezing injury as any other creatures' cells. The frogs freeze very slowly to a temperature often several degrees below freezing. This should destroy the frog's cells, yet those cells and the frog as a whole survive. How? A primary mechanism is through the production of glucose and its incorporation in the frog's cell. By lowering the amount of water that leaves the cell during freezing, the glucose offers protection against the rise in ionic concentration and excessive cell shrinkage, thereby reducing chemical harm.\n\nWhile the wood frog spent millions of years perfecting the use of such chemicals, scientists in the field of cryobiology disco	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is matter mass? [SEP] question_content: Really what i want to know is that if matter is mass and there is such a thing as antimatter [ which there is ] how come it can be measured in grams and micrograms and stuff, also if mass equals energy than how can antimatter produce ebnergy [ which it does] at 100% efficiency. [SEP] best_answer: In physics, matter is everything that is constituted of elementary fermions. Matter occupies space and has mass. It is composed predominantly of atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. All gauge bosons (of which the photon is one), which mediate the four fundamental forces, are not considered matter, even though they certainly have energy and also some mass.\n\nMatter thus consists of quarks and leptons. There are six types of quarks (strange, charm, top, bottom, up, and down) which combine to form hadrons, primarily baryons and mesons, through the strong interaction and are actually thought to always be confined. Among the baryons are the proton and the neutron, which further combine to form the nuclei of all elements of the periodic table. Usually these nuclei are surrounded by a cloud of electrons. A nucleus with as many electrons as protons, which is thus electrically neutral, is called an atom, otherwise it is an ion.\n\nIn bulk, matter can exist in several different phases, according to particle density and energy density or alternatively pressure and temperature. These phases include gases, plasmas, liquids, fluids, superfluids, solids, and Bose-Einstein condensates. As circumstances change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called phase transitions, and their energetics are studied in the field of thermodynamics. In small quantities, matter can exhibit properties that are entirely different from those of bulk material.\n\nHomogeneous matter has a definite composition and properties and any amount of it has the same composition and properties. It may be a mixture, such as brass, or elemental, like pure iron. Heterogeneous matter, such as granite, does not have a definite composition.\n\nIn chemistry, matter is often restricted to chemical substances, as elementary particles such as quarks and leptons are not known to participate in chemical reactions.

question_title: is a snowflake traveling the same speed  from begining to end? [SEP] question_content: if everthing travels at the same speed why doesnt it hurt when it lands on you [SEP] best_answer: Snow flakes do not fall at a constant speed. They start out slow, and will often be caught in updrafts that will halt or slow their downward progress or even make them temporarily rise. Snow flakes will accelerate until they reach their terminal velocity [1]. \n\nBy the time we encounter snowflakes, they are falling at a roughly constant rate, as long as there is no wind. This is called the terminal velocity, which is reached when the acceleration of gravity is balanced by the frictional force of the air [1].\n\nFor something like a snowflake, the terminal velocity is usually very slow. According to the attached reference [2], the terminal velocity of snowflakes varies between 1.5 mph and 9 mph, depending on the shape and density of the snowflake (for comparison, human beings fall at about 125 mph). The reference [3] gives a more complete summary of the terminal velocities of a variety of different snow flake shapes. A discussion of the relation between snowflake size and terminal velocity is also attached [4](there appears to be some controversy about the correlation of these variables). \n\nThe fastest snowflakes are those that are "rimed", that is, that have fallen through regions of supercooled water vapor, so extra ice builds up on the snowflake as it falls.  \n\nIf one couples the very minimal terminal velocity of snowflakes with their tiny mass, they will have a very small momentum, translating into a tiny force delivered to your skin, so they will hurt very little. The typical mass of a snowflake is 3 mg [5]. It would have a kinetic energy of about 6.7419e-007 Joules at terminal velocity, and a falling 220 lb man has a kinetic energy of about 1.56e6 Joules at terminal velocity. That is, it would take 2.31e11 falling snowflakes to produce the kinetic energy of one falling 220 lb body; about 230,000 million snow flakes, or about 1.53 million pounds of snow. \n\nIt might be noted that snowflakes fall much slower than raindrops, which fall at 5 to 20 mph [6], so raindrops can deliver more force than snowflakes can for "precipitation objects" (snowflakes or raindrops) of the same mass. \n\nAll of this analysis assumes that there is no wind involved. Of course, if the snow and/or rain is being driven by wind, it can strike at greater speeds (but maybe less than the speed of the wind, given the air resitance of the drop or snowflake). \n\nHail stones can have much greater terminal velocities (40 mph for pea size hail, and greater terminal velocities for bigger size hail)[7]. Therefore, hail stones can really do serious damage. Having grown up in regions that get a lot of hail, I have seen hail stones as big as grapefruit that break car windows, dent cars, punch holes in buildings, plow under crops, strip leaves and bark and branches from trees, and would probably injure or kill people caught in the barrage. A hail stone that is 2 inches in diameter (51 mm) will fall with a terminal velocity of almost 72 mph [8,9], delivering 28.9 Joules of energy. I guarantee, if that hits you, you will feel it.

question_title: Does anyone know how to easily make "aero-gel"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Unless you have an autoclave for doing supercritical drying, you won't be able to make a true aerogel.  Supercritical removal of the solvent is critical (pun intended) to making aerogels because in the supercritical region, there are not distinct liquid and vapor phases with large molar volume differences-- just a single fluid phase.  This nearly eliminates the shrinkage and cracking that typically accompanies drying of a gel under non-supercritical conditions.\n\nWithout an autoclave, you'd be restricted to making xerogels or ambigels -- low-density, high-surface-area materials that are made by simple drying of gels.  \n\nSee source.

Next time that you feel like attacking a teacher, please stop and think that maybe he/she's just tired and disheartened, and needs some good attitude from the students. I know that a good response works for me!	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What are the possible causes of Hydrogen cooler leakages of a 248MVA Generator? [SEP] question_content: Cooling water quality is being well maintained vis a vis pH & Dissolved oxygen content. The same water is being used in other coolers with out any complaints of corrosion. is this phenomena electrical related? [SEP] best_answer: Using two or three standard cylinders of helium mixed with air or CO2 as a tracer gas the generator can be tested, repaired and re-tested prior to being filled with hydrogen for operation.\n\nLeak testing of operational generators is easily accomplished using one a hydrogen detector. This test is performed in the same manner as the helium test and provides similar test sensitivity.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: can you explain gm>>1/rds for MOS transistors? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I believe you are referring to the transconductance of a MOS transistor.  gm >> 1/rds must mean that the transconductance must be much larger that 1.  "rds" must be the unit of transconductance (which is not typically shown) possibly radian*seconds.  This might be given to you so as to simplify a calculation.  For example is you have a term anywhere in your calculations that looks like this: (gm+1) you can change it to just: (gm).  This can often simplify complex algebra that may arise.

question_title: What path does blood take to get throught the entire body? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the human body, the heart is normally situated slightly to the left of the middle of the thorax, underneath the sternum (breastbone). It is enclosed by a sac known as the pericardium and is surrounded by the lungs. The apex is the blunt point at the base of the heart. A stethoscope can be placed directly over the apex and count the beats. In normal adults, its mass is 250-350 g, but extremely diseased hearts can be up to 1000 g in mass. It consists of four chambers, the two upper atria (singular: atrium) and the two lower ventricles.\n\nA septum divides the right atrium and ventricle from the left atrium and ventricle, preventing blood from passing between them. Valves between the atria and ventricles (atrioventricular valves) maintain coordinated unidirectional flow of blood from the atria to the ventricles.The ventricular systole consists of the contraction of the ventricles and flow of blood into the circulatory system. Again, once all the blood empties from the ventricles, the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves close. Finally complete cardiac diastole involves relaxation of the atria and ventricles in preparation for refilling with circulating blood.\n\nThe function of the right side of the heart (see right heart) is to collect deoxygenated blood from the body and pump it into the lungs so that carbon dioxide can be dropped off and oxygen picked up. This happens through a process called diffusion. The left side (see left heart) collects oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the body. On both sides, the lower ventricles are thicker than the upper atria.\n\nOxygen-depleted or deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium through two great veins, the superior vena cava which drains the upper part of the body and the inferior vena cava that drains the lower part. The blood then passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs, through the pulmonary artery. In the lungs gaseous exchange takes places and the blood releases carbon dioxide into the lung cavity and picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood then flows through pulmonary veins to the left atrium. From the left atrium this newly oxygenated blood passes through the mitral valve (also called the bicuspid valve) to enter the left ventricle. The left ventricle then pumps the blood through the aorta to the entire body. Even the lungs take some of the blood supply from the aorta via bronchial arteries.\n\nThe left ventricle is much more muscular (1.3 - 1.5 cm thick) than the right (0.3 - 0.5 cm thick) as it has to pump blood around the entire body, which involves exerting a considerable force to overcome the vascular pressure. As the right ventricle needs to pump blood only to the lungs, it requires less muscle.\n\nEven though the ventricles lie below the atria, the two vessels through which the blood exits the heart (the pulmonary artery and the aorta) leave the heart at its top side.\n\nThe contractile nature of the heart is due to the presence of cardiac muscle in its wall which can work continuously without fatigue. The heart wall is made of three distinct layers. The first is the outer epicardium which is composed of a layer of flattened epithelial cells and connective tissue. Beneath this is a much thicker myocardium made up of cardiac muscle. The endocardium is a further layer of flattened epithelial cells and connective tissue which lines the chambers of the heart.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart itself is supplied by the left and right coronary arteries, which branch off from the aorta.

question_title: Why does my pee smell after I eat asparagus? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One possible reason may be the glucosinolates present in asparagus and other brassica vegetables.  Through a series of chemically transforming steps during digestion, glucosinolates become molecules such as Indole-3-carbinol that modulate (usually up-regulate) the activity of certain enzymes in your body involved in detoxification and metabolism.  This process may lead to a transient increase in certain odoriferous metabolites that are eliminated in urine.\n\nBest wishes!	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: i dont think is a good idea to ask him if he is just being nice or if he likes you. that would be risky. why? because if you say he has your number and he doesnt call at all it means he DOESNT want to be more than friends. he is just nice to you because maybe that's the way he is with everyone else. my ex boss used to call me sweetie and used to give me a ride to school, used to tell me that he liked my dress or this or that but that was the way he was with everyone. so don't confuse yourself.

question_title: if you are married is getting married a good thing and would you ever recomend it or is it best left alone? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think marriage is a wise decision only if you love the other person. You should care more about the other than yourself. Your life should be truly devoted to providing happiness and well being for the other. You should be able to communicate. It sounds like alot to ask for, but if you are truly in love, you will do all these things willingly, without thinking about it. \n\nI have been married nearly two years. My husband and I made it through the hardest part because of how strong and reliable our love is. Life without a partner to share it with isn't worth living.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: me and my fiance are now both work abroad, and we  plan to have a church wedding in september next year in my hometown manila.. but we both cant go home ahead of time. is it possible to get the license,bookings for church, and wedding banns even we cant be there to have them personally scheduled ahead of time? i have read that license should be applied personally and atleast 3 months before the wedding, and we just cant do that.can we just have a relative do these legallities in behalf of us? [SEP] best_answer: I do believe it depends on the state that you are getting married in, however, you can always call city hall, and find out what they would be willing, or not willing to do for you.  They may send out the license to you to fill out, and send back to them, maybe with copies of drivers license and such...On the other things, use your relatives to book for you....you don't have to be the one who books the church and such, and long as someone gives the money, that is why people hire a wedding planner most of the time.  So they do not have to do everything.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: questions that say \nhow do i know if he likes me?\nhow do you talk to your crush?\nwhat do i do, i like this boy but...? [SEP] best_answer: It's annoying cause you'd think they'd just read other questions like it. I mean when you ask a question, it lists other questions like yours right under the box you're typing in. You'd think they have enough sense in their heads (even if they are teenagers) to just click on the other questions and read what advice they're giving there. No, they have to make users retype the advice. I've just learned that there's nothing you can do to stop the 200 questions that are asked like this a day. So I just put the link to another question like it in my answer...and still get my two points :D. If they want to be stupid enough and not look at similar questions, I'll keep sending them to where they can look for themselves, while trying to be nice about it.

I always managed to be going in the same direction as him after class whenever possible, and saw way too many French movies with subtitles (he was in the French Club which showed them, plus I got extra credit for all those French classes.)

question_title: I neep some imput please!? [SEP] question_content: I have a friend of 10 years, we've been through alot together, grew up together, claimed sisters, even lived with each others parents houses.  In 1997, this so-called friend slept with my boyfriend of about a year.  Yes I was deeply hurt and disappointed, of course.  At the same time, she had recently been through a very traumatic, life changing experience, so I forgave her.  In 2002, she slept with another one of MY men, someone I was only with for a couple months, but it still hurt.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, and yes it's such a shame because I forgave her again like the sucker I am.\nI am now married, only for a few months, and she recently asked my husband for a ride two times because she was stranded, without my consent or knowledge.  My husband didn't go get her, he cant stand her for all the pain she's put me through. \nTo finally get to the point, I'm extremely angry with her and told her to go fucc off.  Am I wrong for kickin her to the curb? [SEP] best_answer: I don't think so-- at all. She's the one that should be apologizing to you and asking for your forgiveness. It sounds like this woman is more concerned about herself than she is anyone else. If she can't be respectful, you shouldn't have to be around her. I think she definitely deserveed that kind of slap in the face. She had it coming.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Ladies: What really leaves an impression on you? [SEP] question_content: I'm an organizer of a singles' group in my area, and occasionally make the presentation for the week. My next topic: Ways a Man Can Impress a Woman He is Interested In (the guys in the group are sooooo looking forward to this one!).\n\nI have my topic pretty much prepared, but this forum is a valuable opportunity to hear from the rest of the world. So, girls, give me the goods. For you, what makes a guy stand out from all the others trying to get your attention? How does he go the extra mile to let you know that you are the icing on his cake? And what makes you take that next step - responding to him?\n\nGuys, this could be golden info for you! ;-) [SEP] best_answer: On the last date I went on, we were eating at a restaurant and when we got up to leave, my date helped me put my coat on.  He was really good at it!  I made a comment about it and he said that his grandfather had taught him how.  It was a smooth little detail but it was very impressive.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering about the trick, he said it's to hold the coat lower than you would think.  This makes sense because it's hard to put your arm up when it's behind you.\n\nThat was a little thing, of course.  What really attracts me to a guy is a positive attitude and if he's willing to just have an open conversation with me.  If I feel like I'm doing all the work to keep the conversation going and on a positive note, that's a turn-off.	Family & Relationships

question_title: i need help with relation problems? [SEP] question_content: i have this bf and i really like him but he acts like he likes my cousin and not me. but he tells everyone that he likes me and not her what should i do should i tell him that i am gettin jealous? or tell him that it is me or her?his friend dosent even know how to help so if you can help me then it will mean alot to me. [SEP] best_answer: If you find out it is her he's interested in, make him choose but don't say "her or me". Here's how you do it. \n\nStart "losing interest" in him....start making it noticeable that you might be interested in one of his friends, or talk to one of your friends to set this up. Make it appear in front of him that you are losing interest in him and gaining interest in someone else. See if you can get 1 of your friends to play along...that would be safest.\n\nTheres only 2 ways he can react. He'll either go for your cousin, if indeed he even likes her. or he will get jealous and be protective of you...and come back to you. Thing is you won't be able to keep him from going to your cousin if he does like her but if i know guys and if i know myself, I will be twice as likely to act out of jealousy and go back after you. See you are his "territory" so to speak, in guy language, and once he sees it being invaded on, he will most likely drop everything to protect what he has. Only don't be too flirtatious so as to cause him to get very angry. Just a bit of interest in someone else should spark his jealousy. But don't make him choose by telling him. I have a rule for myself........I'm never the first one to fall in love....never. This way I have a lot more control to do these sorts of things in order to protect what I really want. It will be very hard if you are already in love with him.\n\nSome guys won't react because of fear of confrontation. If this is your man, observe him out of the corner of your eye whenever you start showing interest in someone else. If you can see he's starting to sweat it, go back over to him and stay with him and make him feel secure. Do it however many times it takes until you get a reaction. Then do it 2-3 more times after that but no more. Once he realizes that what he has is in jeopardy, you've got him.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I de-pants my step son in public. His underware did not come down. I thouhgt it was funny,he did not.He is 10. [SEP] question_content: He told his real mother that i did this and his grandma know the whole family is mad at me for doing this.  The reason i did this was to prove a point that he must wear a belt when he goes to school or out in public.  otherwise his pants and being held up by his privates.  I do not approve of that. So i pants him. [SEP] best_answer: What are you - a juvenile?\n\nI am not surprised your stepson is upset and the family is mad. What you did was assault his person in public. Proving a point is one thing but you did not have to humiliate your stepson by pulling down his pants in public. A private demonstration would have sufficed and as the adult in this particular case, you could have picked a better way to demonstrate why you felt a belt was a good idea.\n\nNext time try explaining the risks to him and then, if he still doesn't get it, demonstrate on yourself (in front of his mother) what could happen if he does not take the precaution of wearing a belt.

Trust me, he will be impressed and hopefully, like you back.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: you see yesterday my bf came and got me and we went to the lake and then to his place... at first we were just making out and then he asked me if i wanted to and i said yes so then is happened it was sooooo great but now that i did it im not sure that i should have. please give me some advice. [SEP] best_answer: I think that if you have to ask, then no, it wasn't a good idea.  I'm glad that he asked, and I'm glad that you consented.  I'm also glad that you regret it.\nWhat's done is done.  More than likely you will continue the activity, but I want you to consider something....\nJust because the deed is done, doesn't mean you have to keep doing it.  If you really regret it, and feel that you truly were not ready yet, there is absolutely no shame in declining to engage further.  If you feel it appropriate, get together w/ your bf & tell him, "Look, it was really great, but now i regret it, and I just don't think I was ready.  So I'd really like to wait...before I do it again."\nAny good guy will respect that.  If the dude has a fit, drop him.  It's a good test of character.\nAs for you, you can run that game all you want, but I'm willing to bet you'll still be weak enough to give in if the situation comes about  ;-)  Just a fact of life, babe.\nSOooo... yes, it's too late to go back; no, it's not too late to wait; and yes, if you choose to wait, you should avoid situations where you can get caught up in the lust.\nDon't worry.  It happens to the best of us  :-)	Family & Relationships

question_title: I find myself being hit on by girls between the ages of 18 & 24...why? [SEP] question_content: I am a 35 year old man, married, and my job requires me to wear a uniform!!  I am in good shape and confident.  I have younger women hitting on me all the time.  It seems like the older I get the more frequently this happens.  They know I am married, but that doesn't seem to matter.  This question is for women between the ages of 18-24.  What would you want from a married man almost twice your age?  Is this a common fettish for younger women?  Could it just be the uniform? [SEP] best_answer: Hmmm. Take out the married part and I could see the attraction.  Older men are more mature, and a lot of younger woman find that attractive.  Especially if they're sick of dating immature people.  And it could be the uniform, especially if it is a type that puts you in a place of power (think cop, lol).  I don't really have respect for anyone who goes after a married man.\n\nBut who knows.  Maybe you're just cute and they like flirting?	Family & Relationships

question_title: What are our options? [SEP] question_content: My husband and I live together in the USA. He has a 5yr old daughter with his ex-wife, and they live in Aruba.\n-She would call his phone once (sometime twice) per week, asking for money for all kinds of random expenses. My husband would send money because she told him she was not working. Unfortunately, just a few months ago we found out that she has been working for years, and earning a tidy sum…even tidier when you add all the money that my husband sent.  When he did not have the money to send, she would refuse to let him speak to the child.\n-And when he did speak with the child, she would take the phone and tell the child what to say. [SEP] best_answer: First, they are in Aruba, US law doesn't apply there.  Nor does Aruban law apply here.  If you want to fight her over these issues, then you need to either bring her and the child to the US, or go to Aruba and hire a lawyer and fight her under Aruban law.  It is admirable that you want to pay for the child's education, and I think sending the money for that to the school is more than adequate, of course, she must allow the child to attend, which she may not out of sheer spite.  I would not send another penny to her, not one.  IF she claims medical costs, ask her where, and contact them yourself as you did the school and make arrangements for the child's treatment cost.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE SEND HER ANY MORE MONEY.  Unfortunately, the money you have already sent her is a total loss, you cannot recover a penny, but learn from the past and don't repeat it.

question_title: i am in  love a true love but the girl whom i love does not believe in love wat should i do kindly tell me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I was in your shoes, my friend, years ago. And this is what I did and learned:\n\nI waited & waited to be loved in return... five years as a matter of fact. I had many sleepless nights, I had a whole migration of butterflies in my stomach everytime we spoke over the phone, whenever i saw her, & even a simple thought of her. Not a single day, night & moment went by that I did not think of her. I was there for her emotionally, physically, financially, spiritually... & evermore optimistic for her to one day feel the way i felt. Yet, she did not reciprocate the same intensity & desire as i did. Mind you that nobody knew that i was feeling soo ga-ga over her, so i had no one, not one soul to talk to for advice or direction of what i should do. \n\nSo what happened? What did I do? \n\nWell, one nite i finally broke down, emotionally, like i had before and got down on my knees and prayed to help get over her. A warm blanket of feeling came over me and realize that I was just alone, too lonely & barking up the wrong tree. In that instant my head was clear & had enough gusto to say myself & her "no mo". I moved on. Since then, I had many friends to count on and goals that kept me busy.\n\nThe Truth is: I was infatuated. I "loved" someone who did not loved me back; who did not reciprocated... for five long years! It was a waste of my time, energy & not to mention financially. In that instant in the dead of night, i realized one love is not enough... it takes two.\n\nSo my question to you, my friend, how long can you wait?\n\n-Taz-	Family & Relationships

My stepdad (for 12 freaking years!!!) was a child molestor. You wont believe the things he has done to me during that whole time. And my mom always stood by him even though he beat her a$$ up every stinkin day. Sometimes I felt like she deserved it, but then when I saw her face covered in blood I couldn't help but crying. I cried myself to sleep every night, thinking that I would wake up the next morning with no mother. I never felt close to neither of them, but if I ever did, I would always stick with my mom. I never felt like she cared, cuz even after I told her about my stepdad, she still had the fuck1ng guts to ask me to forgive dat b*tch cuz he "loved" me." And she HAS been a witness of what my stepdad used to do with me. Some people are lucky they dnt have a dad"... I always think. But to tell you the truth, I waz alwayz close to my grandmother. She would kill a n*gga for her baby. lol.... which is me. I always felt comfortable with myself and avoided being with them. But I waz only 5 years old back then. But yeah... my grandpa is like yo stepdaddy... he be telling me "Preguntale a tu abuela" (Ask yo grandma) and my grandma would tell me the same thing. lol. its mad crazy. And you think it's crazy not getting along with your mom cuz you "remind" her of your dad.... How crazy you think it iz to have a mom who actually HAD your dad by her side, cheat on him, dump him, go with sum other dude, and love that MAN more than you no matter wat a monster he is. And on top of that.... keep you from knowing who your real dad is and lie to you by saying it's someone else???\n\nIt all ended ONLY 2 years ago... (dats not very much)\n\nAnywayz..................... so u ask... "Are you closer to your mother or father?"... my answer... my mom... especially now dat she in a wheelchair, she's blind, she goes to dialysis (with needles) every other day, has had open heart surgery, has NO legs (they amputated both... i waz devastated), almost got her rite arm cut off, is always throwing up, takes like 30-40 pills a day, has a bad-azz Diabetes, died (her heart stopped) and had to go to emergency room and get relived......... i seriously dnt kno where to stop.

question_title: What do you think about this dream? [SEP] question_content: I dreamed that I was in a forest next to a fire I had made. I looked up into the sky and I noticed a mirror inside the moon. There was a woman's reflection in it and at the same time mine. I saw both of our eyes glow as if they were stars. Suddenly those four stars started to combine into one form making both reflections into one, a dream. Something in reality that is far far far from true. [SEP] best_answer: I believe you were seeing your TRUE self reflected in the moon. The combining of the stars shows that you are looking to reunite with your true self. By this I mean who you were at the time of your birth ...when you came into existence on this plane. Quite a beautiful and hopeful dream!!!!	Family & Relationships

question_title: How long does it take for a women to size up a man? [SEP] question_content: Do woman have two categories? 1 friend material 2 bedroom material [SEP] best_answer: Personally I know w/in 30 seconds of meeting a guy if we'll ever be more than friends.  Usually w/in a week after that we're either seeing eachother or not.  Then it takes me around 3 months to start gettin comfy and our routines of seeing eachother down.  By 6 months I know if this is really something that's gonna last or not....and if I don't feel good about whatever I'll say something.  It either works out or we go our separate ways.  ......I think what you're asking though is does a woman know if just friends or more though right?  ....that's the first 30 seconds.....IF there's even a possibility anyway.

question_title: Is it really possible to love like you've never been hurt? [SEP] question_content: I am sure most of you have heard Mark Twain's phrase before,"Dance like nobody's watching; love like you've never been hurt. Sing like nobody's listening; live like it's heaven on earth." My question is, having been hurt, is it really possible to love like you haven't? Is that even someone you would WANT to do? [SEP] best_answer: I think the real question behind is do we let fear or love be primary in our life?\nFear has it's obvious advantages like self preservation. It's unseen and not so obvious side effects are a decreased feeling of being alive. It's like pills we take to aleviate an illness. They are great untill we start becoming dependent on them and they start to slowly seep their poisonous side effects into our body.\nLove on the other hand is difficult to live with because it makes us feel vulnerable, not in control and this makes it possible for us to be hurt.\nActually I think it's even worse than that! When we love or feel happy we are going to be hurt and feel unhappy. Life is a cycle like the seasons, like our breath.\nWhen you see life just as that, a cycle, hurt and love complement each other and they are both OK.\nLook, you will be hurt again!\nSo why dwell on it? Why not let the free bird in your heart fly up to the sky on loves wings?	Family & Relationships

question_title: ??HoW YOU DEFINE MAKING LOVE?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The word defines itself: Having sex with the one you love and is the one who loves you. It should please both of you phisically and mentally. For me it's the best way to enjoy your sexual life, because every time your physical feeling is taking you to heaven, your heart and soul are also soaked with the feeling of love and being loved. Making love is just the very emotional and delightful way to express love to each other.	Family & Relationships
question_title: who is your rolemodel? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: My role model would have to be my daddy.

Work hard, be fair, and respect others........good role model, huh?	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: if you know he is reluctant and apprehensive about marriage and he feels his ex pressured him why would you even think about it? if you are so happy why try to push him into something? sorry but if this is something that is still on his mind he is going to feel like you are trying to pressure him regardless of your intentions. wait and be happy with what you have, let him come to it in his own time, thats what love is being able to put someone elses needs above your wants.

I want to go out but I have no clue.He really wants to go out with me and I know it's against the law to date a guy who 18 yrs ld. So should I just go ahead and say yes or just say something else?

It is not "against the law" to date, but anything sexual with him is a crime (for him, not for you).	Family & Relationships

So don't worry about his feelings! \n\nHowever, are you really too tight for him or is it because you're not wet enough? Try with more lubrication (either lube or more foreplay!).\n\nBut he might really be too big. I knew someone who had the same problem.	Family & Relationships

question_title: does taurus goes with aries? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They have both similarities.\n\nThe Taurus was a very successful model for the Ford Company selling almost 7 millions units during its 20 years life span.  It was at its peak between 1992 and 1996 when it was the best selling car in the USA.\n\nThe Aries total production was just under 1 million before Dodge cease production in 1989.  It won the Motor Trend car of the year award in 1981 and its popularity helped Dodge towards financial recovery.\n\nSo I guess that both cars were big success stories for their respective companies.  However, I'd give the Aries a little edge for what it did for Dodge on a larger scale.  \n\nSo strictly on a business basis, we have an excellent chance of a good match.  The Arian, being a fire sign is the ideas and go getter half and the Taurean, an earth sign, is very practical and will excel at keeping the production flowing and the books in tip top shape.   In this Partnership we have the salesman and the bookkeeper combination.  And, if the planets are well aspected, it can be a winning combo.\n\nBut although at first blush the Aries and Taurus pair seems to be an excellent match, it is a different story for the long haul as the calm, logical Taurus would soon drive the active, fun seeking Aries right out of its mind!   Aries must be caught up in the moment, with the involvement in new ideas being its life blood; not so with Taurus.\n\nSo there you have it.  Hope this was helpful to you!	Family & Relationships
question_title: are there any woman who like a man who is abusive? this is a serious question? [SEP] question_content: ive been trying to change me and t you know its pretty touch mostly when i am sitting on the side lines. i dont care to deceive and lie .if i am being my self i lose the relationship. please tel me what your experience is ?will you respond? \n God bless you [SEP] best_answer: Wow Robert, that's a deep question.  While I'm not exactly sure where your position is in this question... are you the one abusing or watching someone be abused?  It appears that you are the one abusing, so I will go with that.  I have been an abused woman, mentally, physically, monetarily and sexually.  I didn't like it one bit.  It is a demeaning and horrible thing to do to another person.  After the initial shock of it all, one begins to think they deserve it until it becomes a way of life.  Thankfully, I woke up before he killed me.  \nThere are people who are submissive totally by nature who are into BDSM and to them, they need a dominant figure in their lives.  Someone to guide them and discipline them and to them this is love.  To their Masters or Owners, who crave this, between both of them, it is the most generous gift one can give to the other.  I will not disagree with these people because they are the only ones that know what they "need" to exist and feel at peace within themselves.  \nIf I understand your question correctly and you are wanting to change the fact that you abuse women and then loose the relationship, I would suggest finding a support group of some kind to help you with it.  If you find it is something you truly need in your life, then perhaps you may want to do some research on the BDSM lifestyle and learn what it is about.  My best friend is a Dom and explained it to me in a way that I truly understand what he means when he says he does not "abuse" his submissive.  While it's not something I would be interested in, I feel it gives him and his partner an opportunity for them both to get what they crave.  I will add here that that lifestyle requires a certain mind set and a complete understanding of it.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: Ex boyfriends come back more frequently than they stay away!  They break things off with us for odd reasons, then miss us when we've moved on.  The question is, what do YOU want?  Does he bring anything new to the relationship?  Why are you letting him dictate the terms?  I'd date other guys with a view to allowing the best guy to attract your focus.  This one may compete for you if he wishes, but you should not accept his crumbs when he's in the mood to toss them to you.	Family & Relationships

question_title: my girlfriend wants time from each other for a month but she said to wait for her.what should i do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well,I now understand your second question you asked,but I'll answer this one instead. Any time that someone needs a break from a relationship,there is an underlying cause to why this person NEEDS time away. Even if it's just to think through where their life is going,if their on the right track. Most of the time though I truly believe that if the relationship is a stable one that the 2 people involved should be able to communicate their thoughts,feelings and hopes,dreams,wishes,whatever...to each other.\nI don't know your age,but I am assuming that you're younger,because this tends to happen a lot more in young love. I'm older so this answer may not suit you.\nMy advise would be to let her go,obviously she was the one who wanted out of the relationship in the first place. Don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Get out and do things that you enjoy and live life to the fullest. There is so much more of the world to see than what is right outside your own back door.\nHope this helps if even just a little. You are a real person with real feelings and you need to take care of YOU first and foremost. Good luck.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: I just broke up with my boyfriend of 7months. \nWhat are some of the things you did to get over your ex boyfriend. p.s i lost my virginity to his guy. Please help!! [SEP] best_answer: i know it hurts right now. a lot. there's probably nothing anyone can say that will make the pain go away completely. just ease the pain by spending time with friends and family, who will give you support and get your mind off the situation for a little while.\n\nremember that sometimes people are in your life for a short time, for you to learn from them or for you to teach them something. and then they're just gone.\n\nsometimes the best relationships don't work out for one reason or another, but there are so many bright stars in the sky!\n\nkeep your memories! the good ones are yours to treasure forever. the bad ones are yours too, to learn from! sometimes relationships are just stepping stones to get us to where we are meant to be in the future.\n\nkeep smiling! i know it's hard. but soon you will begin to be able to laugh again and you'll be okay!

question_title: How do I get my parents to stop partying so much? [SEP] question_content: My parents never used to drink all that much, but the past 6 months, they've stayed at the bowling alley on Fridays & Saturdays (They bowl on a league) and they stay until about 3am (They go at 5pm). They've been drinking immense amounts of alcohol, to the point where my dad was about drunk, and screwed up a wall in the house. They didn't start staying out late, until they started Saturday bowling, and my mom has been hanging off of other guys, but they claim that there is no problems. My sister and I have been "giving my mom stress", according to my dad, who has been the one who's making her cry lately. My dad has been drinking, before going to work at night (He's an engineer) and my mom had two beers when she got home yesterday from work. They /never/ used to be this way, they would stay home with me, and everything, but now it's the total oppisite. If you would like more info, please email me.. thanks for your time. [SEP] best_answer: Hey, sounds like it sucks at home lately.  I have some words of wisdom for you, but I'm not going to drag your parents through the dirt in public, simply because you said "please email me."  So I've done that.  Keep an eye out for me, and we'll talk.\nOh, and for those who insist that you talk to them about it, I'll agree to a point, but right now it sounds like I wouldn't recommend it.

question_title: Hunters Only!? [SEP] question_content: Yeah, like that is gonna work!!!\n\nI have noticed that there is an increasing amount of harrassment from the antihunters that cruise the site looking to cause trouble and harrass the hunters.  This is unacceptable.  I posted a question previously, concerning this topic, but I believe it is time to level the playing field.\nEvery time someone has a complaint filed against them and the complaint is found valid, it knocks points off that user's score...I have reported every insulting or threatening reply as harrassment.  That is exactly what we are dealing with here....they have nothing positive to say, nor can they speak in a polite or even an intelligent manner, instead using insults and threatening remarks. Therefore, the antihunters are violating community guidelines.  Join me in my attempt to stop such harrassing communications!  Report them!\n\nSo, to make this a valid question, (see "got my first deer") here's the question:  WILL YOU STAND UP AND JOIN ME??? [SEP] best_answer: I join & applaud you, I have been a  hunter for many years & will continue to do so. I would never torture & maim an animal just for cruel sport & shoot to kill..and to put in my freezer..As I said in another post, if anyone of these people went to a slaughter house, where their bacon, sausage, hamburger & steaks came from & saw what really happens as these animals are slaughtered, they would think twice about what they say & think about hunters, and as for the folks that dont eat meat, that is a choice of yours & not ours..

question_title: will the Oakland Raiders be in the playoffs in the next two years? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You never know because of how unpredictable the NFL is. Did anyone expect the Panthers to make the Super Bowl after only winning 1 game in 2001?  Did anyone see the Rams winning the Super Bowl in 1999 after being 4-12 the previous season?  No.\nThe Raiders have a chance at making the playoffs, but if had to be $100 on it, I would say no.  They are at the very beginning of a rebuilding phase in which they gradually phase out their veterans and replace them with younger talent.  To keep fans interested, they'll still keep some of their high priced veterans like Moss and Sapp. Al Davis will not admit that's where the team is, but that's what the team is doing. Maybe in 3 or 4 years the team will be contending but not within the next two years.	Sports

question_title: Any truth to this rumor? [SEP] question_content: A friend of mine owns a couple of claiming racehorses. He usually races them at Hoosier Park in Anderson. He recently told me that Churchill Downs Inc. (who owns the track) sold HP and next year the new owners are only running harness racing. Please tell me this isn't true! [SEP] best_answer: I am from Anderson, Indiana and I have not heard about this development. It seems quite unlikely that CDI would sell their shares of Hoosier Park at this time. There will be slots legislature considered soon that could give Hoosier Park a large share of the machines and revenue share from them.\n\nLet me say that we in Anderson are looking forward to hosting the Indiana Derby for many years to come. In addition more and more Indiana bred runners are making their mark nationally. The horse racing industry appears to be very stable in Indiana. Until slots are decided, I cannot predict they will pull out of this market before then.\n\n The company DID sell HP in fact. They sold their controlling interest of Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California last year. The new owners are now running on a very expensive, new  "Polytrack"  surface. I predict that they will conduct racing at that facility for the foreseeable future.\n\n There is some pressure on Hollywood Park to sell the property they own for significant commercial development. I would say the owners response can be measured by their investment in a new track surface. They don't intend to move!\n\n Harness racing is very big in Indiana but they cannot shut out thoroughbred racing interests from the scene.  You or your friend can e-mail to me if you would like to discuss the issue further. I have covered every detail of Hoosier Park since before the day they opened their doors.\n\nHere is a link to their 3rd qtr. earnings report that details their recent activity.\nhttp://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com/our_company/company_news/2006_news_releases/company_news_11072006.html	Sports
question_title: Why do so many people love to watch Nascar Racing? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, first of all about 5 years ago I thought it was really boring until I started watching it. Now I am total addicted to it, I watch all 3 series of the racing, from the trucks, Busch and Nextel! Once you pick a driver and have friends that watch it, it is alot of fun. It is a very competitive sport actually. Also it is a total adrenaline rush when your driver takes over the lead in turn 3 on the final lap...nothing better to get the blood totally pumping. \nYou have to think of it another way though too, why do so many people watch football? Where with football it is not just one person doing all the work...he has alot of help out there. Where in Nascar if the drivers car is total junk...he has no one else that he can rely on other than himself and his crew to make it better. And if he gets loose and crashes they can't blame anyone else. Where in football...if one player is off that day, they have many more to rely on.\nI say the people that don't know why people watch nascar, probably haven't watched it much and probably haven't given it a chance.\nMy suggestion is to pick a driver (just not Jr. to join that ban wagon) but someone that you can connect with and start watching and than maybe you will understand why people watch.

[SEP] question_content: what is your opinion?  did you camp?  did you kayak?  did you dive?  did you snorkel? where is the best place to get a good shot of the sunrise, or sunset?  let me know about your experience with the park. thouse who fill in the most details will be voted best. [SEP] best_answer: I've been there several times as I lived nearby for six years. You can rent kayaks, snorkel, and dive in several places along the keys. I went snorkeling off of Key Largo and there's plenty to see. If you are interested in seeing sharks I recommend getting a kayak and go to Cudjoe Key which is a few miles up from Key West. Expect to see black tip reef and nurse sharks, sting rays are plenty. If you snorkel, watch for jellies, they will leave you itching. \n\nI don't know of any camping on the keys but if you have the time I believe you can overnight at the Dry Tortugas which is off the coast of Key West therefore only accessible by plane or boat, this former military fort site has excellent snorkeling.  Best place to get a sunrise/sunset pic is there and another good sunset pic would be from Mallory Square in Key West. Be sure to catch the Sunset Celebration every night at Mallory Square, too! Sunrise pics are best from the east side of any island. There are plenty of web sites you can get info from. Don't forget sunscreen!!!	Sports

question_title: How do u make an ice rink 4 ur backyard? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Buy a "backyard ice rink" kit. I've seen these advertised in hockey magazines like the USA Hockey members magazine. They are easily found on the web as well. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, you will minimally need to put together some kind of frame and potentially lay out plastic to keep the water from seeping into the ground.  If you have a natural depression in your yard (as was the case with my dirt driveway when growing up) and you don't care about the shape of your rink you could just fill it with water when it gets cold enough.  You can't get much cheaper than that!	Sports

question_title: What is a better baitcast reel a Shakespear Alpha or a Rhino? [SEP] question_content: I want to purchase a baitcast reel but i don't know which one would be better. [SEP] best_answer: Shimano and Daiwa are still #1, followed by Quantum,Pflueger,Abu Garcia,Browning,and then Bass Pro Shops brand, and Cabelas brand.\n\n     If I were you, and I was looking for an inexpensive BC reel I would probably look into buying either a "Bass Pro Shops Mega Tournament"(which is $50) or a "low-end" Cabelas Brand reel. Looking at your question, I think you may be wanting to ask "What is a good SPIN-cast reel"? \n\n     In that regard, I would have to say the Daiwa "Procaster" ($24.99) would work well or any $20-30 "Zebco" reel. Match it with an "Ugly Stik" and you've got a good low-end combo.\n\nHowever, Shimano reels are fantastic and rarely have any mechanical trouble. They are expensive($99-400 dollars) but you can have them a "life-time". If you are really interested in buying a reel, get a Bass Pro Shop catalog and a Cabelas catalog. They are free, just go to there web-site and order one.	Sports

[SEP] question_content: i think they're hilarious LOL plus they give indepth analysis on the game. charles' opinions are pretty one sided though, but he's pretty much always right. [SEP] best_answer: I like Barkley in the studio.  He's not afraid to criticize a player for doing something stupid out there. I can't stand announcers or analysts who won't criticize a player because they think their job is to 'promote' the game, not criticize it...\n\nAnd Charles is usually right on in his criticismss. He knows good basketball when he sees it. And he knows when someone's playing like crap...\n\nThe guy I can't stand is Kenny Smith... just becuase he rode Hakeem Olajuwon's coat tails to a couple of titles, he thinks he knows more than anybody... and he thinks he knows what it takes to be a champion.... (yeah, just have Olajuwon as your teammate, and make sure he's at the peak of his career, and you'll do just fine).\n\nAt least, when talking about championships, Scottie Pippen not only won some championshps, he was actually a contributor to those titles, unlike Kenny Smith, without whom  Houston STILL would have won in 94 and 95.

question_title: If there is a draw in the standings in the World Cup, what is the method for determining who moves on? [SEP] question_content: I know hardly anything about Soccer or the rules of the game, but I noticed the USA team got a draw with Italy in their last match.  I notice the Czechs and Italy play each other for their next game.  If Italy wins and the US wins, it would put the US a point ahaid of the Czech Republic and they would move on.\n\n  However, the thing that confuses me is if there is a draw and the US wins.  The US would be tied with the Czech Republic.  Italy could possibly lose their match, with the US winning theirs, and there would be a tie between Italy and the US in the standings.\n\nWhat would happen in the event of a tie? [SEP] best_answer: The first round is the only round where there could be a tie, this is because the system of play will be the league system, each team playing one match against each of the other teams in the same group, with three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat.\nBut the round of sixteen, quarterfinals, semifinals, play-off for third place and final will all be played in accordance with the knock-out system. That means, that if after 90 minutes, a match ends in a draw, extra time of twice 15 minutes will be played. If the score is level after extra time, penalty kicks will be taken to determine the winner.\n\nUNTIE THE TIE OF THE FIRST ROUND:\nThe ranking of each team in each group will be determined as follows:\na) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;\nb) goal difference in all group matches;\nc) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria,their rankings will be determined as follows:\nd) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;\ne) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;\nf) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;\ng) drawing of lots by the Organising Committee for the FIFA World Cup	Sports

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Both these answers are basically correct, just one part left out: If the player signs an offer sheet with another team, his current team gets a chance to match it.\n\nThere is also a "Transition Player" tag a team can slap on a player. It is the same as a "Franchise Player", except two differences:\n\n1) A Franchise Player gets a salary of the average of the top 5 players for that position or 120% of last season's salary whichever is greater. A Transition Player gets a salary of the average of the top 10 players for that position or 120% of last season's salary whichever is greater.\n\n2) If either type of player signs with another team, his current team gets a chance to match or beat the offer. If they do not match it, the team gets compensated with two 1st round draft picks for a Franchise Player, and no compensation for a Transition Player.	Sports

question_title: How are the candidates for FIFA World Player of the Year Award picked? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The FIFA World Player of the Year is a football award given annually to the male and female player who are thought to be the best in the world, based on votes by coaches and captains of international teams. In a voting system based on a type of a Borda count, each coach gets three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the winners are ordered based on total number of points. The award started in 1991 for men and 2001 for women.Following criticism from some sections of the media over questionable nominations in previous years, in 2004 FIFA drew up a shortlist of 35 men and 21 women from which national team managers and, for the first time, team captains and representatives from FIFPro (the worldwide representative organization for professional players) could vote [1].\n\nAnother criticism brought up against the men's nominations is that no player in activity outside of Europe has ever been nominated for the award. Although players from several nationalities, of three continents, have been nominated and won the award, they were all playing for European clubs at the time of their nomination or victory. It has been suggested that players active even in the more prestigious Leagues in Latin America (such as the Argentine, the Brazilian or the Mexican Leagues), are generally overlooked for the award. Others have noted that because of the money involved almost all of the world's best players play in European leagues by the time they mature as players.\n\nLa Liga players have won the men's award 5 years running	Sports

He will probably get more RBs and will definitely get more steals. KG will have plenty of guard help but is all alone down low. That equals more opportunities. Don't discount Kaman as he may take away a few of Brand's opportunities. I think Brand is great; I took him with the 9th pick of the first round in a recent draft.

question_title: Who Is Better? [SEP] question_content: Which one of these guys is the best?:\n\n1. Babe Ruth\n2. Reggie Jackson\n3. Barry Bonds [SEP] best_answer: Babe Ruth without a doubt, he revolutionized the game, baseball wasn't that big until he came around, people started coming in droves when he started hitting home runs, one year he had hit more home runs than the entire league combined. He also played in what was called the "dead ball era", the baseballs weren't as tightly wound as they are now, and for a guy with his built he was surprisingly fast, and had a rocket for an arm. Many people agree that no matter what era he had played in he still would of hit all those homers and in all probability would have hit more. \nReggie Jackson would have to be 2nd, he hit tremendous home runs as well and was a winner, he too was fast and had a rocket for an arm when he was in his prime.\nBarry Bonds has always been a very good player, but the fact is he's never one a championship, and all the home runs he's hit be it with the help of some juice or not haven't.helped his teams ever\nwin.

Where can i get my self trained ?\nesp online . It would be great help. [SEP] best_answer: SAS Institute Inc., headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, USA, has been a major producer of software since it was founded in 1976 by Anthony Barr, James Goodnight, John Sall and Jane Helwig. SAS was originally an acronym for Statistical Analysis System but for many years has been used as an arbitrary tradename (for which the company has received trademark protection in the US and abroad) to refer to the company as a whole, its products having long since broadened beyond the statistical analysis sphere.\n\n\nIts main and original product was the SAS software package used in statistical analysis, consisting of numerous modules which ran on IBM mainframe computers. In addition to the usual mainframe practice of writing and submitting programs in batch, SAS offered the option, somewhat novel at the time, of a windowed programming environment, where the program being written or edited appeared in one window, the program output appeared in another window, and the program log appeared in a third window.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute\n\nAlso A specialist regiment of the British army that is trained in commando techniques of warfare and used in clandestine operations (especially against terrorist groups) - Special Air Service	Business & Finance

question_title: Is common law marriage still common law marriage if you live in your parent's house and not your own? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been living together for over two years but in my dad's house, if we don't have our own place that is ours could we still be considered married? [SEP] best_answer: Under TX law, both parties must (1) both act as if you are married to each other, so that an objectively reasonable person would view you as married; and (2) both intend that you be married to each other.\n\nThe fact that you live in a particular abode or circumstances is irrelevant, unless it is evidence showing that you are not acting as married so that the public would view you as such, or that you don't intend to be married.\n\nHowever, in order to be actually granted legal status as married, a court must find that you satisfy the common law requirements. So, until you sue your boyfriend/husband for some injury you suffered that can only be redressed by a court as between married persons, then it really doesn't matter, because, in the eyes of the law you're not married.\n\nSo, if your objective is that both you and your boyfriend wish to be viewed as married, then just tell people that you are married, and they will believe you.\n\nConversely, if you want to assert some right against your boyfriend, then you'll have to ask a court to grant you the right first, before you can legally enforce that right.

question_title: Are online/correspondence/distance learning degrees respected? [SEP] question_content: By you?\nBy the public?\nMost importantly, by employers? [SEP] best_answer: Online, correspondence, and distance learning degrees are gaining some acceptance and respect as programs are proven complete and successful.  One thing to look at before jumping into one of the is the accredation of the company offering the course(s).  In order for the credit that you earn with one of them to be transferable, the place offering the credit MUST be accredited by a national AND regional accrediting body.  I STRONGLY suggest that you locate contact information for the accrediting body in your area and check it with them.  If you simply ask the school that offers the credit for the program you are considering, you will be told something like, "Every institution evaluates credit from another school based upon their own criteria and we can't tell you if our credits will be accepted by them or not."  That is a HUGE RED FLAG!  Do your own research!!	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Hi,\n\nLuis Galarza here...\n\nWell my friend if you really want to earn more money in 2 month and maybe build a business that will generate a monthly residual income and not just "more money" I really recommend you to go for Partnership business and MLM or Network Marketing... Why? Simple because you can start any of this business with no or little investment from your part.\n\nPartnership Business: When I said partnership business I am talking about that you can earn more money with JV or Joint Venture Partnerships and Affiliate or Associate Program Marketing. \n\nThis type of business can be very lucrative if you know how to market on the internet the right way. Plus, you don't need:\n\n- A product\n- Employees\n- Office or storefront\n- Merchant Account\n- Phone\n\nAnd you don't have to worry about returns, customer service or sales support, the merchant does all that for you. The only thing you have to do is send traffic to the unique link or links the merchant provide you when you sign up for their affiliate program.\n\nMLM or Network Marketing: Is just another form of Affiliate Program where you can make money by selling the merchant's products or services and you can earn even more money by introducing more people to the business opportunity and teaching them to do the same, which is what network marketers call "Downline".\n\nThe bigger your downline the less work you need to do and the more money you can earn. You can do the same thing on some multi-tier or multi-level affiliate programs... (See resource box for some useful links).\n\nDid you know that even Donald Trump knows that Network Marketing is the way to go... That's exatly what he recommends to anyone who wants to start a new business on a low budget. \n\nAnd he's right... Because you get everything you need from the business plan, business training, and business supplies design to help you earn more money.\n\nPros: Low or no investment, and big money to be make\n\nCons: 95% to 98% make little or no money on ths industrys.\n\nThat's why I really recommend you to get the training you need to have a successful business venture that can earn you more and money for years to come...\n\nHope this little tip will help you.\n\nTo YOUR Success,\n\nLuis Galarza, CEO of\nFree Affiliate Marketing Training Membership Site\nhttp://www.AffiliateCashSecretsClub.com/ \n\nP.S. Test you marketing until you find what works for you, don't be like those poeple that can't earn any money on a affiliate program or network marketing opportunity and then they call it scam.\n\nRemember any business have the potential to make money and you are the only one that can make it happen!\n\nAlso you can visit my blog for more tips at:\nhttp://luisgalarza.blogspot.com/ \n\n\n\n\n.

How do you expect to earn money from that?\n\nTake a look at their sample store pages and the first two sites they feature http://www.ecashstreet.com/?pg=samples\n\nhttp://www.estorebiz.com/snic/\nhttp://www.greatfindsbyshari.com/\n\nOne thing that jumped at me is that these two pages look VASTLY DIFFERENT from the screenshot in the sample pages page of ecashstreet.com. Greatfindsbyshari.com on the sample page looks very professional with a woman standing in the top middle - but clicking on the site goes to a drab looking template and the only sign of greatfindsbyshari.com is the logo.\n\nI say stay away with it. You are not going to make money by signing up with them. Having the same replica website offering the same exact products with hundreds or thousands of other websites is the surest way to lose money on the Web.	Business & Finance

question_title: How far in advance should you start the home buying process compared to when you'd actually move in? [SEP] question_content: For instance..we plan to move around November December is it too soon to begin looking?  Or is now the perfect time to at least start getting ideas and looking around to see what's out there? [SEP] best_answer: You will usually take as few as 15 days to as many as 45 days to close from the day you sign the agreement. So ideally you would make offers you expect to be accepted at 45 days from the move in date. You will then raise the offers them and tighten up the closing date as the deadline approaches if you have to move. Remember there is usually a day or two before it funds and you get the keys, or put in the offer you take possesion at closing. Otherwise it is at funding.\n\nYou should start getting comfortable with the market by looking on your own. You probably don't want to tie up your own agent for this long. So call the listing agent when you want to see inside a house. Otherwise just look at the prices and the paper and maybe drive by. Once you are ready to start making real offers within a month then get your agent lined up. You will even have several that you already talked to and you might like.\n\nAnother option is to start making lowball offers in the mean time and see if any get accepted. My wife and I started looking in Jan a few years ago and made offers 15% below the listed price if it was a very reasonable price, and as much as 20-25% if it was inflated for a big sell. (you can use www.zillow.com to help with valuation, but it isnt perfect remember). It took 8 offers (7 rejections) and we moved in in July to a house that was appraised for 10% more than we paid! Just tell your agent what the plan is so she isn't surprised when you don't come up to reasonable offers. You might even consider springing for lunch once in a while since you are really making her work hard.\n\nMake sure you can afford to have the house early if you get it, otherwise you might not want to try that.\n\nGood luck	Business & Finance
question_title: prequalification? [SEP] question_content: if I was prequalified for $90,100 for a home purchase, the program say's that I have 100% financing, with $0 down, but I want to purchase a house for $250,000, how does that work. Also my closing cost is included in the package. how does this work and how would I calculate a mortgae payment? [SEP] best_answer: First of all, just to let you know, being "pre-qualified" is really nothing. It doesn't take into account your credit history or score, it isn't based on any facts, it is to loose to be taken seriously.\n\nSo, what you need to do is get pre-approved. And the only thing that should cost you is 30-35 dollars (maybe) for the cost of the credit report the mortgage company is charged by the company that supplies them the information. If anyone tries to charge you more than that to get pre-approved, they are ripping you off and you should go elsewhere! \n\nPre-approvals actually take into account factual information you supply such as income (which they verify), savings/bank balances/investment (also verified), pulled credit history, so on and so forth. It shouldn't take more than 48 hours to get the pre-approval letter.\n\nNow, in regards to the whole 100% financing plus having closing costs paid through the loan rather than out of pocket - BEWARE!!!!!!! That means that they are upping the interest rate to pay all that stuff and chances are they are also raising it to the point that they are getting more then 1% commission out of you and you will never know it.\n\nGo someplace other than who has "pre-qualified" you and start fresh. Tell them you want to be "pre-APPROVED" for 100% financing for the highest amount you qualify for and ask them to give you the "par" interest rate which means the rate you can get where there is no "cost" and no "rebate". After you find out what the "par" rate is, THEN you can ask them what your rate will be if you have a large enough rebate to cover the closing costs. Otherwise, if you get the whole closing costs paid out of the rate thing from the beginning, you are asking to be taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, if your particular situation is more difficult than the average borrower's, then it is perfectly ethical for the lender to make up to a 1.5% commission off of you and if you also only can get a small loan on top of that a maximum 2% commission - but even that's pushing it when it comes to fairness.\n\nJust be careful who you go to because the mortgage lending business if FULL of crooks and sharks. Ask friends and family who they recommend.\n\nGood luck!	Business & Finance

question_title: suze orman,  I am $80,000.00 in debt.  My debt is now outwaying my income.? [SEP] question_content: I have asked my dad for help and he will.

I make about 60,000.00 a year.  I have destroyed my credit cards.  Please help.  Worried [SEP] best_answer: With those figures, your best bet is probably to set up an appointment with a credit counseling agency or financial advisor and they will be better suited to advise you as to the variety of plans available to you both "in" your area and "for" your financial situation.  Have your dad go w/you for personal support.  You may be able to get out of the hole you're in WITHOUT digging a deeper one.\n\nIn the meantime.....\n**Destroyed the cards? GREAT start!!!  \nYou can also take better control of the other expenses that nip at you month to month by...\n*get a cheaper cell phone plan-maybe even a prepaid one (you control your spending better that way)\n*If you have the "full deal" cable tv service...cut it down to basic for a while till things iron out, you can always re-upgrade later.\n*If you have ALL the extras on your home phone, get rid of it all and keep just basic service and MAYBE the caller id.  Pick up a cheap answering machine for a one time expense rather than have the voice mail that you pay monthly for.\n*Any other "installment" plans that you have PAY BEFORE THE DUE DATE! You'd be AMAZED at how much more will go to the principal instead of the interest.\n*If you have "high-end" internet, cut down to basic for a while...that too can be re-upgraded later.\n\nThere are ALOT of little ways that you can cut down on some of the "over-head" while you get things straight.  And you'd be surprised what you discover you can live without, You may end up realizing just how much and wonder why you were wasting so much money!\n\nGOOD LUCK!	Business & Finance

question_title: what size is a one carat diamond? [SEP] question_content: what are the dimentions is a one carat diamond and what is the color I? [SEP] best_answer: For Color, It starts with D, E, and F.  These will be colorless.  With a color I, you will have some yellow in it, but not noticable to the naked eye.  This is what my wedding diamond is, and I really don't even notice.  The only way you can really tell, is if you hold it next to a D color stone on a white peice of paper.  Only when you get to a K color, then you can start telling that its a little bit yellow.... unless you are a jeweler.  \n\nWIth the Dimentions, it really depends on what cut you have.  A princess or radient cut will look differently than a round or oval cut.  \n\nA good website that will educate you on Cut, Clairty, Color and Carat is the following:  \n\n(There is some interactive slides that will show you how large a diamond is and also the color)	Business & Finance
question_title: If you were a business consultant, what would you charge your client? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I look at things several ways:\n\n1) How much are you helping your client? For instance, has your advice saved them $80k/year in costs, even though it took you only a week? Then it might be better to negotiate a project fee higher than an hourly rate.\n\n2) How much do others offering similar services to yours charge, given similar levels of skill and experience? Try to be much better than average, and charge a higher than average rate. (sounds obvious, but it is a much better choice than being the low-price-leader and trying to make up for it on volume of work)\n\n3) How much time will the project actually take you, and what will your expenses be during the project? You could always calculate your hours and expenses, and charge exactly that. Your hourly rate will depend on you, your industry, the market etc. but we charge 150 for consulting, and 95/hour for production/implementation work.\n\n4) What is the opportunity cost of taking the project? Will taking this project make it impossible for you to land other, potentially more valuable, work? If so, you should charge a higher rate.\n\nAfter considering all these factors determine a fee that will both compensate you for your time and knowledge, and guarantee that you will be adding value to your client's business.

question_title: what do you mean by OUTSOURCING? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The general concept of outsourcing is having other firms do the work of a particular internal company functions.  Good example of that are the federal government agencies that looks for contractors to perform specific tasks.  An example is the company Lockheed Martin where they have a billion dollar contract with the Department of Defense to design and manufacture the F-22 Raptor.  \n\nOutsourcing can help a certain organization to save a little in terms of paying their own employess, and give other firms (usually start-up firms) an opportunity to take the work, which could give opportunities to potential to work in a different firm and perform the same duties.\n\nHowever, outsourcing can be a negative as well, a good example are call-centers owned by American firms.  Due to the labor costs in the United States being expensive, these firms reach-out or venture their business overseas where in most likelihood labor is cheaper.  Since call-center operators doesn't need to perform their business face-to-face with their customer, they don't need to travel to the United States to work.  This result to a lower cost in labor.  This sets gains in the part of the company but not to the average worker, which will lead to a higher unemployment turn-out.	Business & Finance

question_title: How can I (a German) start a business with an american in america? What types of visa or paperwork are needed? [SEP] question_content: An American friend of mine pitched an idea to my on vacation about a business he would like to start.  I am intereseted in becoming a partner but i have no idea how to move to america and be legally allowed to work.  I am a student so i do not have alot of money. does anyone know how hard it is to get some sort of visa so i can work and perhaps help with loans and such.  any input would be very greatly appreciated... [SEP] best_answer: There are several options:\n\n1. Get an investor's visa, but you said you do not have a lot of money and the requirement is $500,000 at the minimum (if you are going to invest in a "targeted employment area")  http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/residency/investment.htm\n\n2. Employment based immigration - the company that your American partner will form can sponsor you BUT your partner needs to prove that no Americans can do the job as well as you will; and that no Americans are available to do the job. The US employer will first have to apply for a labor certification with the Department of Labor http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/residency/employment.htm and the process even includes advertising and inviting Americans to be interviewed for the job (the state's Department of Labor will handle the interviewing). The process is long and in some states, backlog is quite substantial (some states are only processing 2002 applications). \n\nIt is best to consult with an immigration lawyer to discuss your options. It will not be cheap.	Business & Finance

question_title: How do you start looking for Venture Capital Funding? [SEP] question_content: For an online company, located in a small rural area, that has been in business for over 5 years, how does one go about attracting venture capital funds and investors? [SEP] best_answer: Venture Capital is just another name for private investor. There are some private investor groups but they are not well advertised. Typically a venture capitalist does not engage in the business of private investing because there is usually no or very little return on the investment. They expect to get their money back at best. That's why it is hard to find them, it's not a business. However, there are some organizations that provide business resources, councilling, consulting, advice, and these are usually staffed by successful business people. The chamber of commerce in your city and the state will provide you with local information. Often, those groups will point you in the right direction for fund raising. Another resource is to join a country club and/or a golf club where business executives tend to favor. Networking is key to many aspects of business success. To get your online business producing sales revenues you can hire a professional online marketing company and put me to work making you money.

question_title: How can you treat stringy hair? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Eating a balanced diet is essential for maintaining good hair health and also your overall body health. According to nutritionists, people who have nutritional deficiencies in their diet have dull and stringy hair and can at times even suffer from a temporary case of hair loss. \n\nA diet, which is very low in calories, can affect your hair. Eating too much of only certain food groups and eliminating others from your diet, can also cause hair loss. Studies have shown that a deficiency of Zinc can severely affect your hair and cause it to fall. Zinc is present in meat, seafood, and eggs; so you should try and incorporate these in your diet. For vegetarians, a zinc supplement may help. \n\nHair, to remain healthy, needs essential fatty acids. The omega-3 fatty acids provide the hair follicles with the nutrients necessary for good health and to keep the hair and scalp from drying up. If the hair follicle will not get its share of these fatty acids, it becomes weak and this results in hair loss and thinning of hair. Thus a diet, which all but eliminates fat, is not good for the hair. Omega-3 fatty acids are present in mackerel, salmon, flaxseed oil, macadamia nuts, and walnuts. \n\nAnother constituent of the Vitamin B complex, known as Biotin, is very essential for healthy hair. A deficiency of biotin is known to cause hair loss. Any foods which give you a good amount of protein such as meat, eggs etc, should take care of your biotin requirements for preventing temporary hair loss. Vegetarians can take milk products, cereals, cottage cheese, and tofu to increase their protein and biotin intake. \n\nHence, from all the above, it can be seen that people who have a poor diet or eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, are at an increased risk of temporary hair loss due to nutritional deficiencies that weaken their hair shafts and follicles. Thus it is important to have a proper diet. A healthy and balanced diet will definitely help in improving your hair condition as well as stop it from falling due to any diet related deficiency.

question_title: Please Provide me information about the  ushroom farming? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hope this site helps before you go further.\n\n"... Mushroom farming consists of six steps, and although the divisions are somewhat arbitrary, these steps identify what is needed to form a production system. \n\nThe six steps are Phase I composting, Phase II composting, spawning, casing, pinning, and cropping. These steps are described in their naturally occurring sequence, emphasizing the salient features within each step. Compost provides nutrients needed for mushrooms to grow. Two types of material are generally used for mushroom compost, the most used and least expensive being wheat straw-bedded horse manure. Synthetic compost is usually made from hay and crushed corn cobs, although the term often refers to any mushroom compost where the prime ingredient is not horse manure.

question_title: what to say when someone dies? [SEP] question_content: your talking to some one and they tell you that some one they knew has  passed away. What are some things to say other than "i am so  sorry" that is all that seems to come to my mind.\n\nthank you! [SEP] best_answer: How good of you, Jason, to ask such a considerate question. If you knew the deceased well (and, for example, he loved sunsets), you might mention the sunset tonight was made especially beautiful for (name of deceased), and he had the best view from heaven. I think Robert said it best, depending on how well you knew the person. Also, "I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nPlease let me know if there's anything I can do to help." is always appropriate. Depending on how close you are to the grieving person, a gentle touch on the arm, shoulder or a gentle hug is usually welcome. Your heart will guide you.\n\nThe comment, "it will get easier with time" I think is not appropriate, not sympathetic, and will sound heartless to the grieving person. Older people seem to say that sometime; it's not out of cruely; they just don't know what to say.\n\nwanabelong.com had this to say:\n\nBut what do you say to the family? What can be said, other than, “I don’t know what to say?” and “I’ll keep you in my prayers.”  Sometimes it better to say less than more, or to just be there, with a hug and a cup of tea. Why is it we are uncomfortable with death, when it’s probably the only thing we all can guarantee will happen to us in our lives?\n\nOur awkwardness often leads to saying stupid things trying to fill the space of our discomfort with empty statements that still leave us feeling stupid.  When the person grieving does not hear, their hearts breaking with the grief, their energy taken in a journey to revisit every laugh, every argument, every memory, and the words often lost in a sea of internal thoughts.  \n\nThe most profound thing someone can do for another person when someone dies is to listen, to hold them, to just be there, to give comfort and to resist having to have something to say. \n\nYou'll help a lot of people with your question, Jason.\n\nPeace.

question_title: All things change or evolve over time, should religion? [SEP] question_content: Why or why not?\n\nor...\n\nName something that hasn't changed since the beginning of time and/or before.\n\nI’m truly curious. [SEP] best_answer: Yes, it should, and it does.\n\nThe evolution of religion is a slow process which seems to change old religions out for new ones every 2000 years or so.  It seems to follow along with the astrological age for the time.\nIn the oldest written histories, from the Age of Taurus, we see gods who are very material oriented, very grounded in the Earth; an example would be the Egyptian gods from the times of the early Pharoes.  \nLater when the Age of Aries came around, we saw the old gods replaced by new gods, mostly war gods.  Great Empires rose up and conquored the world: Greece, and then Rome.\nStill later came the Age of Pisces, the one we're still in.  Pisces has seen the old gods replaced by the One God.  The dominant religions of the world today (Christianity & Islam) embody the archetype of Pisces in that it encourages its followers to blind obidence to church authority (or to the sheikh, for Muslims).  \nNow that the Age of Pisces is coming to a close, soon to be replaced with the Age of Aquarius, I expect to see a new religion come about and replace Christianity and Islam.  Based on what I know, I expect this new church to embody humanitarian ideals and place more value on individual expression than Christianity and Islam have; it will probably also be one worldwide church, or, perhaps, a worldwide federation of churches.

question_title: Why is it that we stopped using the gas chamber on people because it was deemed "cruel and unusual" punishment [SEP] question_content: but it's still ok to use in animal shelter. It's bad enough that we have to kill all these animals (most from irresponsible owners) but do they have to die such a horrible death? And can you imagine what that must do to shelter worker who have to put them in and listen to them die? It can't be good emotionally or psychologically? [SEP] best_answer: I'm no vet, nor do I know anything about the gas chambers used for animals. Its possible they might use a different gas for animals than they do for humans. However, when I took my budgie (who had a large tumour, and no quality of life) to the vet to be put down, they used gas to put him to sleep and then gave him a lethal injection.	Society & Culture

I mean, if I can put somebody in a little box, I don't have to look at him or her as an individual. I can then continue you be mentally lazy and blame others for my own bad feelings.

Like, do the women that have big and/or nice ones actually have implants? [SEP] best_answer: jimlive247 said:\n\n"Fake ones are usually round on the top and bottom, while real ones are not round on the top"\n\nThis is essentially not correct, because of a technicality-there are two types of implants- round and anatomical, or "teardrop shaped".\n\nWomen who want fullness at the top will opt for the round implants, and women who want real looking implants will opt for the teardrop shaped ones- teardrop shaped implants look just like real boobs- rounder and fuller on the bottom, with a concave top.\n\nAnother way to tell if boobs are fake is that when they jiggle, they will "slosh" at the top.\n\nI personally think only about 2-3% of boobs are implants for several reasons-\n\n1) it's expensive (around $8,000- $12,000 here in the States)\n2) Many people are afraid of surgery, including women.\n3) Time restraints.\n4) Opportunity restraints (no good surgeon in the area)\n\nJust my take.

question_title: What is the wicca religon? [SEP] question_content: I have always wondered. [SEP] best_answer: Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries, though most commonly in English-speaking cultures. Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act, by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner. He claimed that the religion, of which he was an initiate, was a modern survival of an old witch cult, which had existed in secret for hundreds of years, originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe. Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion. The veracity of Gardner's claims is now much debated, and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s. Since its founding, various related Wiccan traditions have evolved, or been adapted from, the form established by Gardner, which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca. These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs, rituals, and practices. Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated, however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary. Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca. you can find more information also in the address that i give you	Society & Culture

question_title: Do atheists feel that they have to keep quiet about their (non) beliefs in order to avoid problems ? [SEP] question_content: If you do, do you think this is fair that others can easily express thir beliefs and you can't without fear of repercussions ? [SEP] best_answer: Personally I haven't felt that way, but then again I've lived a pretty sheltered life.  I don't bring it up with people I'll only associate with for a few minutes because they'll have just enough time to look at me incredulously, make some sort of snarky comment and then walk away thinking of me as an idiot before I get the chance to say "and here's why" (because, of course, no one can ever just ACCEPT atheism... they always need justification UNLIKE people who believe in some way).  I don't discuss religion with many passing acquaintances so it's also not a big issue.\n\nAll of my friends and coworkers know I'm an atheist.  My family knows, my husband knows, and my son will know when he's old enough.  No one bothers me about it.\n\nThe only place I catch any flack about it is on the internet.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You mean like recent immigrants?  Well, if you mean like straight-off-the-boat immigrants that can't yet speak english, then that's probably because the kind of guys who chase them are hoping to cut down on pillow talk, or some stupid "macho" reasoning like that.  But it you mean, like, immigrants that have been here for a while...i'm not sure, it might be because the media usually portrays foreign men as the ultra-suave "love 'em and leave 'em" type.

question_title: If you feel that Jesus is really Jehovah God why didn't he just say that he was? [SEP] question_content: Why do you feel like God would want to fool us or have is confused?  Why isn't there any where in the Bible where Jesus said I am God?  And No quoting John 1:1 is not an answer.  Genesis 1:26 says "...Let us make man in our image..."  Us and Our are plural meaning more than one, right? Why instead when ones tried to praise Jesus he told them not to?  Another question if Jesus is God then who did he pray to?  Do you think that he prayed to himself? [SEP] best_answer: Who is crazy enough to say that they are one person?\nShame on them!!!	Society & Culture
question_title: Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much? Seems like a double standard.? [SEP] question_content: Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a "chocolate" city. [SEP] best_answer: From my perspective, it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term "offensive."  It has everything to do with wanting POWER.\n\nOne form or POWER is the "double standard," in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group cannot.  \n\nThere have been double standards since the dawn of time, and to this day, you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women.  \n\nA newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness, in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.\n\nWhen one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same, the first group "feels" a sense of control or power.  I say "feels" because any such quest for power, based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power.  it really changes nothing (at least in the short term).  About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target.  If you're motivated by guilt, it has worked.  \n\nIn the scheme of things, it's minor.  You can choose to fight it if you want, but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society, who has accepted, for whatever reason, the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced, not legally, but socially, via scorn, derision and ostracization.  That may mean losing friends, losing your job, or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers (or even your entire account).\n\nSo that's the way I see it.  And If the people who are trying to control the speech, be they black or female, or whatever, really look at it objectively, they can't help but admit that there's a grasp for a modicum of power involved.

question_title: what is the POINT of circomsition? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Directly Quoted:\nCircumcision substantially reduces an infant´s chances of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) during the first year of his life. Although the rate of urinary tract infections for infants is not very high (around xxx %), UTI´s are becoming increasingly difficult to treat (see here for a discussion). \nCancer of the penis - that effects xxx men in a thousand - is essentially eliminated in circumcised males. \nResearch shows that males who are circumcised have a lower risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, partners of circumcised males are less likely to contract vaginal infections (e.g. yeast infections). \nCircumcision eliminates foreskin infections that occur throughout childhood. \nCircumcision prevents phimosis, a narrow opening that makes it impossible to retract the foreskin at a later age. \nGenital hygiene is easier after circumcision. \nCircumcision virtually eliminates the accumulation of smegma.

question_title: Why Does The Goverment Care What Race WE Are? [SEP] question_content: Why does it really matter what race we seriously? Why is it so important what difference would it make, why are there minorities, why,why why are we labling people as minorities, they're all just people, people just look different and have a different skin color thats it, it's not like a white person can't have kids with a black person, this is getting out of hand i think some one  should speak up to the goverment and put an end to asking what race are we, theres no point to it really. [SEP] best_answer: In my honest and humble opinion... I think the government is doing it to avoid a law suit or being labeled as prejudice themselves. The government isn't the ones that said hey im being discriminated against because of my race or nationality it is a few squeaky wheels that messed with the cog so much our government had no choice but to acknowledge there is a difference in skin tones. Its scary that people always blame someone else often our government for their short comings rather than accept that they aren't perfect, learn from their mistakes, move on, and try to become better people by learning from their mistakes.\n\n\nHave a GREAT day!

question_title: Shouldn't Religion and Sprituality be in this section? [SEP] question_content: Do we really need two sections for the same subject? Isn't it confusing?

Mythology is basically religious and/or spiritual stories meant to teach, which is basically what everything from the Bible to the tales of Zeus, Jupiter, Odin, etc. etc. are.  But folklore is not always religious, so that I would not put under Religion and Spirituality, necesarily. If you did split them up, I would put Mythology under Religion and Spirituality and Folklore maybe under Books and Authors.	Society & Culture

question_title: How do you know that your spouse is a manipulator? [SEP] question_content: It seems I would like to get out of my relationship,but everytime I find that reason he turns it around and makes me feel that I am in the wrong.  Like him being bi, he said that it is all in my head.  He blames ms for him not wanting to have sex.  Are there other people out there that are too nice and feel guilty for leaving?   I am sooo frustrated. [SEP] best_answer: At the end of the day, you have to put yourself first. That can be easier said than done, but you do yourself no favours by staying in a relationship that causes you unhappiness. When you do eventually walk away, you will soon realise that it was a good decision, and you will feel better for it. In fact, you will wonder why you did not do it before. No good person wants to break a relationship, but no bad relationship is worth the suffering of a good person. It is your goodness that he is exploiting, but he probably does it unknowingly, because he is not well. I imagine that he needs help, but professional help, and that there is nothing that he will let you do for him. Maybe your departure will alert him to his defects. Let's hope so.	Society & Culture

The next day the State Trooper and tow truck driver both called me at home to tell me that they had gone to look at my rig during the daylight.

[SEP] best_answer: For the same reason that so many Christians try to convert not only atheists, but followers of other faiths. \n\nIf one is so convinced that one is correct, there will be that tendency to spread one's beliefs.\n\nAlso, I'd question your use of the term "always".

[SEP] question_content: It can be Christmas, thanksgiving, whatever holiday you celebrate  just let it be funny [SEP] best_answer: We were having Thanksgiving Dinner a few years ago and we had the whole gang of about 20 people around.  My husband's Dad who was about 95 at the time and who had had recent chemotherapy for cancer all of a sudden got ill at the table and vomited into his napkin.  I quickly grabbed his napkin took it to the kitchen sink, shook it out and rinsed it out really good.  I then turned on the garbage disposal and all of a sudden there was this horrendous racket in the garbage disposal.  I turned it off and reached down into it and pulled out a very mangled set of false teeth. I screeched , oh my and everyone crowded around me and we all started to giggle, even though it really was not entirely funny.  We gave grandpa back his false teeth and he put them back in but they were totally missing teeth.  We all tried not to laugh but it really was a bit humorous. We will all never forget that moment.  Dad has passed on now about 7 years ago but that moment will live on and be passed on to future generations.	Society & Culture

If he had, he wouldn't be good enough for God - according to the [SEP] question_content: Bible:\n\n Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron that in all future generations, his descendants who have physical defects will not qualify to offer food to their God.  No one who has a defect may come near to me, whether he is blind or lame, stunted or deformed, or has a broken foot or hand, or has a humped back or is a dwarf, or has a defective eye, or has oozing sores or scabs on his skin, or has damaged testicles.  Even though he is a descendant of Aaron, his physical defects disqualify him from presenting offerings to the LORD by fire.  Since he has a blemish, he may not offer food to his God.  However, he may eat from the food offered to God, including the holy offerings and the most holy offerings.  Yet because of his physical defect, he must never go behind the inner curtain or come near the altar, for this would desecrate my holy places.  I am the LORD who makes them holy."

[SEP] question_content: my brother is hardly God damn obsessed in a certain sport here in our place and he never stop watchin a t v show w/c airs his favorite sport and he is going nuts! [SEP] best_answer: I think the "spell" you are looking for is called "reverse psychology".  The more you let go of your reaction to his obsession, the less it will be one.  Some ideas:\n\n(0) Ask yourself why is this conflict happening?\nWhy are you sharing a place? Is this a sign that you need to get separate places? Who pays the rent? If you pay more, you make the rules. If he doesn't like it, he can leave.  If you'd rather leave, why not? Could be advantages to having your own place.\n\n(1) Does he normally go through an obsession, burn out, and go on to another?  If this is his pattern, let him OD on it and get over it faster.  \n\n(2) Anytime he sits down to watch, invite people over to "enjoy" it with him, who he doesn't want to share it with.  He will go somewhere instead.  \n\n(3) Is the enthusiasm a true interest? If so, does he have any other friends to share it with? Encourage him to take turns enjoying at friends' houses, at least 50-50, if not rotating the days of the week. That will reduce your turn to host it in your place.\n\nOverall, sounds like he needs more of a social life. If he has nothing else to do, he is projecting all his emotional needs on this one joy he has discovered.  Either let him have his joy, or ask friends of his to help him share it in other ways or other places.\n\nAs for you, what do you want and where would you rather be? if you can occupy your mind with more engaging things than his sports obsession, you won't notice or care as much where his mind is. What are your goals? What creative projects would you like to pursue? Think of your interests, and don't worry about his.	Society & Culture

Where are their parents? This really shocks me... [SEP] best_answer: There has been a decline in general American morality that is especially evident in the media. Millions of people watch Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy, for example, including children. These shows abound with adultery and the fallacious concept that being in love merits sexual activity.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No and yes.\n\nHow was James, “the brother of the Lord,” (Matt. 13:55, Acts 15:13-21, 1 Cor. 15:7, Gal. 1:19) related to Jesus? All believers agree he was related, but no one knows exactly how.\n\nThe possibilities are that James was:\n\n1. A full brother of Jesus, another Son of God born of the Blessed Virgin Mary. No one to my knowledge accepts that God had another child by the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n2. A half-brother of Jesus, a younger son of Joseph and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Some Christians believe this possibility but most Christians including those who are Catholic and Eastern Orthodox believe that Mary remained a virgin for her entire life.\n\n3. A stepbrother of Jesus, a son of Joseph and a previous wife. Many Christians believe that Joseph had a least one previous marriage that resulted in children.\n\n4. A stepbrother of Jesus, an adopted son of Joseph and the Blessed Virgin Mary. When parents died, relatives frequently took their children in and raised them as thier own. An adopted orphaned boy would be considered the brother of Jesus.\n\n5. A cousin of Jesus. The Aramaic language has no word for cousin. Aramaic frequently uses the word “aha,” which we translate into Greek as “adelphos” or English as brother, for cousin.\n\n6. A comrade of Jesus. This is a remote possibility. Greek uses adelphos the same as English does in “a band of brothers.” \n\nPossibilities 1 and 2 obviously go against Catholic beliefs.\n\nThe Catholic Church prefers possibility 5 but 3, 4 and 6 would not go against doctrine. \n\nWith love in Christ.

question_title: Why do Hispanics have trouble coming OUT to their families? [SEP] question_content: I think my brother in law is gay and he dosen't accept it, nor would he ever come out to his family. Hispanic familes are so close, so why is it hard for them to come out? [SEP] best_answer: I think that because it's a very tight-knit family it is hard. You always aim to make your parents proud, and hispanics grow up in a religious, Catholic setting in most instances. I know growing up that there were extreme homophobic undertones at most family gatherings. When my cousin came out as bi they were extremely nice to her face but were so cruel behind her back and told their children to stay away. You can usually sense the dislike there and family especially extended family seems so much closer and in your business, they tell your parents things and try to get you to straighten up their kids. One uncle asked me, "How many girlfriends do you have in college?" I said, "None." and his reply: "You're not becoming a fag are you?" Just too machismo.	Society & Culture

question_title: why are rama and krishna not mentioned as historical kings? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They are mentioned as Historical figure and accepted as our ancestors in India.\n\nThe fact is that history of India has been written by christian s in last 200 years and then by communists. They really challenged everything about ancient India be it Rama and Krishna or other achievements of India.\n\nDo you really think people who made up myth of Aryan race and its invasion in an attempt to propagate that even Hindus are aliens in India would ever accept Rama or Krishna as historical figures?\n\nBy the way Dwarika , ruins of the city of Krishna has been found again under the city.\n\nThe first clear historical record is dated 574 A.D. and occurs in the Palitana Plates of Samanta Simhaditya. This inscription refers to Dwaraka as the capital of the western coast of Saurashtra and still more important, states that Sri Krishna lived here. The establishment of one of the four of his pithas at Dwaraka by Sankaracharya attests to the great religious sanctity the place must have attained by the eighth century A.D. \n\nAnd now the scientists at NIOT (National Institute of Ocean Technology, of the Department of Ocean Development) have established this. While working for British gas in the Gulf of Cambay region, a few years ago, the scientists of the NIOT, were stunned to see images of objects and things, completely alien to the marine domain. Immediately a team swung into action and samples were collected and sent for analysis and dating (it is usually done to scientifically establish the antiquity of the excavated objects).\n\nSamples collected include artefacts, wood pieces, pottery materials, hearth pieces, animal bones. They ere sent to Manipur University, Oxford University, London, Institute of Earth Sciences, Hanover, Germany for analysis and dating. The results were astonishing. It was found beyond doubt that the samples belonged to a period varying from 7800 to 3000 years (BP) Before Present !\nhttp://www.atributetohinduism.com/Dwaraka.htm\n\nThe recently discovered bridge currently named as Adam's Bridge made of chain of shoals, c.18 mi (30 km) long, in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka, reveals a mystery behind it. The bridge's unique curvature and composition by age reveals that it is man made. The legends as well as Archeological studies reveal that the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the a primitive age, about 17,50,000 years ago and the bridge's age is also almost equivalent. This information is a crucial aspect for an insight into the mysterious legend called Ramayana, which was supposed to have taken place in tredha yuga (more than 17,00,000 years ago). In this epic, there is a mentioning about a bridge, which was built between Rameshwaram (India) and Sri lankan coast under the supervision of a dynamic and invincible figure called Rama who is supposed to be the incarnation of the supreme. This information may not be of much importance to the archeologist s who are interested in exploring the origins of man, but it is sure to open the spiritual gates of the people of the world to have come to know an ancient history linked to the Indian mythology.

question_title: how has kumina impacted on the society? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Kumina is the most African of Jamaican cults. Kumina ceremonies are usually associated with wakes and entombments, but can also be performed at births, anniversaries and thanksgivings. During a Kumina ceremony the exponents call upon their ancestral spirits. The dance and music are two of the Kumina's strong features - the drum playing an integral part in this dance ritual. \n\nKumina is both the religion and the music practiced by the people of eastern Jamaica. These people have retained the drumming and dancing of the Bantu-speaking peoples of the Congo. Like the Kongo practitioners from Cuba, they have kept a large amount of the Kongo language alive. In the Americas there are many Kongo-derived religions still being practiced today.\n\nOne main aspects of Kongo religion is the practice of bringing down spirits of the dead to briefly inhabit the bodies of the faithful. The purpose of this is so that the ancestors may share their wisdom, providing spiritual assistance and advice to those here on Earth. Without exception, all such faiths in the Americas retain this central feature of Kongo faith.\n\nAt a "real Kumina" one can expect just about anything, as one of the aspects of Kumina is "being possessed by the spirits of the dead". Anyone can become possessed and there is no limit as to how many spirits can enter an individual. At this point the possessed person enters into a trance called the Maya.\n\nSo, to answer your question, one of its impacts on society today, especially in Jamaica, is the promotion of the false teaching about spirits of the dead.

question_title: Is it important to always be honest? [SEP] question_content: I'm trying out a total honesty policy at the moment. The only problem is do people always want to hear the truth? [SEP] best_answer: Immanuel Kant (a famous philosopher) said it is crucial to be honest because lying is the worst thing a person can do. This is because our society is built on trust.  All the time we trust people not to do curtain things (like blow-up the place you are in).  If you lie, you break down the trust that keep society together and if people lie to much, society will crumble to nothing.  For me sometimes you have to lie, but most time it is good to be honest.

question_title: I need evidence against ghosts. Can someone help me? [SEP] question_content: I am in a debate and I am supposed to be against ghosts. I need "evidende" against them. PLEASE HELP! [SEP] best_answer: Try this:  Based on the number of souls that have died over the centuries, ghosts, if they existed, shouldn't be hard to find at all.  Point out that on the Travel channel's "Most Haunted" series where a crew goes to a new 'most haunted' place every week they never have captured a ghost on video!  Nor has the Sci-Fi channel's "Ghost Hunters" series.  You may want to point out that if ghosts exist that it would be logical for them to appear on security cameras and surveilence cameras all the time...but this seems to never happen.  Sylvia Browne appears weekly on the Montel Williams show and tells people on the show that she sees their deceased loved ones "standing right beside them".  But the cameras never catch anything, nor do the microphones.

[SEP] best_answer: Definitely, thank her for her rapid response and all her hard work. You could comment on how people such as herself make it easier to decide such a difficult decision such as where to go to college. You could say that her thoughtfulness has assured you that you have made the right decision. Administration either makes or breaks a college, trust me I have three degrees.

question_title: What is wrong with Scientology? [SEP] question_content: It seems a lot of people don't like it.  Why? [SEP] best_answer: It is a CULT. Despite what a few fanatical members may say, it IS a cult. The church harasses and bullies anyone who they deem an "enemy" (basically anyone who has anything negative to say about the "church"). They will RUIN YOUR LIFE if you speak out against them long enough.\n\nThe founder is L. Ron Hubbard, the science FICTION writer who once told a friend that the best way to make lots of money is to start your own religion. Though being a very outspoken critic of psychiatric drugs, it was discovered upon Hubbards death that the anti-anxiety drug hydroxyzine (Vistaril) was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric and pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years. (link to page explaining what hydroxyzine is: http://www.drugs.com/MTM/V/Vistaril.html )\n\nScientologists believe the evil alien ruler Xenu killed a lot of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by bringing them to earth & blowing them up inside volcanoes. They believe the souls of these aliens (called "Body Thetans") have attached themselves to us & cause many of our mental & physical ills. Even members of the Church of Scientology who know of Xenu will publicly deny the existence of Xenu & Body Thetans, or attempt to minimize their importance. Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress. Many who remain at lower levels in the church are unaware of much of the these doctrines, which mostly begin at Operating Thetan level three, or "OT III". Because the information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked. OT III recipients must sign a waiver promising never to reveal its secrets before they are given the manila envelope containing the Xenu knowledge.\n\nTo rid ourselves of "Body Thetans" and also “engrams” (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind) so that we can become “clear”, we have to go through "auditing" with a member of the “church” who uses an "e-meter" to measure our “reactive mind”... & we have to pay lots and lots of money for “auditing” (purchased in 12.5-hour blocks, costing anywhere from $750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions) and to take courses on Scientology to advance to higher “levels” in the “church”. The “church” has also taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional in everyday life. They deny the reality of chemical imbalance & profound mental disturbance & accordingly do NOTHING to effectively stabilize the dangerously unstable. The “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from member (with deadly results).\n\nScientology is undeniably a cult. For more information on what a cult is & what their damaging effects are, please visit the link provided at the bottom of the sources. Just know that Scientology DOES qualify by meeting these 5 criteria:\n\n(1) It uses psychological coercion to recruit, indoctrinate & retain its members. (2) It forms an elitist totalitarian society. (3) Its founder leader is self-appointed, dogmatic, messianic, not accountable & has charisma. (4) It believes 'the end justifies the means' in order to solicit funds & recruit people.

question_title: Do Scientologist take their kids and themselfs to the doctor and do they vaccinet their children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Of course.\nI have a really good medical Dr. \nScientology is about a persons spiritual nature. It's basic principle is that YOU are your own immortal soul. Dianetics which came out about a year before Sccientolgy was founded, is about "what the soul is doing to the body" and addresses spititually caused unwnted physical and emotional problems.\nHowever, if a Scientologist needs medical treatment or a medical exam they go to a medical Dr. Dianetics is not medical treatment and is in no way intended as a substitute for it.\nThe issue of child vaccination is one of personal parental choice.In fact any parent has the right not to get their children vaccinated for reasons of conscience.\n Both my kids got all their shots, however, I personally am not certain of the true validity of child vacinations, and even medical Drs have expressed doubts as to whether introducing a weakened strain of some disease causing mico organism into a childs body at a young age to promote immunity, (which is what a vaccination basically is) may not have more overall negative effects than positive. There are certainly plenty of actual cases where this has infact been the result.	Society & Culture

question_title: How long will it be? [SEP] question_content: Before all Christian buildings and churches in the UK are asked to remove Crucifix or Crosses to avoid upsetting a certain minority in this country,and don,t say it wont happen as some churches have already been taken over and the crosses have been removed and replaced with other symbols.PAX. [SEP] best_answer: "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.'" (1 Cor 1 18-19). For two thousand years people have jeered at the cross, but it is our only means of salvation and should be honoured on Christian buildings.  Yours is a good question and the day may come when the crazy authorities running our country might order the removal of crosses from churches.  Let us hope that Christians will have the courage to refuse.	Society & Culture

question_title: why isnt there any king in england? [SEP] question_content: when the king dies the prince becomes king correct? [SEP] best_answer: When the King dies, the eldest child becomes sovereign. If the king has a son, then they become King, if he has only daughters then the eldest daughter becomes Queen.\n\nThere is no King at the moment because the Queen inherited the throne in 1952. When her father became King in 1936 he had two daughters, the present Queen and Princess Margaret. As he had no sons, his eldest child inherited. \n\nThis will be the case when the Queen dies, Prince Charles, as her eldest child, will become King. However, should Charles predecease the Queen then Prince William will suceed. Should Prince William have no children, after his death, Prince Harry becomes King. \n\nAt present, male primogeniture exists, therefore should Prince William have a daughter and later a son, the son will take precedence to inherit the throne. \n\nPrince Charles' sister Princess Anne (the Princess Royal) was second in line to the throne until the birth of Prince Andrew (the Duke of York) and Prince Edward (the Earl of Wessex). Despite Princess Anne being older than Andrew and Edward, because they are male, they take precedence in the line of succession.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Hi, \nI have cable internet from Comcast, they installed a wireless router during my installation but the router is terrible. I want to upgrade my router by buying the best router on the market. However, all the routers on the market don't have a cable outlet on the back like the one I have, although almost all wireless routers out there claim to work with both cable and dsl. So my question is how do I get these routers to work with cable without having a cable outlet on the back? Is there an adapter? [SEP] best_answer: I have three PC's networked with a wireless router at home. (Netgear 54Mbps Wireless ADSL Firewall Router). This router is a combination of five products - ADSL 2 +modem+router+firewall+802.11g access point and a four port Ethernet switch.\n\nTwo of the comps are wireless connected, while one is wired. The wireless connected PC's have a wireless antenna each that receives the signals.\n\nHas the installation and configuration been done correctly?\nWhy not ask your new router vendor to look into the problem?\n\nAs far as the cable outlets are concerned, the jack has to crimped on to the wire and then connected, else use an adaptor. Repeat for this too Why not ask your new router vendor to look into the problem?\n\n(My arrangement cost me about Rs.6000/- in India, that's about US$130 to 150/- and included free installation by the vendor, including a wire of 5 meter (15 feet) Length and matching jacks at each end - that's about 9 months ago.)\nst\n\nAll da best!

question_title: Why am I receiving "returned" e-mails from people I never e-mailed to start with?

Spoofing is where someone uses your email address as the address on an email they sent to others. Difficult to defend against.\n\nAnother possiblity is that you have a computer virus that has taken over your email address book, but then the emails would come from people that were in your address book. You should use an antivirus software program at all times. Just in case you might want to do a virus scan of your computer.	Computers & Internet

AVG has detetcted the problem but cant rectify it.I also tried Avast but it also couldnt detect JS/psyme.I did a full scan still the problem is same.Please help. [SEP] best_answer: Start your pc in safe mode, generally as soon as you turn on the pc you hit the key combination F8 and choose safe mode. Don't be scared, it's supposed to look this weird. Safe mode runs the bare minimum, which is why you want to remove problem programs in it, they can't hide in safe mode like they can during normal start up. Then run your virus software. This should remove it. If not completely then you need to go to the trendmicro or symantec web site for further instructions. & try hitting it with the programs I listed below.\n\nFor future reference:\n\nAlways make sure your Window’s is completely updated, along with Office and Internet Explorer (if you insist on using it – version 6 is the worst so far for known issues).\n\nUse a firewall, zone alarm is free & pretty user friendly. & get the following products.\n\nGet Spybot Search & Destroy by Patrick Kolla Great free program for finding spyware. Don't be cheap, give the guy a donation.\n\nAd aware by lavasoft is free for personal use.\n\nwww.ewido.net - free after 30 days, limitation is that you have to manually update.\n\nhttp://www.superantispyware.com is free.\n\n& dump Internet Explorer. It's got more holes than swiss cheese. Get firefox, it has some really great add on extensions that block scripts, pop-up's & more ... & it's free. Depending on how you access the internet (some programs like Yahoo dsl, & Netzero try to force you to use Internet Explorer) just click on your Firefox icon to surf the web not Internet Explorer.\n\nYou can stop most programs from loading by using "msconfig". It's not on XP so you have to download it from a site such as perfectdrivers. Most programs beyond firewalls and virus protection do not need to run at start up. It's too bad that "Blackvipers" site is still down. He had an incredible list of how to stop unwanted and unneeded services in 2k & XP from running & slowing pc down. It is however still being posted on sites, so google his name.\n\nHijack this is a great program to see what programs are doing on your pc. Generally, you don’t need most of those programs. Hijack this has a lot of information about what is safe to disable & what is not safe. In general, you don’t need the vast majority beyond programs that have to run at start up, your web browser page of choice, virus protection & firewall hooks.\n\nHope I helped. & don't forget --> Just because you have protection doesn't mean it will work if you don't keep it updated & run it once a week. Just think of all the time you'll save not trying to repair a virus infection! It’s a lot of information but once you run through it & play with it it’s pretty simple.\n\nhttp://www.michaelhorowitz.com/removespyware.html	Computers & Internet

question_title: What is the technical difference between a vlog and a vodcast? [SEP] question_content: I know that a "vlog" is a video-based blog and a vodcast is a video-based podcast.  But when it comes down to it, aren't they the exact same content? [SEP] best_answer: A vlog is a weblog which uses video as its primary presentation format. It is primarily a medium for distributing video content. Vlog posts are usually accompanied by text, image, and additional meta data to provide a context or overview for the video. Vlogs or videoblogs are created by vloggers or videobloggers, while the act itself is referred to as vlogging or videoblogging. \n\nVODcast is an emerging term derived from the audio "podcast" and video.\n\nThey are essentially the same thing; although, vodcasts are distributed just like podcasts distributed.

question_title: C Programming? [SEP] question_content: I m having trouble to find even, odd, and prime numbers with this question...\n\nIn this program you must use nested loops to print out the following details for each number from\n3 to 100:\n\n• Is it even or odd?\n• Is it prime?\n\nA number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and 1. So 3 is a prime, because it is only\ndivisible by 3 and 1. But 4 is not a prime, because it is divisible by 2. [SEP] best_answer: Well, I can tell you - you don't have enough in your program to answer the question.  I won't do your homework for you - but this is what you need.\n1) Remember that when divide two integers you ALWAYS get an integer.  FOr example 5/2 is 2!  \n2) So, use this fact to test for even.  In other words take the number and divide by 2.  Now take the answer and multiply by 2.  If that result is the original number you have an even.\n\nExample:\n7/2 = 3.  3*2 = 6, 6 is not 7 so odd.\n12/2 = 6  6*2 =12.  12 is original number so even.\nFor primes all you really need to go up to is the square root of the number.  If you have not found a factor by then you won't!\nExample...\n49....1, 7, 49  7 is the square root of 49.  You cannot think of a number who has BOTH factors larger than the square root of that number.  One of them HAS to be smaller than the square root.\nExample:\n100.  Square root is 10.  You cannot think of two numbers larger than 10 (call them a, b).  Such that a*b = 100.  They both must be 10 or ONE of them has to be smaller than 10!\n\nSo, now hopefully you can do your homework!\n\nGet busy! :D	Computers & Internet

question_title: I heard MacBook Pro's become very very hot and you can't put them in your lap, but what if I have a cushion? [SEP] question_content: My laptop is dead and gone, so I'm getting a new one either a Apple Laptop or Sony Vaio Laptop,and I've mainly decided to make the switch from Windows to Mac OS, and get a MacBook Pro 1.83GHz, but I heard it gets quite hot after awhile, I don't intend on keeping it in my lap every second of the day, but i'd like to now and then, so if I place a cushion or pillow between me and the MBP will I be alright?\nAlso, I have a wooden table, it won't burn through it or anything right?\nI heard a firmware update helps the overheating, is this true?\nAnd also, are the sound issues fixed? Sound isn't a problem for me, but my family might get disturbed by it. [SEP] best_answer: I have a MacBook Pro 2.0GHz/256 VRAM with 2 GB RAM, 100 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive, and a Superdrive.  Yeah, it gets hot, but from my experience, it depends on my surroundings.  At home, it's gets warm and stays warm just a few minutes after I wake it up, but at school, i can keep it going and it stays pretty cool.  I've also used it outside in shade with a good breeze.  It stayed pretty cool then.  Pillows block the airflow to the bottom and also insulate the heat...not a good idea.  I'm currently using a piece of wood cut close to the size of the machine, but my dad has a plastic laptop holder thing that he got from the Sharper Image store. The wood seems to hold the heat, but the plastic seemed to keep everything cool.	Computers & Internet

question_title: which desktop enviromrt should i use gnome or kde or xfce? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are confused about choosing which is better then don't get confused it depends totally on your needs...\n\nYour need for speed:\n\nOne of the big differences between the GUI is the relative workload they put on your system. The more a GUI has goodies, features and eye candies, the more it will need power to run properly and the slower it will be.\nKDE and Gnome are two of the most developed, and heavy, GUI available for Linux. Thus, if speed is of prime importance for you (for example, you want the maximum of power to run a task or you have a slow PC), you may be better to use a lightweight GUI, like IceWM, Fluxbox or Afterstep. In other word, the lighter your GUI is, the faster your overall system will be...\n\nWhich applications are you using?\n\nThe fact is that some applications just run better in one GUI than others.\nKDE and Gnome are based on a different set of programming libraries and tools (named GTK for Gnome and Qt for KDE). Thus, it's easy to understand that applications designed and based on the same GTK libraries than Gnome will work better under Gnome than under KDE. And the reverse will be true for applications based on  Qt.\nSo, it may be better to use the GUI that works best with your applications. If don't know the libraries used by your applications, just try them with different GUI and see if it makes any significant difference. For some applications it will, for others it won't. Thus, your favourite applications may help you determine which GUI you should use.\n\nConviviality and ease of use:\nThis point is more a personal choice, some peoples may find that KDE is convivial and easy to use, but others will be overwhelm with the hundreds of features and options... The choice is up to you, each GUI is, more or less, easy to use, you just have to make the best choice for you...\nHowever, if you're familiar with Windows, you may feel more at ease with Gnome or KDE, which are similar, than with a less classic GUI (like Enlightenment for example).\n\nThe default GUI of your distribution:\nAll distribution give preferential support and integration to one or several GUI. If you have Mandrake, both KDE and Gnome are equally supported. But Red Hat never hides their preference for Gnome, and SuSe for KDE...\nAll other things being equal, it may be a good idea to use your distribution's favourite GUI. It will be less hassle since it's the default installation and configuration. Integration and the "polish" will also be better, default settings being usually just fine. It's also easier to get support, since most peoples using this distribution will use the default GUI.\n\nYour need for eye candies:\nAll the GUI have a different look, some are gorgeous with lot of effects, font anti-aliasing, nice icons, and all kind of goodies, others look pale and simple in comparison. The choice between these two extremes is only a matter of personal preferences. Some will prefer a GUI with lot of eye candies, others just want a clean desktop on a simple background. None is better than the other, it's up to you to make your choice...\n\nFinal words:\n\nWith these points in mind, you should now be more able to choose a GUI. However, remember that choosing a GUI doesn't mean that you have to stick with it for the rest of your life! Nothing prevents you to install many GUI on your system. Then you choose the one you want when you log in. You may choose the GUI that's the most appropriate for the task...	Computers & Internet

question_title: who invented the Internet? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Creation of the Internet\nMain article: History of the Internet \nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik spurred the U.S. to create the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead. DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the "eve" network of today's Internet. In December of 1970, Charles A. Petrik contacted the U.S. Navy and suggested that a special communications network, that the Department of Defense had built for use in the possiblitity of a nuclear attack, could also be used during peace time. Petrik convinced the military to connect the computers of the U.S. National Laboratories for scientific research purposes, and to allow these labs to get data to other labs faster, and safer.\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by 1 January 1983 , when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. (This date is held by some to be technically that of the birth of the Internet.) It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nThe network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN, which straddles the border between France and Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN (which was set up by international treaty and not bound by the laws of either France or Switzerland). In 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign released the Mosaic web browser version 1.0, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word "Internet" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.

question_title: How do you connect an F type plug to the coaxial cable? Is there more than one type of F plug? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are asking how to connect an F connector to a bare end coax cable then the answer is usually with a crimper.  What type of crimper depends on what type of F connector you have.  Some use side crimps that actually pinch the connector onto the cable, some actually screw onto the cable, and the last and most often used by professional installers is the compression fitted connectors requiring, you guessed it, a compression crimper.  You should be able to pick up many of these at your local hardware store or radio shack.  I will tell you though that the compression tool itself can be quite expensive, I've seen anywhere from $50 to $100 and the actual connectors usually run about $1 to $2 each, and these can be harder to find.  Unless you are looking to run alot of cable, it might be better to find someone, like a local satellite installer, to make some cables for you.	Computers & Internet

question_title: How to suppress/delete pop-up ads (embedded in the system?)? [SEP] question_content: Every time I boot my system, a pop-up ad of Citibank comes up. I suspect it might be bringing virus also, as intrusion efforts are detected thereafter. Is the ad embedded somewhere, like a program etc, so that it can be deleted? [SEP] best_answer: By going through this problem one can suspect the same which u said. \n\nThere are few checks u can make\n1. Go to add/remove programmes in control panel and check if any unlnown programme installed there. IF u find one remove it.\n\n2. U can block the programme appearing at start-up. For That go to <start>/<run> and write "msconfig" u will see a small window then select the "startup" tab and see the list of programmes which get activated once u boot the pc. try to find any entry which u dont want to run and uncheck it. Apply the settings\n\nI hope this will do.	Computers & Internet
question_title: Need help about Sata II mode hdds? [SEP] question_content: I have a single sata II maxtor @ 120 gb. I wish to add another one to make a sata II hdd. I know the 2 hdds must be identicall at size , but it must be maxtor both of them? And how do i make this sata II mode (something about ride mode i guess). Please help me on this one, beacuase i need to know if i should buy another hdd of 120 gb or i should give up about this sata II and use another one as a separated device. [SEP] best_answer: You can't "make" a hard drive an SATA2 drive.  It either was SATA2 when you bought it, or it wasn't.  You're talking about RAID 0, which can be done with either SATA1 or SATA2 drives.\n\nRAID will make a definite difference in throughput, but those weren't fast drives to begin with.  I'd recommend you spend $95 on a drive that's almost 3 times as big, and roughly 3x as fast: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148140  Then, just use the Maxtor as either a spare drive, or as additionaly storage space.

question_title: Question about Windows XP Pro.? [SEP] question_content: I need to know what files to delete, to uninstall XP. I am trying to erase the HDD, so I can install a new copy. Also, which format takes up more space, FAT32 or NFTS ? [SEP] best_answer: If you chose to keep your old Windows installation and the FAT32 file system, you should be able to uninstall Windows XP. Please see "Sources".\n\nIn case you do not have an option to uninstall Windows, back-up all your important files onto CDR/CDRW/DVDR/'another hard disk'/'other forms of memory', (create a boot floppy as described in next paragraph,) format your hard disk, and install the version of Windows you want.\n\nWindows XP's CD is always bootable, so you won't require a boot floppy. I assume it must be the same for 2000, but for 9x, most probably you will need a boot floppy. After you finish backing up, insert a blank floppy and (from within XP) format it as a start-up disk. To format,\n-Open My Computer (in your new XP Start menu).\n-Right-click the floppy drive icon.\n-Select "Format".\n-Put a tick mark in the check box named "Create an MS-DOS startup disk".\n-Click "Start" button (the one in the Format dialog box)\nOnly then should you format your hard disk.\n\nI'm not sure of FAT32 taking up more space, but if you use NT/2000/XP, then it is highly recommended that you try your best in sticking to NTFS. Check out the Sources for some information regarding the two file systems.\n_______\nViva La Dvorak! - www.dvzine.org	Computers & Internet
question_title: differentiate vcd to dvd? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: VCD (also called video CD, video compact disc or "disc") is a compact disk format based on CD-ROM XA that is specifically designed to hold MPEG-1 video data and to include interactive capabilities. VCD has a resolution similar to that of VHS, which is far short of the resolution of DVD. Each VCD disk holds 72-74 minutes of video and has a data transfer rate of 1.44 Mbps. VCDs can be played on a VCD player connected to a television set (in the same way that video cassettes can on a VCR) or computer, on a CD-i player, on some CD-ROM drives, and some DVD players.\n\nDVD Short for digital versatile disc or digital video disc,  a type of optical disk technology similar to the CD-ROM. A DVD holds a minimum of 4.7GB of data, enough for a full-length movie. DVDs are commonly used as a medium for digital representation of movies and other multimedia presentations that combine sound with graphics.\n\nThe DVD specification supports disks with capacities of from 4.7GB to 17GB and access rates of 600KBps to 1.3 MBps. One of the best features of DVD drives is that they are backward-compatible with CD-ROMs, meaning they can play old CD-ROMs, CD-I disks, and video CDs, as well as new DVD-ROMs. Newer DVD players can also read CD-R disks.

question_title: Are we being manipulated? [SEP] question_content: Yahoo Answers gives "points" for doing things, then limits the rate at which you can earn points by limiting the number of questions you can answer in a day, the number of questions you can ask in a day, and the number of questions for which you can vote for the best answer.  Is this psychological manipulation? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, there's certainly a psychological aspect to it - if you could do everything you wanted to, you'd be more likely to show up once, spend a long time, and then never come back. By making you spread out your involvement over a few days, it makes it more likely that you'll continue to return.\n\nAlso, limiting the number of actions is a good anti-spam feature - if someone turns out to be a poor user, then the amount of damage they can do is limited by time, which gives more time to catch them and shut down their account.

What can I do to fix this?  \nJust a note:  My laptop doesn't have a cd-rom so I copied the files to the laptop drive via a USB adapter from my desktop.\nScandisk finds no errors on the drive either. [SEP] best_answer: Go into your CMOS and check its settings, just because it is capable of going 133 MHz, does not mean it is set to go that fast.  If you cannot up the speed in your CMOS, if it is not set correctly, you will have to get a manual so you can adjust the jumpers.\n\nThis also could be being cause by how you are installing it, you might want to purchase or borrow an external drive and use that for the installation.\n\nJohn B.

[SEP] best_answer: virtual dub or tmpgenc ...easy is reletive to ur experience ... simply replacing the audio with music should be simple enough but you'll need a music editor to like adobe audition to get music the right length and format and splice it into the movie soundtrack ... overlapping the movie soundtrack with music will be more complicated and somthing like fruity loops would probably be best... free is relative to ur filesharing experience :)	Computers & Internet

question_title: what are some symptoms of colon cancer? [SEP] question_content: i think my husband might have colon cancer. he complains that he feels like he has go to the bathroom but doesnt need to, throws up every night, tired/weak, stomach hurts alot and little blood in toilet. could that be what it is or something else? [SEP] best_answer: 1. You're pooping more or less often.\nThe presence of a tumor in your bowel throws things off. As your body tries to adjust to its presence, demands, and byproducts, you may experience changes in your bathroom habits. For example, let's say a tumor is slowly growing in your colon, inhibiting the flow of solid waste. You may or may not notice that you're defecating less often.\n\nBut if the tumor gets large enough, it may become very difficult for your poop to get by it and you'll end up constipated. Sound like a crap shoot? (No pun intended.) The tumor may obstruct your bowel. You may notice a difference. You may get constipated.\n\nThat's why, in general, it's best to get regular screenings rather than rely on symptoms to alert you to the presence of the cancer.\n\n\n2. Your stool is thinner than usual.\nImagine a three-lane tunnel full of cars, all driving through with a nice, steady flow. Now imagine that two big rigs decide to block the left lanes in tandem... then they slow to a stop. Both of them. Blocking both left lanes. What do the cars do? They start filing to the right so they can get around the obstruction.\n\nThe same sort of thing happens in the bowel. Everything is flowing fine and dandy until a tumor starts to grow, causing an obstruction. As the obstruction gets bigger, the space around it gets smaller. So, as you might expect, tumors toward the "tunnel exit" tend to cause this effect of narrowed stool.\n\n\n3. You have stomach cramping or bloating.\n\nBloating may be the result of a bowel obstruction. Cramping may be caused by constipation or diarrhea. In more advanced stages of colorectal cancer, severe abdominal cramping may be caused by the tumor perforating (poking through) the bowel wall.\n\n\n4. There's bright red blood in or on your poop.\nTumors tend to bleed. Not a whole lot and not constantly, but they do bleed. As a result, some of that blood may be found in your stool. If the tumor is in the right colon, the blood will most likely be dried and virtually invisible by the time the poop leaves the body. However, if the tumor is in the rectum or toward the end of the left colon, it may still be fresh and therefore, bright red.\n\n\n5. You've experienced unexplained weight loss.\nMany of us wouldn't want to question unexplained weight loss. We'd just be happy to be losing weight! But, even though the prospect of losing weight without even trying may seem a blessing, it really is something to question. It's the old "if it sounds too good to be true..." idea.\n\nSee more at http://coloncancer.about.com/cs/thebasics/a/Top10CCSymptoms.htm	Health

question_title: norm-reading blood suger? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: As you can see from the answers you have about 3 levels to choose from.  This is the fun part about normal blood sugars.  It all depends...\n\nHow long have you eaten?  What have you eaten?  What type of activity have you done?  Any stress?  All of these effect your blood sugar level.  The glycemic index of food also plays a part.\n\nTake a normal day.  You could eat an apple, apple sauce, or a apple juice.  Each of these items, even with the same caloric value will change your blood sugar differently.  The apple will raise your blood sugar over about two hours with a moderate elevation, the apple sauce will raise your blood sugar over about an hour with a slightly sharper increase, and the apple juice will spike your blood suger in approximately 15 minutes.  This has to do with the glycemic index of each item.. The best way to think about this is if the food is easy to digest your body will convert it to sugar quickly.\n\nStress, such as an automobile accident, can cause your body to produce adrenaline(sp?) which in turn will cause your liver to release glycogen so your body can handle the fight or flight response.  This will cause a blood sugar spike.\n\nAll in all with no outside factors you blood sugar should be targeted to be kept in the 70 to 120 range.  After a meal your blood sugar should return to under 120 by an hour. Longer then this and you can run into problems.	Health

question_title: What causes a tumor? [SEP] question_content: I have one (non-cancerous) on my leg, what causes them. [SEP] best_answer: A cell with many mutations to specific genes (tumor-suppressor and proto-oncogenes) cannot stop dividing, and all of the cells it produces cannot either. This results in a mas of cells that take up the body's resources, do not perform their necessary functions and crowd the cells around them. If the cells stop dividing for some reason (but still do not function), the tumor is benign, rather than malignant. A benign tumor can be removed more safely than a malignant tumor.	Health

question_title: What is beta glucan? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone know what beta glucan is?\nWhat is it good for?\nDoes it really help you to loose weigth? [SEP] best_answer: Beta Glucan is primarily cultured extract of Baker's Yeast cell wall. It is used as an immunostimulant.  Beta glucans are sugar molecules (polysaccharides). They are found bound together as a sugar/protein complex.  Certain plants and microorganisms are naturally high in this polysaccharide compound.  The richest concentrated source is baker's yeast cell walls. (Because there is basically no yeast left in the products and they have low protein levels, it is considered hypoallergenic.) It is present in lesser amounts in mushroom extracts and Lentinen, Barley, Oat, etc. Sodium alginate is also an excellent source, but the high sodium content is a major drawback in the processing for supplemental use. An expensive research extract called Zymosan™ has been used for doing research for over 45 years. Much of the research has been in combining it with conventional approaches, such as chemotherapy, but it has been found to work well on its own.\n\nWhat glucans seem to do is to stimulate/irritate your white blood cells called Macrophages into action. There is actually beta glucan receptors displayed by immune cells that the lectin fits right into like a lock and key and switches on or activates the macrophage to do it's job...clean up. Increased macrophage activity triggers a whole cascade of immune events, which basically boost immune response, which improves Natural Host Resistance. It also stimulates the production of immune cells.\n\nWhen taken with meals, beta-glucan increases the viscosity of the food in the stomach and forms a gelatinous mass. This slows the passage of food from the stomach into the small intestine, thereby sustaining satiety (the feeling of fullness) and reducing hunger and cravings. The basic principles of weight loss still hold true: eat less and exercise. If you are better able to control your appetite, you will find it much easier to meet your goals of weight loss or maintenance.	Health

question_title: Do carbahydartes turn to sugar or is it the other way around I always forget?

However, the term carbohydrates includes all sugars, too.\n\nThe body breaks down the more complex carbohydrates into sugars which can be transported to the cells or to the liver for storage.

question_title: i suffer from acute asthma at times !! can anybody suggest me a remedy? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Many medical professionals will simply shuffle prescription meds your way to treat acute asthma. They only provide temp relief. What they don't tell you is that the inhaled meds for asthma further damage your lungs (a catch-22) and you become worse over time. For more than 3 years I have completely stopped taking my asthma meds. How? I changed my diet to organic and wholefoods. Asthma is a typically reactive disease. Your body is reacting to an irritant. The 2 main irritants that our body is reacting to is 1) our unhealthy environment, and 2) our steady diet of artificially flavored, presevative loaded, hormone induced, antibiotically treated, chemically laced, saturated fatty foods. Check your food labels. We are making ourselves sick and sicker by what we eat. Asthma, diabetes, High blood pressure, High cholesterol and Obesity are attacking the youth by the thousands. Go organic - Drink Water (not soda) - Begin a moderate exercise and jogging program -Wean yourselve slowly from those asthma meds until you don't need them anymore. To your health.	Health

[SEP] question_content: is there a medical condition out there that will make you have periods twice a month that could decrese your fertility? also what else could this cause and also what could be causing me to have my period every other week... [SEP] best_answer: "Anovulatory uterine bleeding" or AUB is diagnosis of exclusion arrived at when other causes of abnormal bleeding have been ruled out (examples include uterine fibroids or polyps, injury or disease caused by intercourse, infection, genital warts, fluctuation in hormone levels, stopping and starting birth control pills or estrogens, low thyroid function, IUD use, anticoagulant drugs, cervical conization or cauterization procedures).  \n\nOcurring in 20% of adolescents and 40% of women over 40, AUB is typically characterized by less than 28 days between menstrual periods and/or otherwise abnormal menstrual periods, menstrual flow ranging from scanty to profuse, mood swings, hot flashes, vaginal tenderness, and Hirsuitism (excessive hair growth, often evident in women with PCOS).  Unfortunately, AUB can cause infertility, resulting from lack of ovulation.  It can also cause anemia.  Oral contraceptives or progestogen therapy are frequently used to treat AUB,  and ovulation induction may also be necessary if fertility is desired.  \n\nTreatment is successful in about 80% of cases, but some women experience such resistant, severe symptoms that they opt for surgical therapy like endometrial ablation.  \n\nYour GYN can help you diagnose whether AUB or another condition is involved.  Depending on the cause, he or she can help you choose the right treatment and get you on your way to feeling better.\n\nGood luck.	Health

But it wasn't bleeding after I spit. My jaw doesn't hurt and the pain is gone. I think I may need a root canal my mom says maybe it is my wisdom teeth. I'm only 17. So what the heck is going on and why was it swollen and popped? Please help thanks [SEP] best_answer: Abcess.. Oh yeah! \nBasically, your tongue popped it and the 'uaually' yellowish color was the infection. Yes, you now need to get the doctor (dentist) and have him/her xray it and get you started on antibotics. If the tooth is able to be saved, then yes.. Root Canal Treatment, is going to be needed. Then a crown, is needed. If the tooth cant be saved, then he'll pull it. They'll need an x'ray to determine how bad the infection was and if any bone loss has occured. Thats how they'll decided if it can be saved or not. \n\nBTW... Warm salty rinses, is GOOD ADVICE! BUT.. wont stop it from coming back. It's a temp, fix.  \n\nGood Luck....	Health

Yoy can only help yourself out with temporary cures if you do not address the the cause. Dehydration is the most probable cause of setting off this condition. 75% of Americans are 6-8 glasses of water dehydrated and their taste response is so misguided that they sense hunger when they are thirsty. The other problem that Americans have is their food has poor mineral content. \n\nDrinking 6-8 glasses of distilled water with a pinch of unrefined sea salt will rehydrate and remineralize your body. This could by itself make your skin supple and healthy. \n\n30 minutes of sunlight every day will help.\n\nEating oily fish or a fish oil supplement could help.\n\nAlmond and walnuts are great sources of good oil.\n\nSwitch from drinking toxic milk to almond milk or walnut milk.\n\nConsider externally usiing coconut oil with squeezed lemon juice for lightening. \n\nEat less processed foods and more raw foods.\n\nThe cure is out there but is it worth the changes of diet and lifestlye?

question_title: If you are cloned , does your soul enter your cloned body ? and will you feel like you and be the same person? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This question DOES have an answer. The answer is that since souls do not exist, no soul would be entering another's body. When, yes WHEN, a human is cloned (unfortunately someone WILL do it), the clone will have the same genes. They will look alike and theirs traits that are determined by genetics and not environment will likely be the same as well. However, they will still be two different human beings. Both are still alive and the clone will be a baby. You won't feel any different. Why would you? There are many ethical implications involved with cloning. It would be sort of like identical twins (who share same DNA and fingerprints etc) but the result would be very odd indeed especially if the two talked to one another. How alike would they be?	Health
question_title: Does sugar raise pulse rate? [SEP] question_content: Before I eat, I have a normal pulse rate.   \nIf I eat like a tiny bit of sugar.....it goes through the roof!\nIm a huge carb attick, so I love to eat like 6 bowls of cereal and thats it.   But after i eat the sugary cereal, or the chocolate, or cake, my pulse is out of control for the next couple hours!  Whats up? [SEP] best_answer: I will explain this as best I can.  I am a first year medical student so I can't assume to be an expert but I will tell you  what I have researched.  Please read this all because it could be important.\n\nA large amount of sugar in your diet (sugar, cake, etc.) will be absorb into your bloodstream and cause your pancreas to dump a lot of insulin.  In your case, your body may be releasing too much insulin.  Insulin helps get the sugar out of your blood and into the cells of your body.  In this case, a large amount of insulin could actually cause so much of that sugar to enter your cells that there isn't enough left in the blood.  The brain is very sensitive to sugar levels in the blood.  If the brain notices low sugar it sends out hormones that cause your body to release more sugar into your bloodstream.  One of the hormones it releases is called cortisol.  Cortisol causes a different organ in your body (adrenal glands) to release something called epinephrine, or what you know is called adrenaline.  Adrenaline causes your liver to produce and release sugar into your bloodstream.  Adrenaline also causes the heart to beat much faster.\n\nNow I have to ask you some questions.  Do you ever feel: nervousness, perspiration, shakiness, dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, and feeling anxious or weak?  Do you feel any of these at the same time that your heart rate increases?\n\nThese are signs of hypoglycemia (just means low blood sugar).  Low blood sugar can be very serious if allowed to get too low.  A person can actually go into a coma.  This is seen in people who have diabetes and take too much of their insulin and do not eat enough sugar.  They can act confused and even appear a little intoxicated.\nIf you seem to experience these symptoms I suggest you go to this website: http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia/index.htm and also call your doctor for an appointment.  Don't freak out, it is quite manageable and not at all uncommon.\n\nIt could be that your body is producing too much insulin or that your body just seems very sensitive to insulin or sensitive to adrenaline.\n\nIf you have hypoglycemia it is the "reactive" form and not the "fasting" form (which can be very bad).\n\nIf you releasing too much insulin, you could have hyperinsulinemia.  In your case "reactive hyperinsulinemia".  This is sometimes seen in people who have insulin resistance or also diabetes mellitus.  I suggest that you look into the symptoms of diabetes.  The typical symptoms are increased thirst and frequent urination.  If you have these symptoms as well you should definitely go see a doctor.  Again, nothing to freak out about but very important to get treated.  Here is a site on diabetes.\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/type-2-diabetes/DS00585/DSECTION=2\n\nAgain, this could mean nothing, but I do believe that you should schedule an appointment with a doctor.  It is common for a medical school student to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Only a doctor can tell you for sure.	Health

question_title: What are some good workout clothes for fat people? [SEP] question_content: Y'know clothing that doesn't show off every roll on your fat body... [SEP] best_answer: jogging pants and a big t-shirt.  But don't allow this to stop you from working out.  Your goal is to get out there.  And remember, the rolls won't be there for long because you are doing what needs to be done to lose the weight.  Keep in mind the following when losing weight:\n\nDiets and changing your eating to healthy food choices can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called "emotional eating" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.\n\nYou may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. \n\nThis all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. \n\nPlease learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:\n\nYou already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually you’ll see the pounds come off. What’s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same “Emotional Eating.” Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, that’s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesn’t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we don’t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.\n\nP.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.	Health

question_title: Does anyone experience that "Falling sensation" when they dose off sometimes?Why is that? [SEP] question_content: It always occurs when im asleep in the middle of class, and that class is quiet, and i burst out spasming....i get funny looks, it IS pretty funny, lol.  Its weird... [SEP] best_answer: Oh, yes, this is fun one.  What is happening is that sometimes when you are falling asleep, as your heart rate lowers and your muscles relax and your breathing slows, your brain thinks, just for a split second, that you are dying (you can see the similarities).  As a "check," your brain sends a test signal to your major muscle groups, causing them to spasm and you to jolt awake.  It is more likely to happen if your brain doesn't "think" you should be sleeping- like sitting up at a desk, for example, or if your internal stress levels are high at the end of the day.  I know it sounds crazy, but it really is a defense mechanism.  If you really were in danger, your body would not react to the test signal, and your brain would go into "fight or flight" mode to try and save your life.	Health

[SEP] question_content: I dont have cavities and I have perfectly straight white teeth and Im almost 19 but I dont want them to turn gross. [SEP] best_answer: try to cut down on the coke intake-i know this can be hard. caffeine and sugar not only effect teeth but your organs as well.\n\nfor example-caffeine speeds up your heartrate, making your heart pump faster which in turn raises your blood pressure. if you are drinking alot of caffeine throughout the day-your heart is getting more of a workout than it needs.\n\nsugar can also cause unwanted weight gain.\n\nas far as your teeth go..\n-drink your soda through a straw-this will help the liquid bypass getting in between your teeth and breaking down the enamel.\n-make sure to brush a minimum of 3 times a day\n-floss at least once a day\n-rinse your mouth out with water after finishing the soda if you are unable to brush\n-make sure to see the dentist once every 6 months and ask about getting the special sealant put on them to protect them from cavities\n\nwater is the best thing for you but i know most of us out there don't drink as much as we should (me included). and on the occasion-we need that quick "pick me up" that the caffeine in soda provides.\n\nif you can't stop drinking the coke-at least try stepping down to diet. i didn't think i would be able to but that was 2 years ago and i can't stand regular soda now. coke makes their diet with splenda so it doesn't taste too different.

question_title: What has caused me to have violent cold shivers followd by hot sweating profusely for two hours at night? [SEP] question_content: Plus a dull headache. [SEP] best_answer: It may be possible that you have malaria.\nMalaria is caused by a parasite - plasmodium species and transmitted by mosquitoes.\n\nA malaria infection is generally characterized by recurrent attacks with the following signs and symptoms:\n~ Moderate to severe shaking chills \n~ High fever \n~ Profuse sweating as body temperature falls \n~ General feeling of unease and discomfort (malaise) \n~ Other signs and symptoms include:\nHeadache \nNausea \nVomiting \nDiarrhea \nFever\nPeople with malaria typically have cycles of chills, fever, and sweating that recur every 1, 2, or 3 days.\nAfter noting your symptoms and travel history, your doctor will likely obtain a sample (smear) of your blood for observation under a microscope. Two blood samples, taken at six- and 12- hour intervals, can usually confirm the presence of the malaria parasite and its type. It's possible to be infected by more than one plasmodium at the same time.\n\nOther infections may also cause this:\nInfluenza, Enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever, Leptospirosis, Yellow fever, etc.\n\nYour doctor will take a proper history and conduct a physical exam to help properly diagnose you. He may conduct additional tests. It's a good idea to visit your doctor at the earliest. Hopefully it shouldn't be anything serious.	Health

Im thinking of starting it and wanted to get some feedback from people who've tried it. Do you reccomend it? any tips i should know before starting it? [SEP] best_answer: Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)	Health

You dont have to talk for too long, but strike up a conversation. it can be about the weather, a sports game he likes, or your friends, or his work/classes. \nAfter this, day 2, you should call him again once every two hours. Then, talk about something intimate. Like your family or something personal to you. Dont expect him to talk too much. He will say only a little.\nDay 3, you should try to say, 'i like you' in a different way other than words. One way would be to send him a flower and something else he likes. If he likes football, send him the latest scores. If he likes cars, send him a car magazine. Send it to him  or give it in person.\nDay 4, meet with him and ask him out on a date. It might be strange, but if you LOVE him, you should as him on a date. He should pay the biils still, but its like you pay half the bills. Take personally on the date. and try not to be too obivious.\nDay 5....continue this with your own efforts. You should use your own heart to guide what to do next.	Health

question_title: Who was Frederick Douglass? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Frederick Douglass was born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, a slave in Talbot County, Maryland near Hillsborough, twelve miles from Easton. He was separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, when he was still an infant. She died when Douglass was about nine years old. Douglass never knew anything about the identity of his father, other than that he was a white man, although some believe that his master, Captain Aaron Anthony, was his father. When Anthony died, Douglass was given to Mrs. Lucretia Auld, wife of Captain Thomas Auld; the young man was sent to Baltimore to serve the Captain's brother, Hugh Auld. When Douglass was thirteen, Hugh Auld's wife, Sophia, broke the law by teaching Douglass to read. Douglass later referred to this in his first abolitionist speach.\n\nIn 1837, Douglass met Anna Murray, who sold a poster bed to buy sailor's papers needed for Frederick Douglass's escape. Douglass escaped Slavery on September 3, 1838 boarding a train to Maryland dressed in a sailor's uniform and carrying identification papers provided by a free black seaman.\n\nDouglass continued reading. He joined various organizations in New Bedford, including a black church. He regularly attended Abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to William Lloyd Garrison's weekly journal, the Liberator, and in 1841, he heard Garrison speak at the Bristol Anti-Slavery Society's annual meeting. Douglass was inspired by Garrison, later stating, "no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments (the hatred of slavery) as did those of William Lloyd Garrison." Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass, and mentioned him in the Liberator.\n\nSeveral days later, Douglass gave his first speech at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention in Nantucket Island. Twenty-three years old at the time, Douglass later said that his legs were shaking. He conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his life as a slave.\n\nIn 1843, Douglass participated in the American Anti-Slavery Society's Hundred Conventions project, a six month tour of meeting halls throughout the east and middle west of the United States. He participated in the Seneca Falls Convention, the birthplace of the American feminist movement, and was a signatory of its Declaration of Sentiments.\n\nDouglass later became the publisher of a series of newspapers: "The North Star", "Frederick Douglass Weekly", "Frederick Douglass' Paper", "Douglass' Monthly" and "New National Era". The motto of "The North Star" was "Right is of no sex--Truth is of no color--God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren".\n\nDouglass' work spanned the years prior to and during the Civil War. He was acquainted with the radical abolitionist Captain John Brown but did not approve of Brown's plan to start an armed slave revolt. Douglass believed that the Harpers Ferry attack on federal property would enrage the American public. Douglass would later share a stage in Harpers Ferry with Andrew Hunter, the prosecutor who successfully convicted Brown.\n\nDouglass conferred with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 on the treatment of black soldiers, and with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage. His early collaborators were the white abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. In the early 1850's, however, Douglass split with the Garrisonians over the issue of the United States Constitution.\n\nDouglass had five children; two of them, Charles and Rossetta, helped produce his newspapers.

question_title: Why was Wills cigarette production stopped? [SEP] question_content: Talking about Pakistan Tobacco Company, when they decided to stop its production why they did so? One clue that I've got so far is they did so because of copyright problem. They were having there brand copied. I know they started its production again but what particular reason was there behind it. Any help will be much appriciated!\n\nAcctually this is my assignment and I am not getting ang sutiable answer for this. [SEP] best_answer: In England there is a Wills cigarette company that has been in existence for over on hundred years. Their main brand is 'Wills' Woodbines' and the also make 'Park Drive' cigarettes. Both these cigarettes have lost popularity as they do not have filter tips and since the introduction of filters in the UK in the 1960's sales have fallen. However they are still popular brands with older smokers and they are cheaper than most others. Naturally Wills need to protect their trading name hence their assertion of copyright laws. If the Pakistan Tobacco Company had persisted they would have had great problems in selling their products overseas due to the slice of the market that Wills already have and would have been subject to legal action.

question_title: find x   find y? [SEP] question_content: In a 30- 60 -90 triangle where the length of the hypotenuse is 20, the shorter leg is x, and the longer leg is y. find x    find y [SEP] best_answer: First of all, look at the link in my sources... It contains a picture that will help you understand what I'm trying to explain!\n\nIf the hypotenuse is 20, you know the shorter leg (x), or the leg across from the angle that measures 30°, is half of that.  You know this because of the 30°-60°-90° triangle that you will probably want to memorize for your math classes (see image).  So 20*(1/2) = 10.  x = 10.\n\nNow that you have the lengths of 2 out of 3 of the sides, you COULD simply use the pythagorean theorem to solve for y.  But if you have a calculater and your 30°-60°-90° triangle memorized, then you can do it easier and faster.  According to the image, the ratio between the shorter leg and the longer leg is 1:rt.3 (rt.3 meaning square root of 3.)  That means that all you have to do is take the length of the shorter leg, and multiply it by rt.3.  Since you know the length of the shorter leg (x) is 10, this is very easy.  10*rt.3 = 17.32.  y = 17.32\n\nIn conclusion, to answer your question, x = 10, y = 17.32.\n\nYou could also use sine and cosine formulas to solve this problem, but I personally like my way better.  If you'd like me to explain the sin and cosine way of solving this problem, hit me w/ an e-mail and I'll help if you need it!\n\nI hope I helped, and I hope my explanation wasn't too difficult to understand!

question_title: Why is the normal snooze time nine minutes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Simple. After a good night's restful sleep, the body needs a few minutes (usually) to regain its alert state. \n\nThe average time that elapses between the first opening of the eyes and the readiness to get off bed (touch down) is in the range of 5-15 minutes. So an ideal snooze time has been designated so that a person is really ready to 'touch down' in about 9-10 minutes after he or she wakes. \n\nSnooze time in some clocks/phones is 5 mins while in others it is 10 mins. Some models allow the user to set their own snooze time.	Education & Reference
question_title: what play activites can i use for young children with autism? [SEP] question_content: such as ages 3yrs old and 6yrs old [SEP] best_answer: Autistics remain in the infancy level of play because of their difficulty with socialization (at least until they are older and able to learn the "why" behind social rules). They parallel play rather than interact with others.\n\nTherefore, any games that are individual play are good. Many autistics do enjoy social company, with careful respect for their personal space and interaction focused on their own interests.\n\nTry puzzles, interactive educational computer programs (like Reader Rabbit), art activities, etc.  Many autistics will "play" with objects that spin, swirl, etc. because it keys in to their fascination for repeating details.\n\nWith older autistics who like puzzles, we  often use them to start to teach the idea of "turn taking." Your crowd is a bit young for that, though.\n\nDon't forget that autistics absolutely must have rigid structure and routine. "Play time" should be carefully defined, organized, and at the same time every day... and you may have difficulties the first few times you do it until the kids get used to it being part of the routine.

question_title: What is a smart allec? [SEP] question_content: I understand what it means,i don't understand the allec part,or however allic is spelled?Just like when someone says"im sick and tired",i get tired of things to,but not sick.If a person gets sick evereytime he or she is tired of something,i think there may be something wrong with that individual. [SEP] best_answer: I believe it is "Alec."  Sick and tired means that you are NOT literally ill, just sick (or tired) of the situation.\n\nHere is the info that you might be interested in as far as Smart Alec:\nFor many years, Smart Alec or Smart Aleck was thought to be no more than a generic character, first cousin to Clever Dick. The problem with seeking his original is the obvious one that, with so many possible candidates, only a stroke of luck might lead a researcher to the right Alec. A plausible candidate has been put forward by Professor Gerald Cohen (for the full story, see G L Cohen, Studies in Slang, Part 1, 1985). He argues that the original was Alex Hoag, a celebrated and clever thief in New York in the 1840s.\n\nHoag worked with his prostitute wife Melinda and an accomplice called French Jack to fleece unwary visitors to the city who were looking for a little fun. The key to his activities was that they did so in close association with two police officers, who shared the loot and provided protection. Most was done by what was in effect pickpocketing, with Melinda taking the victim’s pocketbook while they were otherwise engaged and surreptitiously handing it to Hoag or French Jack as they walked by. So far, so commonplace. However, his downfall came because he got into financial difficulties and tried to cheat his police protectors out of their share of the loot. One way was that Hoag lay behind a wall in a churchyard and had Melinda drop the goods over the wall to him so that the constables couldn’t see the exchange.\n\nAnother of the standard frauds, practised by many, was called the panel game. George Wilkes, the assistant editor of the Subterranean, met Hoag while Wilkes was falsely imprisoned in the infamous New York prison called The Tombs. Wilkes described the trick in a diary of 1844, The Mysteries of the Tombs: “Melinda would make her victim lay his clothes, as he took them off, upon a chair at the head of the bed near the secret panel, and then take him to her arms and closely draw the curtains of the bed. As soon as everything was right and the dupe not likely to heed outside noises, the traitress would give a cough, and the faithful Aleck would slily enter, rifle the pockets of every farthing or valuable thing, and finally disappear as mysteriously as he entered.” The victim was then persuaded to leave in a hurry through a window by Alec banging on the door, pretending to be an aggrieved husband who has suddenly returned from a trip away.\n\nHoag used this trick to avoid paying off his police protectors, so that when he was caught, the police were in no mood to aid him. He was sentenced to jail, but escaped through the help of his brother, only to be recaptured following extensive police searches (by one of those odd coincidences, having been recognised by Wilkes).\n\nProfessor Cohen suggests that Alex Hoag was given the sobriquet of smart Alec by the police for being a resourceful thief who outsmarted himself by trying to avoid paying graft. It’s impossible to be certain this is the true story, since the expression doesn’t appear in print until 1865, but it does seem extremely plausible.	Education & Reference

Once a child finds that he or she likes a show, that program becomes a constant obsession. Children learn from the parents’ example, but when the children are not supervised properly, they start developing obsessions for television, which then fall back to the parent’s role in supervision. The adults are simply not taking the responsibility for the children’s well being. Therefore, the parents are to blame. [SEP] best_answer: 	Education & Reference

Darkness may also serve as a sort of foreshadowing of a sad and dark ending to this tragedy.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is there a difference between  Marine salt and Sea salt? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are all sorts of salts.\nIn common usage, 'salt' refers to sodium chloride. Table salt is refined sodium chloride together with various additives, e.g. anti-caking agents, iodides, etc.\nMarine/sea salt is sodium chloride from the solar evaporation of sea water. It contains associated impurities such as calcium sulphate and magnesium chloride.\nWhen I did a Google search with the term "sea salt"+"marine salt" most of the references were to do with products for marine aquariums, so I think that the phrase 'marine salt' is used to describe stuff mostly intended for aquariums whilst the term 'sea salt' is for human consumption. If this is the case then I would expect 'sea salt' to be more strictly controlled as far as imputities are concerned.	Education & Reference

[SEP] best_answer: If you're looking for a way to quickly play the piano you're going to love this. Listen... most of you already know that the quickest way to play the piano is by learning chords.\n\nBut what most of you don't know is what kind of chord to start out with. There are triads, seventh chords, diminished chords and thousands more. There are closed position chords and then there is something called the open position chord, and with it, you'll be able to create your own music in less than an hour!\n\nLook.. the reason why so many people have problems with the piano is they give up out of sheer boredom! They sense that it will take months if not years to create something that sounds like music on it. So they give up.\n\nBy starting out with open position chords, you'll immediately sound like a pro! Why? It all has to do with the way the chord is structured. First, it's a modern sounding seventh chord. All this means is the seventh note of the scale is used to along with regular triad notes to give it a more contemporary sound. Jazz musicians use it all the time.\n\nSecond, it covers more than 2 octaves of the keyboard giving you a very nice "open" sound. If you love contemporary stylings, you'll be playing them in no time with it.\n\nAnd last but not least, you use both hands right away to create with! In fact, the chord is so wide open that you can literally create music without moving your hands around at all.\n\nIf you love the idea of playing piano but don't want to start with boring triads or note reading, you're going to love learning to play the open position chord!

question_title: I'm a taurus and I really like this guy who is a scorpio, does anyone know if we would be a good match? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: the compatibility depends: like family, romantic, coworker;\n\nthis is bout love:Taurus & Scorpio \n\nWhen Taurus and Scorpio come together in a love affair, their union is nothing if not intense, whether that's in a positive or a negative way. They are opposite Signs in the Zodiac, giving them a special, complex connection. They can combine to make a whole, each partner's strengths balancing the other's weaknesses. Their sexual attraction is likely to be off the charts! Taurus and Scorpio have tons in common, but because their personalities are so powerful, they often swing between passionate love and passionate disagreement! \n\nTaurus and Scorpio both have deep desires, Taurus for possessions and Scorpio for power. They're both concerned with wealth and resources, and they're both intensely passionate about all sorts of things. Taurus is a bit more self-focused than Scorpio, who is more concerned with their lover and immediate family. Both of these Signs have a great, deep-rooted need for security in a relationship, but with slightly different focuses. While Taurus prizes honesty and forthrightness and abhors infidelity, Scorpio loves to be mysterious. A Scorpio's need for security is more about the need to be constantly reassured that their emotional connection with their loved one is strong. The good thing is, Taurus needs this reassurance too -- and is also willing to provide it for their Scorpio lover. \n\nTaurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Scorpio is ruled by Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). This combination is very intense, thanks to Pluto's influence, but it's an excellent balance of masculine and feminine energy. Scorpio and Taurus together form the basis of all love relationships -- love and passion. Venus and Mars go well together; Venus is about the beauty of romance, and Mars is about the passion of romance. Scorpio is smoldering and intense (and intensely sexual), and Taurus, a sensual and tireless lover, is attracted to this intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the devotion inherent in Venus-ruled Taurus. \n\nTaurus is an Earth Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. Scorpio tends to be very deep -- like an ocean, too much upset will cause a tidal wave! When Scorpio feels crossed by a lover, watch out for that Scorpion's tail, which can whip out and sting their lover without warning! It's a good thing that these two Signs are so strongly loyal to each other. But while Taurus is open, with everything laid bare on the surface, Scorpio is more secretive and inscrutable. They can both teach one another about their opposite views of life (direct versus complex). Another factor adding a tantalizing dimension to this union is the two Signs' mutual tendency toward jealousy. Taurus loves it when Scorpio displays their jealous -- it means Taurus is adored and appreciated! \n\nTaurus and Scorpio are both Fixed Signs. This means they're both pretty stubborn and resolute once their minds are made up. Let's hope their minds agree -- if not, they're prone to fights the likes of which neither experiences with any other Sign. Taurus seems to prevail as the dominant partner, but that's not always the case. Scorpio can ""win"" through more devious means, such as employing emotional manipulation to get what they want. These partners must learn to discuss their views and needs openly and to reach a compromise if they want their union to be lasting and happy. This largely depends on Scorpio's ability to learn to trust Taurus. The relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot overcome their opinionated, fixed stances. \n\nWhat's the best aspect of the Taurus-Scorpio relationship? Their powerful connection that can shine when obstacles to intimacy are cleared away. When Scorpio realizes that Taurus is there for the long term and won't create the misery that some Scorpios attract to their lives, this relationship can blossom.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Why do Leos take their breakups so seriously which leaves me (a Gemini) without a partner because of their ex? [SEP] question_content: Both of the Leos I have tried to get in a relationship wouldn't because they had a hard breakup and don't want a relationship with anyone.  Leos, how long will this take before your next relationship? [SEP] best_answer: Several of my family members are Leos. I know EXACTLY what you're talking about. Honey, unfortunately, a Leo can grieve themselves to death. Put it this way, the female Leo in my family took 13 years after her spouse died before she even thought about another relationship.\nOnce a Leo gives their heart to someone, they give their WHOLE heart and once scorned it can take a very long time to repair. They generally will need a friend to help them through the bad times and then will tend to lean on the one that stuck with them through thick and thin. Leo males in my family are this way as well. When they've been scorned, they may go from one girlfriend to another until they find the right one and settle down. This just keeps them from being hurt again.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Quick Draw McMgraw was  a what, with a sidekick named who, and an alter ego named what? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Quick Draw was the bumbling horse sheriff of a lawless Western town. He was "the high-falutin'est, fastest shootin'est cowboy you ever saw," and he spoofed every Western cliché television has ever offered. Quick Draw was assisted in keeping the town free of wrongdoers by his friend and deputy Baba-Looey, a Spanish-accented burro who sounded a bit like Desi Arnaz's Ricky Ricardo, on "I Love Lucy." In episodes that ranged from amusing to absurd. Several cartoons featured Quick Draw, in a parody of Zorro, as a swashbuckling masked avenger called El-Kabong, who used a guitar in place of a sword. Other Quick Draw cartoons featured Snuffles, a treat loving canine who would help Quick Draw and Baba-Looey only after being awarded a dog biscuit. When given the biscuit, Snuffles would moan in joy, hug himself, float up into the air and slowly return to the ground in total ecstasy.	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A sonnet is a poem consisting of two quartets and two tercets (verses of four and three lines each) composed either entirely of alexandrins or of decasyllables (each line must have either twelve or ten syllables). the rhyme structure is also set:\nABBA, ABBA, CCD, DED (or EED) \nor ABAB, ABAB, CCD, DED\nThis notation represents the last sound in each line, e.g.\na poem where the ending words are\nlay\nmight\nwrite\nstay\nhas an ABBA rhyme scheme.\neach new sound has its own letter assinged to it. \nthe following is one of the most famous sonnets of all time, by an equally famous poet\n \nShall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day?\nWilliam Shakespeare \n\nShall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\n\nSometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometimes declines,\nBy chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;\n\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\n\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:\nSo long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\nas you can see the poem is composed in alexandrins and its rhyme structure is ABAB, CDCD, EFE, FGG\nVolumes upon volumes could and  have been written about the sonnet, its beauty, its appeal and its deeper meaning, but I only feel adequate to discuss its basic mechanics	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Okay, there was this movie with punk bands.....? [SEP] question_content: This movie was a comedy of some type, had something to do with metal/punk bands.  At the end there was some sort of battle of the bands.  During one song, everyone backstage is involuntarily jumping up n down with the music.  Out in the crowd, a singer/announcer/whatever is encouraging people to dive from the balcony.  Then there is an older black man who had smoked/consumed some substance and ends up walking on air with colored lights playing about him.\n\nThis is an older film, prolly early 80s or 70s even.\n\nIt is NOT a documentary of any sort... [SEP] best_answer: Sounds sort of like "Get Crazy" Starring Daniel Stern (Home Alone), Malcom McDowall, and rock musician Lou Reed.   The plot was a rock promoter (a Bill Graham type) was preparing for a New Year's Eve Concert (82-83)  when he has a heart attack and thinks he's dying.  To culminate his life, he gathers the best musicians he ever promoted for the biggest concert ever.  Stern plays the promoters protege who has to handle the craziness this causes.  Lou Reed pretty much plays himself, McDowall plays the Mick Jagger type and there is a punk band, a hippie group, and a blues act.\n\nI have not seen the movie in ages, but I do remember theold blues musician who walks on air thanks to pot, and comments "Good reefer here."  Also,every band does the same song (Hoochie Coochie Man?) in their own way.\n\nI have forgotten the punk singer's name, but I know he fronted a band (Fear?)and was in Streets of Fire and The Decline Of Western Civilization.

question_title: What is Calvin's Dad / Mom's name? [SEP] question_content: Calvin of Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. [SEP] best_answer: Calvin's mother and father are for the most part typical Middle American middle-class parents; like many other characters in the strip, their relatively down-to-earth and sensible attitudes serve primarily as a foil for Calvin's outlandish behavior. Both parents go through the entire strip unnamed, except as "Mom" and "Dad", or such pet names as "hon" and "dear." Watterson has never given Calvin's parents names "because as far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad." \n\nCalvin's father is a middle-aged patent attorney who is portrayed as an upstanding middle-class father, as his son might see him. An outdoorsman, he enjoys bike rides and camping trips, and insists that these activities, like Calvin's chores, "build character\n\nCalvin's mother is a stay-at-home parent who is frequently exasperated by Calvin's antics. On the rare occasions when she is not reacting to Calvin's misbehavior, she seems to enjoy quiet activities, such as gardening and reading. The "daily disciplinarian", she is frequently the one forced to curb Calvin's destructive tendencies; in one Sunday strip, she allows Calvin to smoke a cigarette in order to teach him how unpleasant smoking can be. She also usually seems sympathetic towards her son's relationship with Hobbes, and a few times has found herself speaking to Hobbes as well (although she refers to one instance as "talking to a stuffed animal").
