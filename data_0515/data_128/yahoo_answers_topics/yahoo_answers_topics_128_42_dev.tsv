question_title: Are Geminis romantically compatabile with Virgos? [SEP] question_content: I know that Geminis are supposedly compatabile with other air signs and most fire signs, however I heard that the Virgo sticks out like a sore thumb as the only non air-fire sign that can also be compatabile with a Gemini. Is this true? Why is it so? \nFYI_I am a Gemini...but you already knew that. lol [SEP] best_answer: Virgos and Gemini can be very compatible some of the time. At other times, it can just be a terribly annoying situation. It's kind of half and half - youre a Gemini & you don't understand that? LOL\n\nVirgos and Gemini both like to be analytical, but Gemini are more into being the center of attention, being entertained and finding amusement. Both Gemini and Virgos tend to have great levels of imagination. Virgo people often consider themselves to be more serious than Gemini. Sometimes Virgo can be very fascinated, amused and captivated by the interests and actions of a Gemini. The other half of the time, Virgo might just can't stand it anymore because these things are just wasting valuable time or resources.\n\nThe majority of Virgo people I know are frugal whereas the majority of Gemini people I know are the opposite. This can definitely be a deterrent in a romantic relationship.\n\nCaligirl, please understand I am smiling all the way thru this. I am Virgo. I have several wonderful longterm non-romantic relationships with Gemini people, male and female. In almost all of these relationships there is time out where we just have to make space and not deal with each other because one has gotten on the others last nerve (& that happens with both Gemini or Virgo). I have also seen a couple of absolutely disastrous love/hate relationships between other Virgo/Gemini couples  With that in mind though, I would never purposely get into a romantic situation with a Gemini.

question_title: Whatever happened to Kriss Kross??? [SEP] question_content: jump jump [SEP] best_answer: As a result of the popularity of their only hit Jump, the Atlanta duo was able to ride a wave of popularity in the summer of 92.  When it was time to follow up with new material they fizzled, and never came close to having a another hit, in addition there voices started to change and they hit the ugly teenage years, thus losing the cute little kid thing that was part of their initial appeal.  After two disappointing albums in 93, and 96, the two ended their singing career and went into producing.  And then in 2003 Chris Kelly and Chris Smith aka Kris Kross resurfaced to announced a come back into the "rap game" hitting heavier and harder than they ever had.

[SEP] best_answer: Everything happened. The blackouts happened, therefore all the alternate lifes happened too.  The truth is that in the end he could finally find a way to be in peace with his 'future' (not hurting anyone he loved - his mom & kaylie) choosing not to meet the girl when they were kids.

Jimi Hendrix Live at Monterey\nI credit it as being the music that inspired me to pick up the guitar.\nWhy do I love Music? You're talking to a singer/songwriter of 11 years and trust me when I say this that there is NO OTHER feeling like the one that you get from writing a song, it's deeply spiritual and inspiring, getting swept up into the moment and surrendering to it. Writing and performing well.....It's a spiritual communion with God and until you've felt it there's just nothing else that can compare. Absolution, freedom, wonder.... all those feelings combined don't even come close. Music is a gift, and a blessing and it is very much my life.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: who won dancing with the stars? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Emmitt Smith Wins ABC's 'Dancing' Title - http://tv.yahoo.com/news/ap/20061115/116366154000.html\nWednesday November 15 11:19 PM ET\n\nEmmitt Smith danced off with the mirror ball. The three-time Super Bowl champion, who proved to be as nimble on his feet in the ballroom as on the football field, was named the winner of ABC's "Dancing with the Stars" Wednesday night. With the victory came the glittering trophy. The NFL's all-time leading rusher beat out actor Mario Lopez.\n\nThe hunky, dimpled Lopez was generally regarded as the series most dynamic celebrity dancer, but the public's vote, the deciding factor after the contestants had tied in the judges' tally at Tuesday's final dance-off, brought Smith the victory.\n\n"It is awesome! It is awesome!" declared Smith, after hugging his professional dance partner Cheryl Burke. "We came a long way, we really have." \n\nBurke won last season, too, on the arm of singer Drew Lachey.\n\nSmith had kind words for Lopez, who was gracious in his defeat. He called the former "Saved by the Bell" star a "true gentleman" and said he and partner Karina Smirnoff "raised the bar" during the competition.\n\n"This whole journey was unbelievable ... And Karina, most unbelievable person," Lopez gushed. "It's something I'll never forget."\n\nSmith and Burke wowed judges on Tuesday with a spirited samba, to the tune of Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke."\n\n"What's so great about you is you are the everyday man who became a dancer in our eyes in the past 10 weeks," judge Carrie Anna Inaba told Smith, who's been dubbed "The Big Easy" for his laid-back elegance and charm.\n\nIn the closing segment of Wednesday's decision show, Burke, in a video clip, praised Smith's work ethic.\n\n"From the beginning, he just wanted to be the best possible dancer he can be," she said.\n\nSmith, ever the competitor, was determined to win, just as he had done so many times with the Dallas Cowboys. "You don't get into a competition unless you think you can win," he told AP Radio after Tuesday's dance finale.\n\nDuring Wednesday's program, all nine of the previously rejected celebrities Vivica A. Fox, Harry Hamlin, Joey Lawrence, Sara Evans, Willa Ford, Monique Coleman, Jerry Springer, Tucker Carlson and former beauty queen Shanna Moakler returned for a last dance with their partners.\n\n"Dancing with the Stars" was a surprise hit when it debuted in the summer of 2005. Now in its third edition, the show was a ratings juggernaut week after week and, last week, the dance-off show was No. 2 to ABC's "Desperate Housewives" with 22 million viewers, according to Nielsen. And the results show was No. 4, with 20.7 million viewers.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones issued a statement soon after the show ended, saying how proud he was of Smith. "Although we are all thrilled," Jones said, "we should not be surprised. ... "If Emmitt Smith is on your team, there is a good chance you are going to win."	Entertainment & Music

question_title: WHY A BOTTLE IS BETTER THAN A WOMAN By WILLY? [SEP] question_content: "At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the amount of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society permits more satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is to function in some way as a safety release then it must obviously deal with these taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we accord our licensed jesters, that nothing be excused the searching light of comedy. If anything can survive the probe of humor it is clearly of value, and conversely all groups who claim immunity from laughter are claiming special privileges which should not be granted." -- Eric Idle \n\nWHY A BOTTLE IS BETTER THAN A WOMAN By WILLY 1/22/06 3:30 PM\n\n* A bottle will never nag you to keep the freaking toilet seat down!\n* Depending on your choice a bottle can keep you warm or cool you off!\n* A bottle will never tell you, "The last guy drank me straight, no chaser," or on the rocks w/e!\n* You can own as many bottles as YOU want, they don't get jealous!\n* You can try as many other bottles, as your stomach can take, your bottle will wait for you!\n* An older bottle doesn't need Victoria's Secret lingerie to make you drink from it!

question_title: Anyone Heard of Siouxsie & the Banshes? [SEP] question_content: they invented the genre of music GOTH [SEP] best_answer: Yes, I have heard of her(them) and have seen them @ CBGB.Here is a little back ground info. for your reading pleasure:\nBack in Bromley Kent UK in the mid seventies a 17 year old called Susan Dallion ,a self confessed loner, was listening to Bowie, Lou Reed, T Rex and Roxy music while most other teenagers were listening to the Eagles in their flares and long hair. In 1974 however, she got together at a Roxy Music gig with Steve Severin (aka Spunker , Havoc) and became kindred spirits and joined up with Bill Broad (Billy Idol). In 1976 their whole world changed after Bill saw the Sex Pistols  and they became  the infamous Bromley Contingent who attached themselves to the Pistols to form the nucleus of an embryonic punk scene.  \nSusan soon re-invented herself as Siouxsie Sioux, dressing herself in what was then an outrageous mixture of glam, fetish clothing and fishnet, peek a boo shiny plastic bras, spiky stilettos, rubber stocking and swastika armbands; her face was painted "with the obsessive skill of the truly possessed" as it was described at the time. She was the high profile leaderene of punk style , "the female Sex Pistol"\n She looked stunning and she knew it as she became the (un ? ) willing tabloids "pin-up punkette". But her and Severin wanted more than image - they wanted to play. In September 1976 they played the 100 Club punk festival. With Sid Vicious on drums and Marco Pirroni on guitar they presented a spontaneous gig as the band wound itself through a 30 minute jam composed of bits of Smoke On The Water, Twist and Shout etc and which came to be known as The Lords Prayer. Excrutiating !!.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: If you were asked to select one from violin/guitar which one would you select and why? [SEP] question_content: elucidate the reason....im here to read all the lines! [SEP] best_answer: Personally, i would go for violin. It has always been one of my favourite instruments. Good violins look beautiful as well as having a rich tone. My violin is over 100 years old and has a lovely mellow tone (especially with a good set of strings). \n\nFor me, a good violin is something to be treasured and passed on, but never sold. Violins are individual and each has its own characteristics just like those who play them. Violins have a history and improve with age and good playing. there are many violins that are over 100 years old, some dating back to the 17th century. \n\nI am a violinist. I've played vioin for over 10 years (since I was 7). I'll never play professionally, but I will never stop playing. It's too much part of who I am.\n\nSo yes, the violin.	Entertainment & Music

The boat alone outweighs a 3 tonne shark, how is this possible?

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: supergiantbaileycat did a very good reply.\n\nI just want to add, Cinco de Mayo IS NOT the day mexicans celebrate independence.

Cinco de Mayo represents to México what El Alamo represents to US. A celebration of brave (even if they lost).\n\nAnd yes, it seems that the date is bigger in US than in México. People work and there ain't much of a celebration in México that day, except maybe in Puebla state.\n\n--------------------------\nkevintillot: I don't see the reason to paste exactly what other poster had cut and pasted.

So now what used to be Scorpio, is now most likely Sagittarius. \nPeople who take this stuff seriously are reading the wrong horoscopes.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: I am earning Rs.15000/- p.mm  How much I should save and where to invest money to get maximum benefit from it? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: manojgahiwal is ignorant or a fraud if he thinks you can get 20% return per year "insured".  If you're lucky or skilled you can average 20% per year but it means taking a lot of risk of some sort.  Risk in junk bonds defaulting, or risk of huge losses in volatile stocks, or risk of distressed property not selling--whatever the investment vehicle 20% is a reasonable target only for the high-risk investor.  10% is the norm for stocks of large US companies.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't know the currency you're referring to--is it South African rand?  How much to save is a highly personal thing and depends a lot on your age and the economic situation in your country.  Anyone in the US counting on Social Security in 30 years is living in a dangerous hallucination.  Republican mismanagement guarantees that all that will be left of Social Security will be a subsistence program to keep poor people from falling into total destitution.  It will be like welfare is now--anyone not covered will be grateful they're well-off enough to not qualify.  In these circumstances someone starting out should save at least 10% and someone in middle age should be saving 30% or more if they don't have several hundred thousand dollars in assets.

question_title: What job(s) can get you rich these days (colledge jobs). In my opinion 100,000$ is a very hardy salary.? [SEP] question_content: Thank you. :) [SEP] best_answer: Well, if you are sincerly looking for a $100,000/yr job. You need to start with an education. Believe it or not there are people in education that make that annual salary. But in order to get to that plateau, you must be educated. At least have a masters degree. Whether its education, business, IT, engineneering, it rreally doesn't matter. What matters is you. What is your passion? What do you want to be? There are members of large police departments who earn this, as well as firefighters, everyone has a boss, and everyone knows that the bosses make the bucks. However, a boss also has a stellar educational background. So, you must decide what you want to be, because you more than likely will do it for a very long time. Just get your degree, !st.

question_title: why do most frying pans sold are without covers? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Food is not properly fried with a cover.  Doing so prevents moisture from escaping, thus making it simmered or boiled rather than fried.  I do prefer to have a lid with my fry-pans because sometimes I like to brown, then reduce the heat for simmering.  Lids can be purchased separately,  although they do not always properly fit the pan.

I don't know whether your principal or director tolerates meaness, but this girl in my highschool made out a petition and had a whole lot of girls put their signatures that this guy was a real piece of s**t (they didn't use that word, but it was implied).  The director called in the guy, explained to him that a petition had been brought to him and after thinking about (speaking of the director), he expelled the guy from school.  This may seem a bit harsh, but this director did not tolerate this kind of behavior in any way.\n\nI hope this helps you.	Business & Finance

question_title: Living in Fort Worth, TX, which markets are due to be better off in Fort Worth or surrounding areas? [SEP] question_content: I just purchased a home in Scenery Hill addition in Fort Worth and would like to know if the market in Fort Worth is going up instead of depreciating?  I know parts of Los Angeles, CA have since I'm originally from there, just want to make sure I'm making a correct decision. [SEP] best_answer: Homes in Texas appreciate at a rate of 3%-4% per year.  In Dallas and Fort Worth, homes generally appreciate at a rate of up to 6% per year.  The Scenery Hills addition has some nice homes and is an established neighborhood.  The property values appear to have increased over the last couple of years, or have remained steady, depending on the home.  \n\nIf one purchases a home and years later, he/she has done no updating, doesn't take care of the home, or the location is no longer desirable, then that will certainly affect the value of the home, and in the case of location, might affect the value of every home in the subdivision, depending on what the circumstances are that made the area undesirable.\n\nAs far as markets that are "better off" around Fort Worth, try the City of Mansfield, located in southeast Tarrant County.\n\nI'm confused though, as you first indicated you "just purchased" a home and later indicate that you want to make sure you're "making a correct decision."  If you purchased the home, the decision has already been made, as you now own the home.  If you just submitted an offer to a seller and haven't closed, then you haven't "just purchased" the home. \n\nAnyway, good luck to you!	Business & Finance

God has 6 arms and is called Vishnu, oh no sorry, i didn't mean to say that. God is buddha, oh no i think i didn't mean to say that either. god is god. god is zeus, oh shoot that was a long time ago. God is Ra, oops!!! God is the magic penguin..... God is that which changes through the ages and centuries of human existance, and also changes for persons living in different countries...umm well...God is that which created the universe, and the existance of the universe proves god created it...errr...did I say that? God is that for which all christians who believe through faith are trying to find logical reasons for his existance, god is a three lettered word, for which Nietzsche said the job was vacant......GOd is that which gives comfort to the weak (Chatnior..) and helps them die and live comfortably to existance.... God is that which many people are taugh to believe in since they where born until they are 18 years old when they begin questioning themselves but find the custom is too old to deny....god is that which many people cannot escape......God is also that which people are afraid of and respect since they fear hell....God is that for which people pray their  families be safe, and then realize it is uncomfortable to not pray and not believe so they belief with faith, and then faithfully try to explain with reason his existance........God is that for which Blaise Pascal said it is easier to believe in than not to, Blaise boy said you risk losing all if you do not believe in god, while believing in him you risk nothing, since they where be non existance/ God might be that which doesn&#92;t exist for the brave. God is that for which I cannot explain, as many other things, and that which I don't know at all, but according to the catholic ideas surrounding my area I should, God with capital letters, (not god) is that which people who pray pray for and "feel" is talking back to them, God is that for which you give thanks when the twin towers are destroyed but you safely made it out, so you give thanks to him, yet the people who died dont really give him thanks,, god is that being who never ever shows himself(he? oh well...?) and then you are expecting to believe in since you meet him after you die according to people who have been in the afterlife, which is very common among us human creatures, all the time visiting the afterlife.....god is that being which tells you somehow (through the bible?) that you need to believe in him no matter what your mind and body tells you, that you need faith to believe him, as penguin god creature told me to believe on him as the creator of the universe , God is that supreme, omnipotent, perfect being who was so perfect to create humanity, and made them with the ability of free choice to believe or not in them, so generously so that he built people as killers with a free choice to escape from being killers yet they ultimately kill because they are killers and their bodies and minds made them kill but this is actually not so because they had a time when they could choose not to kill based on their mind and body created by god who built them with this choice, so they made the wrong choice based not on their qualities or on what they are but on something else......God is that being which is so just that thinks people who might make a reasoning mistake, say, saying God doesn't exist, should be punished with hell, due to their mistaken reasoning.....God is Jupiter or Zeus or Cronos, God is that being which became God starting Old testament but which people or civilizations who never heard of him 20,000 years ago will burn in hell, God is that which the intelligent masses believe in and the dumb, small elite do not believe in,  God is Attila's friend, Nietzsche joke buddy, and someone el	Business & Finance

question_title: How can I get the Department of Education to apply my payments to "Principal Balance"insted of to "fees&costs" [SEP] question_content: National Payment Center is using my payments for "fees&costs"never towards principal balance. [SEP] best_answer: First, call them and tell them that you want your payments to go toward your Principal Balance, or at least a portion of it. If your current loan does not allow for that, try negotiating with them. They may ask you to put it in writing --for instance, you may need to send a check and WRITE on the check to put it towards priciple. But more than likely, you may need to send your regular payment and AN ADDITIONAL amount that you specify is to go toward principal. If this fails, I would speak with a financial  counselor outside of National Payment Center. HTH and best of luck to you.	Business & Finance

question_title: What is the penalty if I sell some of my 401K? [SEP] question_content: Need to sell bad. Going through a divorce and need the money. Credit is bad (now) and need the money before they come get me (ha ha). [SEP] best_answer: It will depend on your age and retirement status when you withdraw. Generally speaking, you will be assessed a penalty equal to 10 percent of the taxable amount of your withdrawal if you withdraw money before you reach age 59 1/2. There are some instances when you may not have to pay a penalty. Keep in mind that you must pay income taxes on all withdrawals of taxable money, \n\nDepending on your plan, you may be eligible for a "hardship withdrawal," for those unexpected circumstances when you may need your money before retirement. According to IRS safe harbor regulations, your "hardship" must represent an "immediate and heavy financial need" and is necessary to satisfy the financial need. Also, there must not be "any other resources that are reasonably available," to you to handle that financial need. The IRS has deemed the following four distribution reasons as representing an immediate and heavy financial need:\n\nCertain medical expenses for you, your spouse or your dependents \nPurchase of a primary residence (excluding mortgage payment) \nPayments of certain post-secondary education expenses for the next year for you, your spouse or your dependents \nTo prevent eviction from or foreclosure on your primary home \n \nPlease be advised that if you take a hardship withdrawal from the plan following "safe harbor" rules, you may be suspended from making contributions to the plan for a minimum of six months.  \n \nSome plans also allow hardship withdrawals for other reasons. Check with your benefits department. You will need to show your employer proof of how you intend to use the money, and proof that the amount you requested isn't more than enough to satisfy your need.  \n \nAs a result of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, hardship withdrawals are not eligible to be rolled over, and are not subject to a federal income tax withholding. You may still owe income taxes and a possible 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under 59 1/2 when you file your annual income tax return. State and local taxes may also apply. Please note: You should consult your financial/tax adviser with specific questions about your personal situation if you are considering a withdrawal from your plan account.	Business & Finance

question_title: Do I just keep ignoring the company? [SEP] question_content: I have one credit card with a little over 5,000 dollars on it.  I haven't made a payment in over a year.  I have ignored any phone calls, and haven't acknowledged that I owe the debt.  In AR the SOL is 5 years.  Is it better to just keep ignoring them for a few more years in hopes they won't sue me for 5,000 dollars?  Or is it better to acknowlege the debt?  I can't pay it in full...which is what they want.  Nor will I be able to make payments until my car is paid off in 10 months. [SEP] best_answer: Just my educated opinion.....\n\nCredit card company will generally come after you for debts over $1000 if they have contacts in your state.  That makes it easier for them to appear and court and sue you. Otherwise, the cost is too high.  So your $5000 debt makes you a prime target.\n\nI'm fairly certain that if they don't come after you, you can expect a collection agency to do it.  Either way, I'd say a lawsuit is a very real possiblilty.\n\nI don't think the SOL will help you.  The CA will certainly know when it expires and will step up collection efforts before that happens.\n\nSo my suggestion is to first look at your budget.  I'm sure that if you take a serious look at it, and cut out unnecessary expenses, you can find $100 a month.  You need to negotiate a payment plan with them, so don't insult them by offering $50 a month.  They are not going to wait several years to get paid, and if you don't offer something reasonable they will sue you.  Even $100 a month is will not go over well with them, but it's a start.\n\nIn the link below are a few sample letters you can use to form a negotiation letter.  Try that out and see what happens.  \n\nOne last piece of advice....it's a certainty that they have placed a negative item on your credit report.  Get them to remove this item IN WRITING before you pay them a dime.  It's my opinion that a judgement is just as bad as a default, and both will hurt your credit score.  But If they want their money, make them fix your credit.  Otherwise, you will have bad credit, plus you will be broke!  This is very important if you plan to get credit within the next few years for a car or home.  If that's not going to be an issue, the bad credit won't matter, as it will gradually improve after a few years.	Business & Finance

question_title: i want to do masters in marketing in UK.what will be the tot al expense to stay there,please tell in $.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends where you stay.  London and the South-east tends to be more expensive.  Midlands and the north less so.  \n\nI'm in Leicester at the moment, and it should approx cost you £7000.00/$12,930 for twelve months here (£3500 of that is accommodation in halls of residence).  Tuition fees would be approximately an additional £8000/$14777 per year as well.\n\nSo in total, if you choose to study in the Midlands area (I'm guessing Nottingham, Derby, Northampton, Birmingham would be about the same price, and probably the North-East/West too), you would be looking at approx. $27,707 per year to cover tuition and expenses.\n\nLondon would definitely be more than this (though tuition would probably be about the same).

question_title: Why is depression common nowadays? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The diagnoses of depression has increased in the last 20 years for several reasons.\n\nFirst we are getting better at recognizing the signs of depression.\n\nSecond the social stigma against getting treatment has decreased a little.\n\nThird we understand the problem more and we understand how often depression is a component of major problems.  Anyone who is diagnosed with at serious disease has to deal with depression.\n\nFourth it is getting harder and harder to live.  50 years ago a married couple could live quite well with a family, a car, and a good size family.  They could also afford to put their children through college.  Now days it takes both parents working to afford the house and the family and if you don't start saving for your child's college education at birth you will be only able to afford Junior College.  The Consumer Price Index is not a correct measure of how effective our money is today when compared to how effective it was years ago.  Frankly, the value of the dollar compared to only 10 years ago is declining and the decline is worse when compared to 20-50 years ago.  The two main culprits of that are energy prices and the high price of health care.  Health Care costs have skyrockected and it is up to Mr. and Mrs. Average Citizen to make up the difference.  30-40 years ago a family could afford to send a child to college without having to sell their house.  Today the cost is so huge that often the teenager can't afford to leave home until after they graduate.  If they do leave home then the high cost of living beats them into the ground.  Without college they can't get a decent job so they fall into a cycle of barely making it, which increases their depression.\n\nFifth the pace of our society has increased.  Most jobs once offered two weeks of vacation a year, now it is half that.  Europeans enjoy a month.  Even when people are on vacation their cell phones and the Internet with email makes sure the office is only a phone call away.  Also Americans are working harder and harder.  A 40 hour week has grown into a 50 hour week, and many bosses expect this as a minimum, with no additional compensation.  The pressure of life has simply gotten too huge for many people to handle.

question_title: Is it worth doing Btech(distance learning) in Rajasthan Vidyapeeth University when compared to do AMIE? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I do not think so. In my opinion there is not much sense in doing B. Tech by distance learning as it unless you are involved in regular course you will not be able to do justice with lab work as also concepts will not be clear by theory unless some one explain in class. If you just want a B. Tech then you can go ahead with it as AMIE do not give B.Tech degree instead institute offer diploma which is considered eqv to B.Tech/ B.E.\n\nSecondaly AMIE diploma is much difficult to finish that distance learning B.Tech but value of it will be much more than any other distance learning course. Though you require experience in technical field for doing AMIE diploma.\n\nSo you have to make up mind with reference to above information.	Education & Reference

We don't like to  study  because we are rather forced to read to pass the exam,  score marks. The compulsion makes us repulsive towards studying. So u must come out first from this repulsion by suggesting to yourself the benefit of learning. A projection of your career ahead if your results are good can help u to love studying. There are many ways to improve\nconcentration and memory. But try this, keep a magazine or whatever else  you like to read handy during studying, whenever u fel bored in studying read that mag for  a while then again start reading the  school book.

question_title: why is the Pacific Ocean so cold all the time? [SEP] question_content: the atlantic ocean is so warm, and the other ocean, the PACIFIC, is so cold. why? [SEP] best_answer: In the southern half of the ocean the Humboldt Current flows north along the coast of South America. The cold mineral rich waters support many millions of small fish, which are eaten by larger fish and seabirds.\nAt regular intervals a huge area of the Pacific becomes warmer. Because warm water rises above cold, the sea-level increases. This change in temperature and level causes an alteration in the pattern of the winds. The warm water travels across the Pacific at 100 kms a day. This phenomenon, known as El Nino, deflects the Humboldt Current. 1997 saw the highest temperature recorded of this warm water during the last 150 years.	Education & Reference

question_title: Why is "importantly" being used so much these days? [SEP] question_content: This is a perfectly good word when used in the proper way. It is an adverb... as in "He dressed importantly for the meeting". Seems everyone today has tossed the english language. Most of the talking heads use "more importantly...". It's been written a lot too. It should be "more important..." It reminds me of the time when everyone was using the non-word, irregardless. They finally wised up on that one though. [SEP] best_answer: im·portant·ly adv. \nUsage Note: Some critics have objected to the use of the phrase more importantly in place of more important when one introduces an assertion, as in More importantly, no one is ready to step into the vacuum left by the retiring senator. But both forms are widely used by reputable writers, and there is no obvious reason for preferring one or the other.\n\n-----------\nir·re·gard·less    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (r-gärdls)\nadv. Nonstandard \nRegardless.\n[Probably blend of irrespective, and regardless.] \nUsage Note: Irregardless is a word that many mistakenly believe to be correct usage in formal style, when in fact it is used chiefly in nonstandard speech or casual writing. Coined in the United States in the early 20th century, it has met with a blizzard of condemnation for being an improper yoking of irrespective and regardless and for the logical absurdity of combining the negative ir- prefix and -less suffix in a single term. Although one might reasonably argue that it is no different from words with redundant affixes like debone and unravel, it has been considered a blunder for decades and will probably continue to be so.

question_title: what is so special about charleston south carolina? [SEP] question_content: im talking about that there was an historic event there and i cant find anything bout him!!!!! help meeeeeeee! [SEP] best_answer: Early history of Charleston\nAfter Charles II of England was restored to the English throne, he granted the chartered Carolina territory to eight of his loyal friends, known as the Lords Proprietor, in 1663. It took seven years before the Lords could arrange for settlement, the first being that of Charles Town. The community was established by English settlers in 1670 across the Ashley River from the city's current location. It was soon chosen by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, one of the Lords Proprietor, to become a "great port towne," a destiny which the city fulfilled. By 1680, the settlement had grown, joined by others from England, Barbados, and Virginia, and relocated to its current peninsular location. The capital of the Carolina colony, Charleston was the center for further expansion and the southernmost point of English settlement during the late 1600s.\n\nThe settlement was often subject to attack from sea and from land. Periodic assaults from Spain and France, who still contested England's claims to the region, were combined with resistance from Native Americans as well as pirate raids. Charleston's colonists erected a fortification wall around the small settlement to aid in its defense. The only building to remain from the Walled City is the Powder Magazine, where the city's supply of gun powder was stored.\n\nA 1680 plan for the new settlement, the Grand Modell, laid out "the model of an exact regular town," and the future for the growing community. Land surrounding the intersection of Meeting and Broad Streets was set aside for a Civic Square. Over time it became known as the Four Corners of the Law, referring to the various arms of governmental and religious law presiding over the square and the growing city. St. Michael's Episcopal, Charleston's oldest and most noted church, was built on the southeast corner in 1752. The following year the Capitol of the colony was erected across the square. Because of its prominent position within the city and its elegant architecture, the building signaled to Charleston's citizens and visitors its importance within the British colonies. Provincial court met on the ground floor, the Commons House of Assembly and the Royal Governor's Council Chamber met on the second floor.\n\nWhile the earliest settlers primarily came from England, colonial Charleston was also home to a mixture of ethnic and religious groups. In colonial times, Boston, Massachusetts and Charleston were sister cities, and people of means spent summers in Boston and winters in Charleston. There was a great deal of trade with Bermuda and the Caribbean, and some people came to live in Charleston from these areas. French, Scottish, Irish and Germans migrated to the developing seacoast town, representing numerous Protestant denominations, as well as Catholicism and Judaism. Sephardic Jews migrated to the city in such numbers that Charleston became one of the largest Jewish communities in North America. The Jewish Coming Street Cemetery, first established in 1762, attests to their long-standing presence in the community. The first Anglican church, St. Philip's Episcopal, was built in 1682, although later destroyed by fire and relocated to its current location. Slaves also comprised a major portion of the population, and were active in the city's religious community.

No-one helped me. my parents then sent me to a private schoo, and lied to the head tecaher saying that I wasn't behind in my schholwork..when I was..seriously behind.... I found I couldn't keep up with the work..by the end of the year I couldn't cope anymore and because I didn't know what to do...refused to go to school altogether.(this was the end of my third year in high school) I was then at home with 3 measly hours of home tuition in only Englah and art....for the next 2 years. I got G grades in my GCSEs (apart from English) what I need to know is.....when I was at the end of my 3rd year and then went to ahve home tuition...how could I have fixed the situation then/ what could I have done?

question_title: Is it best to send my 5Th grade girl to a school she hates and where many girls bullying her or to homeschool? [SEP] question_content: We have tried our public school many times (started a new year fresh in 3rd & 4th grades)but still the same group of girls bully her by ignoring her,making up mean rumors, and trying to ruin other friendships she tries to make with the other kids in class. Our girl is cute, petite, & smart but on the shy side and tends to let these girls get the best of her. This group of girls are that bully are 10 going on 17 mentally, and unfortunately have mothers that are in the "in crowd" with the school board members and many school personnel. So the school teachers just turn their head when things happen and let these girls run the school basically. I thought about getting a lawyer even, but they would probably turn things around & make us look like some kind of psycho parents or something. Plus I don't want to make things worse on our daughter. I have been homeschooling her off & on, but this takes it toll on me and I want to finish my nursing degree and go to work.\nAny ideas?\nThank you. [SEP] best_answer: I would suggest that you let her remain in public schools, mostly because she is already shy, home schooling will just withdraw her from more social interaction.  You have two options, let your daughter know that everyone goes thru phases and that she should ignore the "bullies" and focus on her school work and friends in which case the bullies will either give up because they know it doesnt bother her anymore or hopefuly they will grow up.  your other option would be to see if you area has another local school that has open enrollment that would alow her to change school districts and give her a fresh start.

question_title: is there such such thing as a guarenteed scholarship? [SEP] question_content: where can i get a guarenteed scholarship. ? [SEP] best_answer: There are scholarships out there and many. Some are renewable and some are not. Colleges do offer merrit scholarships if you meet certain criteria and maintain it in areas such as grades. Most outside scholarships are judged by an interview or a written essay. Doing your homework about the organization really helps. I will provide sources for both application tips and locating scholarships. Each of these items do not cost a single penny.\n\nFirst, apply at FAFSA.ed.gov the fall semester before you start college. It will help you tap into need based financial aid from the federal government and the college itself.\n\nSecond, if you are a current high school student, check with your high school guidance office because they have a list of local scholarships and requires only an application to get consideration on receiving it.\n\nThird, 35 states have a websites where high school students can apply for college admission and for state college grants by searching Google.com and Yahoo.com for it. If your state is not one of these states, search your state government's website.\n\nFourth, the college's financial aid website lists private scholarships offered by companies and organizations.\n\nFifth, search Google.com and Yahoo.com for scholarships based on your ethnicity, college major, and religion. There are scholarships out there based on these items.\n\nFinally, join several free membership scholarship websites. Most are updated on a regular basis.\n\nIf a company is promising you guaranteed scholarships for a fee, do not do it. Much of the work can be done by yourself for free. Unless your time is very tight, do not use the service. However, the fee could be better spent.\n\nI did notice from one source I came across that a guaranteed scholarship came from colleges and universities. The student met certain criteria such as grades or being a member of the National Honor Society. There is a list at Guaranteed-scholarships.com. It is a small list of colleges, and the scholarships are listed by college and shows the amount.\n\nGood luck!	Education & Reference
question_title: What is the origin of the word 'bye' ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hi\nNo doubt more than one reader has wondered exactly how goodbye is derived from the phrase “God be with you.” To understand this, it is helpful to see earlier forms of the expression, such as God be wy you, god b'w'y, godbwye, god buy' ye, and good-b'wy. The first word of the expression is now good and not God, for good replaced God by analogy with such expressions as good day, perhaps after people no longer had a clear idea of the original sense of the expression. A letter of 1573 written by Gabriel Harvey contains the first recorded use of goodbye: “To requite your gallonde [gallon] of godbwyes, I regive you a pottle of howdyes,” recalling another contraction that is still used.\nregards\nrca	Education & Reference

question_title: key ring.....? [SEP] question_content: if i have a project ,is about key ring  what can i write? [SEP] best_answer: A keyring is a ring of material, usually metal or plastic, that holds keys and other small items, which are sometimes connected to keychains.\n\nThe most common form of key ring is a metal ring consisting of two complete loops. Either end of the loop can be pried open to allow a key to be inserted and slid along the spiral until it becomes wholly engaged onto the ring. Often the ring is adorned with a key fob making identification easy and possibly also identifying the purpose of the keys.\n\nOther forms of rings may use a single loop of metal or plastic with a mechanism to open and securely close the loop.\n\nIn the cryptography sense, a keyring stores known encryption keys. For example, GNU Privacy Guard uses the concept of keyrings.\n\nA key fob is a decorative item many people often carry with their keys, on a ring or a chain, to provide a better grip or to make a personal statement.\n\nFobs vary in size and style. Most common are simple shapes of smooth metal or plastic, often with a message or symbol. A fob may be strictly symbolic, or it may be functional itself. For examples, many fobs are small flashlights, compasses, calculators, penknives, store discount cards, bottle openers, or USB flash drives.\n\nElectronic key fobs are used for remote keyless entry systems on motor vehicles. Early electric key fobs operated using infrared and required a clear line of sight to function. These could be copied using a programmable remote control. More recent models use challenge-response authentication over radio frequency, so these are harder to copy and do not need line of sight to operate.\n\nKey fobs are increasingly used in apartment buildings and condominium buildings for access to common areas (ie. lobby doors, storage areas, fitness room, pool). They can be programmed to allow access only to those areas in which the tenant or owner is permitted to access, or only within certain time frames.\n\nTelecommuters may also use an electronic device known as a key fob that provides one part of a three way match to log in over an unsecure network connection to a secure network. This kind of key fob may have a keypad on which the user must enter a PIN into to retrieve an access code, or it could be a display-only device such as a VPN token that algorithmically generates security codes as part of a challenge/response authentication system. The most well-known example of the latter type is RSA's SecurID token.\n\nA keychain or key chain is a small chain, usually made from metal or plastic, that connects a small item to a keyring. The length of a keychain allows an item to be used easier than if connected directly to a keyring. Some keychains allow one or both ends the ability to rotate, keeping the keychain from becoming twisted while the item is being used.\n\nA keychain can also be a connecting link between a keyring and the belt of an individual. It is usually employed by personnel whose job demands frequent use of keys, such as a security guard, prison officer, janitor, or retail store manager. The chain is often retractable, and therefore may be a nylon rope instead of an actual metal chain. The chain ensures that the keys remain attached to the individual using them, makes accidental loss less likely, and saves on wear and tear on the pockets of the user.\n\nA keychain can also be a short chain used to link together a number of keys or other items.

question_title: I have a lot of belly fat on my stomach will crunches alone make it go away.? [SEP] question_content: Or will my stomach tone up underneath and the belly fat stay there. [SEP] best_answer: It depends on whether it actually is belly fat, or untrained abdominal muscles.  The former can be helped with good diet and some loss of weight, the latter crunches will solve.  Of course, both of these work only in time.  What you also have to account for is the fact that abdominal muscles are not necessarily supposed to be 'pancake flat' yet we as a society seem to be completely obsessed with it..deeming anything but that as inadequate.  Don't fall into this trap, you may naturally have a slight curve to your belly which you are unable to get rid of. \n\nSo, yes, belly fat will stay there no matter how much you do crunches..if that is all you are doing.

question_title: weed allergies? [SEP] question_content: i'm highly allergic to weeds i irrigate 15 acres for the cows, and my eyes swell bad i've tryed every allergy product on the market is there any organic solution available out there [SEP] best_answer: I have bad allergies. Have you tried Zyrtec or Zyrtec D, or maybe Singular. My brother has asthma and Singular and Clariten helped the most. I don't know if that helped or not, but if you haven't taken those then try them. The only other advice I could give you is to go to the local allergist and get a test(where they prick you) and then start getting shots. Basically all the shots are is everything you are allergic to, that is so you can build up an "immunity" to them. The shots helped my brother and he no longer has major probs with asthma. Hope you feel better and find a solution. Good Luck,\n                                Chelsea	Health

question_title: i need to eat healthy but i always seem to mess up,any tips that will help me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods. You need more than 40 different nutrients for good health, and no single food supplies them all. Your daily food selection should include bread and other whole-grain products; fruits; vegetables; dairy products; and meat, poultry, fish and other protein foods. How much you should eat depends on your calorie needs. Use the Food Guide Pyramid and the Nutrition Facts panel on food labels as handy references. \n\nEnjoy plenty of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Surveys show most Americans don't eat enough of these foods. Do you eat 6-11 servings from the bread, rice, cereal and pasta group, 3 of which should be whole grains? Do you eat 2-4 servings of fruit and 3-5 servings of vegetables? If you don't enjoy some of these at first, give them another chance. Look through cookbooks for tasty ways to prepare unfamiliar foods. \n\nMaintain a healthy weight. The weight that's right for you depends on many factors including your sex, height, age and heredity. Excess body fat increases your chances for high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, some types of cancer and other illnesses. But being too thin can increase your risk for osteoporosis, menstrual irregularities and other health problems. If you're constantly losing and regaining weight, a registered dietitian can help you develop sensible eating habits for successful weight management. Regular exercise is also important to maintaining a healthy weight. \n\nEat moderate portions. If you keep portion sizes reasonable, it's easier to eat the foods you want and stay healthy. Did you know the recommended serving of cooked meat is 3 ounces, similar in size to a deck of playing cards? A medium piece of fruit is 1 serving and a cup of pasta equals 2 servings. A pint of ice cream contains 4 servings. Refer to the Food Guide Pyramid for information on recommended serving sizes. \n\nEat regular meals. Skipping meals can lead to out-of-control hunger, often resulting in overeating. When you're very hungry, it's also tempting to forget about good nutrition. Snacking between meals can help curb hunger, but don't eat so much that your snack becomes an entire meal. \n\nReduce, don't eliminate certain foods. Most people eat for pleasure as well as nutrition. If your favorite foods are high in fat, salt or sugar, the key is moderating how much of these foods you eat and how often you eat them. \nIdentify major sources of these ingredients in your diet and make changes, if necessary. Adults who eat high-fat meats or whole-milk dairy products at every meal are probably eating too much fat. Use the Nutrition Facts panel on the food label to help balance your choices. \n\nChoosing skim or low-fat dairy products and lean cuts of meat such as flank steak and beef round can reduce fat intake significantly. \n\nIf you love fried chicken, however, you don't have to give it up. Just eat it less often. When dining out, share it with a friend, ask for a take-home bag or a smaller portion. \n\n\nBalance your food choices over time. Not every food has to be "perfect." When eating a food high in fat, salt or sugar, select other foods that are low in these ingredients. If you miss out on any food group one day, make up for it the next. Your food choices over several days should fit together into a healthy pattern. \n\nKnow your diet pitfalls. To improve your eating habits, you first have to know what's wrong with them. Write down everything you eat for three days. Then check your list according to the rest of these tips. Do you add a lot of butter, creamy sauces or salad dressings? Rather than eliminating these foods, just cut back your portions. Are you getting enough fruits and vegetables? If not, you may be missing out on vital nutrients. \n\nMake changes gradually. Just as there are no "superfoods" or easy answers to a healthy diet, don't expect to totally revamp your eating habits overnight	Health

He needs the equivalent of three 8oz bottles of milk a day for the calcium and protein found in milk.

Those are especially good for people with arthritis. Also, if you cannot perform any kind of cardio activity, I would recommend going to the sauna or hot tub, to get the blood flowing and your metabolism kicking.\nAlso, watch what you are eating and your calorie consumption.\nLosing weight is a hard endeavor and I’m confident you’ll do well. ;)\n\nGood Luck!

If your sleep pattern is constantly disturbed, preventing you from getting to the REM sleep phase, then that may be the problem even if you are getting 8-9 hours of sleep.\n\nSleep apnea is one condition that can cause this problem. Causes of sleep apnea include obesity, swollen or enlarged adenoids or just problems with your neck/facial/airway anatomy. You can consult your regular physician if you have problems and you may need to go to a sleep testing center to determine if you do have sleep apnea.\n\nOr you may just be like me - I used to fall asleep all the time in classes, especially when they turn out the light.

question_title: Weightlifting vs toning? [SEP] question_content: Hi there, I am trying to get rid off fat, and want to tone my muscles but, don't want to gain a lot of muscle. Lately I have started doing weights and I don't increase the amount weights I use, but it still looks like I am getting bigger. I do carido about 3 times a week. Any suggestions? I weight about 195 and usually use 30-35 weights [SEP] best_answer: Maybe you will get a little bigger if you gain muscle faster than you lose fat.  If you have just started using weights, then I doubt you just want to "tone" muscle - you can't tone muscle that you don't have, and if you haven't been lifting for a while already, I doubt you have much to tone.  Up your cardio to five times a week, and try making your weight lifting like circuit training - go from one exercise immediately into another, e.g. deadlifts, bicep curls, squat jumps, push ups, repeat five times.

question_title: how long does it take to recover from rotater cuff surgery? I do tree work and it has been 3 monthes PAIN? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I agree with the previous answerers - it should take around 6 months to fully heal.\n\nYou are really at risk of tearing it again with your heavy work so soon after surgery.\n\nGood physical therapy after this type of surgery is crucial.  They will gradually progress you through a strengthening and mobility program.  Using weights is not always the best way to go.  Ask your therapist to perform closed chain exercises and rhythmic stabilization exercises as a part of your program - these are more functional exercises and will make you less liable to re-injury.  They should also be using modalities like electrical stimulation to decrease pain and swelling, ultrasound to help with the scar tissue, massage to stretch the scar tissue and shoulder joint.  If you are not getting one-on-one time with your therapist - time to look elsewhere!!\n\nMy mainstays in treating patients include using accupressure points using microstimulation and Kinesio Tape.  If you can find a therapist who knows these techniques, it will really speed up your recovery.\n\nGood luck!	Health

It's something you shouldn't let go. You actually should go to the emergency room; if it is infection it could be really bad by the time you can see the doc on Monday. Better safe than sorry because it could make you very sick.  You're paying the price right now by beating yourself up over it.  Take a big deep breath, forgive yourself and don't worry about what others could be thinking about you.  And I'm going out on the Jesus limb right now but He will forgive you, you can forgive yourself and you'll get on with your life and do good things.  I'm not saying you will forget about it and never think about it again but you can get out there and do some positive things with your life and it will be better.  Time and forgiveness is a good healer.  I'll pray for you tonight but you do need to get to the doctor to be sure you don't have an infection!!!!!!	Health

question_title: what causes post delivery facial&pedal oedema? [SEP] question_content: My friend's wife developed facial&pedal oedema and frequent headaches after delivering in the tenth month.Apart from this she looks and feels ok. [SEP] best_answer: Blood pressure issues are not uncommon after delivery.  She needs to get this checked..  It is possible that her blood pressure is high.  This can be a very insidious problem and only getting an accurate reading will help.   \n\nSometimes it seems as though the ob/gyn just drops you after the baby is delivered and you have made it past the 6 weeks....  so if they will not see her then her primary care person would be good.  Edema usually signals circulation problems and is worth getting checked out.	Health

(4pm - 8pm, M-Thur, and some weekend hours)\n\nI really want to lose some weight, and I'm not giving up on either job.  What's the best way to exercise during the weekend and eat well when I'm on such structured schedule?\n\nLittle pieces of advice is better than general statements, please. [SEP] best_answer: I agree with cuz - you look healthy and probably not too overweight.  Still, you (like all of us) need to do things to stay healthy, both exercise and right diet - it's easy for two jobs to do a number on you if you don't watch out.\n\nSpecific suggestions:\n1) Pack your own lunch, and make it the night before (or make a few on the weekend) - you'll control your intake, and your budget, much better than if you find yourself rushing to some food joint that either overfeeds you or turns it out fast.\n2) Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator whenever you have the chance.  If taking the bus or subway, get off a the next furthest stop and walk the extra 2 or 3 blocks.  If you drive and park, park at the far end of the lot (keeping your personal safety in mind, of course).\n3) Buy some very light (3 pounds or less) weights to have at home or at desk at work - do a few light stretches, curls, up-downs with them when you have the chance (and don't be self-conscious).\n4) Buy a body ball - one of those big inflated balls you see at a gym or in a physical therapists office - and a book on doing exercise with a body ball.  Keep it at home and do it while you watch TV before you go to bed.\n5) Take ONE class a week at your local gym - in either a purely aerobic class (step, spinning) or a yoga or tai chi.  This can be a very early morning or a weekend.\n6) Is there a walking club at either of your jobs?  A group of people who take a brisk 15-minute walk at lunch?  join them, or start one.\n\nThese suggestions won't take too much time or money, and you'll start to feel great and have more energy within a month.\n\nGood luck!

When working out your rotator cuff, be careful, it is a very small muscle that only takes very little resistance to properly work out.  You can very easily damage the muscle if you work it too vigorously.  You can find exercises on line, or look for upper body workout books.  Make sure you get one that is specifically for men or women.  Our bodies require different intensities.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: Ah, prom. Good memories! Anyways, let me begin by saying that natural is a very in look right now. If you want to look romantic, I suggest some cheap mascara, because you wouldn't want to have too long lashes, and some lightly tinted pink lip gloss layered over a bit of red lipstick faded near the ends of the lips with a bit of cotton. Blush is a must, and for radiant skin, I suggest a Neutrogena facial scrub, one of my favorites! Tweeze your eyebrows so only the main brows show, getting rid of any excess hairs in between or around the brows, and finally, sweep your hair out of your face so that it looks nice and fresh.\n\nI hope you make the sweetest of memories!\n\n~Veronica	Health

Does it really hurt to binge and purge sometimes?????????? [SEP] best_answer: hi :) am not sure whats available in the markets...but, this is what i did to lose weight... PLEASE DONT TAKE PILLS... pills are nothing but anorectic agents... they make you feel less hungry... there is no way to loose weight fast... though , sauna , steam and massages help slightly... it has to be combined with diet and excercise... pills are very bad in the long run... can lead to impotency and infertility...\n\nAlso... short term diets are no good because , they terribly pull down your body metabolism rate since you dont eat much during that period ... Because of this , once you break your diet , you'll start putting on more weight, the reduced body metabolism will take longer and slower to burn the food you take in...\n\nThey also dont work because once you break your diet and start eating normally, you will get back to your normal weight as you might not be cautious as to how many cals you take in per day...\n\n\ni lost 10 kgs in about 5 months time... i am getting married in august and i desperately needed to loose weight... i was 65 kilos when i started... according to my BMI , i was 10kgs + overweight... i stand 5'2.odd and 65 kilos is grossly overweight...\n\njust dieting wont help like i found out in my case... diet + exercise will do the trick...\n\ni'll tell you what i did... it worked for me... hope it works for you too :)\n\nthe trick is not to starve but to eat smart :) and stay healthy :)\n\nwhat you should cut down :\noil , butter , cheese , margarine , mayonisse , sauces (depends , will get back to that a bit later), chips , crisps, nuts , chocolates , sugar , cola, fizz , areated drinks ,ice creams , chocolate , alcohol , cakes and everything else thats hi - cal... you'll need to avoid everything thats sweet , oily and sticky... if you are not sure about what foods to avoid... check the net...loads of info available...\n\nvegetables / meat to avoid :\npotatoes - very very important , beetroot (its a root and has concenterated sugar in it) , all kinds of roots basically except carrot... avoid lamb, mutton , pork , beef, and prawns... all these put on weight... eat only lean meats... thats fish and chicken.. avoid eating egg yolk... eat just the egg white...\n\nfruits to avoid :\nmangoes , bananas , jackfruit\n\n\nnow that we had a look at what foodstuff is to be avoided...you might be wondering if there is anythig at all that you can eat... thats how i felt... there is loads of stuff you can eat actually :)\n\nhere they come :)\n\nfast foods are a big no no... you can order salads and special lo cal foods that are avaailable in most outlets...\n\nits best to eat at home for the period you are dieting and trying to lose weight...after those few months... once you've shed your load...you can get back to your usual lifestyle... of course with some caution...\n\n\nmy diet...\nbreakfast:\n\nskimmed milk (use skimmmed milk , is low in fat , other typer of milk are higher in fat content) , fruit... i am from India... am not sure where you are from and hence you might not understand certain food types we consume here... but let me tell you something...

She said at the most maybe some physical therapy. But w/ her head hurting so much I'm worried.\n\nAny suggestions? [SEP] best_answer: Your doctor is wrong..He is not an authority on what a doctor of chiropractic is able to accomplish. As long as there is not a corrective measure taken, this will continue and cause additional problems in the future. Someone this young should respond quite dramatically. Whiplash is something well handled by Chiropractic care... is routine.\n\nThis is a structural problem and there is nothing more your doctor can do to treat it.

You can have a hair anaylsis done too to see how much you have.  Avoid aluminum cookware and commercial deodorants and antipersperants.

There are meningeal veins that share drainage from the triangle and the meninges of the brain. I don't know about pulling eyebrows, but for certain popping zits. If you should be the unlucky one who pops zits and seeds bacteria into this circulation a deadly brain infection can result. It does not mean it is going to happen, so people saying they are still here is no argument. It is possible to happen and that you can take to the bank.	Health

question_title: Does wearing socks cause males to lose hair around their ankles/legs? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Lineback ...\n\nThe socks are part of the problem.\nThe main problem is ... already poor circulation in the legs, and the socks just cut off what little there still is.\n\nLots of lifestyle things cause poor circulation in the legs.\nGetting little or no exercise is the main one, since hair growth depends on good circulation.\nAnother is smoking.  Say goodbye to good circulation when you smoke.\nAnother is eating too much sugar.  This causes imbalances that severely strain the body's strength to cope.\nGetting little or no sun on one's skin is actually a problem, too.  Not too much sun, just enough.	Health

question_title: What is the best AB workout machine inn the market? [SEP] question_content: Summer is close, so I need some great advice. [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely, positively, without a doubt NONE!!!  Save your money and stay away from any and all AB machines if your interested in showing off a six pack.  \n\nFor the upper abs, focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.\n\nFor the lower abs, keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area.\n\nRegarding exercises for the lower abs, you need to try and disengage your hip flexors (psoas muscles) as much as possible so that they don't override any efforts to contract your abs. That's why it's very important to never anchor your feet under any fixed device when doing situps. \n\nHanging leg raises, v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region.\nAlways make sure your pelvis curls up to maximize lower abdominal contraction during these exercises.\n\nHere's a link with a complete list of ab exercises:\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/Strength_Exercises_abdominals.html\n\nAlso here's a tool to help you evaluate your stength in this region compared to the population average (note: only anchor your feet for testing purposes only and not during your workouts)\n\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/sit-up_test.html\n\nI would advise to seek the advice of a personal trainer for proper execution and intensity.

question_title: About Crest Whitestrips...? [SEP] question_content: For a long while now, I've been looking at the unused box of crest whitestrips in my cabinet, and about five days ago I decided to use them. I've always been cautious of using them, because I heard that they give you white dots on your teeth, but I looked it up and apparently they go away after a few hours.\n\nHowever, now, there were white lines that are going across the bottom of my front teeth, and they haven't gone away, and only persist the more that I use the whitestrips.

question_title: Why do wealthy families often produce children who are not capable/motivated in life? [SEP] question_content: I have seen many rich friends, who have very wealthy parents, squander tons of money away on cars, girls, and high life. They often promise or say something, but never accomplish or do it. They do not seem to have a direction in life either. \n\nI know that humans are young and should enjoy life during this age, but by observing these friends, I think they are just wasting their life away...\n\nCould it be poor upbringing? Do they need to face adversity and poverty, before they can appreciate opportunities and learn to spend money wisely? [SEP] best_answer: Because, unlike those of us, who when growing up had to work for what we wanted and knew that if we needed something then we would have to be determined to get it, rich kids always had what they wanted handed to them on a platter and therefore never built up any desire for anything.\n\nI'm motivated in life because I know I have to work for what I want but do they?

question_title: will iever get bak with my ex-girlfriend cause i do miss her so much? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Your chances are low right now, I'm sorry.  You didn't give the circumstances surrounding the break up; but the fact is that when you feel lonely, even the people you trust most aren't going to be attracted to you.  That's human nature --- to shun the needy.  She isn't likely to view the potential of your relationship in the long run; more likely, she'll see you as a desperate man with no self respect.   \nYou use the word "ever", so if you get over her, find someone else (someone you are truly happier with), you probably will make her jealous.  Do NOT believe it if she says she would be happy if you found someone else!  That's, in fact, a bluff whether she knows it or not.	Family & Relationships

I stayed up around the fire with all the rest as were drinking up a storm. My boyfriend and I have been having relationship problems in the past and myself and a couple of guys stayed up till the birds came out  talking about it, they really helped me. The problem is I we ended up in our camper trailer as it started to rain and then I ended up on my knees in front of them both.\n\nIs this cheating as I never took off my clothes ? + what should I do if my husband gets suspicious and asks anything as we have been married form 18 years and we both want to continue to get through this roug time.\n\nS [SEP] best_answer: Well I'm confused about a couple of things. Is he your husband of 18 years or your boyfriend or is the boyfriend someone else other than the other two guys you were unfaithful to your significant other with. YES of course you cheated. You engaged in a sexual act with not just one but two other men.\nAlcohol is no excuse for a lack of self control. You may not remember in the morning( though you did) but you certainly know what you are doing at the time it's happening know matter how intoxicated you are. Where exactly did your husband or whatever he is crash out? Was he in the camper van also.? My Gosh what were you thinking? I'm trying not to be judgmental here, because I hate that and it serves no purpose but heavens above, I can't find a reason to condone infidelity. 18years is a lot to throw away, you should have thought about that before you cheated. I would not want to stay with a person that was unfaithful. If your man does find out the responsibility is yours and yours alone.	Family & Relationships

Chest hair is sexy  and so are hairless chests but hair all over a guys back is repulsive.  If a man has a hairy back he should have it permanently removed .

If you do, please have your Mom take you to see a doctor as soon as you can, it maybe a yeast infection. \n\nIf you do not have any discharge, it could be a couple of things.....\n\nMaybe an allergic reaction?  Has your Mom change brands of laundry soap/bleach/softener? How about bath soaps? Have you tried any new foods or drinks that maybe causing an allergic reaction? Or have you taken any meds you have never taken before?  How about toilet paper, is it the same brand always used?\n\nCould be your jeans are too tight (sounds funny but it can make you itchy and uncomfortable if your jeans are 'creeping' up in that area)\n\nAre you having any problem urinating?  burning? discolored urine?

[SEP] question_content: to play with him,he wants his mommy.sometimes when im alone with him hes the sweetest behave little guy but as soon as dad is in the picture he wants to argue fight and rebel.he becomes emoitionally upset if his dad even raises his voice.If i need to go to the store the whole time he says wheres mom,lets go find her im not sure what to make of it.dad quit job six months ago and hasnt worked since i dont know if this is playing a part of it,the whole lack of respect. [SEP] best_answer: theres definately something more behind that.  usually fathers and sons have weird relationships and do vie for the mothers attention but there seems to be some reason he resents his father.  \nmaybe its how his father acts towards him?  is he abusive, cold, etc?  do you talk bad about his father in front of him, or do others?  \ntheres a lot of reasons this may be happening and the only true way to figure this out is to talk to your son.  sit your son down when there are no distractions and ask him why he doesn't like being with his father and try to get to the root of this problem...then take it from there.

You are two human beings no matter what the differences are. Some say that opposites attract and viva la difference ... so be happy with each other and throw care to the wind.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Wow - did he call me stupid? [SEP] question_content: Last night my guy-friend & I had a really intense conversation where he basically told me I had no chance in hell.  I asked him why and...\n\nhe said "because of the intellectual connection - for one.."\nI said "Are you calling me stupid?"\nhe said "no just i can't talk to you at a certain level"\nI said "damn, you can be fuc*ing harsh."\nhe said "straight forward and no I didn't want to tell you that.."\n\nSo, I got called stupid, yes? [SEP] best_answer: I wouldn't say that you were called stupid. Sometimes, people cannot relate to other people when it comes to certain things (conversations, interests, goals etc.). Maybe he meant that you all do not have a lot in common. I wouldn't necessarily say that he called you stupid.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why is it that girls need to go to the bathroom with other girls all the time?? Still don't understand why. [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It's like a bonding thing. We go in there and gossip, talk about plans, and also, we are always afraid of being stranded with no toilet paper, lipgloss,tampon, etc.\n\nSo we go in groups so that if someone needs something usually a companion can go get whatever they need, or has it in thier purse. \n\nThat's what we tell you anyways. We actually go in there to practice making out with each other and hide furniture and TV's.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Is having children selfish? [SEP] question_content: Think about it for a second. What is the reason and where is the motivation coming from? Do most people have childrean more or less because that's what they think they're 'supposed to do'?\n\nIs there a reason for having children that isn't a selfish one? "I want to have kids because I want to love them." "I want to have kids because I want to have a family (just like/better than I did when I was a kid)." "I want to have kids because I love my spouse and I want to see how our kids would turn out." Or my personal favorite: "I want to have kids so someone can take care of me when I'm old." In case you don't see the pattern, there are a lot of 'I's and 'me's in those sentences.\n\nPlease help me understand. [SEP] best_answer: Sometimes I think it is...because I have been telling my mom all my life that when I get married I wanna adopt, rather than have my own. But my mom wants me to have them because she says its so different to have your own. And that when you have your own they look like you, you love them more, and it's better for yourself. I don't know...but to me, having your own kids is sorta selfish when there are soo many children out there without families. Also, there is a 40 year old lady at my church, who just got custody of her 17 year old step son. He was totally not brought up right with his real mom and he really needs a lot of attention, and all she could think about was having her own child. So now she has a 1 year old, and she's pregnant again, and she totally ignores her step son. To me, that's very selfish!!! I don't know, I guess it depends on the person though.

question_title: Would you be more interested in the socialite or the one who gives you individual attention? [SEP] question_content: At a gathering, I'm trying to make a girl interested in me. Do girls find the guy who chats with everyone more attractive or the one who specifically pays attention to them? [SEP] best_answer: Well being the quiet type myself I don't tend to like the party animals.  I prefer a guy who has friends but isn't loud, smiles and has a laugh but isn't arrogant, and eventually focuses his attention on me.  In an ideal world anyway!	Family & Relationships

question_title: how do I get my friend, who's a girl, to open to me more about her problems outside of school? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Let her know that you are there to listen if she needs it.  Don't pressure her to talk or she may pull away more.

question_title: What do you think about an 18yr old getting married? [SEP] question_content: Seriously, be mature about it. Don't give some shit faced answer like 'zomg itz so dum'.\n\nMe and my boyfriend plan on getting married before he goes to airforce. So it'd be...soon. Not too sure when, but possibly within the next 2-3 months.\n\nWe've been together for 3yrs and 6 months. Neither of us have any doubts, we're just ready. Not to mention all the benifits of him being in the airforce and married. They send extra money home.\n\nAnyway, I'm 18, 19 in october, and he's 20, 21 next saturday.\n\nWhat is your opinion on young people getting married? I've heard a few different answers from the people I work with, and they have very different views on it.\n\nI personally think if someone knows the person they're with and is ready....Then they're ready. I don't think it's right for one person to tell someone else 'you aren't ready for this' even though they can't expirience the relationship themselves. [SEP] best_answer: Are you ready to be married and be alone?  This isn't about money or status, it is about two people that can handle staying commited and true no matter what and at your age that is a lot to bite off.\nI bit it at 18 and found at 30 that I really felt I had missed out on lots of fun.\nIf your love is real it will weather the time in the airforce and still be strong when he returns.  I suggest waiting so that you both still have the freedom without regret to experience the rest of maturing.	Family & Relationships
question_title: how can i get back at him? [SEP] question_content: well abotu i donno awhile ago not that long me and my man broke up i was totaly in love with him but he was always ditching me and made not very much of an effort. we were doing sort of long distance, well about an hour away...anyways short we hada fight i said i was fed up with him not putting in any effort and if he wasnt gonna put more in he could at least move to the town clsoer to me cuz he was offered a job there.  he did netierh of them and i drove home that night. i think i hurt him but after that i started obsessively calling him cuz i didnt wanna loose him but its like he got over it in a second...words cant DESCRIBE how he hurt me...ive stopped calling....he said hed call when he was back from work...cuz he decided to move away the second we broke up....how can i get back at hima nd hurt him how he hurt me? [SEP] best_answer: give him the silent treatment, what he did was wrong, and you deserve to be treated better than that.  Maby change your phone number, and ignore him completely.  Then work on finding a guy who will treat you with the respect and kindness you deserve. Or if he straightens up, then try it again, I recommend, finding a better guy, though.  Good luck!\n\nSavage	Family & Relationships
question_title: Who gets horny quickly is it the teenaged gals r the 30 year old mature women?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my experience, the older I have become, the stronger my libido has become. A woman's sexual desire usually peaks in her thirties.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Is he a love rat? [SEP] question_content: I have been seeing this guy for a couple of months,we do the type of things couples do.....but the other day he said he wants to keep things casual,he enjoys the time he spends with me,thinks I am attractive,but does not want to have anything serious for the time being,just to take things as they come along and if they develop then take it further.\n\nI am wondering should I just dump him,or should I should I give him a chance? \n\nI am confused as I really like him,but I don't want to end just being used! [SEP] best_answer: I would emotionally distance yourself from him.  You can remain friends, but I would start looking elsewhere.\n\nIt may be that if you hook up with someone else, he'll realize he might lose you, and that might give him the kick in the butt he needs.  Or he could get jealous and retaliate.  If he has no reaction, it may just mean he's not that into you.\n\nEither way, prepare to move on.  I'm not saying you should find someone to make him jealous; that's just self-defeating.	Family & Relationships

question_title: is masturbation bad for u? [SEP] question_content: is it bad for u i have heard myths about it is it really bad ? [SEP] best_answer: How can masturbating excessively so often bad for you? And what is impotence EXACTLY?\n \nMasturbation is neither good nor bad, depending on how often you can afford to do so without affecting the functions of other organs. In one recently published study, ninety-five percent of men and eighty-seven percent of women have practiced masturbation occasionally. The study further indicated those men usually experience an orgasm when they masturbate and learn how to masturbate before engaging in any sexual intercourse. Another important finding showed males who masturbate frequently during adolescence continue this sexual behavior into their adulthood with the frequency increasing. Is this addictive behavior of masturbation harmful to your body? To answer this question, one has to understand how ejaculating works. An orgasm or ejaculation discharges the bioelectric energy (bio-energy) stored by the parasympathetic nervous subsystem via the sympathetic nervous action. It is supposed to discharge the bio-energy stored in the sexual organs. This is why an orgasm is associated with a burst and subsequent release of tension. When the sexual organs are insufficiently charged, the sympathetic system will draw the energy from other organs, deactivating the associated organs and slowing down the response of the Central Nervous System (CNS) which is the commander of the endocrine and nervous function. So, frequent masturbation and consequent ejaculation will result in depleting other organs of bio-energy since the sexual organs can’t support the release of bio-energy being drawn from over-masturbation. The association of masturbation with guilt and anxiety is partly due to the ignorance of the fact masturbation is not harmful. These negative sentiments are partly due to centuries of religious teachings that masturbating is sinful. In addition, many of us have received negative messages about masturbation from our parents or have even been punished when caught masturbating as children. The cumulative effect of these influences is usually confusion and guilt, which is often difficult to sort out. However, the only time masturbation can be ‘bad’ or harmful is when it becomes compulsive. Compulsive masturbation, like all other compulsive behaviors, is a sign of an emotional problem and needs to be addressed by a mental health specialist. Sex, of course, is extremely pleasurable and all things pleasurable are addictive. Over-masturbation can cause serious problems that aren’t limited to the bedroom. Frequent masturbation should be addressed. So, contrary to ancient and popular beliefs, masturbation does not lead to unbridled lust, make you blind or deaf, give you the flu, drive you crazy, grow hair on your hand, make you stutter, or kill you. Rather, masturbation is a natural and harmless expression of sexuality in both men and women and a perfectly good way to experience sexual pleasure. In fact, some experts argue that masturbation improves sexual health by increasing an individual's understanding of his or her own body and of what is erotically pleasing, building self-confidence and fostering self-acceptance. This knowledge can then be carried forth to make for a more satisfying sexual relationship with one's partner, both through each partner's comfort with mutual masturbation and because of the ability to tell each other what is most pleasing. It is a good idea for a couple to discuss their attitudes about masturbation and to calm any insecurities a partner may have if the other should sometimes favor masturbation over sexual intercourse. In some relationships, masturbation may be mutually acceptable. Done alone or in the presence of a partner, the act can be pleasing and add to mutual intimacy if it is not experienced as a rejection. Like most behaviors, without proper communication, the act of masturbation can be a sign of anger, alienation, or displeasure with the way the relationship is progressing.Overcoming society&#	Family & Relationships

question_title: how do i get over this guy? [SEP] question_content: i like him because when we talk on IM, it's like he's the only who understands me and we can talk about anything.  we only see each other like 3 times a year. ihow do i get over him? i think i';m wasting my time because i don't see him that much. it's so hard because the music i listen to reminds me of him. And i can't stop listeining to music so.. i've liked him for about 8 months now... how do i get over him? [SEP] best_answer: Just do it!!  LOL It can be hard. But you need to give your self a little more value.  Obviously, he does not live with you, so you don't need him to survive.  Find yourself another friend.  Go out and do what you like best in the whole world, even if it means taking a walk all by yourself or hiding under your bed.  There are so many men out there, and you will never meet them if you don't go out there to play.  Not everyone you will meet will be nice and you are always going to have expectations but remember treat every individual as an individual don't go looking for a clone.  If you do you just might end up in the same situation.  Think about it, just not too long......life is short enjoy it before it is too late.  Good luck	Family & Relationships
question_title: what does the term 'spooning' mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The spoons position (also spoon position, spooning) is a popular sexual position and intimate cuddling technique. The name derives from the way that two spoons may be positioned side by side, with their bowls aligned.\n\nSexual spoons position\nIn the sexual spoons position, the man lies on his side, with his knees bent while the woman lies on her side, with her back pressed against his front, her legs slightly parted, her hips tilted to one side, and her knees bent. They line up to align his penis with her vagina, and his penis is then guided into her vagina from the rear. It is also possible to use this position for anal sex rather than vaginal sex.\n\nThis position allows for a great deal of physical intimacy, as the full-body contact allows both partners to cuddle and caress one another. The man can provide the woman with clitoral stimulation by hand while engaging in vaginal penetration in this position (or, in the case of anal penetration in this position, the penetrating partner can masturbate the penetrated partner). Low-intensity sex can go on for a long time in this position. However, the lower intensity from this position may not be desired by both parties; furthermore, penetration is quite shallow, and clitoral pressure is not very intense without manual stimulation. In addition, there is little visual stimulation for either party, as they are not facing one another and cannot see each other's bodies clearly.\n\nA modification of this is for the man to place his uppermost leg over the belly of the woman, who may then lie somewhat more on her back, with the knees of both legs drawn up. The man's lower leg is extended under the inverted "V" of those legs, with penetration from beneath those legs. This can be a very comfortable position for both partners and is useful as a resting position between more energetic episodes.\n\n\nNon-penetrative spooning (cuddling technique)\nIt is also vastly popular to use this position (without penetration) simply for cuddling, as it provides close contact and shared body heat. The term spooning usually refers to this activity.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Should I tell my Mother he has kids? and should she Care? [SEP] question_content: I am engaged and she finally met my fiance about 2 days ago.  I didn't mention the fact that he has been married once before and he has 2 sons.  I am 21.  He is 31.  She knows that but really likes him so its okay.  We are getting married soon and thats fine with her too.  But, I think if I bring up the kids, who are 11 and 9 she will be EXTREMELY upset and think I am making a HUGE mistake.  I really love this guy and he means everything to me.  I am going to marry him no matter what, I just want my parents to accept him and make it easier on me. [SEP] best_answer: You should definitely tell your mother that he has children. She's going to find out anyway, right? So sit her down and have a heart to heart with her and explain to her that you're very much in-love with this man AND his children, then ask her to please accept your new family into her heart as well. Most parents want their children to be happy. I'm sure that's all she wants for you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Is it possible for this to work? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been dating 6-7mos, first 1-2 months it was really slow, then the 3rd month it went fast then his grandmother passed away and he blamed his spending so much time with me, the reason why he didnt see her in the hospital when she was responsive, by time he arrived she was non responsive because we went out. ever since the funeral he has been distant and now he is saying we moved to fast and he pretty much ceased everything, quality time, and intimacy (its been over a month). do u think this can survive? [SEP] best_answer: Death is a hard thing to deal with especially when it is someone who you are close to.  Right now he blames himself and feels guilty for not being there for his grandmother.  That is perfectly normal but at some point he needs to realize that no one could predict the exact day she would become non responsive and that in the end his grandmother would rather have him be with you and be having a good time than for him to be in a hospital watching her die.  I think at this point though you need to give him his space but realize that if he isn't able to forgive himself and stop feeling guilty then you two will never be together again.  If he ever does decide to be with you then you two need to talk about his way of dealing with things.  He needs to realize that a relationship is about two people and when something happens to one person in a relationship it affects the other, and if he wants to ever be in a good relationship he needs to let that person in and deal with life together whether it be the good times or the bad times.  If he can't do this then you need to move on and find someone else because I don't think you are the type that can just let someone you love hurt without being there for them.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: how can i get my ex girlfriend back. she syas she loves me but has a boyfriend she loves too. they only been going out for 2 months and were friends before. i need good advice, no bullshit. i luv her so much. [SEP] best_answer: I don't mean to be mean, but it isn't possible for her to love both you and her new boyfriend at the same time. It sounds to me as if she is keeping you on a string just in case the new boyfriend doesn't work out for her. You didn't say why you broke up or if she broke up with you or vice versa, but it sounds to me as if she is enjoying putting you through all of this. I know you don't want to hear this, and I am sorry I have to say it, but I think you need to care enough about yourself to realize you deserve better than being strung along and you need to respect yourself enough to not allow yourself to be played this way. Move on and find that special person who will love and respect you the way that you deserve. Even if you were to blame for the break up, you don't deserve to be treated this way. We all make mistakes. I know this will be hard, but it will be the best thing for you. If she truly loved you she would not be able to hurt you this way. Good Luck! \n\nSS	Family & Relationships
question_title: Pierre or Dustin???????????? [SEP] question_content: Pierre is black and im white but dustin is white and i liked pierre since 3 grade and im in 5th pierre is ............well he is funny nice but dustin is funny and nice and kind I'M CONFUSED HELP??!!!!! [SEP] best_answer: Oh dear. It's a very good,but tough question. I should help you make a concrete decision between two men, Pierre Bossnan  and Dustin Hoffman. Yeah. Pierre is handsome, smart, and black that means something big. Dustin is gentleman like, nice and kind, and of course can make you confused. But why do you have to choose in the first place? Would you marry him or what? If it's still only a date, you should not make any decision now.  Just date the both guys. In the meanwhile, you will get more instinct who you really love and want to spend of your life with. Scientifically, women's instinct is trust-full. Believe me.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Why do married women wear their engagement and wedding rings in one ring finger? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The choice of finger relates to traditions purportedly dating to classical times, from an early usage reportedly referring to the fourth finger of the left hand as containing the vena amoris or "vein of love".  At least in part due to this tradition, it became acceptable to wear the wedding ring on this finger. By wearing rings on the fourth finger of their left hands, a married couple symbolically declares their eternal love for each other. This has now become a matter of tradition and etiquette.

question_title: How to move on from Broken Hearted Divorce? [SEP] question_content: I seperated from my ex-wife about a year and a half ago after she cheated on me and wanted to be with a friend from her past. The divorce just went through last month. We were together for 6 years. I was really close to her family and since I have drifted apart from them as well. I've tried everything I knew how to get over this, but nothing seemed to work. Friends told me to find someone else so I was with another woman for about 6 months but realized I wasn't with her for the right reasons. I moved into an apartment by myself and have had a rough time since. I can't sleep at night, all I can think about is my past life. It's like I've fallen into an empty pit and I can't find my way out. I would appreciate anyones advivce that they may have. [SEP] best_answer: Poor baby.  I do understand.  Been there.\n\nI have a couple of things to offer you.\n\nFirst, you might be depressed.  Check into the possibility of taking some medication for a while.  I had to take Zoloft for 3 months.  It did get me kind of over the hump so that I could stop crying and sleep and eat.  \n\nInvest in YOU... this is a time for you to look inward and grow.  Do something you have always wanted to do.. work out, learn to cook, a foreign language, ball room dance, something you have always wanted to doooo DO it!!!\n\nAnd, I sought help from a divorce support group.  I went to Divorce Care for a few months.  It was really helpful in learning about what I was going through and also they were soo sweet and supportive.  I also went to a few singles meetings.\n\nIt takes time... everyone is different.  It took me almost 3 years to fianally get to where I don't have that anger and saddness.... \n\nBut one thing is for sure, I am AM happier now than I ever thought possible, and I have found a man who loves me more than my ex ever ever did and it feels good.\n\nAnd, I am stronger than I ever felt possible.  In retrospect, it was a gift!  What I thought was the worst thing in the universe and it did nearly kill me, ultimately made my life so much better.  Hard to believe, but true.\n\nGood luck, dear	Family & Relationships
question_title: My ex & I have amazing sex.But he lives w/his old GF from B4 me,says that she doesn't have much interest in [SEP] question_content: sex.

I know how easy it is right now to overanalyze every little detail. Don't. Thats just going to bring you down more. Look into the future, always have hope and take care of yourself.

[SEP] best_answer: You should definitely make her something!  That means more than anything you can buy.  One idea (ok, this is really girly of me, but whatev) would be to make her a picture frame and put a really nice picture of the two of you in it.  I'm doing this for my bf for Christmas.  Basically, I buy a cheap frame, cut out magazine pictures that are relevant to our relationship (i.e. he likes politics, so i've got a little donkey), and then decoupage (special glue) them onto the frame in a sort of collage style.  It always turns out really nice, and they can tell you've put a lot of effort into it.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: I got this alright dear action speaks louder than words i'm sure somewhere deep he does,and the reason she feels threatend by you and your child is because he has gave no indication to her that he will stay and commit thats what shes pushing for. now you must ask yourself this would you like to have a life with a person who does'nt know how to make a decission and see it through and always be caught in some type of drama all through the duration of this relationship? or would you like to keep your chin up and let sleeping dawgs lye where they lye you might feel a little lonley,hurt and being with a child from this person makes you really want to let him in but think of this there is someone out there that knows what he wants in a woman adn you might be her	Family & Relationships

question_title: Why is it so hard to find a good mother for my son? Are my standards too high? Am I not giving it enough time? [SEP] question_content: My wife was killed by a drunk driver in 2003.  I started dating again in 2005.  After 2 or 3 dates, I usually start to compare them with my deceased wife.  There is no comparison.  She was a great mother.  Me, I don't compare how my wife acted and behaved around me, but I compare them to how they act and behave around my son.  If it's not the same, I get rid of them. [SEP] best_answer: Trust your intuition.  It's important and I'm glad you are picky.  She will have a huge affect on your son's life.  IF you really like someone, then maybe give her a bit more time. When my x and I split, he would let any flooz from the bar babysit.  You are right for being picky.  Your son is lucky.  But also try not to hold her to some "perfect" standard.  Your wife was not perfect either, but sounds like she was a good mom.  So good luck to you and your son.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What would you do if...? [SEP] question_content: My ex-boyfriend is trying to get back with me. We were together for a little over a year and have been broken up for 2 months.

I still love him even though we have issues to work on. Would u take an ex back after they told you no? [SEP] best_answer: If you love each other, then, um DUH! Yes, take him back. Maybe he really did need to "get himself together" and now he feels ready to have a relationship. There's nothing wrong with that if it's true. I think it's great if he wanted to work on himself so things don't get messed up anymore between the two of you.

(A BLOB is much like a binary varchar with a preset maximum length.) Then using mysql_real_query you can enter and extract the binary data from the table.\n\nmysql_real_query is the same as mysql_query, but you must give it a query length, since it cannot rely on a NULL character to terminate the query string.

question_title: how far can virtual reality go? [SEP] question_content: could someone live on the internet? [SEP] best_answer: I really don't think it will go that far, living oon the internet, there would be security risks. You would be more likely to find some kind of programme that would simulate it but i don't know, the idea of being data stored on a harddrive being transfered through out the world doesn't sound to great. your TRON like utopia is far from completion. \n\nThe whole concept of using glasses, and other equipment is doesn't grab me. I would prefer if virtual reality started moving more towards Star Treks' Holodeck type virtual reality, but it might be a bit difficult to reproduce the look and feel of, say an apple or physical human beings, in such an enviroment. There most likely would be some kind of suit you would need to wear, that would send signals to your brain so that you thought you were holding an apple.\n\n\nI think it's best we get on with our lives and let the scientists worry about how far they can go. When the time is right we will have earned millions so we can retire and live our VR dreams.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Codepage incompatibility? Can anyone help? [SEP] question_content: I upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows 98 SE. English (US) versions for both. \nAfter upgrading, all the files that had greek characters in their filenames became unusable. All characters were substituted by underscores but the real problem is that the files are not recognized by the file system. While in the windows explorer, they appear in the list with their (underscored) filenames and details (file size etc.) but this is as far as it goes. If I attempt to rename/copy/move/delete I get the error message that the system cannot recognize the file (I think it ends with “ERROR 1031”). \nI don’t know much about computers, but I presume that there may be a codepage incompatibility between my initial installation and the one I did recently (SE)? Perhaps while installing the SE version I was asked something about codepage stuff and I blindly pressed “ok”, although I don’t remember doing so. \nSo, does anyone have any fast, easy and safe idea on how to restore the files?\nThank you in advance [SEP] best_answer: The data is probably (hopefully!) still there, the system just cannot display it.  Head for Control Panel and poke around in Regional Options.  There's an option somewhere around (can't remember where exactly) that allows you to install further language packs - you'll need to reinstall Greek characters.  You may need your Windows 98 disc.

question_title: Can someone give an honest advice or feedback, of what you think about this:? [SEP] question_content: This is not an advertisement. Just looking for honest advice. I started small business, and it is going okay. But I would like to improve it. Can you look at http://www.88cent.com and tell me what you think ? If you like the web site and the deal why do you like it? and if you do not like it why not? Please help me to improve it or see where I need to focus by your honest feedback. It is american dream to own a small business and I love it. Please do not be afraid to be honest, I will not be offended so use criticism as you see it. I will choose best answer shortly. Thank you . [SEP] best_answer: The site looks average and the price is right, but you got me wondering how you can make a profit selling hosting service for $.88 a month.  \n\nI've worked with a number of clients who's hosted sites with various low-cost providers only to have the company go out of business and take their site with them.  When it comes to technology, I think a lot of people think that if it costs more, it must be better and if it seems too good to be true, it usually is.\n\nReading over the site, I see a number of grammatical errors.  This tells me that either 1) the author doesn't speak the language very well or 2) they didn't take the time to proof read the content.  Either way, it doesn't ooze professionalism.\n\nOn the contact us page, it's generally not a good sign when the address at the bottom appears to be a generic ISP account.  Why not at least use use an address such as support@88cent.com?\n\nOn the Platinum page, I find it odd that your portfolio points to pages on the *.1asphost.com domain.  If nothing else, why aren't they hosted by 88cent.com?  If you go to 1asphost.com, they offer a free hosting package which is an even better deal than yours.\n\nThe other thing your site doesn't talk about is what kind of servers you use, if they're in a datacenter or what kind of connection they have to the internet.  For all a user knows, you're hosting it at home over a broadband connection.\n\nJust my $.02.  I wish you all the best for a successful venture!	Computers & Internet

question_title: How do I get around this error when trying to reinstall Windows XP? [SEP] question_content: I'm preparing to sell my old laptop, so I want to get everything off of it and completely reformat the drive.  I get up to the point in the setup where it gives the option of deleting the partition, but it tells me that "Setup is unable to perform the requested operation on the selected partition.  This partition contains temporary Setup files that are required to complete the installation."\n\nI know there has to be some way to bypass this and load the files off of the installation CD rather than the drive, but I can't figure it out.  Any ideas? [SEP] best_answer: Insert the WinXP CD in the CDROM drive (or DVD drive if no CDROM is\navailable). When your computer starts booting, press the DEL key and\nenter the CMOS Setup utility. In the "Advanced" section you should see\nthe boot sequence. Set the first boot device to CDROM and the second\nboot device to HDD0 (that's hard drive zero). Save setting and exit.\nWhen it says "Press any key to boot from CD..." hit enter. Windows will\nstart, load drivers and other necessary files into memory. Follow each\nscreen until you get to the partitioning screen. Choose to delete the\nprimary partition if there is only one. If there are more than one,\ndelete the secondary partition(s) first then the primary. Next create a\nnew partition. Windows setup will then format the drive and install the\nOS.\n\nIf you ignore the message Press any key to boot from CD..." the system\nwill boot from the hard drive after the above steps are completed. Later\ngo back to the CMOS Setup Utility and set the boot sequence back to\nnormal.	Computers & Internet
question_title: How do you contact yahoo? [SEP] question_content: Ever since I turned in a person talking about chilren like adults, I think he reported ALL of my questions.  Not one bad word, not one bad thing in it.  Does yahoo even check into these?  Cause they are about to lose buisness to AOL over it.  Machines automatically delete them I think.  If a real person read them, they would not have been deleted.  So, were they lying about them caring about their own site?  Or just click happy? [SEP] best_answer: Basically, because the Internet encompasses so many different viewpoints, religions, opinions, and ideas, what Yahoo has created by allowing access to anyone, is a haven for the sane, insane, prejudiced, tolerant, Christians, non Christians, liberals, conservatives (you get the idea). When they disagree or annoy each other the abuse button gets clicked and the sheer number of reports makes it impossible to track and provide customer service for each one. \n\nLet us hope that they at least give consideration to reports before completely canceling an account.

question_title: After a power outage, my pc loops except in safe mode. How can i tell if prob is hardware or software? Thanks! [SEP] question_content: Windows keeps shutting down and booting up. My Dell  warranty just ran out on April 13th.  Didn't renew cuz I hadn't had any major probs till now.  \n\nMy son came over and did minor surgery - moved the ram and blew out the dust. The pc was ok for a day or so - then started looping again.  \n\nAn AOL techie was kind enough to help - [Dell charges $99 to even talk to you] and he suggested trying safe mode and a System Restore.  That got me able to boot up with limited functionality. \n\nI'm typing this in safe mode with networking - but have no video/sound or printer/digicam capability.  This limits what I can do on eBay.  I'm semi-retired and live on a fixed income so eBay sales are important.  \n\nIs there any way I can test my pc to see where the problem is?  It will be expensive to take it to a pc doctor.  \n\nMy specs are as follows:  Dell Dimension 4700 (one year old), Pentium IV, 2.8 ghz, 512 ram, Windows XP Home, Verizon DSL.\n\nAny help you can give is appreciated.  Thanks.   ~ zenmoon [SEP] best_answer: dont system restore until nothing else works. if you can get in long enough to do this then do it or boot into safe mode then goto system properties and on the advance tab look down on the Startup and recovery then click settings then go in the re and disable the automatically restart option on the system failure. You are good to go it will give you an error then basically you research the error any way you want to get your answer i do recommend xp pro. xp home has alot of errors because of sp2. that will get you started. i would try also after that press F8 and select last known good configuration from the menu. hope this helps	Computers & Internet

I have added a link below which can tell you some of the problems (I know it refers to access, but much of the information there is still useful).\n\nIf you can connect to your database just fine using other queries, then how you are calling your procedure is the problem. So remove that code just to make sure that everything else is working fine, then focus on the procedure call itself.\n\nIf this is a stored procedure, are you using a command object? Are the parameters correct? Did you create the parameters correctly and are they the right type? Does your stored procedure on the machine run fine (not through asp, run it on the server)\n\nThe second error is more likely because of the first, your call to the procedure is causing it to hang and when you stop IIS it gives you basically a problem with dllhost.exe (that is what asp uses to run code).\n\nSo check out some of the links below and hopefully this can narrow your problem down further. \n\nIn short, test to make sure that ASP is connecting to your database correctly.\n\nGood luck!

What will be the output if the logical operator's order is changed?\n\nPlz clear my doutbt, for it, i'll be grateful\n\nRegards [SEP] best_answer: A1 k is 0 because the expression got short circuited.  Since i and j are non zero values, the value of the || will always be true, so the right side does not need to be evaluated and k is never incremented.\n\nA2 when you switched to put the || first, no short circuiting can occur (since i and j are non zero, k still needs to be evaluated because of the &&).  The value of m is non-determinate in both cases.	Computers & Internet

You do not need to have internet explorer installed on your computer for this to work.  It's been a while since I added mine on so I dont know the best way to find this add-on any more.  Best bet is search 'internet explorer' on the extensions page.  Hope you find it because it works great!	Computers & Internet
question_title: often my wireless is excellent signal but requires restart to allow net access. any way to access w/o restart? [SEP] question_content: I am looking for specific/non-intuitive advice on how to change my wireless settings so that whatever process the wireless card undergoes subsequent to restart (as this invariably allows me to connect to the net) can be achieved without a restart.  \nJust to clarify: \n-Right-click and "Repair" or "Disable" rarely solves the problem, though I always try it of course\n-Resetting the router also works; but please give me an alternative that deals with my computer settings. \n-This typically happens when I have hibernated or did not turn off my computer prior to switching networks.  \n-I use Windows XP\n-I have an Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2915ABG Net [SEP] best_answer: If your system uses a DHCP server at your ISP, the IP address "lease" may be expiring while your systems is asleep or off. This can cause your computer to get confused when it tries to use the invalid IP, forcing the restart to renew the lease.\n\nIf your using a router like the Linksys you can use the "keep alive" option in the router setup to prevent it from dropping the lease.

[SEP] best_answer: In our community car washes are often held in the parking lots of Jiffy Lubes.  Ask for donations of soap and other supplies from local car dealers or auto parts stores.  A couple of other things to consider are local ordinances.  Check with your city and make sure car washes are allowed.  Some areas of the country have water restrictions due to water shortages. Also, check to see if you will need insurance for the car wash.	Sports

question_title: How much do u think a socer ball and shirt singed by Alan Kelly Sr. is worth??? [SEP] question_content: Alan Kelly played In England, and played as a starting world cup goalie for Ireland. He played against greats Pele and Cruyff, and now his son (Alan Kelly jr.) plays as a starting goalie for the Blackburn Rovers. [SEP] best_answer: I think it could be more than $500 US currency. People pay that much and more just for a designer's shirt. I'd pay that much if I had the money for Alan Kelly's.\n\nBut, if you are planning to sell it, go with his fans. You know, people who actually saw him playing against Pele or some like them would pay that kind of money. I'm pretty sure.	Sports

question_title: Im really devoted to basketball...? [SEP] question_content: but i want to try tennis so i have something to do something off-season...but should i take time away from basketball to improve? please no stupid answers [SEP] best_answer: As a coach, I recommend doing something competitively away from basketball.  Tennis is also a good sport because it is similar to basketball in athletic movements.  In tennis, you do a lot of shuffling, back pedalling, side to side movements...as in basketball.  It will only improve your footwork and quickness.  Also, sometimes it is good to get away from your 'main' sport for awhile....otherwise you can feel burnout and boredom.  You can still do things with a basketball like ballhandling and shooting during tennis season.  The individual aspect of tennis is also a good builder of mental toughness and learning about yourself, winning and losing.  Playing another sport or two will not hurt your chances of becoming a better basketball player.  Sitting around doing nothing at all during the summer is what will not help your skill level.	Sports

question_title: Should Bernie Williams have filed for free angency or retired as A Yankee? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bernie is a Yankee!!   Mickey Mantle, Don Mattingly, Whitey Ford, Joe DiMaggio, were Yankees and only Yankees.  Bernie is on a very special list of players to wear only Yankees pin strips.  Even Yogi Berra can't say that as he played briefly with the Mets before retiring.  If the Yankees offer him a contract, good, if not retire.  My only concern would be that in my humble opinion Bernie would need 300 career home runs and 2500 career hits to give him a real shot at the Hall of Fame.  Right now he is just short on both counts.  With 4 world series rings and 6 AL pennants and a batting title he still might make it.	Sports

question_title: How do you get a rolled ankle to stop hurting? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Rest with the foot elevated (above heart level)and apply ice for a minimum of 20 minutes on, 30 minutes off. Anything less than 20 minutes is not going to help. Also, do not apply heat. That's like throwing fuel onto the fire. You can also take an anti-inflammatory such as Tylenol or Advil.\n\nJust be careful and take pre-cautions with the ankle such as taping it for awhile. I lost a college scholarship when I sprained my ankle one too many times and ended up having to have the tendons and ligaments surgically repaired.	Sports

question_title: I am 6'-0" 180 and toned. I want to gain some mass. what is the best program to gain weight.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/idssports10.htm  Try one of these programs.  The first work-out plan should help gain mass.  However, instead of 10-12 reps, try doing twice the number of sets with around 6 reps per set.  Change the work-out after a couple of months.\n\nBasically, to gain mass, you have to go for less reps (like 6 reps per set) and lots of weight.  Make sure you do each rep correctly (if you do it incorrectly, even with a lot of weight, you will barely gain anything).  Also, you have to eat a lot of food (healthy, not junk).  Don't just eat protein, but if you want extra protein, I suggest eggs and lean meats like chicken.  Start going to the gym more.  Concentrate on specific muscle groups each day (e.g. triceps, chest, shoulders one day; biceps, back, abs the other day).  Don't forget to work on cardiovascular work through running.	Sports

question_title: how do i improve my butterfly stroke in swim? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Practice doing your butterfly at a slow pace. It will feel awkward because you are sinking but visualize the position of your body. Visualize your body following your head. Each movement will be exaggerated when swimming slow. Practice this until the motion feels comfortable. Pick up the pace concentrating on your body position. You will notice that as you speed up your body will be in a more comfortable position.\nPractice without breathing, then practice breathing every stroke. The key to the timing is a keeping that small second kick, even when your taking your breath. Practice with fins to get the feeling of your kick.	Sports

question_title: We are going to water rafting. We were told that there is big water come into the river.  Does it mean danger? [SEP] question_content: We are going to Level five. Is it really dangerous? [SEP] best_answer: I'm guessing you mean Class V, which is a rating of the overall difficulty of the whitewater run.  Simple answer is YES, big water on a class V run is dangerous by definition.  Unless you are with a group of very experienced boaters, who are familiar with the river you are running, I'd opt out.\n\nIf they are experienced and familiar with that river (and I'm assuming you are riding in a boat with one or more of them), then enjoy the ride!  If it's with an outfitter, even better. Then you don't have to concern yourself too much with proper equipment, since they will generally provide it (or at least give you a list if you want one).\n\nGood luck and have fun.  Most importantly, WEAR YOUR LIFE JACKET any time you are on the water.	Sports

question_title: What is your take on the Shani davis situation?

Do you feel it should have taken place sooner? Or is it simply a non - issue? [SEP] best_answer: Congratulations to him.\n\nIn the past, many blacks came from the South where the climate doesn't favour winter sports. There were also cultural issues with many people in the South Side of Chicago looking down on Davis as a skater.\n\nI quote from an article in the San Jose Mercury News:\n\nReturning home was always the hardest part. Shani Davis would be 8 or 10 or 12, the age Saturday's dream actually began, and he'd get out of the car after practice, carrying his ice skates, wearing his speed skating tights.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago would welcome him.\n\n"You wear tights, girl?"\n\n"Is it Halloween?"\n\n"What kind of black boy ice skates?"\n\nIt may well be the same in Compton or Harlem. There is also talk of conflict with the US Speed Skating Associatin. Hopefully, Davis' success will make participation in winter sports easier for other athletes.	Sports

question_title: how does a body dome compare with a wobble board? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Gotta get the body dome, otherwise known as a BOSU BALL instead of a wobble board. WHY? there are two side to a bosu ball. When you are just starting out with your core workouts you stand on the dome, flat side down. this is the beginner way. As you get better, this will be too easy so you flip the bosu ball over and now stand on the flat surface, ball side down. As you improve further, move your feet in closer together. WHEE! LOTSA FUN< HARD WORK!\n A wobble board has one level of difficulty, not very adaptable to skill level improvements.	Sports
question_title: how old do you have to be to race hores? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Each state has its own rules and regulations to be an owner, partner/owner, corporation, trainer, assistant trainer, jockey, exercise rider, etc...\n\nIt is best to contact the racing secretary's office of the particular state and racetrack in which you intend to race and identify yourself. That particular racetrack will give to you all of the necessary paperwork. It may also be a good idea to contact a trainer of that racetrack and discuss your intentions with him/her. \n\nAnd, not only will the racetrack ask for identification and licensing, but, so will the insurance carrier. Even if the racetrack says it's o.k. to be a part of the connections of a racehorse or barn, make certain you carry proper insurance.	Sports
question_title: I've recently viewed some answered questions? [SEP] question_content: and i;ve seen people trying to compare Kobe Bryant with Michael Jordan. I have never seen anything so rediculios or such an insult to a legend. Would this be a fair comment ? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not a big basketball fan (although I like it), but I totally understand what you mean. I guess some people think that at any point in time there HAS to be someone who is outstandingly good, and so they choose the best one at a certain time and end up making ridiculous comparisons between him and the greatest legends. And sometimes the numbers are on their side, but a number really doesn't mean that much.\n\nIt really annoys me, specially because there are young people who have never seen the best ones play and are led to believe they were not much better than the ones who are being compared to them. In soccer (my favourite sport) it's the same, they insist on comparing Ronaldinho to geniuses like Pelé and Maradona, which I think is almost a blasphemy. The guy is good, but come on! But I hope History will do justice to the ones who really were the best. Don't worry, Michael Jordan is a legend, it will take more than a few people's opinion for anyone to replace him in basketball mythology.	Sports

question_title: How long untill you think Ben Wallace will quit basketball?? [SEP] question_content: i mean like he is 36 and still playing. when will he stop??? [SEP] best_answer: Big Ben's game is not based on speed or athleticism. Often this allows a player to have a longer career. He's also not actually that big for a center, which means he isn't getting quite the wear and tear of someone like Shaq (for instance). Unless he decides he is sick of the game, gets a serious injury, or goes Spree and gets some deluded idea of his worth, I think he could have 4 or 5 more years in him.	Sports
question_title: what is the best martial arts form? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The best form of combat is Ju Box Fu it is a combination of Brazilian Jujitsu,Muay Thai kickboxing and kungFu if you have time to include wrestling you cant be beaten. \nIf someone is bigger and stronger you can take them to the ground and use your Jujitsu witch is very easy to learn and very effective. If your opponent is smaller and faster you can use you size and strength and strike them Kungfu is very unorthodox with back fists and kicking techniques they are hard to defend however it takes a long time to learn this style so start with kickboxing witch has a lot of basic power attacks.\nJujitsu is the best form for a 1 on 1 street fight but if you are faced with more than 1 opponent you will need to know your striking.\nIf you only have time to practise and learn 1 style i recommend Jujitsu if you study it for one year you can easily beat a 15 year Martial Artist from any of the classical styles (Karate,Boxing,KungFu,Judo or wrestling) witch are useless unless you both now the same style.\nIt is also very hard to find a Ju Box Fu school as it is a relatively new style so good luck.

question_title: What exactly does a basketball manager do? [SEP] question_content: I signed up to manage my school's varsity basketball team, but I have no idea what to do. There are two other managers but they're experienced while I'm the rookie. So, what's the manager's job? All I know is that I have to keep the stats - points scored, rebounds, assists, etc. But what else? [SEP] best_answer: You work with the team. You come to practices and help them in practice. Your in charge of making sure all the balls and equipment are put away at the end of practice. You also have to be there at all the games and sometimes they make you in charge of refreshing the teammates or keeping track of the scores. Usually they have a parent or someone else keep stats but I'm not totally sure. And don't worry on what to do, the coaches will fill you in on everything you have to do.	Sports

question_title: are americans so lazy because of the mexican slavery we allow to take our crappy jobs? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my opinion, American youth have a "superiority complex".. They feel like they're above accepting an entry level job that pays entry level wages.. \n\nThey have a lot of "authority issues" and don't want to take orders/directions from someone that may not have had as good of education as they did, but has put in the time and effort to achieve the position that they're in.. \n\nAlso, it's a demonstration of the "instant gratification" mentality that has been formed in the US society.. They want to be hired in as the President of the company without working with their "nose to the grindstone" like other people have done in the past.. \n\nThe "Keeping up with the Jones'/American Dream" brainwashing makes them want to be able to buy all the toys and clothes that their friends have.. They realize they can't do that on entry level wages, so they have the mentality that they're too good to take a low paying position. This allows people that are willing to, to come in and take all the 'crappy jobs'..	Politics & Government
question_title: My husband wants to apply for his greencard with me.  How do I know if he married me just to get his papers? [SEP] question_content: He always says he loves me, but lately he has been pressuring me to go to the lawyer to help him get his papers.  I've been putting it off and he gets so angry, so it makes me wonder somtimes if he just wants to be with me so he get his papers.  What do you think? [SEP] best_answer: Curious, I have been following some of your questions for sometime now, even answered a few with my old account. This is just an honest advice, there is something very wrong with your relation. I don't mean to intrude, but if all of what you said is true, the least that can be said is that you are in a non trusting marriage and I can't see this ever working. On one hand, according to your accounts, he is in love with someone else (which apparently is not reciprocated). On the other hand, you seem to use the green card as a leverage on your relation. You keep putting off this decision (you said it yourself) and it would be frustrating for anyone trying to start a life with you. Even if he is fully committed to you and would decide to leave if your marriage fails, your attitude concerning this would destroy the relation. How can you marriage ever work?\n\nThe only way for you to ever know for sure, would be to let him get his permanent papers and see if he sticks around. Of course, it could (and probably will) backfire and he could dump you as soon as he gets them. Anyway, I think it is more than time that you decide, either one way or the other and stick with that decision. I hope you good luck either way.	Politics & Government

question_title: What special factor could guarantee a female president being elected in the US? [SEP] question_content: Will it take lots of money? Or a special charisma like JFK? Or will the candidate have to be squeaky clean (and even virginal) perhaps? Or some sort of exceedingly powerful external influence like that suggested in "When Spirits Beckon" at Amazon.com? [SEP] best_answer: The "Women's Rights Movement" only happened less than 50 years ago. 3X later than the first president of the United States. It is going to take a long time for a woman to become president unless a lot of factors happen all at the same time.\n\nWeak competition\nStrong background/very well known\nImpecible track record\nLife in politics\nModerate but tough domestic/foreign policy.\n\nThe only woman in the near future I see even having a CHANCE at the presidency is Hillary Clinton and even that is a long long shot.

With a vicious cycle of sectarian violence on top of the insurgency, the idea that 20,000 more troops can do much of anything is deluded. [SEP] best_answer: Agreed.

question_title: What is your opinion on the shutdown in Puerto Rico? [SEP] question_content: May 1 Puerto Rico' s government ran out of money on Monday and imposed a partial public-sector shutdown, putting nearly 100,000 people out of work and granting an unscheduled holiday to 500,000 public school students.The shutdown, the first in the history of the commonwealth, occurred despite last-minute efforts by members of the Legislature and Gov. Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá to agree on a bailout plan.The police and other emergency services were not affected, but dozens of public offices were closed or were operating on a limited basis. Puerto Rico has a $740 million budget shortfall because the Legislature and the governor have been unable to agree on a spending plan since 2004. Differing sales tax proposals have been presented that would allow the government to secure a line of credit to pay salaries through June 30, the end of the fiscal year. The island currently has no sales tax.All 1,600 public schools on the island closed on Monday, two weeks before the end of the academic year. [SEP] best_answer: The shut down is due to poor management.	Politics & Government

question_title: How many Democratic presidents have held office during wartime? [SEP] question_content: I'm just curious about the ratio between Republican and Democratic presidents during wartimes.Maybe get a list of each. [SEP] best_answer: Yes, Wilson was a Democrat. And so was Polk (Mexican-American War). So FDR, Truman, Johnson, Wilson, and Polk. That's 5. unless I missed someone...\n\nOh, and as for Republicans: Lincoln, McKinley, Eisenhower, Nixon, Bush 1 and Bush 2. So that's 6.\n\nEDIT: Kennedy never presided over wartime. There were conflicts in Cuba and Vietnam, but it really could not be called wartime prior to real engagement after the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964. Similarly, there were conflicts, even bombing, in Iraq during Clinton's administration, but we wouldn't call him a wartime president. So I'd still say it's 5 and 6.	Politics & Government

question_title: How did the assination of Abraham Lincoln hurt the South more than the Civil War? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Chiefly because Lincoln was poised to adopt a reconciliatory attitude towards the South after its defeat. His "Malice towards none" speech represented a belief that the South should be reabsorbed with little punishment for its seccession.\n\nInstead, Lincoln was assassinated and the Radical Republicans overrode his successor Andrew Johnson. As a result, the prostrate South was forced to deal with a harsh occupation, incompetent politicians (Black and white alike) who were the proxies of Northern occupation forces, and an absolute crippling of its economy. \n\nI don't think any rational or moral personal would argue in favor of slavery. It was an absolute evil. However, imagine the effect on the Southern economy once the slaves were freed. Add to that the total destruction of the South's infrastructure, the political corruption brought on by Reconstruction, and deaths of 500,000 of its finest men in the War, and you rapidly begin to understand the dimension of the region's calamity. \n\nWith this in mind, Lincoln's policies would have probably proven much more effective at reconstituting the South. As it stands, it took the region more than a century to recover from the War.	Politics & Government

question_title: causes for the invasion of mogadishu'? [SEP] question_content: i need to know some reasons why we went into somalia..... [SEP] best_answer: 1993, Mass starvation is killing Somalians due to drought. UN decides to send humanitarian aids but warlords of clans, such as the Habr Gadir led by Muhamad F. Aidid, withheld the aids and kept it for themselves. The UN sent US Marines to rectify the situation. Order is restored. The US Marines withdrew and UN took over. 23 Pakistani UN soldiers were ambushed and killed as they were distributing the aid. The UN asked for help from the US. TF Ranger was sent with 10th Mountain, 101st (SOAR) and Special Forces. \n\nThey set out to capture Aidid and his henchmen. The event of Oct. 3 became a catalyst for US to withdraw. 18 US servicemen died in an operation designed to capture Aidid's top lieutenants. More than 2,000 Somali civilian and militia men died. UN soon withdred after the US.\n\nIT WAS NOT AN IVASION. It was a humanitarian gesture.	Politics & Government
question_title: Why put up a bail bond? Why not just hold onto the accused so that they don't run off? [SEP] question_content: Help explain this to me. \n\nLet's say that  I am being accused of a crime and I am taken to jail. The court puts up a $5,000 bail bond. Let's say I can't pay it. So I call a friend up who says, "yeah, I'll pay that $5,000". How does that ensure my appearance in court. It's not my money either way; what do I care? \n\nNow, with that type of situation present in our country (U.S.), why put a bail bond? [SEP] best_answer: My best guess is it is based on the "innocent until proven guilty" idea.  An "innocent" man should not have to stay in jail.  But, the courts need to make sure that he will show up for his court date, so they use bail money to do so.	Politics & Government

question_title: What do the terms lame duck and swan song mean? I hear them often in political situations.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: lame duck refers to any politician who is finishing out his or her term and will not be either running for another term or has lost the election.  At the beginning of their "lame duck term" they generally do not have as much power with other politicians cuz they will not be able to help anyone else once their term is up.

question_title: Has Karl Rove's tactics ruined our nation? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes in part. Rove's methods of using hate and prejudices to win elections is tearing America apart.\n\nHe has been doing this since the 70s and has fully admitted that motivating a person's prejudices will make them trump any other issue when they are in the voting booth.\n\nWhat he doesn't realize is that while he might win the battles, he loses the war for America. Why? Because when you purposely keep hate and prejudices alive in a person, all that does is divide us, cause animosity and creates a society full of anger.	Politics & Government
question_title: How does the Constitution secure, promote or protect American Democracy? [SEP] question_content: thank you [SEP] best_answer: The Constitution does nothing to secure, protect or promote democracy. It establishes a Republic wherein the sovereignty is with the People. The people then elect representatives to voice their concerns. That is why the House of Representatives has elections every two years. It is the House that is supposed to be the most responsive to the will of the ppl.\n   A lynch mob is a democracy. Is that the kind of government you want?	Politics & Government

question_title: why do Americans categorize themselves as Democrats or republicans.? [SEP] question_content: I just dont know why we cant all be americans and stop the political arguing as to what party is doing what in the white house. If were all americans it shouldnt mater the party you belong too. Since both parties are to preform the same duties of protecting this country and way of life as the citizens see fit. [SEP] best_answer: First off, the framers of the constitution did not want a two party system per se, what they wanted was a government set up to do war with itself. The framers wanted a government with gridlock, checks and balances and division of powers to prevent the situation we find ourselves in today, where a single ideology has siezed control of the government. \nUnfortunatly for our nation most americans today are to disinterested in the political process to think to not vote for the R's or the D's. There are independant candidates but without party support its virtually impossible to make it in a political race, unless you have milions of dollars to spend. \nWe as a people need to realize that the decision is not between left and right, but freedom or tyranny.

question_title: What plans do the Democrats have WHEN they retake congress in the Mid term elections? [SEP] question_content: We know that it is a GIVEN for them to regain control.The Republicans cannot hold a majority with only 20% approval rate. Will this ensure Hillary a top spot on the presidential ticket in 2008? [SEP] best_answer: I disagree that it is a given that they will regain control.  I think that it is a given that they will gain seats.  The main problem is that they haven't formulated any plans or agenda.  They attack the Republicans over the war, but they are divided about whether to oppose the war.  To a lesser extent, they are acting the same way on the economy.  Plenty of criticism, but no plans.\n\nThe Democrats can definitely gain seats this fall at this rate, but if they want try to take control of Congress they need to come up with a concrete platform to sell to voters.  So far, leaders like Pelosi and Reid have been too timid to do anything other than criticize.  Coming up with plans opens them up to criticism, and risks alienating voters.\n\nAs for Hilary, I don't see her on the ticket.  She is too much of a polarizing figure.  2008 is a real opportunity for the Democrats to take the swing vote, and even discontented Republicans.  If Hilary is on the ticket, they won't take a single red state, and risk losing a few blue states.  If the Republicans choose McCain, Hilary would be a disastrous candidate.	Politics & Government

question_title: If torture doesn't guarantee honest information, why is it used? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think sometimes the interrogators get good answers at the beginning of the torture session. Then, the suspect runs out of information and begins making stuff up to stop the torture.\n\nOf course, if he's innocent, all of the suspect's apparently incriminating statements are false. A Canadian Arab was kidnapped by the CIA a couple of years ago at a US airport because his name was similar to a name on the want list. While in a secret Syrian prison which was literally a hole in the ground, he confessed to training with Bin Laden in Afghanistan. He was released after a year.

question_title: Muslim stereotype? [SEP] question_content: Just a general request cos it bugs me, why do we insist on this site in referring to 'muslims', i.e 'the muslims are the biggest terror threat' etc, im not muslim but many of my friends are, some in muslim countries like Iran and i also think this spreads far too much (even subliminal) scaremongering and stereotyping, many, in fact most muslims oppose the terrorist killing of civilians, yes even the ones in countries like Iran. \n\nIf we are to talk about the terrorists can we not correctly term them? Mujihadeen? Or Jihadists? I really think an important part of sorting out our problems starts with stopping dangerous generalisations based on a minority. Anyone for trying to get a bit of clarity into this politics area? [SEP] best_answer: Because the entire religion and its followers seem to have a fanatical element that far exceeds the fringes of any other religion in the history of the world.  The depth of this goes far beyond just Jihadists or Mujihadeen.\n\nThere are approximately 1.5 billion Muslims in the world. If only 10% believe in the very violent, very literal translation of the Qur'an and Sharia law, that means 150 million Muslims would just as soon decapitate or stone you as let you express a viewpoint that run counters to their own. \n\nI would challenge anyone to name 10 acts of global violence that have been perpetrated in the name of Christianity in the last 20 years. However, even completely omitting Iraq and Afghanistan, it would be quite easy to name 50 acts of Islamic violence that have occurred in the last 20 days. Christianity is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. A man who embodied peace, humanity, and love towards all beings. Muhammad was a fierce warrior and military leader right up until his death. Is it so hard to believe that a religion established by someone with this background might have religious doctrine rooted in violence and aggression? \n\nSelf-proclaimed "moderate" Muslims continue to decry what they feel is anti-Islamic attitudes around the world. When a cartoon, a cartoon mind you, is found to be offensive, Muslims by the 10's of thousands take to the streets in violent protest. When the Pope alludes to the statements of a past Pope in pointing out that there needs to be a dialogue within the Muslim and non-Muslim faiths in order to facilitate peace and understanding between all religions, Muslims by the 10's of thousands take to the streets in violent protest. When the twin towers in New York City were disintegrated by Islamic terrorists, 10's of thousands of Muslims took to the streets in celebration. \n\nWhere are the tens of thousand, or even hundreds, of Muslims taking to the streets to protest Bin Laden, or the London bombers, or the Madrid bombers, or the Bali bombers, or the Indonesian Islamists who chop off the heads of Christian schoolgirls, or the Somalian Islamists who killed the Italian nun, or even the radical clerics who are supposedly "hijacking" their religion?

question_title: If there was one thing you could change about  the United States Government....what would it be? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: George W. Bush's leadership as president these past five years have been a one huge disaster after another. We now have huge budget deficits that appear to be growing out of control. We have a very costly war on Iraq that is going on way too long. We have spiraling trade deficits and American corporations moving their factories and personal off shore. We have wealthy individuals paying a smaller percentage of their incomes in taxes then middle class workers, and who are using off shore tax havens to avoid paying taxes. We have a new Medicare bill that is full of corporate welfare and is costing much more than we were originally told. We had a energy deregulation scandal in California that Bush refused to stop. We had huge corporate scams that robbed shareholders, employees, and creditors of billions of dollars. And this list could go on and on. All these facts show that the American people should fear George W. Bush for who he is (a liar and a thief), and what he really stands for (fascism). And the Republicans in Congress have been in lock-step with him every step of the way. We must never again allow these type of people back into our government.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: The whole scenario has a sense of deja a vu and burdened with inevitabiilty at the same time....a train on a collision course, as it were. I mean the threats, going to the UN, the stubbornness on both sides, the threat (real or unreal) of WMDs.\n\nMost analysts believe Iran is years away from developing an operational nuke, the earliest estimate is 2012. The US is stretched thin in Iraq, the Natanz facility can only be taken out by a tactical nuke, the Iranian president is spouting off about the apocalyptic strain of Islam, ...\n\nShould we let Israel take care of it?? This is what we have to look forward to, if nothing is done....a 2007 nuclear exchange between Israel and Iran, a humiliating retreat from Iraq by US forces overwhelmed by Iranian-backed militias, and a four-year war between a US led coalition and Iranian-backed Shi'ite forces....pretty bleak, huh.\n\nChina and Russia are still 'rational' nuclear powers and still ascribe to the MAD doctrine. The two wild cards in the whole scenario will be N. Korea and Pres. Bush himself, any move on N. Korea's part to instigate defence of Iran or premptive Stike by the US will bring us to the brink of destruction.	Politics & Government

The question is, did that bullet hit JFK AND Governor Conolly, or just Governor Conolly, and no ballistics tests are going prove or disprove that. Conspiracy theorists believe that JFK was actually killed by another bullet, fired by a man on a grassy knoll, but that the government covered it up by saying that the bullet that hit Conolly had killed JFK. That the bullet does not exist of course fuels this conspiracy theory all the more, despite the fact that if the theory is wrong, it shouldn't have existed in the first place.	Politics & Government

I know how you feel when you meet these women that are only out to destroy your lives.  I pay my child support on two children, yet I am being threatened of losing my freedom and my driver's license.  I am a truck driver , so i need my license.  If I go to jail, I lose my job and then my children lose the little money that I am sending them.  The child support issues must be reformed because there are fathers that are being manhunted and driven into poverty because of an unconstitutional law that is depriving men of the right to live. [SEP] best_answer: Had you not fallen behind on child support then they wouldn't be threatening you with jail time or license suspension.  It takes serious arrears for them to do that. My ex has been behind since 97 and the state doesn't do a thing to him. \n\nIf someone doesn't pay child support, then he or she deserves to go to jail. It's no different than child neglect.

question_title: Could the pro-illegal protests possibly have done more damage to their cause? [SEP] question_content: Now that the high emotions have worn off from the multiple "Days without Illegal Immigrants", I can't help but think that they irreparably harmed their cause. From the mexican flags to the obnoxious and threatening "Si, se puede" [Yes we can- vote, sneak in, gain amnesty] to the "new" anthem in Spanish, it was nothing but mis-steps.\n\nThe result is that the plan to strengthen border security is stronger than ever. Towns like Hazelton are passing ordnances to rid themselves of illegals and antipathy toward illegals is at an all time high.\n\nIllegal immigration always existed, but before it was tolerated because we saw illegals come here and work hard, learn English and assimilate. The greatest harm to the illegals' cause came from themselves, when they came here and tried to turn pockets of each city into Mexico and they started demanding rights that they had not earned.\n\nThe border is about to be shut down. In ten years, I think illegal immigration will be 20% of what it was last year. [SEP] best_answer: You are right. It is all of the things you have mentioned and more. It is one colossal mis calculation after the next. America has definitely stepped up it's tone on illegals, and it's not really the government, it's the American people. The fact that these illegals tried to demand something that they have not earned is just outrageous. If the demonstrations were a bid to ask the Americans for help to rid Mexico of the corruption and strangle hold the drug families have on the economy then i think they would be in business. Instead, they march on American cities demanding rights and free passage while flying a foreign nations flag. Really, really bad judgment.	Politics & Government

question_title: To Republicans with family in Iraq? [SEP] question_content: I'm just curious about this one. If you are a Republican with a family member in Iraq or other place and supported Bush in the beginning (Or just supported Bush, not necessarily Repub.), has this changed your opinion of Bush?  \n\nI am asking this because I'm curious, not because I am not a Republican. If I were, though, I really think it would have changed my mind about him if one of my loved ones had to go to war. [SEP] best_answer: No.  My nephew decided to join to go there and signed up and he wanted to because he believes in the cause, so it is not like he was forced to go there.  When someone signs up for the military, they know they are going to go fight, and they choose to serve.   My other nephew his brother went ROTC and so he went through college, graduated, got his commission and is training troops now so he will be going over but he is still in the states.  ( my nephews, sister and whole family are all Republican )\n\nWhy would their family or friends want to change to a party that does not support what they are doing???  The whole "we support the troops but not the war" thing that democrats say is only being is fake and we all know it and so do the troops.  \n\nI do not agree with the way the war has been carried out, but that is tactics, and a tactical disagreement, not a philosophical or moral one.   I believe that Rumsfeld should have listened to the generals and gone in with a MUCH greater force from the get go and we would have been done by now, like we were in Desert Storm.   That does not mean I disagree with the war or think we should pull out, I do not in either case.	Politics & Government

The officer is subject to the same laws as we are not to mention that this is dangerous for anyone else on the road. However if he is parked offside the road of course he can have his lights off while radaring people. \nIt is not entrapment the Officers lights off is not forcing you to speed. I'm sure if he had is headlights on and was offside the road alot of people would still speed by.	Politics & Government
question_title: What are some disadvantages of participatory democracies? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In part there must be an agreement as to what the term participatory democracy means.  I believe that its meaning isn’t the same for everyone.  In the simplest meaning, all people of a given society are able to directly impact the acts and directions of the society.  \n\nCertainly in a small society this can have merit.  Say a community of 1,000 people get together for each decision and discuss it and vote.  Even here though there will be decisions which must be made too quickly to get everyone together and some individuals will be selected to address those decisions.  For example, will they all be the local sheriff and all participate in the decision making to decide when evidence dictates who is to be arrested or a traffic ticket issued?  Or will that function and responsibility be given to selected individuals?  In this sense that participatory democracy is replaced with some form of representative democracy and clearly as the size of that society grows, the need to expand the representative function will also grow.  The point is that it is doubtful that this form of representative democracy of full citizen participation is actually functional.\n\nIf by participatory democracy it is meant that the majority of the people shall rule in all situations, then what exists is a form of mob rule where the minority does not have and shall never have rights.  In this form the Founders were very concerned because they believed that such a form of government would ultimately lead to dictatorship.  \n\nIf participatory democracy is meant to be citizens having the power to be aware of government acts and intent, and to have the power to discuss it, and to have the power to influence elected and appointed officials, then that exists today.  It exists as an elementary part of the Constitutional Representative Republic developed by the Founders and now functioning.  \n\nAnyone or any group has the right to find out what government is doing or intends to do.  Further, anyone or any group has the right to address any elected official through right of petition for redress of governmental acts.  In the final analysis the citizen holds the power over the governmental officials by the vote.  The citizens can vote anyone in or out of office.  However, there is a problem with this, that is, for it to work the citizen must become involved.  That is, attend local work sessions of local government.  Belong to groups of citizens (usually having similar views) who keep an eye on elected and appointed officials and make real use of the right of petition, the power of the vote and the power of the court.  \n\nIt is now, as it has been for over two hundred years in the hands of the citizen to mold and control government.

[SEP] best_answer: I think you're a bit behind the times. Bush has signed into law a piece of legislation barring protests at military funerals.\n\nThe new law bars protests within 300 feet of the entrance of a national cemetery and within 150 feet of a road into the cemetery.

question_title: senate, house, congress, representatives? [SEP] question_content: I thought I understood all this, but now I'm confused. What is the difference between the senate, house, congress and representatives? What are their duties? How are they different? Please explain [SEP] best_answer: Short answer:\nCongress is the legislative branch of the government\nThe Senate is half of Congress\nThe House of Representatives (sometimes called just "House") is the other Half of Congress\nRepresentatives are the members of the House of Representatives\n\nLong answer:\nThe US government is made up of three branches - executive (president), judicial (courts, from the Supreme Court on down), and legislative (Congress). There is a separation of powers (you probably learned the phrase "checks and balances" in school) - this allows each branch to have some power of its own and some power to regulate the other branches.\n\nCongress is made up of two elected groups - the Senate and the House of Representatives. Both have similar duties - the difference is in how the numbers are distributed over the states, and how long their terms are. All states have two Senators, and they serve 6 years. With Senators, all people in the state vote for both Senators, just not both at the same time. The number of Representatives is determined by the population of the state. Right now there are 435 voting members (representatives from DC, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands don't vote). Every state gets at least one Representative, but the larger the state, the more Representatives they have. Each Representative comes from a section of their home state - not everyone in the state gets to elect all of the state's Representatives. You elect one in your region. Representatives serve 2 year terms, so every two years all of the seats in the House of Representatives are up for vote.\n\nCongress deals with stuff like interstate and international commerce, declaring war, levying taxes, maintaining the military, and organizing the federal courts. There are some things that they cannot control according to the Constitution - powers that are reserved for the states. \n\nThere are a few things that only the Senate or only the House can do. For example, when the President nominates a new Supreme Court Justice or federal judge, the Senate votes whether or not to accept (confirm) the nomination. Only the House can begin impeachment proceedings against the President (and it doesn't go to the Senate unless the House vote to impeach). The House also is the only place where bills for raising money can be started.	Politics & Government

question_title: If the eye were sensitive to rays from other part of the electromagnetic spectrum could we see radio waves? [SEP] question_content: Are there any instruments that turn electromagnetic waves into images?\n\nI know the question isn't really clear but I don't mean the television.  Aren't televistion rays just translations of signals sent through waves.  I mean waves directly converted into images like x-rays.\n\nLet's say radio waves for example.  What would a picture of a star look like in radio waves? [SEP] best_answer: Because radio waves have long wavelengths relative to the size of human cells (radio waves have wavelengths ranging from about a millimeter to as long as many kilometers long), it would be very difficult for our eyes to "see" images from the radio spectrum.  This is similar to the reason why animals which use sonar must use very high frequencies.  However, there are instruments, such as radio telescopes, which can form images based on radio waves.  In fact, because different frequencies of the ElectroMagnetic spectrum (including radio waves) each are absorbed differently by interstellar dust and other objects, astronomers can often learn a lot by observing the radio emissions of a star.

question_title: the prevailing winds in Canada usually blow west to east, while the wind in australia usuallybloww from E-W.WH [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is the factor of where the wind originated from and the rotation of the earth.  Think about it, how fast is the north pole spinning (pretty slow, it takes 24 hrs for the earth to revolve)?  At the equator, the ground spins at a very high speed, being as the ground is further from the axis of rotation.  \n\nAs an example, a high-altitude air-mass originates from near the equator and travels away from the equator. The ground is spinning slower as you move away from the equator, but the air-mass does not lose a lot of the speed it had when it was at the equator.  Thus it will be moving relative to the ground it is now above. Since the earth rotates in the eastern direction, the wind will travel from east to west (relative to the ground it is now above).  \n\nIf the wind came from a location away from the equator and moved towards the equator, it is moving slowly relative to the equator so it will appear to be travelling slower than the rotation of the ground below it.  As a result, it would move from east to west relative to the ground.\n\nThis is how phenomenon like that jet-stream work.  This effect is called the coriolis (if I spelled it right) effect.

question_title: What are some safety issues of Inductors and Capacitors? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Both inductors and capacitors store energy, in the form of magnetic or electric fields, respectively, so they have some possibility of discharging that energy in a dangerous way. Shorting out a large capacitor, for example, would produce a large current. Overheating an inductor (too much current) might cause the coil to fail, and then the magnetic field decay would produce a voltage spike I think. I would assume the risks with small components are quite small.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: BDE=30, if you accurately draw the triangle you will be able too measure it yourself. But if you want to calculate it, it is CBD-BCE=the difference in degree's between the 2then if you want to know the degree of BDE=90-(CBD+the difference in degree's)	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what forms earth's hard surface? [SEP] question_content: help!!!!   And what kind of wave is released durind an earthquack? [SEP] best_answer: The earth's hard surface (commonly called the crust) can be composed of oceanic crust or continental crust.  The two types of crust can form to create plates.  (Refer to plate tectonic theory)\n\nThe creation of the earth's crust can be a result of many processes such as: volcanism (Hawaii/Mt.St. Helens), Rift Zones (Mid-Atlantic Spreading Center), or combinations of the two.\n\nThe boundaries of these plates can convergent (come together), divergent (move apart), or transverse one another (slide past one another). \n\nOne of the most famous boundary between plates is the transverse or strike/slip fault that commonly creates earthquakes in California. The two famous faults are the San Andreas and Hayward faults.  \n\nEarthquakes are simply a build up of forces on these plate boundaries and eventually break.  The "break" is the earthquake  that we feel, the aftershocks can continue after the initial break, but are usually less intense or less strong (see Richter Scale)\n\nTsunamis are the result of deep earthquakes on/or near the ocean floor.  The movement of the fault will move massive amounts of the oceans water table is shifted. This forms a wave that will generate out in all directions.  When the tsunami travels thousands of miles thru the ocean and comes into contact with land it produces large scale waves (anywhere from 20-300+ feet) in height.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What exactly do stem cells do? [SEP] question_content: I've come across a product that claims to promote the release of adult stem cells: what would be the benefit of that? [SEP] best_answer: Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can, under the right conditions, turn into any other kind of cell.  They are of particular interest to scientists in that they may provide a means to replace damaged cells that the body cannot naturally replaced (in the spinal chord, for example).  Stem cells are often talked about (not inacurately) in the context of curing numerous degenerative neurological conditions (Parkinsons, Altzeimers, ALS, etc.) as well as other conditions that can be traced to the malfunction of a particular type of cell (they could be used, for example, to replace insuline-sectreteing cells in type I diabetes).\n\nAlthough I have not heard of a product like the one you mentioned, I would be inclined to say it does absolutely nothing.  Stem cells are only useful if they can be made to differentiate and become a specific type the specific type of cell that is needed, where that type of cell is needed.  Flooding the body with stem cells will not make that happen.  My best guess is that it is an attempt to profit off the wide-spread association of the term "stem cell" with curing uncurable diseases and, by extention, with improved health in general.

question_title: Where did soap initially come from? [SEP] question_content: How and when was it discovered? When did it come into wide use? [SEP] best_answer: A soap-like material found in clay cylinders during the excavation of ancient Babylon is evidence that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 B.C. Inscriptions on the cylinders say that fats were boiled with ashes, which is a method of making soap, but do not refer to the purpose of the "soap." Such materials were later used as hair styling aids. \n\nThe early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently did not use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of clay, sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil. They also used oil with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams. \n\nSoap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed. Rain washed a mixture of melted animal fat, or tallow, and wood ashes down into the clay soil along the Tiber River. Women found that this clay mixture made their wash cleaner with much less effort. \n\nThe ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering a substance called soap, made of tallow and ashes, that they used to tint their hair red.

question_title: How is it possible to separate the components of a mixture? [SEP] question_content: Briefly describe how you might separate nitrogen and oxygen in air. [SEP] best_answer: I know of at least 4 ways.  I think that the distillation or membrane separation are the most practical.\n\n(1)Distillation\nOxygen and nitrogen have different boiling points.\noxygen: 90 K\nnitrogen: 77 K\nIf you cool the mixture to a temperature between the boiling points of each you will be in a two-phase region.  There will be a gas phase rich in nitrogen (because it has a lower boiling point) and a liquid phase rich in oxygen.  A distillation column can be used to separate the phases and collect them in a continuous, pretty efficient process.  I think you have to do something special about the argon in air when you do this (like have more than one separation step, more than one distillation column).\n\n(2)Adsorption\nOxygen and nitrogen gases may adsorb to (stick to) the surfaces of certain compounds (like metal surfaces).  If you make a series of tubes lined with a substance that preferentially adsorbs (for example) oxygen, you will get a gas output that has less oxygen in it.  In a well-designed case, the adsorption is reversible.  Increasing the temperature of the substance will causes the oxygen to leave the solid surface and once again become a gas, giving you a relatively pure oxygen stream.  If the purity is not good enough, you can collect the streams and repeat the process (use a longer tube).  I don't know of an example of an adsorption material off-hand.\n\n(3)Stripping\nStripping is the process of passing a gas through a liquid and may involve chemically removing one of the components of the gas.  If you bubbled air through a liquid that had a chemical in it that reacted with oxygen to form a compound then the gas that reaches the top will be nitrogen-rich.  For example, your blood contains hemoglobin, so that when it is in contact with the air in your lungs the oxygen sticks to the hemoglobin, forming a chemical complex.  This is a lot more effective than limiting yourself to an oxygen supply based on whatever gases can dissolve in your blood. \n\n(4)Membrane Separation\nOxygen and nitrogen have different permeability in membranes.  They can diffuse through solids, but at different rates.  I think oxygen typically has high permeability.  If you pressurize the gas mixture and pass the gases through a bundle of tubes (high surface area is key) then some gas will pass through the tubes axially and some will diffuse through the walls radially.  The stream that passed through the tubes will be richer in nitrogen, since it is less permeable.  The stream that diffused through the walls of the tube will be richer in oxygen, becuase it is more permeable.  Repeat the process to get the desired purity.\n\nAn artificial lung can be made by passing blood through a long set of tubes that have oxygen on the outside of the tubes.  The oxygen diffuses into the blood through the permeable tubes.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how do fireflies light up? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Fireflies or lightning bugs make light within their bodies. This process is called bioluminescence and is shared by many other organisms, mostly sea-living or marine organisms. Fireflies light up to attract a mate. To do this, the fireflies contain specialized cells in their abdomen that make light.\n\nThe cells contain a chemical called luciferin and make an enzyme called luciferase. To make light, the luciferin combines with oxygen to form an inactive molecule called oxyluciferin. The luciferase speeds up the reaction, which occurs in two steps:\n\n   1. The luciferin combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is found in all cells, to form luciferyl adenylate and pyrophosphate (PPi) on the surface of the luciferase enzyme. The luciferyl adenylate remains bound to the enzyme:\n\n      luciferin + ATP -------------> luciferyl adenylate + PPi\n\n   2. The luciferyl adenylate combines with oxygen to form oxyluciferin and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Light is given off and the oxyluciferin and AMP are released from the enzyme's surface:\n\n      luciferyl adenylate + O2 -------------> oxyluciferin +AMP + light\n\nThe wavelength of light given off is between 510 and 670 nanometers (pale yellow to reddish green color). The cells that make the light also have uric acid crystals in them that help to reflect the light away from the abdomen. Finally, the oxygen is supplied to the cells through a tube in the abdomen called the abdominal trachea. It is not known whether the on-off switching of the light is controlled by nerve cells or the oxygen supply.\n\nThe luciferin-luciferase chemical reaction has been used for years to measure the amount of ATP produced in cells and by various chemical reactions. Recently, the gene (section of DNA coding for the protein) for the luciferase enzyme has been isolated, placed in the genes of other organisms, and used to follow the synthesis and/or expression of other genes (i.e. used as a reporter gene).

question_title: What is called the "area 51" ?. Is it an alien experiment lab in porto rico run by the u.s. government? [SEP] question_content: please give details!! [SEP] best_answer: It's located in the Nevada desert. It's an actual US Air Force base where they test experimental aircraft. Some of the experimental aircraft are very odd looking, which may be where the UFO connection may have come from.\n\nArea 51 is located on a dry lake bed (lake dried up a long time ago) of what used to be called Groom Lake.\n\nThe Air Force chose Area 51 for their base for two reasons. First, dry lake beds are perfect for aircraft runways. Second, it's in the middle of the desert, so it's difficult to spy on the base without their security people catching you.\n\nThe name Area 51 comes from the old Department of Energy (DOE) maps. When they were mapping out the desert for future atom bomb tests, they labeled each square as Area 1, Area 2, Area 2, etc. Groom Lake happened to be in Area 51.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: does anyone own a venus flytrap? [SEP] question_content: i have always wanted one. are they easy to take care of? i would have bought one but i have never seen one. i hear people say evn walmart sells them but i have never seen them there. [SEP] best_answer: I actually saw some for sale at Home Depot.\n\n\nThe Venus Flytrap is one of the easiest carnivorous plants to grow. If you wish to grow one or more, they have only a few requirements such as, wet roots, high humidity, full sunlight, and poor, acidic soil. It comes shipped to you as a bulb or rhizome. Plant it root side down so that the top of the bulb is even with the soil. A recommended soil mixture is one that contains sphagnum moss and sand. Do not add fertilizer or lime. Your plants will do better if you transplant them into new soil every few years.\n\nIn order to provide high humidity for your Venus Flytrap, plant it in a terrarium or in a glass container with a small opening. An old aquarium or fish bowl make good containers for this purpose. You need to watch your terrarium in the summer because the temperature inside the glass may get too hot. Two hours in the sun may be sufficient. If your plants wilt, then they need to come out of the sun sooner. Just the opposite is true for winter. If it gets very cold in your area you may need to move your plants away from the window or cover them at night in order to keep them warm and moist. However, your Venus' Flytrap will experience a dormant period in the winter, from Thanksgiving to Valentine's Day so it needs fewer hours of daylight and cooler temperatures.\n\nAnother way is to plant it in a pot and place the pot in a larger container such as a bucket. Partially cover the top of the bucket with a piece of glass or Plexiglas. Don't cover the entire top because air needs to circulate.\n\nIf you grow your plant outside, it will get enough insects to eat. If it rains the container may fill up with water but this will not hurt the plants, they can live underwater for months. If you grow your plant inside you will need to feed it insects. A couple of houseflies or small slugs per month is enough during the growing season. Do your plant a favor and do NOT feed it hamburger! Indigestion, rot may occur and usually your plant will die.

question_title: A triangle has sides of length 4, 7, and x. Let theta denote the radian measure of the largest angle.? [SEP] question_content: a. Express theta as a function of x if x < 7\n\nb. Express theta as a function of x if x > 7\n\nI thought I knew how to do this but then I started to second guess myself. Can someone please help. Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: This is a neat problem, and I am sure that there are many ways to solve it. I will be interested in seeing if the different ways to solve it end up producing answers that are at all similar.\n\nHere is what I did. I'll start with part (b), since I found it to be easier.\n\nIf x > 7, then the largest angle is the angle opposite the side having length x. This is the included angle of the sides having length 4 and 7.\n\nUse the law of cosines to relate the lengths of the two shorter sides and their included angle to the side having length x.\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(theta)\nx^2 = 4^2 + 7^2 - 2(4)(7)cos(theta)\n\nx^2 = 16 + 49 - 56cos(theta)\nx^2 - 65 = -56cos(theta)\ncos(theta) = (65 - x^2)/56\n\nOr, theta = arccos[(65 - x^2)/56]\n\nIn this case, x must be greater than 7 and less than 11.\n\nIf x is less than 7, then the largest angle is the angle opposite the side having length 7. This is the included angle of the sides having lengths 4 and x.\n\nMy first idea didn't work, so let's try something that could be even uglier :D\n\nCall the included angle of the sides of length 4 and 7 alpha.\n\nUsing the law of cosines, \n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(alpha)\nx^2 = 4^2 + 7^2 - 2(4)(7)cos(alpha)\n\nx^2 = 16 + 49 - 56cos(alpha)\nx^2 - 65 = -56cos(alpha)\ncos(alpha) = (65 - x^2)/56\n\nLet's derive sin(alpha) from cos(alpha).\n\nSince sin^2(alpha) + cos^2(alpha) = 1,\n\nsin(alpha) = sqrt[1 - cos^2(alpha)]\n=sqrt{1 - [(65 - x^2)/56]^2}\n\nAt this point, you're probably wondering what this has to do with theta.\n\nNow that we know sin(alpha), we can use the law of sines on two of the sides of the triangle, and the angles opposite them.\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nIn this case, theta is still the angle opposite the side having length 7. alpha is the angle opposite the side having length x.\n\nSo:\n\nx/sin(alpha) = 7/sin(theta)\n\nor\n\nsin(theta) = 7sin(alpha)/x\n\nWe know sin(alpha):\n\nsin(theta) = 7*sqrt{1 - [(65 - x^2)/56]^2}/x\n\nSo theta equals arcsin [7*sqrt{1 - [(65 - x^2)/56]^2}/x]\n\nThat's not very pretty.\n\nIn this case, x must be greater than 3 and less than 7.

question_title: Plese tell me the half life of copper, aluminium, ss and iron? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Are you referring to radioactive decay rates of isotopes of the three elements (copper, aluminum and iron) that you listed? If so, the first answer gave you some info, but you should check it (e.g., because copper has more than one isotope and they all have different half-lives). One can't specify a half-life for stainless steel because it's a mixture of metal elements whose ratio isn't specified by the generic name.\nIf instead you're referring to some measure of chemical activity, such as corrosion life, you haven't given enough details. (Well actually you haven't given enough details either way.) You could google corrosion rate, reaction rate and similar terms if you want to go further with that.	Science & Mathematics

(x-xo)^2+y^2 = (x1-xo)^2+(y1)^2\nsubstituting f(x) for y in the above equation, we get:\n(x-xo)^2+(f(x))^2 = (x1-xo)^2 + (y1)^2 [SEP] best_answer: First, a warning:  I had never heard of Descartes's method before (after two math degrees at university!).  So, you better check that I do describe the method you seek.\n\nI read a brief description in section 13.4 of the document at the web site (see source).  The idea of the method is to find an equation that simultaneously solve two equations: that of the curve and that of the straight line we are trying to fit tangent to the curve.  Then we find the condition(s) for the simultaneous solution to have only one solution in the neighbourhood of the point of contact.\n\nIn equation #1 we are lucky because f(x) is a parabola, which is a convex figure (the tangent will never cross the curve at any other point;  there are equations where a local tangent may cross the curve at some far point -- see an example at 13.3 in the same document)\n\n f(x) = x^2 is a parabola.  The point (2,4) belongs to the parabola (because 4 = 2^2).\n\nA straight line is represented by equation g(x) = mx + c where m is the constant slope and c is the intersection of the y axis.  If the line goes through (2,4), then c can be expressed as a function of m (for example, if m = 0 -- a horizontal line -- then c = 4;  if m = 1 -- a 45 degree slope -- then c = 2; if m = 2, then c = 0; and so on).  In general, c = 4 - 2 m.\n\ng(x) = mx + (4 - 2 m)     for a line through (2,4)\n\nAt intersection points, the distance between the two lines is zero.  So, let us subtract one line from the other and find out where the distance is zero:\n\nf(x) - g(x) = x^2 - mx -(4 - 2 m) = 0\nx^2 -mx +2m -4 = 0\n\nroots: ( m +/- SQRT ( m^2 - 4(2m - 4)) )/ 2 \n\nWhat value of m will yield only one solution?  The value such that the content of the square root (SQRT) is zero.\n\nm^2 - 8m +16 = 0 \n(m-4)(m-4) = 0\n\nm = 4\n(which, substituting in f(x)-g(x), leaves us with x=2 as the point of contact... good!)\n\nThus our tangent is g(x) = 4 x - 4	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the splitting field of x^p -x -a over F_p? [SEP] question_content: a is a multiplicatively invertible element of F_p, p is prime. [SEP] best_answer: If y is a root of this and b is in F_p, then (y+b)^p -(y+b)=y^p +b^p -y-b=a, so y+b is another root. Hence the complete list of roots is y, y+1, ....y+p-1.\n\nThus we have two cases, the first where the polynomial splits in F_p (a=0) and the other where we get a degree p extension, so F_(p^2).\n\nNotice that we are using the algebra student's dream (x+y)^p=x^p +y^p which is justified because we are working over a field of characteristic p.

question_title: How can a cut apple become brown color after leaving it for some while? [SEP] question_content: when u cut an apple, after for some while it will become brown in colour. given informatiion that the reduced guaiacol + H2O2 + enzyme peroxidase will produce oxidised guaiacol which give the color of brown. then why izzit  only the cut apple become brown?why cant the apple become brown when it is uncut? as all the conditions above are provided? [SEP] best_answer: Fresh cut apples turn brown when iron-containing chemicals inside apple cells react with oxygen in the air.  We see this every day when iron objects rust, or when scabs on cuts turn brown. \n\nThe chemical reaction is called "oxidation", and the enzyme that regulates oxidation in apples is called "polyphenol oxidase" (PPO), also known as "tyrosinase". \nThere are millions of tiny cells inside each apple.  One way apple cells get exposed to oxygen is by cutting the apple open.  This damages the wall that protects each cell and exposes its contents to oxygen in the air. \n\nBruised apples also exhibit oxidation.  When an apple gets damaged--as might happen if it were dropped--many of the cell walls inside the apple get broken.  \n\nYou see the browning when the fruit is cut or bruised because these actions damage the cells in the fruit, allowing oxygen in the air to react with the enzyme and other chemicals. When its uncut, this is much slower as the outer skin prevents oxidation.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: When the universe is essentially nothingness, how can there be an edge? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: consider your interesting question in 2 dimensions for example.\n\nthe surface a shadow exists on is its space or "nothingness" as you call it.  The shadow doesnt directly perceive this surface but exists ON it.\n\nwe exist in 3-D space but percieve it as nothing similiarly.\n\nthe "edge" that you refer to for the shadow is directly above the shadow at all times but the shadow cannot "go there" because it needs a surface to exist on ( a medium in effect ). \n\nFor us, the edge of the universe is always near us but in a direction we cannot physically point to.  We cannot ever reach the edge by traveling thru space.  It is like a shadow lifting off its surface and is a meaningless feat because a shadow cant exist without its surface or space.  \n\nsome physicist believe we live on the surface of a 4 dimensional sphere and if we traveled in a straight line thru space we would end up where we started ! \n\nregardless, your question cannot be understood by common sense but only abstractly.   simply put,  existence requires space and beyond space nothing exists  as far as rationalization.  \n\nanother way to understand it is to consider that space is something and not nothing.  "nothing" is that which is NOT space.\n\nyou see, it is all a matter of wordplay as no one has actually observed any of these ideas firsthand.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Spring problem for physics!? [SEP] question_content: A spring of negligible mass has force constant k = 1600 N/m.\n\nHow far must the spring be compressed for an amount 3.10 J of potential energy to be stored in it?\n\nYou place the spring vertically with one end on the floor. You then drop a book of mass 1.10 kg onto it from a height of 0.900 m above the top of the spring. Find the maximum distance the spring will be compressed.\nTake the free fall acceleration to be g = 9.80 m/s^2. [SEP] best_answer: Using the equation U = 0.5*k*x^2\n\nU = potential energy (joules)\nx = compression distance (meters)\nk = force constant (N/m)\n\nx = sqrt(2*U/k) = sqrt(2*3.1/1600) = 6.22cm\n\n\nFor part 2, assume the book transfers all of its potential energy into the spring.  First figure out the book's potential energy.\nUsing the equation: PE = m*g*h\nPE = Energy (joules)\nm = mass (kg)\ng = gravitational acceleration (m.s^2)\nh = height (meters)\n\nPE = 1.1 * 0.9 * 9.8 = 9.702 J\n\nThen calculate compression same as in part 1:\n\nx = sqrt(2*U/k) = sqrt(2*9.702/1600) = 11.0 cm	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What does the scale read after4.22s? [SEP] question_content: Water ( density = 1000kg/m^3) falls without splashing at a rate of 0.111 L/s from a height of 24.2m into a 1.07 kg bucket on a scale. The accelaration of gravity is 9.8m/s^2. \n\nIf the bucket is originally empty, what does the scale read after 4.22 s? Answer in units of N. [SEP] best_answer: The fall time T = sqrt(2*h/g) = 2.22 s. So only 4.22-2.22 = 2 s of water poured is in the pail. That's 2*.111 kg added to 1.07 kg = 1.292 kg. That mass * g = 12.66 N.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Why Hill stations are cooler than sea level regions even though they are closer to Sun than sea level regions? [SEP] question_content: For example, bangalore is cooler than chennai, even though it is 3000 ft above sea level, ie., it is closer to sun than chennai!!! [SEP] best_answer: First, a high elevation on Earth is not that much closer to the sun than sea level is when you consider the great distance from Earth to the sun.\n\nThe temperature changes have to do with air pressure... there is less of an atmosphere to hold in the heat at a high elevation than there is at sea level.  You might notice that cities at high elevation also have widely varying temperatures between day and night.  Here it will warm up in the day easily without much atmosphere to reflect energy from the sun, but at night it's like just having a sheet over you--the heat escapes easily.  At sea level you will warm up more slowly but hold that heat in much longer because you have a giant blanket of atmosphere over you, and higher air pressure to maintain the heat.  \n\nAlso at sea level, if you are by the sea, you have the added effect of the ocean or sea keeping the air temperate (around the same temperature all the time) since water maintains it temperature better than the air.

question_title: from your personal knowledge, who invented the traffic light? [SEP] question_content: from which state [SEP] best_answer: Fascinating facts about the invention\nof the Traffic Light by William L. Potts in 1920. TRAFFIC LIGHT \n \n Even during the horse and buggy days, traffic in big cities was often heavy. Police officers had to be stationed full time directing traffic at busy intersections.\n \nThe world’s first traffic light came into being before the automobile was in use, and traffic consisted only of pedestrians, buggies, and wagons.  Installed at an intersection in London in 1868, it was a revolving lantern with red and green signals.  Red meant "stop" and green meant "caution."  The lantern, illuminated by gas, was turned by means of a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced traffic.  On January 2, 1869, this crude traffic light exploded, injuring the policeman who was operating it.  \nWith the coming of automobiles, the situation got even worse. Police Officer William L.  Potts of Detroit, Michigan, decided to do something about the problem.  What he had in mind was figuring out a way to adapt railroad signals for street use.  The railroads were already utilizing automatic controls. But railroad traffic traveled along parallel lines.  Street traffic traveled at right angles. Potts used red, amber, and green railroad lights and about thirty-seven dollars worth of wire and electrical controls to make the world’s first 4-way three color traffic light. It was installed in 1920 on the corner of Woodward and Michigan Avenues in Detroit. Within a year, Detroit had installed a total of fifteen of the new automatic lights.\nAt about the same time, Garrett Morgan of the United States realized the need to control the flow of traffic. A gifted inventor and reportedly the first African American to own an automobile in Cleveland, Ohio, he invented the electric automatic traffic light.   Though it looked more like the semaphore signals you see at train crossings today. \n\nMany others had obtained US Patents for Traffic Signals, some as early as 1918. But Morgan's Patent was purchased by General Electric Corporation and provided the concept on which GE's four-way traffic lights are based.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: which way does toilet water flow when you flush a toilet it in the southern hemisphere? [SEP] question_content: in the northern hemisphere it flow clockwise. [SEP] best_answer: It should flow counterclockwise because of the Coriolis effect.\n\nHowever:\n\n>> But, the Coriolis force is very small, indeed. \n \nCompared to the rotations that one usually sees (tires on a travelling automobile, a compact disc playing music, or a draining sink), the rotation of the Earth is very small: only one rotation per day. The water in a sink might make a rotation in a few seconds and so have a rotation rate ten thousand times higher than that of the Earth. It should not be surprising, therefore, to learn that the Coriolis force is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the forces involved in these everyday spinning things. The Coriolis force is so small, that it plays no role in determining the direction of rotation of a draining sink anymore than it does the direction of a spinning CD. \n\nThe direction of rotation of a draining sink is determined by the way it was filled, or by vortices introduced while washing. The magnitude of these rotations may be small, but they are nevertheless gargantuan by comparison to the rotation of the Earth. I decided to include a picture of a draining sink, and the first one I tried in my house was found to drain clockwise (the opposite of what the silly assertions would have it do here in the northern hemisphere). This direction was determined entirely by the way the tap filled the sink. The direction of rotation of a draining toilet is determined by the way the water just under the rim is squirted into the bowl when it is flushed.<<\n\nI guess you'll just have to observe - I have made the water in kitchen sinks swirl the "wrong" way just for the heck of it, and it doesn't begin to immediately go the "right" way unless I act on it.

question_title: ???What if??? [SEP] question_content: IF WE ONLY US 10% OF OUR BRAIN WHAT IS THE REST FOR?? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE USED ALL OF OUR BRAIN?? [SEP] best_answer: The ten percent myth goes back a long way.  It started when a doctor started stimulating the brain of people who consented during brain surgery.  He would see legs, eyes, arms, hands, etc. twitch when he stimulated a certain area of the brain called the motor cortex.  Other areas produced no effect thus he called then the "silent" areas.  Thus only 10% of the brain produced an effect.  These others areas are now known for processing information from sound, light, touch, pain, temperature.  They also very important for the storage of long term memories.  \nThe fact is that we use every part of our brain, we just don't use it all at the same time.  Do you know what we call it when large portions of our brain are stimulated at the same time?  A seizure.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: the white mouse is most probaly:\nA) homozygous recessive\nB) Heterozygous\nC) Homozygous dominant\nD) Haploid [SEP] best_answer: A)\n\nThe white mouse shares the phenotype and genotype of parents\n\nMother white mouse: aa\nFather white mouse: aa\nWhite mouse: aa\n\nThe Brown mouse might be 2 things, \neither heterozygous: Aa\nor homozygous dominant: AA\n\n(in these type of exercises, when you mate something with an animal from which you have no info, he's usually homozygous. And if he wasn't the next step would not work.)\n\nTherefore, the mating of the white mouse (aa) with the brown mouse (AA) give only heterozygous (Aa) brown mice.\n\nWhy not B?\nBecause if the white mouse was heterozygous (Bb), that meant that "White" was the dominant gene, and the brown mouse had to be homozygous recessive (bb). But now you can say that they still could have a brown mice offspring, because they both carry a recessive allele (bb). Well, yes, but eventually white mice would appear in the be born (BB, Bb). This way it would never be all brown.\n\nWhy not C?\nBecause all the offspring would then be all white and never brown. It's the inverse of example A).\n\nWhy not D?\nBecause the white mouse is alive and fertile.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: We all know the chemical formula for water is C02, so why don't we just make some more? Why shortages? Simple [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Okay...\n\nFor starters, water is H2O. We can make H2O by burning hydrogen gas in the presence of oxygen, easy, but then where would we get enough hydrogen gas to make even a noticeable amount of water? Besides, the problem isnt finding H2O--it's producing clean water. Most of our planet is under water, and there's tons of water vapor in the air. The difficulty is getting a large source of water where peole live, purifying it, and keeping it clean until it gets to people's homes.\n\nThe shortages in your area may be because there's just no ready source of water there, or because your community uses way too much of it. Environmental stuff like seasons play a part, too. There's usually less water in reservoirs during summer because of the decreased rainfall and increased evaporation.\n\nSometimes science isn't the problem. We already have more than enough technological remedies for every little inconvenience. Start conserving water, and you won't have to worry about shortages.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: is there anything multiplied by 0 is not equal to Zero.\ni mean x * 0 not equal 0 [SEP] best_answer: if we speak of numbers and not of limits, the answer is no without exceptions: 0 is defined in group theory as the null element, so it is BY DEFINITION the element which multiplied by any other gives itself: always 0.\nInstead, what we usually assume as always true, but is not true in some finite algebraic models, is that if A*B=0 then either A=0 or B=0. This is not always true in all algebraic models (for exemple in modular algebra).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does Moussaoui deserve a death sentence? [SEP] question_content: Zacarias Moussaoui gave a clear testimony that he hates Americans and would kill more if given the chance. To the question "Are you insane?" he also replied, "Thank God I am not." He's not mentally insane in terms of psychological excuses. But he has given himself over to evil and is letting another power control him. Does he deserve the death penalty? [SEP] best_answer: It is my belief that the death penalty is not meant for Mr. Moussaoui.  He is clearly a conspirator and should be  taken at his word. His own testimony should be interpreted as an intent to continue his conspiracies.  \n\nSince any punishment may lead to his martyrdon, I think that his fate should be put in his god's hands.  Take him on a destroyer to the Indian Ocean about 20 miles from the coast.  Supply him with a boogie board and about a dozen fresh superficial cuts, just enough to draw blood.  Dump him in the ocean and point him in the direction of the coast and tell him to start paddling.  This is where the destroyer will come in handy.  Any boats that would try to assist can be blown out of the water.	Society & Culture
question_title: what is the real purpose of living in this world and why we are alive and living? [SEP] question_content: please answer this seriously.. [SEP] best_answer: To learn how to love Christ and serve him. This world would have been a perfect paradise. There would be no pain, no suffering, no saddness, no depression, no sickness et al. God made us perfect and gave us a perfect world. He made us so he would not be lonely. He first created man and then created woman to be man's companion. When evil came, due to Satan turning against God (The fallen angel), it changed life. Due to sin, man was now stricken with pain, suffering, sickness etc. God then gave all mankind free will to choose their own path. He later sent Christ, his only son, to save us from our sins. So then our mission became that which what we must do to follow God's path for our life. It became neccessary for us to resist the Devil and his ways. It is a daily struggle for all of us. I sort of like to look at life as a spiritual war. We are all in this war. We all join Gods Army or Satans Army.  If we are a soldier for Christ we stand behind him. He is our leader. We avoid the enemy. WE are wise to the traps and landmines the evil ones set before us. We walk carefully through life to avoid Satans folly. At the same time Christ wants us to learn how to love one another. It is also our responsibility once we have come to Christ to minister to others, by words and actions. It is our duty to live accordingly to Gods word. WE must come to know Jesus personally. We should live our life so that at the end when God judges us, he will say, welcome home, Job well done! If we walk God's path, we will be drawn to many of his people. We will find true bothers and sisters in Christ. I have been blessed to find many great people in my journey of walking in faith.

question_title: What Gods do Mormons believe in? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Lots and lots of them.

They have another Jesus, too....the "spirit brother of Lucifer"....who, with his "brother" each presented a plan of salvation for the new world...to a council of Gods (yes, Gods!) - and their Jesus won!!  Woo hooo!!  \n\nAfter they get themselves "sealed" in the Temple, in a cermony that is almost word-for-word out of the Masonic ritual (Jos. Smith was a Mason, you know...)....they can go on to become gods, too....and practice polygamy....because, after all - once the husbands call their wives out of the grave with the secret password given to them at the "sealing ceremony" (uh oh, wives - if they forget the password....you are doomed!) - they need  as many wives as possible to keep eternally pregnant so they can populate the new planet that they are now the "only god" of.\n\nGreat stuff....for a science fiction novel.  \n\nToo bad so many folks don't know the truth.

question_title: can you tell me anything about Buddhism? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Buddhism generally explain the cause of our existence , and how to end the rebirth cycle . The main core teaching of The Lord Buddha is the Four Noble Truth and the Noble Eight Fold Path . These teachings or Dharma preach by The Buddha teaches us on how to end our suffering by practicing Morality ( Sila ) , Samadhi ( Concentration ) and Panna ( Wisdom )\n\nFrom the Dharma that The Lord Buddha have preached to us , the cause of Suffering ( our existence ) is due to Tanha ( attachment ).  Literally , Tanha means thirst which covers all the senses of greed , lust , desire, cravings , and likes .\n\nWhen there is Tanha , there will be suffering . For example , people who are very greedy and love their money so much that they do not want to be apart . This is the attachment and when they loss their money , they feel very sad which is clearly a suffering to them . Or when one loss a love one , this is also a suffering because they are very attached to the decease .\n\nAs summary : Suffering is the cause of Attachment . Attachment is the cause of Wrong View . Wrong view is the cause of Ignorant . So , By learning and practicing the Dharma , one is expected to eliminate Ignorant ( Moha / Avijja in Pali Language ) which eventually , eliminates sufferings in the end . \n\nIt may be very hard to understand Budhhism here because you may not understand what i say here . However , what i have written here is only a very general idea on what Buddhism is since there are those who have already told you who the Buddha is .\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about Buddhism , you can always attend to the nearest Buddhist temple or other Buddhist website. There is no regulation such as if you enter a Buddhist Temple , you must be a Buddhist . Every people ( from other religion or all walks of life )is allowed to come , investigate , question and study the Dharma ( teachings of the Buddha ) without the need to convert to Buddhism if he / she has no intention to do so .\n\nHowever , for those who wish to create havoc by questioning every thing about the teaching of the Buddha in which his / her objective is not towards the understanding of the religion but more to condemning the religion , i urge them all to be more understanding and stop their action as many people will be irritated or hurt by their words.\n\nSadhu , May all be well and happy ..

question_title: The act of commit suicide?? In the Bible noted? [SEP] question_content: Matthew 27:5 says that Judas Iscariot when he died he hung himself. Acts 1 says that 'no' he jumped off a cliff head first.\n\nAny explainations to this? Which method did he died?\n\nThanks [SEP] best_answer: According to Matthew 27:5, Judas hanged himself. But Acts 1:18 says, “pitching head foremost he noisily burst in his midst and all his intestines were poured out.” Matthew seems to deal with the mode of the attempted suicide, while Acts describes the result. Combining the two accounts, it appears that Judas tried to hang himself over some cliff, but the rope or tree limb broke so that he plunged down and burst open on the rocks below. The topography around Jerusalem makes such an event conceivable.	Society & Culture

question_title: How essential is it to study comparative religions?  Do you think we really can learn from such a study?  Shou [SEP] question_content: ... [SEP] best_answer: Actually I think alot can be learned from comparative religion,especially if you go back far enough to see the similarities between different religions so that you can see the possibility of things taught in one religion actually having origins long before. One such example is the "ressurection" which of course was only witnessed by Jesus's followers,therefore there is no reason to believe it really happened,but if you go back in time you find other religions with very similar stories,stories that perhaps the Christians borrowed from in creation of their theology. And it makes perfect sense since some of the religions I speak of were worshipped by their ancestors,like the Canaanites who worshipped Baal and who at one time had a yearly celebration marking his death and ressurection. Although these things changed over time and eventually Baal and his father Dagon were eventually put in the trash heap of theology to be ignored and mocked the fact remains that many of the practices from that religion were eventually merged into the belief systems that followed. If nothing else it provides a launching board for the very factual belief that God is a creation of man,not the other way around. \n\nAD	Society & Culture

question_title: what is a deist? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Rather than just give you a cut and paste answer that requires no thought, I will actually contribute something here.  A deist was a religious follower from the early late 17th and 18th centuries who mixed the age of faith with the new age of reason or enlightenment.  Many of our Founding  Fathers were deists such as Jefferson, Adams, Washington, and Franklin.  They saw God as a celestial match maker who created the universe (the watch) wound it up (began life) and then stepped back and let things run on their own.  That way it mixed science with religion neatly in their minds.  They did not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ, nor did they believe that prayer was useful.  God was no longer involved in the affairs of mankind.  Deism will pretty much die out during the second great awakening of the 1820s-30s.	Society & Culture

Of course, you would see good things too, but I think after so much time, you start to get tired and cynical.\n\nWould you really think Jesus is just biding his time, or would you start to think that maybe Revelations was a bad choice to enter into the canon?  Maybe it was meant to encourage  followers very near to the time it was written?\n\nI'm open to your ideas. [SEP] best_answer: Jesus certainly existed - no serious historian doubts this (the handful of pop religion books on the topic notwithstanding.) There is plenty of evidence, written and otherwise - from the still extant ruins of Peter's house in Capernaum (Jesus' home base), to his mention (the second mention is not interpolation) in Josephus' "Antiquities", and Tacitus' reference to him.\n\nAs to the second coming of Jesus, none knows the hour, or the way. None of us should be confident we'll see it whether  we live five years or five hundred. It happens when it happens, in the way that it happens. "Stay awake", we are told, live an exemplary life. Every day is to be lived as though it were the dawn of the day of the Lord.\n\nAs Mother Theresa said, "Yesterday is past, and tomorrow is not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin."

question_title: Evolution versus creation? [SEP] question_content: If the theory of evolution is not valid, and if God created man, then why does a human foetus before 12 weeks have gills and a tail? [SEP] best_answer: Here's the thing: I'm not an expert on fetal anatomy, but human fetuses do not have gills.  They do have tails for a few weeks, appearing around the 4th week and dispearing around the 8th.  They also have regions that are homolgous to those that develop into gills in aquatic organisms, but will form the throat of the human fetus.\n\nThe gill and tail myth was created by a man named Haeckel.  Now, Haeckel actually (whatever creationists may say) did have some good ideas, but he was a very bad scientist and had an unfortunate tendancy, especially in the later part of his career, to exagerate and even completely fabricate morphological features of embryos.\n\nHOWEVER, there _is_ an association between fetal development and evolutionary lineage.  It's just a bit more subtle than Haeckel claimed.  While embryos don't go through stages that ressemble the adult forms of their ancestors, the is a distinct correlation between the age at which the morphology of embryos of different species diverges and the evolutionary relationship between those species.  For example, human embryos and chimp embryos look really similar for a lot longer than human embryos and snake embryos.  But human and snake embryos look similar to each other long after they have completely diverged from the development of, say, a sea urchin.\n\nYour point about gills and tails isn't very accurate, and the actual connection between evolution and development is not very accesable to the non-scientist, but there is plenty of evidence for evolution that doesn't take a PhD to understand.  Here are a few points that I hope will help you next time you want to defend the theory of evolution:\n\n\n1. Vestigial structures\n\nOne example of a vestigial structure in humans is the appendix. It has no function. Removing it is harmful only in so far as any surgery is associated with certain risks (so I wouldn't have it removed just for fun, but it's because of the surgery not the absence of the appendix). An appendix is found in several mammals. In humans it is small and has no known function. In rabbits and many other herbivores it is large and is used in the digestion of cellulose.\n\nAnother example of a vestigial structure is the hipbones of snakes. Snakes evolved from quadrupeds, and some species still retain not on pelvises, but tiny protrusions of bone in a location that corresponds to the location of the legs in other quadrupeds.\n\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n\nCreationists will tell you that microevolution does not prove macroevolution.  This is true.  However, it does provide evidence that macroevolution may be possible. Taken in the context of the other evidence for evolution, microevolution provides a mechanism by which macroevolution could occur. On its own, it doesn't prove that macroevolution occurs, but it does suggest that it is possible.\n\n3. The fossil record.\n\nAlthough the fossil record does not provide a “complete” record as fossils form only under certain conditions, it does show a gradual change in the morphology of species as well as numerous extinct species.  There are a number of methods used to date fossils, and the time period from which a fossil comes can be determined with reasonable accuracy.\n\n4. Imperfect structures (the blind spot of the mammalian eye, for example).\n\nI want to mention the bind-spot of the mammalian eye specifically because creationists often hold up the human eye up as an example of something that is too perfect to occur by "chance" (i.e. as the result of the natural selection of beneficial changes among random mutations).\n\nThere are also numerous examples where the morphology of a species is constrained by similar patterns in its ancestors (quadrupeds, vertebrates, etc.).\n\n5. Developmental biology reflects evolutionary lineage.\n\nCreationists like to bring up a man named Haeckel in response to this argument. 	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Psalms 82:6\nI said, "You are gods, And all of you are children of the Most High......."\n\nJohn 10:34\nJesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"'?......\n\nObviously Hes not saying that we are God.. But I dont really understand. I read the entire Psalm and searched the surronding context of John, but I am still not quite understanding. [SEP] best_answer: Hannibal Lecktor said, "...if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is."\n\nWell, that is a twisted truth. Hey, it's Lecktor, what do you expect? But basically, God made man and gave him an incredible authority, that of being a "judge". As a judge you are exercising power much like God--that is, as judge and arbiter over men's lives. This was an awesome responisbility. Now look at the Psalm you sited closely and in context...\n\nWhat sets God apart?\nGod stands in the congregation of the mighty;\nHe judges among the gods.\n\nWas God satisfied with their judgments?\nHow long will you judge unjustly,\nAnd show partiality to the wicked? \n\nGod gave them a great responsibility...\nI said, “You are gods,\nAnd all of you are children of the Most High.\n\nBut did they live up to the task? NO!\nBut you shall die like men,\nAnd fall like one of the princes.\n\nThe Pharisees knew the scriptures up and down, inside and out. When He said, "It is written", the Pharisees would pride themselves on knowing the full scripture, its context, and what early sages said about it. When Jesus said, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"' What the Pharisee would immediately recognize is that in judging Jesus of being a blasphemer, they were not fulfilling their role as proper judges and would die as men due to mishandling their office. Jesus would only be a blasphemer if He wasn't GOD, and so He told them to judge by the works He did since they would validate His claim.\n\nIt's a toughy, but you have to put yourself in the place of the Pharisees listening to Him. It was a real jaw dropper for them. Notice they did not say much after that.	Society & Culture

I guess it's true that bad parenting is the cause of these kids falling into crime and crap.  What do you think, even if they had good parenting, would they still be cholos??\n\nMy cousin is so outgoing.. and he lived in mexico, did so much stuff was influenced so much by friends and so on even was like a rebel, but he didn't end up a gangster nor was he  even a criminal. He's a hard worker, and his parents and family are close bonded and that's why hes good. I also never got into any thing gang related and i have a good family relationship. So are those kids who are not studying and who begin to do bad things since Junior high, does it necesarily mean they have a bad family relationship?

question_title: Another question about God or Jesus in the according to the christian view? [SEP] question_content: Ok, so on my last Jesus question I recieved varying answers. I had heard of the trinity thing and it kind of does not make sense, explain please. So Jesus was God in a human form. Does that mean he pretended to die? and when he 'died' he was resurrected to...himself? \n\nMatthew 3:16\nAs soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.\nWhat does this verse mean? Jesus saw himself lighting upon himself?\nThanks [SEP] best_answer: The notion of the Trinity was (I believe) first coined by Tertullian in approx. 200 AD to refer to 3 of something, though vague references to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit being one are present in the New Testament (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14 and a few more).  It was not until LATER theological study that the idea became part of the Christian Orthodox dogma.  It was made official by the first Council of Nicea, hence the line in the Nicene Creed: "And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the giver of life, who proceeds from the father, whom together with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, who spoke through the Prophets."

Even though I'm not a big fan of large breasts it's hard not to talk to so much surface area, especailly when it's thrust in your face. \n\nVery scantily clad ladies I'm going notice body in general first. For example a lady in a bikini I'm looking at the midriff first then up and down. \n\nA lady with lots of clothing up top, but wearing hot shorts that she's falling out of and is walking away I'm going to look at her butt first. \n\nA gal with really long and well kept hair it'll be the hair. On the flip side really short hair will normally cause me to look elsewhere completely.

When a mind is full of guilt, anger, jealousy or selfishness etc, it suffers by its own negative karma.

question_title: what's the difference between zeitgeist and Gestalt? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Gestalt is a German word meaning shape or form. The word also bears connotations to creativity (Gestaltung). In English gestalt refers to the concept where an entity's properties cannot be discovered from the total properties of its parts. The more general English equivalents are synergy, holism, emergence, and variations on the phrase "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts".\n\nLook up gestalt in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.In psychology, Gestalt can refer to: \nGestalt psychology (Gestalt theory), and Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy \nGestalt therapy \nThe Gestalt effect \nGestalt was also the name of an environment-query function in Mac OS. \nGestalt is also a term used in Dungeons and Dragons to represent a warrior/arcane mage multiclass combination or character concept, although the term can be more generally used to describe when the features of two or more classes are combined to create a 'mixed' class at first level (also known as taking apprentice levels). In Dungeons and Dragons v3.5, gestalt is a variant rule from the sourcebook Unearthed Arcana which allows a character to simultaneously take two classes at once, gaining the abilities and strengths of both. \nFans of the Transformers (and to some degree Hasbro) use the term gestalt to refer to teams of robots which can combine together to form one large robot which is "stronger than the sum of its parts". \nAuthor Theodore Sturgeon (February 26, 1918 - May 8, 1985) referred to the term gestalt in his book More Than Human (Farrar & Straus, 1953. International Fantasy Award) to describe a series of characters that together created "a greater being", also implying that this was the next stage in human evolution. Nonetheless the different people that formed the gestalt could be changed for another person with similar characteristics (for example, a person that performed as a "head" could be exchanged for another person as long as he was able to be a "head" and was accepted in the gestalt). \nThis is a disambiguation page — a list of articles associated with the same title. If an internal link referred you to this page, you may wish to change the link to point directly to the intended article.\n(disambiguation). \nLook up Zeitgeist in Wiktionary, the free dictionaryZeitgeist is originally a German expression that means "the spirit (Geist) of the time (Zeit)". It denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of an era. Volksgeist has similar meaning. Zeitgeist is still used in German, while Volksgeist is not.\n\nThe concept of Zeitgeist goes back to the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder. In 1769 he wrote a critique of the work Genius seculi by the philologist Christian Adolph Klotz (German Wikipedia article) and introduced the word Zeitgeist into German as a translation of genius seculi (Latin: genius - "guardian spirit" and saeculi - "of the century").\n\nZeitgeist has achieved a unique status among German loanwords in other tongues, having found an entrance into English, Spanish, Dutch and even Japanese.\n\nIt is a term that refers to the ethos of a cohort of people, that spans one or more subsequent generations, who despite their diverse age and socio-economic background experience a certain worldview, which is prevalent at a particular period of socio-cultural progression. Zeitgeist is the experience of a dominant cultural climate that defines, particularly in Hegelian thinking, an era in the dialectical progression of a people or the world at large.\n\n[edit]\nQuotations\nWhoever marries the zeitgeist will be a widower soon. - August Everding (German Wikipedia	Society & Culture
question_title: Why is this country becoming Utah?!? [SEP] question_content: More American pharmacists are refusing to fill prescriptions for birth control because of their personal moral objections. What is up with that? I know the other side is saying, yes, but this is a moral issue. Yeah, but the problem is, not everyone gets their morals from the same book. They go by the book that says slavery is okay but sex is wrong until after marriage, at which point it becomes a blessed sacrament between a husband and the wife who is withholding it. Well, let me say to all the activist pharmacists out there, the ones who think sex is bad probably because sex with them always is, hey, a pharmacist is not a law-giver, not even a doctor. In the medical pecking order, they rank somewhere in between a chiropractor and a tree surgeon. They don't answer to a law above the laws of men. They work for Sav-On. The doctors are the ones who make medical decisions because they went to medical school, whereas they were transferred from the counter where people drop off film. Why?

question_title: doesnt abortion go against the commandment "thou shalt not kill"? [SEP] question_content: keep in mind, im not talking about rape or incest, just regular abortion ... [SEP] best_answer: I agree with you that abortions are wrong. I strongly believe that it is cruel and takes away the life of a child. Everyone should have the right to live and I believe it is selfish of someone to take away a child's entire life because they don't want 9 months of suffering. If they can't take care of the child there is always adoption. To those who say that a women should have the right to chose, what about the unborn child, shouldn't he have some rights or at the very least the right to live. Now this is also disapproved by religion as it goes against the 10 commandments as so forth but it is more then that, its a matter of love and selflessness, its morality and common sense. Abortion is murder and murder is wrong.	Society & Culture

question_title: What are hanukkah and kwanzaa? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Chanukkah, the Jewish festival of rededication, also known as the festival of lights, is an eight day festival beginning on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev. \n\nChanukkah is probably one of the best known Jewish holidays, not because of any great religious significance, but because of its proximity to Christmas. Many non-Jews (and even many assimilated Jews!) think of this holiday as the Jewish Christmas, adopting many of the Christmas customs, such as elaborate gift-giving and decoration. It is bitterly ironic that this holiday, which has its roots in a revolution against assimilation and the suppression of Jewish religion, has become the most assimilated, secular holiday on our calendar. \n\nThe Story \nThe story of Chanukkah begins in the reign of Alexander the Great. Alexander conquered Syria, Egypt and Palestine, but allowed the lands under his control to continue observing their own religions and retain a certain degree of autonomy. Under this relatively benevolent rule, many Jews assimilated much of Hellenistic culture, adopting the language, the customs and the dress of the Greeks, in much the same way that Jews in America today blend into the secular American society. \n\nMore than a century later, a successor of Alexander, Antiochus IV was in control of the region. He began to oppress the Jews severely, placing a Hellenistic priest in the Temple, massacring Jews, prohibiting the practice of the Jewish religion, and desecrating the Temple by requiring the sacrifice of pigs (a non-kosher animal) on the altar. Two groups opposed Antiochus: a basically nationalistic group led by Mattathias the Hasmonean and his son Judah Maccabee, and a religious traditionalist group known as the Chasidim, the forerunners of the Pharisees (no direct connection to the modern movement known as Chasidism). They joined forces in a revolt against both the assimilation of the Hellenistic Jews and oppression by the Selucid Greek government. The revolution succeeded and the Temple was rededicated. \n\nAccording to tradition as recorded in the Talmud, at the time of the rededication, there was very little oil left that had not been defiled by the Greeks. Oil was needed for the menorah (candelabrum) in the Temple, which was supposed to burn throughout the night every night. There was only enough oil to burn for one day, yet miraculously, it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of oil for the menorah. An eight day festival was declared to commemorate this miracle. Note that the holiday commemorates the miracle of the oil, not the military victory: Jews do not glorify war. \n\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITION OF KWANZAA Kwanzaa is a unique African American celebration with focus on the traditional African values of family, community responsibility, commerce, and self-improvement. Kwanzaa is neither political nor religious and despite some misconceptions, is not a substitute for Christmas. It is simply a time of reaffirming African-American people, their ancestors and culture. Kwanzaa, which means "first fruits of the harvest" in the African language Kiswahili, has gained tremendous acceptance. Since its founding in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, Kwanzaa has come to be observed by more than18 million people worldwide, as reported by the New York Times. When establishing Kwanzaa in 1966, Dr. Karenga included an additional "a" to the end of the spelling to reflect the difference between the African American celebration (kwanzaa) and the Motherland spelling (kwanza). \nKwanzaa is based on the Nguzo Saba (seven guiding principles), one for each day of the observance, and is celebrated from December 26th to January 1st. \n\nUmoja (oo-MO-jah) Unity stresses the importance of togetherness for the family and the community, which is reflected in the African saying, "I am We," or "I am because We are." \nKujichagulia (koo-gee-cha-goo-LEE-yah) Self-Determination requires that we define our common in	Society & Culture

question_title: Should a woman submit herself to her husband? [SEP] question_content: I have heard men and women argue over the subject that men should be the head of the house and woman are to submit to them. I want to hear others views on this. \n\nGod said.."EPH 5:22 ¶ Wives, be subject to your own husbands." Men love this bible verse they use it all the time. But what does this mean and what did God say to men? In the same passage further down God says, "EPH 5:28 So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it." \n\nWhat if the man were so in love with his wife that she was his only need? What if the thing that made him happy was to see her safe and fulfilled? Would it be so wrong for her to submit to him? Would it not be a natural response? [SEP] best_answer: No- this is a bunch of male crap. Anyone who uses religion to control or enslave someone, should be horsewhipped.

question_title: What gift is appropriate when you're not invited to the wedding?

I feel like I should still send her some sort of gift (despite the fact that my feelings are hurt by being excluded).  What type of gift is appropriate? [SEP] best_answer: It's hard to not take it personal, I know - but don't. It could be that you are one of many friends she would've loved to be there with her but her beau was against a big ceremony. It could be many things but don't think so much about it. Just be happy for her and make sure you give her a huge hug and congratulate her. An appropriate gift would be a hand-written letter on pretty stationary telling her how much her friendship means to you, and that you wish her the best in her marriage.	Society & Culture

Stealing is wrong because it means someone doesn't have something they own and I know how that feels. My parents taught me a fine job without the use of religion..

question_title: your feelings about the sins in the Bible? [SEP] question_content: After 243 questions, i'm starting to get the way most christians interpret the bible. A sin is a sin is a sin. There is no 'in between', a sin is a sin. Because it's God's word. Ok, i begin to get that part now. (i am kinda slow in these matters, sorry)\n\nI was wondering, seriously, do you ever have a feeling about all this? Do you ever wish something God tells you to be wrong, would in fact be not all that wrong? Specially the trivial items, like wearing clothes of two different fabrics, homosexuality, eating shelfish?\n\nWouldn't life be much easier if those things were never mentioned in the Bible??\n\nDon't get me wrong, i understand that is your feeling that God's word should always be concidered as the full Truth, i just wonder how it makes you feel. [SEP] best_answer: Things have to be taken in context.  I agree that the wearing of mixed fabrics and refraining from shellfish are not about morality, they are about sanctity - God set the Jews out to be His people of promise.  The Messiah came through them.  It's not that God didn't have dealings with (and laws for) other nations, but the Jews were bound to certain rituals and stipulations that had more to do with symbolism than with morality.\n\nSin is any transgression against God.  All sins are the same in the sense that any of them separate me from God.  Any of them.  I hope that's what people mean when they say that all sins are equal.  Because, of course, if they were all equal in all ways, they would all carry the same penalty.  Or the same level of consequence.  Under the Old Testament law, some sins carried more weight than others.  Some would get you stoned to death and others required a payment to be made.  \n\nI believe there is also a difference between willful - premeditated - sin and being "over-taken" in sin.  Maybe the difference is in the heart of the person and their willingness to repent.  \n\nAll sin is equal in that it is equally undoable.  Once done, it cannot be undone.  That's why we need a clean slate, and Someone advocating on our behalf.\n\nI believe that everything commanded of us - both to do and not to do - is for our benefit.  I don't claim to know all the pros and cons of homosexuality.   I certainly don't think that homosexuals are somehow in the same mindset as murderers.  I don't hate people for their sexual orientation.  \n\nI still believe that anything we surrender to God, He uses for our ultimate good.  Willingness is the key.  I'm not saying that's easy.  \n\nI also don't believe it's the orientation itself, but the lifestyle that is sinful.  It's the same for those who are unmarried (but sexually active) who are heterosexual.  \n\nSince I believe God's word is Truth, it would be unloving of me to say that I think something is fine, when from what I can see it is condemned.  I'm not going to persecute someone for disagreeing with me, but I'm not going to lie if asked for my understanding either. \n\nThere are many things that would be easier if they weren't in the Bible.  I feel sorrowful for those who oppose the truth (as I understand it).  It isn't anything to gloat about.  I know there are some who feel that that makes me arrogant.  That's not my experience or intention.  It's not me saying I'm better.    \n\nI believe that what is in there is for me to apply to me first. It's not something to bash other people with or impose on others.\n\nThanks for asking your question the way you did.  I hope I haven't offended you - or anyone else for that matter - in my answer.

This is a place that always had a fire and they burnt trash, animal carcasses, and live babies were sacrificed to molech the great owl god.Look at a map.In Psalm 16:10, & 49:15 David knew he was going to hell (grave) and would be resurected from it.Many of the older Bibles such as Geneva properly translated these words as grave or pit. It is impossible to have three totally different words and translate them all as hell. In the 1600's when the KJV Bible was made ,the meaning of the word hell was to put in the ground so when they changed the wording to hell they understood what it meant.If you look up Gehenna in Websters dictionary today you will see it tells you the same thing I said. Apparently its to difficult for most Christians to actually look up the meaning of a word, they prefer to listen to the lies that their preacher spews from the pulpit. My God will put you in hell when you die,the grave, and regardless of your beliefs or how you lived you will be resurected for judgement. To receive eternal life you must know Christ as saviour, if not you will be thrown into the lake of fire Rev. 20:14,this is the second death, where people are consumed instantly and permanently. No eternal suffering and torment.I am a Christian and I think its a shame that churches use these kind of scare tactics to keep people in church.	Society & Culture
question_title: Lesbian Home? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend currently owns the home that we live in. Since I pay bills equally, what would happen to the house if anything ever happened to her?  Would I have to move into a new place or would I be able to have the house signed over to me? [SEP] best_answer: You may want to get some legal documentation written up so that you get her assets in the unfortunate event that she dies or something happens to her. As a same sex couple, you have no rights over anything unless you specify it in a legal will or something. Also, it would be a good idea for you and her to go to a lawyer and get a DPOA written up in the event that something happens and you need to be the person making decisions, if you dont have that, hospitals can and will deny you that right. Here is a prime example of the reason we need to be able to legally get married. To bad our stupid conservative nation will not open there eyes and see that eh?	Society & Culture
question_title: What services and help do people around you need? [SEP] question_content: What realistic changes in your community could help people? If you know of specific examples, please feel free to share them. What could people do to help others? Is there something on your street, or in your school or workplace, that needs to be made better, or fixed, or improved?\n\nThanks - every response is appreciated! [SEP] best_answer: The public schools in my city need smaller classes, the teachers are worn out with all these children in one class and trying to teach and quiet half of them do in order to teach,therefore lots of time gets wasted and only 1/2 the lesson planned for that day gets taught.  Also they need books, the teens in highschool barely have homework because they can't take the books home.....I'll just leave it at there	Society & Culture
question_title: do you think the use of marijuana is becoming more or less acceptable? [SEP] question_content: not in legal terms but in how our society views  people that use it [SEP] best_answer: Well people have been smoking it for ever and it is not a big deal.  My parents would have sh1t themselves if they knew I had tried it because they had no experience with it.  When my daughter smoked it, it was no big deal because I knew what she was getting into.

question_title: As a Muslim, I would like you Christians to explain for me what the trinity myth is all about.. wanna help? [SEP] question_content: Well, so far I did not get to see a clear picture that can make trinity to me logical, Christiansclaim that trinity is a hard to understand thing, I say trinity is B.S. since it is nothing but a damn old mythology that has no base, for God is One and not three nor three in one... if you think otherwise, please explain your trinity and BACK UP YOUR CLAIMS WITH verses from any of today's Bibles available.. [SEP] best_answer: I'll make this simple and understandable for you.  God is love.  Love is nothing if it cannot be shared.  God created his son in order to share his love.  That allowed both God and Jesus his son to love, but only back and forth.  The trinity was formed when God created the Holy Spirit, thus allowing Gods love and Jesus' love to flow with and through the Holy Spirit.  You might notice that I said God created Jesus in order to share his love, yet Jesus came into a human form long after other humans had.  That is because God has no beginning and no end.  Since Jesus is the son of God, he too had no beginning and no end, save for his human existence.\n\nI hope that explains it clearly.	Society & Culture

question_title: Adam and Eve, inbreeding to populate earth, vestigial organs...? [SEP] question_content: Do any creationists have a way to incorporate things like vestigial organs with the creation and propagation of humans? Vestigial organs are parts of our body that we don't use, but science thinks we used to at an earlier stage.  ex. appendix, fetal gills [SEP] best_answer: Am I the only one bold enough to say this? ADAM AND EVE WERE NOT REAL. Study human evolution and you will better understand where we all came from and why we are hairless and other things as well. Adam and Eve were a construct designed to explain the unexpainable back before we had the means to figure out the truth. Thats what religion is. Sad but true. Not saying there is no God, but religion is mostly just stories put together over our history to explain things as we began to wonder but stilllacked the technology to answer ourselves. Now we do!

question_title: does anyone believe in the whole 6-6-06 thing?? [SEP] question_content: i do [SEP] best_answer: I personally don't since it is a way to scare people to be converted as Christians or Catholics.  Do you remember in 2000 and everybody was talking about the end of the world and it never happen?  A lot of religious people claim that the end is near and go by different scenario that will cause the end of mankind.  Remember that it is June 6, 2006 (remember that isn't 6-6-6 but 6-6-06).  That doesn't make any freaking sense.	Society & Culture
