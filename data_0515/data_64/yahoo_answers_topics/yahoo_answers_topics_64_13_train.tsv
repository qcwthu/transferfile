question_title: what is Holy grail? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In Christian mythology, the Holy Grail was the dish, plate, bowl, glass, cup or vessel used by Jesus at the Last Supper, said to possess miraculous powers. The connection of Joseph of Arimathea with the Grail legend dates from Robert de Boron's Joseph d'Arimathie (late twelfth century) in which Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus and sends it with his followers to Great Britain; building upon this theme, later writers recounted how Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him and that in Britain he founded a line of guardians to keep it safe. The quest for the Holy Grail makes up an important segment of the Arthurian cycle, appearing first in works by Chr√©tien de Troyes.[1] The legend may combine Christian lore with a Celtic myth of a cauldron endowed with special powers.\n\nThe development of the Grail legend has been traced in detail by cultural historians: It is a gothic legend, which first came together in the form of written romances, deriving perhaps from some pre-Christian folklore hints, in the later 12th and early 13th centuries. The early Grail romances centered on Percival and were woven into the more general Arthurian fabric. The Grail romances started in France and were translated into other European vernaculars; only a handful of non-French romances added any essential new elements.\n\nSome of the Grail legend is interwoven with legends of the Holy Chalice.

question_title: Is the Church in USA Roman Catholic? What's the relation with the Vatican? [SEP] question_content: I am European. I would like to understand the way the Christian Church is divided in the USA. For instance in Europe you have the Roman Catholics to the West; Protestants in England, Germany etc. and the Orthodox Church to the East. How about in USA?\n\nA good link would do too.\n\nPS: This question is not about faith etc. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I live in a small town in Kansas; right in the center of the USA.  Our population is under 30,000 people.\n\nWe have:\n\n2 Jewish synagogues\n1 Muslim Temple\n1 Pagan sanctuary\n6 Roman Catholic Churches\n4 Baptist churches\n5 (that I know of) Covens (Wiccan)\n5 Protestant churches\n1 Jahovah's Witness' meeting hall\n1 Irish Catholic church\n1 Seventh Day Adventist church\n3 Lutheran churches\n2 Jesus' Christ of Later Day Saints churches\n2 Non-denominational Christian churches\n2 Korean/Christian churches\n2 All Faith religious Centers (catering to any/all religions)\n2 Mormon Churches\n1 Bahai group\n2 New Age Metaphysical groups\n1 Church of Satan\n...  and easily 10 more churches/worhip places which, honestly, I don't know who attends.\n\nI've actually looked for a complete list of churches in Kansas, but can't find one.  There are literally thousands, of varieing faiths.  For all the variety of faiths practicing openly in Kansas, Kansas is, itself, accepted as being one of the more conservative states in our Union.\n\n  \nYou're getting the idea that we really do have a large mix of faiths/spirital practictioners in any area of the USA.  While any given religion might not actually be accepting of another; we do reasonably well at tolerating, if nothing more, people of other faiths.  And tentions/hostilities which do exist are generally demonstrated more covertly than overtly.\n\nSpecifically to Catholicism:  The Roman Catholic Churches in the USA are a bit at odds with The Vatican.  They don't adhere to Papal authority as much as The Vatican would like, and, with some frequency, are threatened with ex-communication.\n\nI hope that gives you some insight into how things work here.  Thanks.	Society & Culture
question_title: I want to know if there are Seventh-day Adventists over there? [SEP] question_content: How do you find life as an Adventist? where's your church located? thank you very much. Have a blessed day! [SEP] best_answer: My whole family are seventh Day Adventists. I grew up SDA and personally found that it changed my life.\n\nGrowing up I had no idea of anything I just believed what I was told. Later on when I was a teenager I started asking questions about Life, God, the Bible, etc. I finally came to my own conclusions about it all and left the SDA's and all other religions. \n\nI personally have found the SDA to be a bit on the strange side. I mean the "branch davidians" branched from SDA and we'll all saw what happened at Waco. Not that all SDA people are wierd, because my family is pretty normal, but I find the teachings to be odd and I wonder why people just follow blindly.\n\nAnyway, whatever you're looking for I'm sure you'll find it and if its right for you, then good.

question_title: Why do Christians keep pushing the lie that the book of job speaks about dinosaurs? [SEP] question_content: Supposedly comes from Job 40:15 - 24. Aside from the obvious fact that man and dinosaurs never existed at the same time, they claim that the phrase "His tail sways like a cedar" means that only dinosaurs had tails like that. However, the problem is that anyone that has at least the most basic understanding of English will notice that "sways like a cedar" means the movement is like the movement a cedar has, not that the tail physically resembles a cedar. Either way, what dinosaur has ever had a tail that looks like this: http://universe-review.ca/I10-22a-cedar.jpg\n\nSo why do you keep pushing this ignorant lie?\n\n(PS. I know someone will say about dinosaur blood found in montana; that is false. They found tissue, but they didn't find ANY red blood cells. And even if they did, that doesn't porve they existed at the same time as humans.) [SEP] best_answer: The correct answer, of course, is that ignorant lies are necessary to the defense of the religion. \n\nWhy would you expect honesty of someone whose goal is to defend a religious belief system?

Also if you do believe in evolution then show me some form of bacteria (or whatever) that will turn into a fish, grow legs and arms,turn into a furry monkey, make fire, straighten out its spine to walk upright, and talk to me.

Because those of us who do KNOW(believe in) GOD would never, well you know evolutionist. Some of you are just dumb and want to say something for the hell of it. If you can believe in evolution why not aliens? Bacteria can be found all over the earth, why not distant planets? If life formed for us in that way then there must be aliens?! If you can't believe that then there is no such thing as evolution!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP] best_answer: the problem is that history can not be proven. science deals with the now. right now we have fossils and bones. what does this mean? that somthing lived and died not that they evolved over millions of years. if the biologists knew anything about astronomy they would realize that the earth is slowing down (hence the leap second) and if somthing is slowing down that means it used to be going faster. and if you do the math on this billions of years ago the earth was going so fast that day and night were one and nothing could stand on its surface.\n\nlets think for ourselves and not let the government or our textbooks tell us what to beleive \ngalleleo along with almost every other inventor would have never made there discoverys had it not been for there mistrust of textbooks.

question_title: When theists say things like how could a watch create its self can they prove it couldn't have? [SEP] question_content: When theists say that how could (name of something manmade) create its self I wonder just how many of them could prove it couldn't have happened on its own without saying because they know it is man made. [SEP] best_answer: Just something to think about: the watchmaker analogy is old, but it does not make sense. A higher power made the watch. It is orderly and perfect in order to work properly. On the same note, if a higher power made the world/nature wouldn't it be orderly and perfect as well? Nature is chaotic and unpredictable. \n\nA watch is proven to be made by man, a physical being that can be touched and felt. Nature has no physical touchable creator that can be proven to be real. There are plenty of logical theories that can be used to explain why nature is how it is. But many people overlook this because they want to believe something more. \n\nThe watchmaker analogy does not hold up logically. I hope that helps?	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: simply put, it is true that we should have freedom but most people that are advocates of 'freedom' in all its forms forget that having freedom is not one-sided.  freedom's twin is 'responsibility'.  one's freedom ends when it starts to encroach on another's.  freedom should be viewed in the correct perspective.  rules and regulations and norms are in place to enforce some sort of order.  but better than rules and regulations are PRINCIPLES.  when we know, have and practice the correct set of principles (which can be summarized into two: love God with all our heart, soul, mind, strength; and love our neighbor as ourselves) then we are able to live responsibly and know the limitations of our freedom.

question_title: supposedly in the bible it says races should not mix if so exactly where and what scripture and verse? [SEP] question_content: if anyone knows please answer [SEP] best_answer: Does the Bible state certain people should not exist?\n\nSatan is brilliant when it comes to orchestrating deception. He has managed to persuade people to make problems when there need be none. No more effectively has He did this than with "race." Satan has deceived people into making "race" a problem by simply defining it as one. The premise usually goes something like this: "God never intended the mixing of the races." The inference is that there are four distinct races and that being in any group other than one of those distinct four "races" constitutes a genetic and aesthetic disadvantage. A person (influenced by Satan) makes the statement, convinces himself that it represents God's point of view and then connects "imagined" negative consequence to what he despairingly terms "race mixing." Since God is supposedly behind the argument, if you or I disagree with the premise, we are disagreeing with God! Who would dare disagree with God? Of course the Bible points out that many will come in Christ's name saying Christ is the Christ and deceive many (Matt. 24:4-5). And, they will kill you and think they do God a service. So, we had better ask ourselves if these ideas really represent God? \n\nThe holder of the argument goes about gathering "data" to support his premise. He usually finds what He is looking for. If evidence doesn't exist he can always "define" it into existence. "Look at the 'race' riots. Look at the 'racial' problems that exist all around the world. Blacks kill whites and whites kill blacks. Therefore, there is a race problem." The average non-thinking person usually swallows this argument. However, if it was pointed out that "blacks" kill "blacks" and "whites" kill "whites" that might infer that "race" was not the causative factor. Killing and hatred are not confined to "racial types." Japanese kill Japanese as do Germans kill Germans. Hatred it seems is not the exclusive domain of "race." Cain killed Abel. What did that have to do with "race?"	Society & Culture

question_title: Does anyone know who translated the Jehovah Witness bible The New World translation of the Holy Scriptures? [SEP] question_content: I have asked Jehovah Witnesses over the years that question and it seems that they themselves don't know. They usually respond that they don't want to give glory to man by revealing that. I want to know who to hold accountable for their outright deceptive translations of John 1: and Heb 1: where the wording has been changed to make Jesus out to not be God as in the original language of the New Testament. [SEP] best_answer: During a court trial in Glasgow, Scotland in 1954, Franz was asked by the Government lawyer just who the translators were. Franz replied under oath: "That is an absolute secret. It will never be revealed now or even after death." Only someone with something to hide would be so intent on secrecy. He was asked: "What happens if somebody submits a translation. Does the committee examine it? Mr. Franz: No. I give it my 0.K., then the President, Mr. N. H. Knorr, has the last word." He was further asked to explain how "translations and interpretations of the Bible were made." Franz replied that they emanated from God: "passed to the Holy Spirit who, invisible, communicates with Jehovah's Witnesses - and the publicity department." (Franz is the head of the Publicity Department).\n\nI found this::  evidently a comittee\nC. The NWT translators were: Nathan Knorr, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas, Fred Franz, M. Henschel\n\n    * "Fred Franz however, was the only one with sufficient knowledge of the Bible languages to attempt translation of this kind. He had studied Greek for two years in the University of Cincinnati but was only self-taught in Hebrew." ["Crisis of Conscience"; by Raymond Franz; Commentary Press, Atlanta; 1983 edition; footnote 15; page 50.]\n    * Four out of the five men on the committee had no Hebrew or Greek training at all. They had only a high school education. Franz studied Greek for two years at the University of Cincinnati, but dropped out after his sophomore year. When asked in a Scotland courtroom if he could translate Genesis 2:4 into Hebrew, Franz replied that he could not. The truth is that Franz was unable to translate Hebrew or Greek.\n    * What we are left with is a very inexperienced translating committee that twisted Scripture to make it fit the Society's doctrine.\nhttp://www.bible.ca/Jw-NWT.htm	Society & Culture

Please state your race and country first then state whether you would etc and are there any races you wouldn't like to date for any reasons? Just for interest really.

If we can love, accept and respect each other, and get along most of the time, then I would date anyone from any race, there's none that I would exclude totally, as everyone even within small regions is different!

[SEP] question_content: If I am wrong and god does exist (which is unlikely) I can look him in the eyes and say I have tried to examine and understand the universe the best I could and I couldn't see you in it." But now what if I'm right there is no supreme being for us to be afraid of offending no one can be accused of playing god because he doesn't exist so science is free to advance without hindrance and that will expanded our knowledge of the universe and save billions of lives as we develop new effective cures for diseases and improve billions of others as new technology is developed .  Also there wouldn't be as much discrimination or war as religion is the main cause of that.  Oh what a wonderful world it would be.  So there you go that is what happens if I am wrong and what happens if I'm right and personally I think it's worth the gamble (not much of a gamble as there is no evidence to suggest god does exist so that would mean I am right just the sooner you theists admit it the better for everyone). [SEP] best_answer: Dude I totally agree with you plus how do we know the bible is true like seriously there is no proof to what they say in the bible it could all be a lie	Society & Culture
question_title: Define "True Friend"? [SEP] question_content: There is so many people that we can call "friends" around us. But it's just so little one that can be called "true friends". Can you define what's true friend, and what's the best way to get a true friend? [SEP] best_answer: True friends are those who never let you down and are there for you (even by email) when you need them, and if they can't they look for a way to make it up to you.. They make you smile, make you cry, and make you angry when they tell you the awful truth that you don't want to hear... They save you when you need it (and when they can) and they support you, even if they sometimes don't understand you... THey let you go and crash when you're stubborn about sdomething that's not right, but they're always there to pick you up and heal you after that crash... True friends are the most important people after your family (and in some cases after your couple)... \n\nThe best way to get one is by doing all the things above with someone that is just your plain friend.. and he/she'll do the same for you eventually... ;)	Society & Culture

question_title: Does this look like an indication of the some (not all) of the answers floating around here??? [SEP] question_content: The Dangers of the Last Days 2 Timothy Chp 3\nYou should also know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. 2 For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. 3 They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control; they will be cruel and have no interest in what is good. 4 They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. 5 They will act as if they are religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. You must stay away from people like that. [SEP] best_answer: Yeah you bet ... but it is not really a suprise because we live in a fallen world. All of us "fall short" and its just that those that don't "love Him" have a different heart, you will recognise a tree by its fruit - out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks - a good tree does not bear bad fruit and in the same way a bad tree will not bear good fruit. You have a Bible, you know the verses. I guess that some of the folks that "know Him" don't come on here due to some of the content on here such as that you have referred to. Hope this answers your question.	Society & Culture
question_title: What to ppl think of SOUTHERN ACCENTS? [SEP] question_content: espicially louisiana. [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the kind of southern accent you're talking about. I like the way some accents sound, but some people sound really stupid when they talk. The softer sophisticated southern belle accent is the one I like the best. The rest I cant take.

Trying to scare everybody away? [SEP] best_answer: I would agree, very often the one acting the 'toughest' is the one most unsure of himself (or herself, it applies to women too).	Society & Culture
question_title: Do you think Jesus loves mentally "slow" People? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: JESUS loves all kinds of people, especially the mentally slow people and the sinners. It's the reason why he has to die on the cross because he loves them so much, he wants them to be saved and go to heaven. God bless.	Society & Culture
question_title: How should I get my freedom on prom night? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Let her talk to the parents. If you have nothing to hide, then that should not be a problem. But also explain to her how important this is to you. My mother refused to allow me to go to a party after graduation. I am nearly 50 years old now and I still harbor resentment for that. Be honest with her and with yourself. But also respect her. She has her reasons for wanting to protect you. You will only understand when you become a parent yourself, as I am now.	Society & Culture

question_title: Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Not I! :D\n\nLOL My family raises wolves and I would rather have them by my side in the dark than anything else. Have you ever seen pissed wolves bare their teeth in the moonlight? LOL I don't think very many monsters, bad people, or clowns would mess with me then! It would be like having 6, 190lb. bodyguards with a jaw crush strength of 2,700 lbs. (which is quite a bit higher than the human skull can withstand btw) that can run up to 47 m.p.h.'s, and are willing to die for me. :D	Society & Culture

question_title: Purpose??? [SEP] question_content: Unless I'm wrong, christians and other such religions believe that life is a test to see whether you go to heaven or hell.\n\nWell, even if it were true, what would be the point?\n\nYou can live on Earth or in heaven, what's it matter?\n\nAlso, don't the supposed gods already know everything?  They know exactly how they made you, and since they are perfcet, they know that you can't turn out in any other way then they meant for you to turn out, sort of eliminating the idea of free will.  So how is it a test if they already know whether or not you will go to heaven or hell.  Also, since god knows how he made you, and if you go to hell, isn't it HIS fault? He knows exactly how he made you, and he knows that you'll go to hell, so why did he do it in the first place?\n\nWhat's the point of this life if we just go to heaven or hell?  This ife isn't a test to see if we're worthy or not becaue they already know if we're worthy...\n\nNone of it adds up... [SEP] best_answer: no you r absolutely right, just live a good life, be nice to others and hopefully others will be good to you, and if not screw them	Society & Culture
question_title: How important is it for you to see the pictures of people you chat with online? [SEP] question_content: i really have no desire to see people i chat with online-give me your thoughts. [SEP] best_answer: I don't really want to them, because people ask you what you think ot their pic and I never really know what to say! I don't really need to know what people look like to be able to chat to them, but other people always ask for pics so I guess they do! I mean what they look like doesn't make what they are saying any different!	Society & Culture

question_title: are you a psychic or have you had premonitions? [SEP] question_content: I do believe in paranormal stuff but I'm a little sceptical about the whole psychic thing!  But this is what happened and my mom thinks it is premonitions, I think it is coincidence!  I had a dream about a fire and my dad came home that day and said that one of the old antique million dollar homes in town had burn down.  Then I had a dream about the space shuttle exploding (I thought is was about the challenger)  so I was asking my mom a lot of questions about it and then we watched Columbia and we were like whoa!!  I still say coincidence.  Well my boss hasn't been feeling well and he is really stressed out and the night before last I had a dream that he had a heart attack!  And when I came in yesterday a co-worker said that he had suffered from a mild heart attack!  Is this a gift or coincidence?  And if it is a gift how can I get a handle on it!  Or am I just a loony?  If you have these abilities could you please help me with a little more info about what I am experiencing!  Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: There are NO coincidences.  There are also quite a few folks out and around that have prophetic dreams.  It is a natural talent, just like music in some, that comes from more development/use of your right brain lobe.  \n\nHow to handle it? That's a bit more difficult.  You can't compare your talents to others.  Just compare them to past occurances you'd had and weigh them from there. I wouldn't advise you to tell others what you suspect is coming but you learn by experience at it occurs more.	Society & Culture
question_title: What age of your life did you decide what you believe about religion? [SEP] question_content: Are you firm in your beliefs? Do you still have nagging questions?\nI believe I am a Christian, however I do not take the Bible as literal fact, especially the Old Testament [SEP] best_answer: It actually occured over time.  I was raised a Methodist, but by the time i was in Sixth Grade (now 27 years ago), I began to see there was more out there, at least from the scientific side.  I began to be pretty heavy into science in high school, then began to study religions in the last two years I was in high school.  I had an English teacher than encouraged me to continue to study about them (as a comparative-type study, not a theological path).  \n\nWhen I went to college, I took a major in religion.  I mainly wanted to study world religions, but wound up taking a lot of classes in the Bible.  By the time I had left college, I had read quite a few of the sacred texts of the world's religions (including most of the Bible).  I had even read some of the apocryphal Bible (Old and New Testaments).  I began to believe in Deism during college, but didn't really have a name for it.  \n\nI am a firm believer in Deism today and I really can say I have no nagging questions.  It is a very logical, reasoned religion without a sacred text.  For me, it works.	Society & Culture
question_title: Does Gospel of Judas proves the Islamic version of the end days of Jesus? [SEP] question_content: According to Islam,Eesa(Jesus)was not crucified. Instead the one who revealed him was crucified.\n The Gospel of Judas narrates that Jesus said to Judas that 'you will sacrifice the man that clothes me'.Is Judas the mistaken identity of Jesus for all these years people beleived him to be Jesus. [SEP] best_answer: If the Gospel of Judas was a proper Gospel then it would still not corrabote - as Jesus WAS crucified - but the difference was that Judas is made out to be the hero - as it frees Jesus' spirit from his body - which apparently was the mission.\n\nHowever, this just is not consistent with the fact that Jesus healed people - if the purpose is to free spirits from the flesh then while heal the flesh (and He still does today - see my question on miracles).\n\nBut given that it was written by the Gnostics 200 years later then no.  But it does provide an interesting insight into the Gnostics beliefs.	Society & Culture
question_title: What if you discover that all of your church offerings went to the pastor's prostitutes? [SEP] question_content: You actually thought your money(10% of your income) was going to god.  Would you feel soooo stupid?  What if that's just the beginning.  What if you discovered that God doesn't even exist after you have prayed twice a day for 50 years.  That's a lot of waisted time. [SEP] best_answer: I am speachless..if there are such pastors they must be punished severely first here,then they will have ample time in confessing their sins in the Purgatory and their souls will be in Hell..	Society & Culture
question_title: Where do old sayings like "a stitch in time saves nine" come from? Why do we remember them? What do they mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: When ALL sewing was done by hand, it was quite a chore to make an article of clothing. IF a stitch popped, a quick repair saved one heck of a lot of time, because, as you well know, if you mend something that just starts to break, it is easy. To fix the whole thing is really difficult. \n"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" is obvious. The world is full of wisdom in these sayings.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Should the target Britney concerning being a good mother and her relationship with Kevin Federline....or shuld they leave the poor girl alone, she going through enough as it is, especially with another baby on the way?........ [SEP] best_answer: the only reason shes getting all this grief is because the media want someone to moan at, and they take the tiniest thing and turn it into something major, im sure shes a brilliant mum, she only wants best for her child, i wish people would stop giving her a hard time, especially, with that husband of hers, i may b wrong but it just seems like she does everything and he just does nothing but think of hisself and his supposed "rap" carrer. i think he needs to get off his backside and help britney	Entertainment & Music
question_title: Which one do you like more, Your mom or dad? [SEP] question_content: Please try not to say "both equally"\n26/18-17 [SEP] best_answer: I'll be honest. The love is there for my dad, but he just was never there for me emotionally. Sure, money and house and food and all of that stuff, but he was never there when I made that A or when I was valedictorian in 6th grade... But then again, that makes me think of myself because I was the one who pushed him away.\nWell, anyway, I love my mom to pieces even though I've never told her that. She's a woman, so she understands a few of my views-- but not all. She's more empathetic, understanding, funnier, more accepting of love, and definitely nicer. \nShe sometimes wonders if I hate my dad, but I don't hate anybody so... But it is pretty damn  hard to love somebody who doesn't want to be loved.	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] best_answer: Try either "Return to Paradise" "Dark City" or "Mean Creek".  They are all fabulous movie that had little box office success but recieved critical acclaim.  Mean Creek is the only one that is Indie.  Return to Paradise does have stars in it, but kind of flopped.  it is a GREAT movie though.  Dark City is probably one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever.  Better than the Matrix and it came out before it and unfortunatly tanked.  Roger Ebert loves it enough to do a commentary track for the DVD by himself for the entire movie, and has given lectures just on this movie.  \n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0124595/     --- Return to Paradise\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0118929/     --- Dark City\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0377091/     --- Mean Creek\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051106/REVIEWS08/511060302/1023    --- Roger Ebert's Dark City review for his "Great Movie" collection.

question_title: What is the very best joke you know? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is long, but soooo funny:\n\nA little rabbit is hopping through the forest when he comes upon a bear rolling a joint.  He says to the bear, 'why are you doing that, Mr. Bear, please think about your health and put down that joint and come running through the forest with me, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  So the bear thinks about and agrees, off they go running through the forest together.  As they are enjoying their run through the forest they come up to a giraffe about to snort a line of c*ke.  The rabbit is horrified and says to the giraffe 'why are you doing that, Mr. Giraffe, please think about your health and put down that mirror and straw and come running through the forest with us, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  Very hesitant the giraffe gives in and puts down his items and joins the rabbit and bear on their escapade through the forest.  The three of them are now having a blast running freely when they see a lion about to shoot up.  The rabbit quickly runs to him and says 'why are you doing that, Mr. Lion, please think about your health and put down that needle and come running through the forest with us, you'll see how good it will make you feel'.  The lion is irritated that he was interrupted, but he puts down his needle, walks over to the rabbit, grabs him by the ears and begins to beat him senseless.  The bear and giraffe are standing there in horror, they scream and plead with the lion to stop asking him 'why are you doing this to him, he is merely trying to help you!?'.  The lion looks at them and says 'bullsh!t, he's not trying to help, everytime he's on ecstasy he makes me run through the forest with him for hours looking like an idiot'.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Why doesn't starch give a positive glucose test? [SEP] question_content: I know so far that starch has an adehyde group but it is too small in comparison to the rest of its own molecule. The experiment used benedict's solution to determine wheter there was a reaction of glucose or not. Starch did not give a positive glucose test. Why? [SEP] best_answer: A starch molecule is made up of 100's of glucose monomers. And each glucose monomer in a starch is linked with another glucose monomer by alpha -1,4 linkage due to which a starch molecule does not have a free aldehyde group which is opresent in a free glucose molecule. At its end it may have a free aldehyde group, but is too small in amount to show the reaction in comparision to a huge glucose monomer. As Benedict's Test is a test to determine presence or absence of a aldehydic group; a starch molecule can not show a positive glucose test. But if a starch molecuse is hydrolysed with help of an acid or amylase enzyme it will certainly show hte positive glucose test.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What is the best peripheral IV site for giving IV contrast dye for chest angiograms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Generally IV's are started at the most peripheral site that is available and appropriate for the situation. This allows cannulation of a more proximal site if your initial attempt fails. If you puncture a proximal vein first, and then try to start an IV distal to that site, the fluid may leak from the injured proximal vessel. The preferred site in the emergency department is the veins of the forearm, followed by the median cubital vein that crosses the antecubital fossa. In trauma patients, it is common to go directly to the median cubital vein as the first choice because it will accommodate a large bore IV and it is generally easy to catheterize. In circumstances where the veins of the upper extremities are inaccessible, the veins of the dorsum of the foot or the saphenous vein of the lower leg can be used. In circumstances in which no peripheral IV access is possible a central IV can be started.\n\n*** NO NO NO no central line for just IV contrast.  You've got to be kidding me!!!	Science & Mathematics
question_title: How to tighten a screw? [SEP] question_content: When assembling a product I was always taught to tighten one screw at a time unless you are aligning two pieces with multiple screws.  Does anyone knowof any technical papers out there for the best practices? [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what you are putting together.. For some things, it's not important if you screw in all sides evenly.  However for other things that require proper alignment for functionality and ease of construction putting the screws in equally is important.  For example, when you put on a tire for a car, you should put the nuts on evenly (opposite nuts in) so that the wheel remains balancedwhen you drive.  But if you are simply puttng one board to another that does not require balance for the object to function (like wallboard) then it really doesn't matter.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what does metabolite mean? [SEP] question_content: it seems that there's "metabolite 1" and "metabolite 2" . what's the difference? [SEP] best_answer: A metabolite is any molecule that is produced in a metabolic pathway carried out in living cells, starting with a particular substrate and driven by some number of enzymes essential to completion of the pathway.  For example, the complete metabolism of the glucose molecule is driven by a large number of critical enzymes and coenzymes that produce a number of metabolites in the pathway leading to the end products, water, carbon dioxide, and ATP (the cell's chemical "money").\n\nWhen you speak of metabolite 1 and metabolite 2 you are probably referring to primary and secondary metabolites.  Primary metabolites are molecules that are essential to the normal growth, development, and reproduction of the organism.  Secondary metabolites may also have important functions, but are not necessarily essential.  Examples of secondary metabolites are pigment molecules in plants and animals and the substances produced by various fungi that act as antibiotics.\n\nAll of the biochemical reactions that take place in living cells make up the cell's metabolism.  In some pathways, described as catabolic, large molecules are subdivided into smaller ones, usually with the release of energy stored in the large molecule (e.g. glucose).  In other pathways, called anabolic, smaller molecules are combined to form larger ones (e.g. the formation of functional proteins from a directed sequence of their constituent amino acids.\n\nAll chemicals that enter the human body as drugs or environmental contaminants are by definition not strictly necessary for the normal function of the body.  Such chemicals may have direct effects on the body's normal physiology without any metabolic conversion.  The most familiar example of such a chemical might be ethanol, the effects of which are known to anyone who's ever taken a drink.  Other drugs and chemicals may also have direct active effects.  On the other hand, many drugs and chemicals must be converted into an active form before they can have a  physiological effect.  For example, the carcinogen vinyl chloride must be converted into chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde, which have the capacity to bind to and alter nuclear DNA, for the carcinogenic effect to occur.\n\nConversion of "foreign" parent molecules into active or inactive metabolites takes place in primarily in the liver.  Liver cells contain a vast array of enzyme systems which have apparently evolved with our species to protect us from the harmful effects of potentially toxic chemicals in our food and in the general environment.  The primary effect of these enzyme systems, such as the cytochrome P450 system, is to convert potentially toxic chemicals into relatively harmless metabolites, which are then frequently conjugated with another molecule, such as glucuronic acid, making it easier for the body to excrete the metabolites via the urine.  Again, sometimes the metabolites produced by one of these enzyme systems may be more toxic than the parent molecule; or the parent molecule given as a medication does not become active until it has been processed by a liver enzyme system.  Ethanol is another example here; one of its metabolites, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than the parent alcohol molecule.  Usually acetaldehyde is rapidly converted to carbon dioxide in water; many East Asian people are deficient in the enzymes needed to process acetaldehyde, and so have a much more limited tolerance for alcohol than non-Asians.\n\nOne final note:  it is usually the products of metabolism of  many drugs that may be detected in a person's urine.  This is true for most illicit drugs and also for tobacco.  Each drug produces a characteristic metabolite or metabolites that are present in the urine for some period of time after ingestion of the drug.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: I have heard that all living organisms from polar bears to penguins contain DDT in their bodies. How come? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a number of things to consider:\n1) Persistence - the time chemical substance remain in the ecosystem before degrading.  Elements are persistent in the extreme, most do not change during the lifetime of the solar system.  They only change by nuclear processes (fission or fusion).  Some organic substances, such as DDT, persist for decades or centuries simply because there are no efficient mechanisms for their degradation. \n\n2) Bioaccumulation - does the substance accumulate in the the tissues of organisms exposed in the environment due to \na) biocenentration - the tendency of a substance to be found at higher concentration in the organism that in the environment (i.e. higher in fish tissue than in the water they swim in) and \nb) biomagnification - the tendency of a substance to be found at higher concentration in organisms higher up the food chain (higher trophic levels).  There are some substances that bioconcentrate in fish, but do not biomagnify because the things that eat the fish can efficiently metabolize the substance.  \n\n\nand 3) Transportation/exposure - the tendency of substance move from the location it is released in the ecosystem.  More volatile substances are more easily transported around the globe (hence the many problems associated with mercury).  Give a long enough lifetime, most things will be cycled throughout the global ecosphere (to the poles, oceans, all land masses, etc.). \n\nThere are a handful of POPs (persistent organic pollutants-- of which DDT is one of the most infamous, see http://www.pops.int) which persist in the environment for decades or centuries.  The key to minimizing the risk from these substances is to stop their release into the environment so that even the very slow degradation can eliminate them from the ecosystem.\n\nTo sum up, DDT (and other POPs) is very persistent, it bioaccumulates up the food chain (so high-level predators like eagles and polar bears have higher concentrations in their tissues) and is fairly easily transported.

question_title: is the world a colder place today then in the 1930's? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, temperatures are going up due to Global Warming.\n\nCO2 is 30% higher than it has been for 650,000 years. Methane is 130% greater. These are two of the main pollutants humans put into the atmosphere in excess, and they are two of the primary greenhouse gases.\n\nLook at the 'hockeystick', which shows a dramatic warming since 1950 after a fairly stable climate for 1000 years. In fact, the 10 hottest years in recorded history have all happened since 1990, with 2005 being the hottest, and 2006 is shaping up to maybe break that record.\n(see links below)\n\nHow's that for proof of man's fault in this? There is ample proof, any real scientist will tell you that.\n\nThere has NEVER been an article doubting man's influence on global warming published in a peer-reviewed journal. A recent study of almost 1000 proved that.\n\nYes, the earth naturally heats and cools, but the rate and amount we are warming now is unprecedented in the recent geologic past. We are doing this, and we must stop it. This is not some political statement or rhetoric. This is science trying to educate a crass, ignorant public of the damage they are doing. The magnitude of temperature increase ALREADY is about 10x that of the 'little ice age' of the middle ages, and rate and amount are only going up. \n\nJust to be clear, glacial and interglacial cycles are mainly controlled by astronomical fluctuations, but we have a detailed record of the last 7 cycles, and what the climate and CO2 is doing now is way different and extreme. The rate of increase is much higher than in the past AND the value itself is much higher.\n\nHI CO2: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4467420.stm\nHOCKEY STICK: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5109188.stm\nGeneral climate stuff: \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3897061.stm	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the difference between a CARDIAC ARREST & a HEART ATTACK? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They are not the same.\n\nCardiac arrest is when a heart stops beating / contracting. That is when you give a CPR and either shock the heart or give appropriate drugs to treat it.\n\nHeart attack is when the heart muscles die as a result of not getting enough blood supply. Here you give drugs directed to improve the blood supply of the heart. In most cases the heart keeps beating after the heart attack. But rarely, if many of the muscle fibers are dead, the person's heart stops beating too. In those cases, cardiac arrest happens as a result of heart attack.\n\nHope its clear to you now.

question_title: How many integers between 1 an 1000000 have the sum of their digits equal to 18? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I can show that the answer is 25927 without using computer.\n\n\nFirst, we can ignore 1000000 since its sum of digits is not 18. Also, let's add 0's in front of numbers to have 6 digits if the number has less than 6 digits. So our range is going to be from 000001 to 999999.\n\nNumber of partition of 18 into 6 whole number is\n(18+6-1)C(6-1)=(23)C(5). Assign these 6 numbers to the 6 digits.\n\nNow, we need to remove the cases where one digit is 10 or bigger. It is very good thing that two digits cannot be 10 or bigger, as the sum would go over 18.\n\nLet one digit has x, where x>=10. The sum of the other 5 digits is 18-x. Since 18-x is partitioned into 5 whole numbers, we have (18-x+4)C(4) possible ways. This should be multiplied by 6 since the big digit can be the first digit, second digit, ..., sixth digit. x is from 10 to 18. So we need to calculate 6((12)C(4) + (11)C(4) + .... + (4)C(4)).\n\nSince (n)C(m)+(n)C(m+1)=(n+1)C(m+1), we get\n(4)C(4) + (5)C(4) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((5)C(5) + (5)C(4)) + (6)C(4) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n=((6)C(5) + (6)C(4)) + (7)C(4) + .... + (12)C(4)\n...\n=(13)C(5). (This shows beauty of mathematics, doesn't it?)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (23)C(5)-6*(13)C(5)=25927.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the symbiotic relationship between beetle larvae(mealworms) and protozoa in their digestive tract? [SEP] question_content: This is for a Bio experiment, please help. [SEP] best_answer: It depends on the specific protozoa; if for example both the mealworm and the protozoa benefit from the relationship (the protozoa has a nice place to live and feed and the mealworm benefits from the protozoa breaking down other organic matter in the mealworms digestive system) it would be a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.  If, however, the protozoa is using the mealworm as a host carrier in its life cycle as a staging area to propagate itself, lay eggs, or feed on until it is deposited somewhere and it negatively affects the health of the mealworm, it is a parasitic relationship (the protozoa being the parasite).

question_title: why are there 60 seconds in a minute and not a number llike 10 or 100? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You can blame the ancient Babylonians who had a base-60 (sexagesimal) system for counting.\n\nThey liked 60 because it is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6... and it can also be divided by ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty. \n1/2 hr = 30 minutes\n1/3 hour = 20 minutes\n1/4 hour = 15 minutes\n1/5 hour = 12 minutes\n1/6 hour = 10 minutes\n\nIn addition to using base sixty, the Babylonians also made use of six and ten as sub-bases. \n\nTo this day, we bear the legacies of almost every number system our ancestors experimented with. From the duo-decimal systems we have twenty-four hours in a day, twelve inches in a foot, and special words such as dozen (meaning 12) and gross (meaning 12 x 12 = 144). \n\nFrom the Babylonians‚Äô sexagesimal system we have sixty seconds in a minute, sixty minutes in an hour, and 360 degrees in a circle, where 360 degrees is derived from the product of the Babylonian's main base (sixty) and their sub-base (six); that is, 60 x 6 = 360.\n\nThe French at one time tried to mandate a base-10 time system, (10 hours in a day, 100 minutes per hour), but it never caught on.  So like much of the weirdness of our 3 ft / yd, 1760 yd. / mile, 8 oz / cup, etc. we have to live with numbers that aren't all based on 10.  I wish it were so, but it isn't.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: will anyone give me the historic sequence how and what make the avogadro to derive the hypothesis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The name "Avogadro's Number" is just an honorary name attached to the calculated value of the number of atoms, molecules, etc. in a gram mole of any chemical substance. Of course if we used some other mass unit for the mole such as "pound mole", the "number" would be different than 6.022 x 1023. \n\nThe first person to have calculated the number of molecules in any mass of substance was Josef Loschmidt, (1821-1895), an Austrian high school teacher, who in 1865, using the new Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT) calculated the number of molecules in one cubic centimeter of gaseous substance under ordinary conditions of temperature of pressure, to be somewhere around 2.6 x 1019 molecules. This is usually known as  "Loschmidt's Constant."  (This value, no, is now listed at the NIST web site as 2.686 7775 x 1025 m-3)\n\nWhen was the first time the term "Avogadro Number" was used?  The designation seems to originate in a 1909 paper entitled "Brownian Movement and Molecular Reality."  by Jean Baptiste Jean Perrin (b. Lille, France, 30.9.1870-d. New York, 17.4.1942.)  This paper was translated into English from the French in Annals De Chimie et de Physique by Fredric Soddy and is available.  Perrin, was the 1926 Nobel Laureate in Physics for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium.  Perrin should be very well known to anyone who does calculations in molecular dynamics.  Most of these methods were developed by Perrin.   In his paper Perrin says "The invariable number N is a universal constant, which may be appropriately designated "Avogadro's Constant." \n\nIn the presentation of his Nobel prize in 1926 it was said of the work of Perrin:  \n\nIt may perhaps be said that in the work which we have just summarized Perrin has offered indirect evidence for the existence of molecules. Here, follows a direct evidence. Microscopic particles in a liquid are never at rest. They are in perpetual movement, even under conditions of perfect external equilibrium, constant temperature, etc. The only irrefutable explanation for this phenomenon ascribes the movements of the particles to shocks produced on them by the molecules of the liquid themselves. A mathematical theory of this phenomenon has been given by Einstein. The first experimental proof of this theory was given by a German physicist, Seddig. After him, the problem was taken up by two scientists simultaneously. One of them was Perrin; the other Svedberg. I have to speak of Perrin only. His measurements on the Brownian movement showed that Einstein's theory was in perfect agreement with reality. Through these measurements a new determination of Avogadro's number was obtained. \n\nThe molecular impacts produce not only a forward movement of the particles distributed in a liquid, but also a rotational movement. The theory of this rotation was developed by Einstein. Measurements in relation herewith were carried out by Perrin. In these measurements he has found another method for determining Avogadro's number. What then is the result of these researches ? How many molecules are there in two grams of hydrogen? The three methods have given the following answers to this question: 68.2 x 1022; 68.8 x 1022; 65 x 1022.\n\nThe work of Einstein and Perrin gave some of the first concrete evidence for the existence of molecules, entities many still did not recognize even into the early 1900's.   And Avogadro's Number has a value that must be measured experimentally.    Subsequent to the work of Loschmidt and Perrin many scientists carried out many experiments using a variety of techniques to arrive at the most accurate value for this the number of molecules in one mole of substance.  And by 1933 there was still no universal agreement as to what the number should be called.  In a paper entitled "Loschmidt's Number", publi	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can "any humanbeing"can touch the stars...? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Stars are massive, glowing balls of hot gases, mostly hydrogen and helium. Some stars are extremely hot, while others are cooler. You can tell by the color of light that the stars give off. If you look at the coals in a charcoal grill, you know that the red glowing coals are cooler than the white hot ones. The same is true for stars. A blue or white star is hotter than a yellow star, which is hotter than a red star. Temperature of stars range in the high hundreds to thousands degrees F. So to touch the stars that are in the sky is almost impossible, as your body would burn due to high temperatures surrounding them.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Are people made from Stardust? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely.\n\nIt is now thought (and even more radio telescope survey evidence on this has just come in) that at the very beginning of things (the Big Bang) there was nothing but energy. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles were formed from that energy, and some time later, things cooled enough for atoms to form and stay together. Since it takes force to push protons together (to form nuclei of the higher atomic number atoms), and the force wasn't available, only hydrogen (and a very small amount of helium and perhaps an even smaller amount of lithium -- the simplest atoms) resulted.\n\nLots of hydrogen, distributed in a sort of clumpy manner, will eventually collapse into stars. Large stars burn through their available fuel relatively quickly, all the while forcing together protons into more complex atoms such as carbon and oxygen and silicon, and so on. When these large stars go nova, they spray a good part of themselves into interstellar space where the material is incorporated into newly forming stars or collected into clouds around them. As those clouds collapse into planets (which must be very common as we have now seen some hundreds of them around stars in the local area in our galaxy (ie, within a few hundred light years)), the non-hydrogen material in them is actually star stuff. Probably not really dust particles in most cases, but...\n\nAnd that's how it was. Fascinating stuff.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is the importance of solar energy and why do people use and where does it come from? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is suppose to be common sense by now well unless you're 6 yr old then that's different. So I guess you need read this:\n\nsolar energy, any form of energy radiated by the sun, including light, radio waves, and X rays, although the term usually refers to the visible light of the sun. Solar energy is needed by green plants for the process of photosynthesis, which is the ultimate source of all food. The energy in fossil fuels (e.g., coal and oil) and other organic fuels (e.g., wood) is derived from solar energy. Difficulties with these fuels have led to the invention of devices that directly convert solar energy into usable forms of energy, such as electricity. Solar batteries, which operate on the principle that light falling on photosensitive substances causes a flow of electricity, play an important part in space satellites and, as they become more efficient, are finding increasing use on the earth (see solar cell). Thermoelectric generators convert the heat generated by solar energy directly into electricity (see thermoelectricity). Several projects have produced electricity on a large scale by using the solar energy available in desert areas. In one system, large numbers of solar batteries generate electricity for Coconut Island, off the coast of Australia. In another, oil flows through pipes that are set in reflecting parabolic troughs that can trap the heat from sunlight falling on them. The heat from the oil is then converted into electricity (see power, electric). Heat from the sun is used in air-drying a variety of materials and in producing salt by the evaporation of seawater. Solar heating systems can supply heat and hot water for domestic use; heat collected in special plates on the roof of a house is stored in rocks or water held in a large container. Such systems, however, usually require a conventional heater to supplement them. Solar stoves, which focus the sun's heat directly, are employed in regions where there is much perennial sunlight.\n\nAlso there are tons of info on this on the web just go to Yahoo search or Google and type in Solar Energy. It's not that hard.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is chip designing ,explain with an example? [SEP] question_content: can this designing be confined only to printed circuit boards? [SEP] best_answer: The process of circuit design can cover systems ranging from national power grids all the way down to the individual transistors within an integrated circuit. For simple circuits the design process can often be done by one person simply designing the circuit as they go along, but for more complex designs, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation are becoming increasingly common.\n\nFormal circuit design usually involves the following stages:\n\nsometimes, writing the requirement specification after liaising with the customer \nwriting a technical proposal to meet the requirements of the customer specification \nsynthesising on paper an abstract electrical or electronic circuit that will meet the specifications \ncalculating the component values to meet the operating specifications under specified conditions \nbuilding a breadboard or other prototype version of the design and testing against specification \nmaking any alterations to the circuit to achieve compliance \nchoosing a method of construction as well as all the parts and materials to be used \npresenting component and layout information to draughtspersons, and layout and mechanical engineers, for prototype production \ntesting or type-testing a number of prototypes to ensure compliance with customer reqiurements \nsigning and approving the final manufacturing drawings \npost-design services (obsolescence of components etc.) \nContents [hide]\n1 Specification \n2 Design \n2.1 Costs \n3 Verification and testing \n4 Prototyping \n5 Results \n5.1 Documentation \n6 See also \n7 References \n \n\n\n[edit]\nSpecification\nThe process of circuit design begins with the specification, which states the functionality that the finished design must provide, but does not indicate how it is to be achieved .[1] The initial specification is basically a technically detailed description of what the customer wants the finished circuit to achieve and can include a variety of electrical requirements, such as what signals the circuit will receive, what signals it must output, what power supplies are available and how much power it is permitted to consume. The specification can ( and normally does ) also set some of the physical parameters that the design must meet, such as size, weight, moisture resistance, temperature range, thermal output, vibration tolerance and acceleration tolerance.\n\nAs the design process progresses the designer(s) will frequently return to the specification and alter it to take account of the progress of the design. This can involve tightening specifications that the customer has supplied, and adding tests that the circuit must pass in order to be accepted. These additional specifications will often be used in the verification of a design. Changes that conflict with or modify the customer's original specifications will almost always have to be approved by the customer before they can be acted upon.\n\nCorrectly identifying the customer needs can avoid a condition known as 'design creep' which occurs in the absence of realistic initial expectations, and later by failing to communicate fully with the client during the design process. It can be defined in terms of its results; "at one extreme is a circuit with more functionality than necessary, and at the other is a circuit having an incorrect functionality". (DeMers, 1997) Nevertheless some changes can be expected and the wise designer keeps his options open: it's easier to remove spare gates from the circuit later on than it is to put them in.\n\n[edit]\nDesign\nThe design process involves moving from the specification at the start, to a plan that contains all the information needed to be physically constructed at the end, this normally happens by passing through a number of stages, although in very simple circuit it may be done in a single step. [2] The process normally begins with the conversion of the specification into a block diagra	Science & Mathematics

The 'Rozwell Incident' was no hoax!! and was promptly swept under the carpet by Government whitewashing techniques.The consesus of people who kept investigating Rozwell, echo words of a 'Trade Off' with the Beings who survived the crash,..There Technology for their ability to continue with whatever they were here for in the first place.It would seem ignorant,for lack of a better word,and closed minded to assume that there is NO other Life forms in the entire expanse of our known Galaxy or for that fact our Universe.Ive taken a keen interest in the existence of Intelligent Life forms after the eye witness account of one of the Space Shuttle Astronauts(and crew) while attached to a teather in open Space.There are 2 sources that might interest you, if you  wish to further investigate;~~~~~~~1) The Bob Lazar Story... \nIn 1989, Robert Lazar came forward with an incredible story : He had been recruited by the US government to work at the top secret Groom Lake/Area 51 research base better known as "Dreamland" (actually at the S4 site, Papoose Lake which is a few miles to the south of Groom Lake) to reverse engineer alien spacecraft! Here are a few things he learned. \nThe disc's reactor uses a fuel which does not occur naturally on Earth. This fuel is a super-heavy, stable, element with an atomic number of 115 and does not appear on our periodic chart. Element 115 has a twofold purpose : First, it is the source of a gravity wave that is unknown to Earth's scientists, the "Gravity A" wave. Second, it is the source of the anti-matter radiation which is reacted to provide power.\nThe Gravity A wave eminates from the nucleus of Element 115 and actually extends past the perimeter of the atom. The propulsion system of the disc amplifies and focuses this Gravity A wave to cause space/time to bend, much like space/time bends in the intense gravitational field of a black hole. The ability to direct gravity to cause space/time distortions allows the disc to cross vast expanses of space/time without travelling in a linear mode at a high rate of speed. \nInside the reactor, the Element 115 is transmuted to Element 116 which is unstable and immediately decays releasing antimatter. The antimatter is reacted with gaseous matter which causes a total annihilation reaction, the 100 percent conversion of matter to energy. The heat from this reaction is converted to electrial energy by a solid state, near 100 percent efficient thermoelectric generator. It is this energy that is used to amplify the Gravity A wave. \nThis mode of travel is one of the two methods of propulsion used by the disc. In this mode, the disc's gravity amplifiers  are in the "delta configuration" and are pulsed sequentially in a rotational pattern. This amplified Gravity A wave is so powerful that the only natural occurring source of gravity that could cause space/time to distort this much would be a black hole! \nThe other mode of travel is the "omicron configuration" and is used for short range travel near a source of gravity such as a planet or star. When a disc travels near another source of gravity, like Earth, the Gravity A wave, which propagates outward from the disc, is phase shifted into the Gravity B wave, which propagates outward from the Earth, and this creates lift. The gravity amplifiers of the disc can be focused independently and they are pulsed and do not stay on continuously.  \nAlien UFO propulsion systems according to Bob Lazar...2) this is a websi	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What are SPECTRA ropes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: SPECTRA¬Æ Double Braided\n\nOne of the most popular high performance lines, G-Force is a double braided rope consisting of 100% polyester braided cover and a 100% Allied Signal's Spectra¬Æ braided core. It was engineered for General Marine, Industrial, and Commercial Fishing applications where extra low elongation and extremely high strength-to-weight ratio of Spectra¬Æ are required. Spectra¬Æ double braided rope often replaces wire of the same diameter. Great for Merchant Marine, Industrial, Commercial Fishing, and Recreational Boating applications. \n\nThis rope offers extremely high strength and low stretch, and is one of the toughest lines around. The HMPE minor tendency to creep is minimized with advanced core design, and this rope is much more tolerant of standard size sheaves than an aramid (e.g. Kevlar¬Æ, Twaron¬Æ) rope. Because the specific gravity of Spectra¬Æ is less than 1.0, size-for-size G-Force is one of the lighter ropes around. Downsize and your weight savings is twofold. This is one tough rope, built to withstand mistrals and gale force winds! The cover is a dazzling tri-color weave, a base color combined with two separate multi-tracers running in opposite directions.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how do the cells produced by meiosis reeestablish a complete set pf chromosomes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Remember that meiosis is the formation of gametes from germ cells.  Our bodies begin the process of making germ cells very early in our development, and the precursors to sperm/egg cells are in tact well before puberty.  When a woman ovulates, at the end, four of these egg cells complete the maturity stage in each cycle, but only one survives to become an ovulated egg (accompanied by 3 polar bodies).  This egg (and its complement sperm) have ONE set of chromosomes each, and upon fertilization, the zygote will have 2 copies of every chromosome, one from the sperm, and one from the egg.

question_title: What is the difference between amps and horsepower? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the motor and VFD variable frequency drive industry, the standard speak is Amps, which is replacing HP old school.\n\nYou must realize that in an industry in which the typical 3phase power is based on 480VAC.\n\nThis means when someone is sizing a motor for a specific application they speak of the Amps need to perform the task.\n\nThe drives (VFD) which I work on are typically between 10amp up to 3000amp. Usually, 480Vac, sometimes 600Vac or 690Vac.\nA drive which is rated at 690Vac, 705amp is 600Vac, 800amp for the same drive.\n\nYou need to know both, HP and Amp for the machines which you are interested in. That means what is the typical voltage for the area. USA vs Canada vs UK vs Asia They are all different. \n\nKeep in mind Amps are Amps regardless where you are. Heavy wire sizing is crucial.

question_title: Is evolution possible? Does the scientific advancements gives enough evidence for it? [SEP] question_content: Please answer this with reference to the complexity of life and the chance of origin of life from a state of nothingness. [SEP] best_answer: First, let me get some ambiguous terms out of the way. First, there's micro-evolution. This is like breeding dogs to get the dog you want. Then, there's macro-evolution, which is breeding dogs to get a human after milllions of years. Okay.\nMicro-evolution is, obviously, possible because the genes of the dogs change to let it's grandchild be a different kind of dog. However, there's a limit to how much genes can change. After a while, the dog will be really different from his ancestors (chihuahuas and great danes) but can never turn into a non-dog. I've never seen a dog give birth to a cat-dog. It's just not possible. Think of it this way. If you take the word "Cat" and change one letter at a time, you can come up with "hat," "mat," and "pat." Can you ever come up with "orange?" No, orange doesn't have three letters.\n  The only way for evolution to be possible is if a lizard mates with a squirrel to produce a bird. And I don't think it's possible for that to happen, do you? Sure, donkeys and horses can mate to produce mules, but they're related (like dogs and wolves.)\n   If you ever see an owl-kangaroo, I'll take this back.

question_title: do four legged animals get twice as tired running or half as tired running as would a human? [SEP] question_content: based on comparable distances for animals and human distances [SEP] best_answer: It's probably a wash. The weight of the body is distributed over twice the number of legs, so each leg has to do less work. More legs, though, mean that there's more energy required to move them all. The more legs thing could be cut down depending on the gait.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Biology: Blood types and Genotypes? [SEP] question_content: a women with blood type B marries a man with blood type AB. The woman's father had blood type O. Identify the womens genotype, the mans genotype  and the possible blood types of the children. [SEP] best_answer: The women and the man would have a heterozygous geneotype\n\nThe woman's genotype would consist of a gene for B blood and for O blood.\nThe man's genotypes would consist of a gene for A blood and B blood.  \n\nSince O is a ressisve gene, A and B would dominiant the blood type for their children who could have an A, B or AB blood type.  \n\nFollowing a basic 2 x 2 Punnett square, the statistics of a child getting a homozygous B blood type would be 1/4; a AB blood type would be 1/4; for getting a heterzygous A or B blood type with a ressive O gene would be 2/4 or 1/2.

question_title: How do you solve the Math Puzzle of the Hexagonal Pattern "The disguised triangles?"? [SEP] question_content: I am looking for how to prove the correct answer. [SEP] best_answer: I'm assuming you are referring to the disguised triangles in the attached link... (link 1).  I'm sure there are some rigorous mathematical proofs you could supply, or automated ways to count the triangles, but I basically decided to just use the "brute force" method of counting.  The hard part is recognizing all the different triangles while not double counting...\n\nWhat I finally did was to create several copies of the diagram and tried to color the triangles.  You can color the individual triangles (24), right off the bat.  Now if you try to pair up triangles, you can pair them one way (12) or another using the flipped image (12).  Grouping them further in groups of three or four triangles, I counted another set of (7) and the flip for another (7).  Then I noticed four other ways to group four triangles (3), (3), (3), (3).  Lastly, there are two large triangles composed of the inner sixteen triangles (1) and (1).\n\nAltogether I got seventy (76) triangles.  You can double check my work using the attached image (link 2).  I think I got them all and didn't double count...	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: there was an error loading your sidebar. the sidebar is currently not compatible with internet explorer 7. we are working to address the issue and will update this messege when it is resolved. [SEP] best_answer: Ok, firstly, if you look at the first answer you'll see why its never a good idea to use your e-mail as your name! Plus your in box will fill up with spam and drive you nuts.\nYou don't need to un-install I.E. If you use XP, just go to add and remove programs, check custom, then pick another installed browser as your default browser. \nIf you used Add and Remove programs to 'uninstall' I.E. then just go back and tick the radio button to allow access; but it sounds like you did completely remove it. You can do a repair installation from your XP disc.\nI've never done that so I'll leave it to someone else to explain how. Or you could use TweakUI to restore it if you have that installed.\nYou need I.E. so don't remove it!	Computers & Internet
question_title: why wont my hp 1315 3 in 1 printer accept refilled ink cartridge? [SEP] question_content: why wont my hp 1315 3 in 1 printer accept refilled ink cartridge [SEP] best_answer: Your printer has a memory on it.   The printer remembers the last three cartridges that have been installed, and thus is remembering your cartridge as being empty.\n\nIf you have some empties kicking around or know somebody that does, just install and remove them in sequence with your refilled cartridge being the fourth and final.  \n\nHopefully that will clear it up.  \n\nHowever if you are getting a blinking light and a "please check cartridge" warning then unfortunately the cartridge is done.  The electronics have failed and there is nothing left to do except replace the cartridge.	Computers & Internet
question_title: i have 12.0mbps internet speed is it Fast,Slow or Average? [SEP] question_content: if i want to connect my psp this speed is good or not ? [SEP] best_answer: It depends.  The rate they sell you is not the rate you will always get.  You could have a 20mbps connection and depending on certain variables (cable or dsl, distance from provider, computer hardware, etc) you won't get that full 20mbps.  As a general rule of thumb, you never get the full amount of speed you are supposed to be able to get.  Yes, that is a fast connection and definitely fast enough to hook your psp to.

I'd like to also add that many products on the net claiming that it removes WinFixer is actually that product again. You have 2 options, you can either use System Restore or follow these steps:\n\n1. Download http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx\n\n# Reboot the infected machine\n# Launch the VirusScan On-Demand Scanner (ODS), or the command-line scanner, but don't initiate the scan yet\n# Run Process Explorer and suspend the Explorer.exe, Winlogon.exe, and rundll32.exe processes (right-click on these process names and choose suspend)\n# Scan & clean with the current DAT files and engine (the Window launched in step 3 above) [there will be clean failures, that is expected]\n# Physically power the machine off and back on.(a hard reset is required as Windows will not shutdown without Winlogon.exe running, and resuming that process will revert the changes made by the scanner).\n\nTo avoid getting infected again, add www.winfixer.com to your Firewall Block list.

If the request times out, you are not connected to the modem or router.  Try rerunning the connection wizard\nRight click My Network Places > Properties > Set up a Home or Small Office Network\n\nIf you get a reply from your ping, then you have something in yur firewall settings that is blocking the Internet.  Try turning our firewall off temporarily and set if you can connect.

question_title: What's the difference between DVD- and DVD+ when burning movies?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: DVD-R disks will generally play in older DVD players, if you have a newer player at home, it should play the DVD+R's and the -R's. The -R's are the older format used when DVD burners first came to be. +R's are more recent technology and therefore do not play on the older DVD players. If your burner is new, you may find that DVD+R's burn better in it than the -R's do.	Computers & Internet

question_title: my pinter is not pinting good? [SEP] question_content: I got an Epson stylus photo 1280 and I used it for Sublimation so I used sublimation inks with a bulk ink system. When I print a picture and it have black in it the outline of the black is yellow\n\nP.S. I have done Nozzle checks and the Nozzle check comes out good. [SEP] best_answer: your nozzle check is good.  Run a couple cleanings on it.  then check again.\n\nYou may have a priming issue with the bulk ink systems.  Epsons always need a little ink to remain inside the print head in order for them to print.   If the system is drawing back in after a print then you will have a void in the print head resulting in a lack of print.\n\nDo a few nozzle cleaning since those tend to use a little ink do your nozzle checks as well.  Trying printing immediately after wards.   Do a couple pages to see if there is improvement.  If that works then you have huge problem with the bulk ink system.  One that will eventually damage the print head beyond repair.	Computers & Internet

After a few months, the color of the case started  to fade, the LCD screen was getting more "winkles", never seen that on any monitors. It totally broken down a months ago. They charged me $99 for the shipping when I send it in for repair, and $160 for two hours of labor. I had to pay upfront, dont know whats the hurry since they will have my computer. one month after they received  the system, I was told  they need to replace my mother board because it got overheated.  I have never heard that one before, but whatever. They said they will charge me $312 for the board and it will take another week. So  I bought a Dell, tired of their lies.

question_title: i want 2 write my name at  START (left bottom on d system)? [SEP] question_content: in window syatems there is START on d left bottom side, i want 2 write my name on this [SEP] best_answer: 1. Download Resource Hacker.\n\n2. Locate explorer.exe in your C:/Windows directory. Copy this file somewhere and give it the name explorer.bak.\n\n3. Launch resource hacker and use resource hackers menus to open up explorer.exe. Once opened you will see a lot of collapsed folders.\n\n4. Expand the String Table folder and then find folder No. 37 (folder No. 38 if you're in Windows Classic mode).\n\n5. Click on resource 1033 and locate the text that says 'start.' This is your Start button, Change the 'start' text to your text of choice. You don't have a character limit, but the text takes up valuable taskbar space, so don't make it too long.\n\n6. Click on the button labeled Compile Script. This updates the settings for your Start button. But nothing will happen until you complete through step #20, so keep going!\nIf you just want to change the text and nothing else like hover text, image, etc. jump to step 16.\n\nChange your hover text\n\n7. While you're here, why not also change the text that pops up when your mouse hovers over your Start button?\n\n8. Right now it says 'Click here to begin.' Well, duh! We already know that's where to begin!\n\n9. Open folder No. 34 and click on resource 1033.\n\n10. Find the text that says 'Click here to begin' and change it to something cooler.\n\n11. Click on the Compile Script button to update this resource.\n\nCustomize your Start icon\n\n12. For an added bonus, you can also change the Windows icon to the left of the text, too.\n\n13. Collapse the String Table folder and expand the Bitmap folder at the top of your folder list.\n\n14. Click on folder No. 143 and click on resource 1033. You should see that familiar Windows icon.\n\n15. Go to the Action Menu and select 'Replace bitmap.' Select 'Open file with new bitmap', and locate the replacement image on your machine. Note: The image must have a .bmp extension and a size of 25 pixels by 20 pixels. Then click the Replace button.\n\nMake your new Start button active\n\n16. Now that you've made your changes, save the file in your Windows folder with another name, such as explorer1.exe. Don't name it Explorer.exe, because that file is already being used by your system.\n\n17. Now that we have created a new Explorer1.exe file we need to get Windows to use it. That‚Äôs where the Registry editor comes in. Click on your "start" button and then click "RUN". Now type "regedit" and click the "OK" button to open the registry editor.\n\n18. In the registry editor go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92; SOFTWARE&#92; Microsoft&#92; Windows NT&#92; CurrentVersion&#92; Winlogon". Once there double click on the string value "Shell". Once inside the text box will have "explorer.exe" in it, delete that and type in "explorer1.exe", (what we saved the new explorer file as) then click the "OK" button.\n\n19. Make sure explorer1.exe is in the "C:&#92;Windows&#92;" directory otherwise you will have to type the whole path ito the text box.\n\n20. Now reboot your computer and enjoy your new start button!

I may need to do it manually with the IP addresses and everything but it's so confusing... can anyone help me figure it out? I'll add details if necessary... [SEP] best_answer: call me 760-242-5453\nask for alan.\nor e-mail me at alan@axiommedia.net\n\nChances-are, you are trying to use the same network address as the one the modem has given your router. Something I've run into a GREAT deal of late. damn hybrid modems !\n\neg. if you DHCP RELEASE and RENEW your Router, it obtains a **WAN** IP of 192.168.0.1 YOU CANNOT USE 192.168.0.X for your **LAN**\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter that the subnet 255.255.255.0 would allow you to......don't do it. Put your Router on a **LAN** IP of something else....like 192.168.2.1\nthen with your PC's on DHCP themselves, Release and Renew them as well.\n\nhope this helps-------------------------------------\n\nin the LAN portion of your Router setup use the IP I gave you. \nif your Router is on  192.168.2.1\nthen YOUR PC needs to either be on DHCP, or \na static ip of\n192.168.2.100\nsubnet mask of\n255.255.255.0\ndefault gateway of\n192.168.2.1\nand dns of\n192.168.2.1\n\nhmmm, if your going to use DHCP for other computers in your house, and you want to use a Static IP for yourself, then use instead IP address 192.168.2.99 for yourself.

[SEP] question_content: HOW CAN I CREATE SOFTWARES?\nWILL I BE ABLE TO CREATE SOFTWARES AFTER LEARNING C++ LANGUAGE? [SEP] best_answer: just learning the basic C++ language will not give you a handle on creating software apps. usually creating applications requires you to have a good handle on programming language. it will also mostly require that you know some form of database (either SQL, Access and Oracle). You will also most probably be working in a team (very few software apps are made by locking a programmer in a room and letting him/her churn out code).	Computers & Internet

Consequently I set up a firewall, that does not allow http requests to or from any of the following servers (this has eliminated all my pop-up problems):\n\ncrutialparadigm.com\nadonspot.com\nadbrite.com\nzedo.com\nrevenue.net\nallfeeds.com\nadrevolver.com\nrealtechnetwork.net\ncentrport.net\ncoremetrics.com\nmediaturf.net\n2mdn.net\natdmt.com\nfastclick.net\ncontextweb.com\nquestionmarket.com\nadvertising.com\nhitbox.com\nmediaplex.com\ntargetnet.com\ncasalemedia.com\ntrafficmp.com\nfirstadsolution.com\nsmashits.com\nbollywoodondemand.com\ntribalfusion.com\nfalkag.net\ntqlkg.com\nawltovhc.com\nafcyhf.com\nftjcfx.com\nci.com\nkanoodle.com\n\nIn my opinion these guys serve a bulk of the pop-up ads on the web, and blocking them resolves the problem without additional software -- which may need to be continuously updated.

First, it typically takes place in a chat room or IRC channel. Second, it is almost always a non-paid conversation between consenting adults. However, role playing is common, so you never know if you are speaking with a male, female, teenager or senior citizen.\n\nOf course, if an under-age child takes part in the conversation, this can present a problem.

At This Point You Press Any Key.After you do that you will be lead to a blue screen that starts loading a bunch of things. Once it is done loading you have to acsept the licence aggrement from microsoft (I think you press F8 but it will tell what to press). You will then be asked if you would like to repair windows. Cancel and press escape. You Will Then Be shown all the partions on You HardDrive. Delete all the partions (except the unused on). You Have Now Erased the HardDrive. If You Want to install windows again you must create another partion. If you are using only one operating System use the max space alloted. Your new partion will then be formatted. Once that is complete some new files will be written to your hard drive. Now after that is complete your computer will restart and automaticly install windows. From Here all you have to do is pedioticly enter some information (Ex. Name, Time Zone). That Is How Erase A Hard Drive. Note that this could take up to 3 hours. Good Luck.	Computers & Internet

question_title: What is the difference between a modular and a true modular? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Interesting question! I've never heard the term "true" modular.\n\nA modular home is one that's built in a factory, and trucked to the building site. It does not have wheels or a chassis, and is of a construction similar to "stick built" on-site construction.\n\nThe modular home typically comes in at least two units (modules), for a standard ranch house. I own a modular custom-colonial two-story, and it came in 10 units.\n\nOnce the modular home is installed on the foundation ("set" in industry terms) it cannot be moved.\n\nThis is all in contrast to a "mobile" home, which is built on a chassis, has permanent wheels, and can be moved at any time.\n\nYou might be thinking of a "manufactured" home, which is essential a mobile home without the wheels, and is typically one-piece.

(If that is what you mean by counter offer) If you want to stay where you are at, (make sure the offer is genuine) tell your current employer you got 25% raise at the other company. If they really value you, they should at least try to match. If they don't, you can still leave.	Business & Finance

question_title: What's the E Commerce ...? [SEP] question_content: What's Your Opinion ... Profits ... Disadvantages ...  Which Level is Your Country in ? [SEP] best_answer: What is E-Commerce.\nElectronic Commerce (E-Commerce) is simply any business transacted electronically.\nIn today's parlance it has come to mean "Business transacted over the Internet".\n\nE-Commerce consists of three components.\n\n1. A Merchant Account. The Merchant Account gives you the ability to take Credit Card information from your \nprospective customers. There are many sites on the Internet where you can apply for a Merchant Account. Typically\nyou pay from $100 - $300 to start this process. Ultimately the Merchant Account is issued through an \nAuthorizing Bank. Click here to access EasyCart Merchant Account provider partners.\n\nThink of the Merchant Account as a Drivers License. Just because you have a Drivers License doesn't mean you \ncan drive. In order to move around you need a vehicle! Likewise - in order for you to use your Merchant Account \nyou need a vehicle to move the information around. An example of how to move this information might be a \ntelephone. You could just ask your website prospects to call you on the phone. The phone is then your vehicle \nto move the Credit Card information.\n\n2. Online Shopping Cart software is another example of a vehicle to move Credit Card and ordering information. \nYour customers can efficiently order 24 hours a day. Also a Shopping Cart eliminates some potential for error \nbecause there is only one human involved in the process - rather than two. Online Shopping Cart software also \nincreases your credibility on the Internet.\n\nThe Shopping Cart is a vehicle that enables you to; Get the ordering information from the customer; Verify via \nemail to the customer that the order has been made; Deliver the notification and ordering information to the seller. \nThe more information the shopping cart can collect - the wider it's application can be.\n\n3. Transaction Device or Software is how you Deliver the money. Now that you have the customers money - \n(Credit Card information)- you need a place to deposit it. Your Bank! But you still have some choices to make. \nAre you going to walk in and place the transaction with the Teller? Are you going to drop it in the Night Deposit \nbox? Are you going to utilize the bank's Drive In option?\n\nIn the same manner you have to decide how you are going to deposit the E-Commerce transaction into \nyour bank account.\n\nHere again you have 3 basic choices.\n\nA device in your office to enter the transaction over the phone lines. This device will be similar to those you \nsee in retail stores when you buy something using a credit card. There are many options with widely \nvarying prices. \nInternet software that enables you to 'deposit' your transaction over the Internet. Typically by filling out an \nonline form. Here again you will find a rather wide variation - in most cases you will need to rent the software \non a monthly basis. \nReal Time Credit Processing. This is the service provided by companies such as AuthorizeNet. Using this \nmethod your Shopping Cart interfaces with the Real Time Credit Processing company to complete the transaction. \nThis takes place automatically while the customer is placing the order. Using this method the customer and the \nseller is notified as to whether the credit card account has sufficient funds to enable the transaction. \nThe only difference between these three is how the transaction is entered with the bank. We suggest you use the \nmethod most economical to your situation.	Business & Finance

question_title: Do you know anything about CREDIT SCORES? [SEP] question_content: Is it true that Insurance companies Like AUTO, HOME OWNERS insurance, check your FICO score before giving you insurance rate? If so, WHY? what is the correlation between having  bad score, and the insurance rate? I would appreciate any help, and any resources that you can point me too. THank you!! Im doing this for a school project! [SEP] best_answer: Yes and no.  Your beacon score (the number generated by the major credit bureaus) is different from your insurance score (the term used by insurers for the application of credit).  Every company has a proprietary way of reviewing credit and the factors that determine your insurance score will vary from company to company.  Your insurance score can be substantially different from your beacon score, depending upon the weights and factors used by the insurance carrier.  \n\nFor your beacon score, the key factors are things like paying your bills on time and not being maxed out in terms of your debt to availability ratio.  Insurers won't necessarily place the same weight here, and often look at factors like the types of debt you have, the frequency with which you open new accounts, inquiries and collections.  \n\nInsurance companies analyze risk.  The riskier your behaviors (like running up $30,000 in credit card debt) have an overall indicator that someone is less financially responsible than someone who has no debt.  Keep in mind that insurance carriers are looking at the law of large numbers here, as well.  Of course there are great customers with a ton of debt (small business owners, for example), but the state departments of insurance prevent insurance carriers from evaluating on a case by case basis and require that carriers file their credit review procedures. \n\nAlso keep in mind that credit is one of literally dozens of factors that determine premium (like age, driving record and address for auto or location, claims and age of dwelling for home).  There is a direct correlation between having a lower insurance score and the frequency/severity of claims filed.  Interestingly, the correlation is often stronger with regard to auto claims rather than to homeowner's as might be expected.  \n\nInsurance carriers are looking for any statistical data that helps them splice and dice risk.  If they could find evidence that supported saying blondes deserve better rates than red-heads, they'd go with it.  Insurance companies compete any many different levels and the company with the best ability to sort risks out into pricing levels will win in the long run.  \n\nHope this helps!	Business & Finance

[SEP] question_content: Best answer will automatically go to first irreverant, yet practical answer. [SEP] best_answer: Report on the effects of leachwifery and procreation on employee compensation.\n\nYou read that 30% of an employee's compensation is accounted for by benefits.  However, most of these benefits consist of health insurance paid to men who have leachwives and rugrats at home.  \n\nIt is unfair.  You should not be compensated for things that do not benefit the company.  In fact, if anything, leachwives and rugrats detract from an employee's performance and compensation should be deducted for having them.	Business & Finance

question_title: why cant i get a job? the agencies seem to throw away my number the moment i register. how do i get a job??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The process for getting a job is similar to the process for getting a girlfriend: you have to figure out what it is that they want and then give it to them.\n\nPeople who look for jobs are often too self-oriented and they don't do research on the company to understand what the company really needs.\n\nFirst of all jobseekers should understand that a company creates a job because there was a problem that was persistent. If you know what the problem is, then you can position yourself as the solution to that problem. Only then will they give you the job.\n\nGoing to the job market without having a clear solution to offer is never going to work, in the same way that a guy who wants to date women but only thinks of sex and not what he can bring to them, will never get a girlfriend.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci may have been an artistic and scientific genius, but he also did something few job seekers know: in every cover letter he sent to patrons, he would always list 10-15 specific solutions or projects he could do for the employer. He even offers to work for free, so the employer can go for a "free trial"!\n\nGood luck!	Business & Finance

question_title: What is escrow? [SEP] question_content: How does this apply to houses? [SEP] best_answer: 1- What Is Escrow?\nEscrow is a process that provides for a fair and equitable transfer of property from one person to another.\nEscrow opens when the buyer and seller sign a sales contract, commonly called a real estate purchase agreement and receipt of deposit. The contract, along with any additional instructions, serves as instructions for the escrow officer. \nEscrow assures that the lender releases the home purchase funds at or about the same time that the deed is recorded to reflect new ownership. Escrow includes depositing, with a neutral third party, funds, documents and instructions necessary to complete the transfer. \nBecause the real estate transaction involves large sums of money and reams of documentation, escrow is not always a predestined, step-by-step process, but can become a confusing end game of details, nit picking and overlapping procedures. It requires preparation, attention to detail, and desire from both sides to close the deal. \nRegional custom will dictates who (the buyer or the seller) chooses the neutral third party and who that third party will be. A neutral third party can be an escrow officer from an escrow company, someone from a title company or from a title and escrow company. Some regional areas use title and escrow attorneys. Custom and market conditions also dictate which escrow costs the buyer or seller pays. The amount typically totals about 1 to 2 percent of the cost of the home. \nChoosing an escrow officer is much like choosing any real estate professional. Get several referrals from trusted people, then compare services, cost and convenience. \nYour escrow officer opens escrow by assigning your escrow an account number and collecting the contract and other instructions, the buyer's deposit and perhaps additional proceeds or documents related to the transaction. Deposits are either applied to the purchase price, or returned should the deal fall through. \nThe buyer orders title insurance, to protect him or her against blemishes on the title, and he or she orders a preliminary title search to determine if there are any claims against the title. \nThe contract and escrow instructions likely contain contingencies for home insurance, flood insurance, home inspections, financing, repairs and other tasks either the buyer or seller must complete before the transaction can progress. Each time a contingency is met, the buyer or seller signs off with a contingency release form or letter copied to all parties, including the escrow officer. \nAt some point, parties will receive a preliminary title report which summarizes the condition of the title, including easements and liens, claims and encumbrances against the property. The seller must resolve any claims against the title, or they could stall the deal. \nThe title company may check once again and produce a final report to be sure existing claims have been removed and that no claims have been filed since escrow opened. \nOnce the loan is funded, contingencies are released, the title is cleared, the buyer inspects the property and decides how to take title, only a few loose ends must be tied before close of escrow. \nRemaining paperwork to sign a few days before close includes the buyer's grant deed, any final escrow instructions or contingency releases, the settlement sheet of disbursements, title reports, the deed of trust lender forms, inspection reports, tax statements -- and a rental agreement if the seller will live in the home for some time after escrow closes. \nEscrow closes and the deal is sealed when the escrow office records a new deed in the buyer‚Äôs name, the seller gets paid for the home, and all other moneys are disbursed. \nMoney may be held in escrow after the close to pay contractors for unfinished work. \ntop	Business & Finance

Why do Mexicans think they are better then everyone else?  Not all Mexicans, just the ones bitching about everything. [SEP] best_answer: ILLEGAL ALIENS in America are here only because they are GUILTY of CRIMINAL VIOLATION  of our FEDERAL LAWS, Jumping our borders and living in a shadowy underground economy. They are morally culpable for shoving aside those who adhere to the law and enter these United States in orderly and Legal Fashion. \nSince when do criminals and cheaters receive pride of place for the blessings of liberty, over those honestly, earnestly and faithfully seeking to become American citizens? \n\nPresident Bush has called for a reasonable and civil debate over the issues of border security and immigration reform. But the American people understand there can be no responsible immigration reform UNTIL OUR BORDERS ARE SECURE. ‚ÄúGuest worker‚Äù amnesty programs ARE NOT a part of border security. \nAmnesty is not the answer. To grant amnesty to these trespassers is to say "You crossed our borders ILLEGALLY, You BROKE OUR LAWS and now we are REWARDING you with U.S. Citizenship -- Congratulations!" \n\nThis is unacceptable.

[SEP] question_content: when i met my husband he was and still is cleaning floors its not easy work to strip and wax a store as big as a wal-mart in one week but he did it. when we moved on behalf of his job we tried to find a white or anybody (other than hispanic) to take the job it payed $2,800 a month do you know the ONLY person willing to take the job was a mexicon so why is every body so down on having hispanics legal they so jobs no white man wants even when it pays good money [SEP] best_answer: That's nice because your illegal husband is making more than most legals make.  You say $2800 like it's nothing.  That's a lot of money.  So if your husband becomes legal, then does that mean he will stop doing the work he is doing now?  If your arguing that illegals work hard and do jobs that U.S. citizens wont do and that this benefits the U.S., then with your logic if he got amnesty he would quit that job and then no one would do that work period, right?

question_title: Is there a common formula for a judge to sentence a convicted person to death? What exactly does he/she say? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: 1.) Only certain crimes are eligible for the death penalty. The jury must first find the defendant guilty of an eligible crime (with aggrivating factors if required by the state).\n\n2.) To my knowledge, all states as well as the federal government require a jury to vote unanimously for the death penalty. This is why prospective jurors are asked if they would apply the death penalty if it was called for by law.	Politics & Government

question_title: How does a criminal record affect the immigration process to get a permanent green card? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Depends on what the crime was.  \n\nIf it was only a speeding ticket, you're okay.  First offense DUI, you should be fine.  \n\nBut if you're talking about drug trafficking, illegal immigrant trafficking, murder, etc., then forget about it.  The USCIS will deport you at the first chance.  \n\nSo, as always, it's best to consult with immigration attorneys.  The general rule (the "line") is whether that crime involves "moral turpitude."  But you may want an attorney to represent you to argue your case (or present it in the best light) in your adjustment proceedings.	Politics & Government

question_title: does anyone know the cause of napoleons defeat at waterloo? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Napoleon lost the battle for a number of reasons:\nan accident of weather. As before all of Wellington's battles, it rained heavily all the previous night so Napoleon could use neither his guns nor his cavalry to their best advantage. His guns sank up to their axles in the mud and his cavalry could not charge uphill in the soggy conditions. The start of the battle was delayed for about two hours, so that the ground could dry out a little.\nWellington's tactics were superb. He refused to move from the high ground into the boggy valley, so the French had to take the battle to him, uphill and through mud.\nWellington used the "thin red line" and hid his troops: this surprised Napoleon, who had never seen this method of fighting. Wellington had perfected them in Spain while Napoleon was occupied in fighting elsewhere.\nWellington's smaller force held the French to a stalemate from about 11 a.m. (when the battle started), until about 4 p.m. Wellington was about to give the order for a general retreat following Napoleon's order for a general advance, when Blucher arrived and tipped the balance in favour of the Allies.\nNapoleon said he lost Waterloo because of the "obstinate bravery of the English troops" - many of whom were Irish. [1]\nThere is an account that Napoleon was not functioning at his best because of a medical problem. It seems that he suffered terribly from haemorrhoids (piles); his physician used leeches to alleviate the pain but during the night of 16 June, the leeches were lost. The physician gave Napoleon laudanum to alleviate the pain but by accident administered an overdose; consequently, at Waterloo, Napoleon's abilities were imp	Politics & Government

question_title: Discovery or Discloser law? [SEP] question_content: I am not sure of the correct terminology but I know that both the prosecution and defense have a duty to disclose and share all evidence that they may have so as to give each side an opportunity to have their own experts give their opinion. does the defendant and or his or her spouse have a right to view this evidence as well?  in other words can the defendants spouse optain any and all copies of paperwork that the attorney may have regarding the case?  what is the exact statute and wording? [SEP] best_answer: It's not a statute, it's a court rule of procedure. Discovery takes in interrogatories, requests for documents and depositions. It can include a "view" when the locus of an event cannot be seen from a public way.\n\nJust because the information has been disclosed to the party's lawyer does not mean it can be shared with a spouse of the party, since the attorney must maintain attorney-client privilege even as to a spouse.\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecution generally has a duty to disclose evidence exculpating the defendant. The defendant, except in MA and a couple of other states and federal courts, there is no general duty on the defense to share information with the prosecutor.\n\nA defense lawyer will usually share any disclosures with the defendant. But the lawyer will tell the defendant not to disclose it to anyone else if it will affect the case when it gets out.	Politics & Government

As for closing the borders, i agree to this because i believe this country is going to become overcrowded with illegals. The people from Mexico and other countries south of the border should take a stand and try to fix their countries and stop running away from their problems.\nwhy doesn't this country start the process of fixing this situation by jailing those that actually hire illegals to work for them.

question_title: Border walls... Good? or bad?   who is aginst them and why... who thinks they are godd and why?  Reasons GOOD! [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: a. They are a good idea, but they must be built properly. You can't build a 700 mile fence on a border that is over 1,950 miles. You also can't build a fence that is only three feet tall or made out of chain-link, wood- and- post, etc. (There are 5 year olds that can climb over them.) \n*****\nWhat I would do: \na. Height: At least 15 feet. \nb. Fence type: Chain-link fence with razor wire and barbed wire intertwined through it. (Anyone who is stupid enough to try and climb it will get exactly what they deserve.) There will be one wide gate that can be opened to let buses, trucks, cars, etc. through every 25 miles. Also, there should a large slab of concrete wall underneath the fence to prevent tunneling.\nc. Other forms of security: \n1. Cameras wherever the border patrol deems it necessary. \n2. ARMED border patrol agents with vehicles best suited to the rocky desert terrain. They will patrol the border and be stationed at the gates. (They'll check the interior of the buses, trucks, cars, etc.) \n3. Small helicopters to patrol from overhead. \n4. (Hopefully.) Start pulling in U.S. troops and start sticking them on the border. \n5. Force anyone that leaves food, water, and/or medical supplies on the border to leave. Then, take the supplies away. \n\n-Incidentally: Leave about three inches of fencing without wire on the bottom just to make sure that small lizards, etc. won't get cut. I'd also keep a few veterinarians on hand. Also, if Mexico or some "do-gooder" wants to send doctors, fine. Just remind them that: \na. They are going to have to pay for the treatments with their OWN money. \nb. The illegals will be immediately deported when they get bandaged up and ready to start the road to recovery. \nc. Any potential anchor-babies born on U.S. soil would not get an automatic path to citizenship. Instead, they'd get sent back to Mexico with their mother's citizenship. \n*****\nb. Who is against the fence? Illegal immigrants and their relatives. \n\nc. Why is the fence good? It blocks one wave of illegal immigrant from entering the country. After our border is secured, we can start working on deportation, tracking tourists, and on keeping tack of people that have visas. (We must make sure that the latter don't "mysteriously disappear.")

question_title: What would you say was the greatest military battle fought in the history of the world? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would believe that the trogan war was a great battle, as far as original battle strategies. It depends on what you mean but "the greatest military battle." because there has been battle faught over time that you would even consider a battle. I believe that the best battle are faught before you even got to physical war. So you will not see these battles in history books.\n\nSun Tzu in the art of war says "Therefore, to gain a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; to subjugate the enemy's army without doing battle is the highest of excellence. \n\nTherefore, the best warfare strategy is to attack the enemy's plans, next is to attack alliances, next is to attack the army, and the worst is to attack a walled city. ? \n\nLaying siege to a city is only done when other options are not available.\n\nIf you like to see more of this check this out . \nhttp://www.sonshi.com/index.html	Politics & Government

This also has to be delivered to the apt manager at least 60 days prior to your lease being up.  What part of MN.  I am also having problems with my apt. manager.  Just curious to know.  I have never heard of your lease automatically renewing though.  Are you sure that it doesn't just go from the 1 year lease to a month to month lease.  Also, You said that you looked at your original lease, does it say anything in there about it automatically renewing itself?  If not they can not hold you to it.  They would need to file an addendum stating that you are renewing your lease.  You would have to sign this in order for you to be held to the contract.  These are just some thoughts, i don't want you to think that i am an expert or anything like that, because i am not.

There are several approved drug treatments that seem to slow the growth of the HIV viruses (which causes AIDS), and seem to slow the progress of the AIDS disease.\nSo far, these are imperfect for several reasons; they don't work for everyone, they have serious side effects, and the virus is "learning" to overcome these drugs.\nCancer is actually many different diseases, with many different causes, affecting many different parts of the body, and with many different outcomes.  There are cures for a few types of cancer; effective treatments for many others; but there are still some types that we don't\nhave effective weapons to use against.  \n\nWell..

Imitrex injections when I did get them. \n\nWith all of the new improvements and advancements the combo of Celexa and Topomax daily took me down to having maybe 5-6 a month. When it starts I use the Maxalt and within an hour I can get out and go.  \n\nAfter being on that for over a year (prob closer to 2 yars) I tapered myself off of all of it and now am able to use an OTC herbal gel for the migraines and they are not nearly as horrible as they were when they started 10 years ago. \nGood Luck, they are horrible..

question_title: I work with someone who has Fredricks Artaxia  what is the life expectency? [SEP] question_content: my patient was told 36 is the life expectancy of this illness she is 34 now does anyone know if this is true she was diagnosed in her early 20's also wonder if it is contagious in anyway to the care givers or family. [SEP] best_answer: Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an inherited, progressive nervous system disorder causing loss of balance and coordination.\n\nThe rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most patients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symptom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility by age 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications is also quite variable.  but may be as late as the mid-sixties.  the particular length of the triple repeat has not been correlated strongly enough with disease progression to allow prediction of the course of the disease on this basis.it is not catching .\nThe gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin. Normal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structures known as mitochondria, where it is thought to be involved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, the frataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with nonsense information known as a "triple repeat." This extra DNA interferes with normal production of frataxin, thereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence may be repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symptoms and severity of FA seems to be associated with the number of repetitions. Patients with more copies have more severe symptomatology. Researchers are still wrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromosome 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggests that FA develops in part because defects in iron transport prevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.\n\nThe nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the spinal cord involved in relaying information between muscles and the brain. Tight control of movement requires complex feedback between the muscles promoting a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. Without this control, movements become uncoordinated, jerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.\n\nits inherted in the genes.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: Effects of Stress \n\n\nStress can affect you both immediately (acute stress) and over time (chronic stress).\n\nTension is often the first signal of acute stress. Tense muscles are tight and feel "hard" to the touch. A tense mind makes you feel jumpy, irritable, and unable to concentrate. This could be your signal to do something about stress, both for your immediate comfort and to prevent the long-term effects of stress.\n\nSymptoms of stress\nCommon symptoms of stress include:\n\nRapid heartbeat. \nHeadache. \nStiff neck and/or tight shoulders. \nBackache. \nRapid breathing. \nSweating and sweaty palms. \nUpset stomach, nausea, or diarrhea. \nYou also may notice signs of stress in your thinking, behavior, or mood. You may:\n\nBecome irritable and intolerant of even minor disturbances. \nFeel irritated or frustrated, lose your temper more often, and yell at others for no reason. \nFeel jumpy or exhausted all the time. \nFind it hard to concentrate or focus on tasks. \nWorry too much about insignificant things. \nDoubt your ability to do things. \nImagine negative, worrisome, or terrifying scenes. \nFeel you are missing opportunities because you cannot act quickly.

question_title: What is witch hazel?  Can i use it while on differin and cleocin-t? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Witch-hazel is the common name for a genus of shrubs Hamamelis in the family Hamamelidaceae, with four species, two in North America (H. virginiana and H. vernalis), and one each in Japan (H. japonica) and China (H. mollis). The Persian Ironwood, a closely related tree formerly treated as Hamamelis persica, is now given a genus of its own, as Parrotia persica, as it differs in the flowers not having petals. Other closely allied genera are Parrotiopsis, Fothergilla and Sycopsis (see under Hamamelidaceae). The Witch-Hazel is not closely related to the Common Hazel.\n\nThey are popular garden shrubs, grown for their clusters of rich yellow to orange-red flowers which begin to expand in the autumn before the leaves fall and continue throughout the winter. It is one of the earliest blooming garden plants. The bark and leaves are astringent, the extract, also referred to as Witch Hazel, is used medicinally. Extracts from its bark and leaves are used in aftershave lotions and lotions for treating bruises. The seeds contain a quantity of oil and are edible. The name is derived from the use of the twigs as divining rods, just as hazel twigs were used in England.\n\nHamamelis species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Feathered Thorn.\n\nThe word witch has its origins in Middle English wiche, from the Old English wice, meaning "pliant" or "bendable", and which also gives us Wicker and weak.

Yet, many of us hardly drink ANY water.\n\nTherefore, I assume it is Will Power which will allow us to follow the directions to a "T" and avoid harmful things.  How do YOU increase YOUR Will Power?

You have to let yourself some leeway for messing up, otherwise the first time you actually do mess up you wont want to continue what you are doing because it isn't perfect. \nDont shoot for perfection.

question_title: I have 3 different antibodies in my blood?  What's going on? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: An antibody is a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody recognizes a specific antigen unique to its target. Production of antibodies is referred to as the humoral immune system.\nMany illnesses are diagnosed by antibodies. Antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream or bound to cell membranes.

My mother-in-law did and was cancer free but took it because of precautions and she died 7 days after her first treatment????

Even with all the technology and knowledge of today, doctors just aren't infallible.  They do commendable work, but they just can't hit the nail on the head every time.\nSo, so sad.

question_title: How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Where do you live?  I have been taking a class called "Core Fusion" for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt).  It is offered at Exhale Spa, which has locations in Boston, New York, Chicago, Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006.  \n\nIf you are not near an Exhale, yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?).  So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring).  \n\nThere are also the old "standbys" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat).  One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries.  \n\nIf you go to the gym, some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines.

question_title: Can multiple sclerosis cause hip pain?

Its most common presentation involves blurry vision and sensory changes, but a variety of pain syndromes can be present as well.  Recent study found up to 43% of patients with MS have some form of pain.  Hip pain was not specifically mentioned in the study, but back pain was and one can certainly imagine MS causing hip pain as well.

question_title: Reflux Pain Gallstones??How do you know??Short Time of Fever and Chills..then goes .odd! Pain comes and goes!? [SEP] question_content: I had a bought of 'fever and chills' earlier this evening, then they went away. I called Ttelehealth Ontario on their free 1-800 number. Not much help there, they told me to go to EMERG. Typical answer.\n\nMy urine is not dark, and I took some Ranitidine with milk as I am totally out of Pantoloc and Pariat. No vomiting or nausea. The pain comes and goes under my right rib area, not in my shoulders. I am constantly rubbing the area, I tried an ice pack, and BEN GAY, that remedy just irrates the area in question. It's a strong nasty pain like someone sticking a knife into you, it comes and goes. Caffeine irrates it too, so do Cheezy's or anything spicey, Bad foods that I eat. Yes I am overweight as well, not a drinker but a smoker and am 44 years old and very tall!!\nHelp!! I live in the only modernized city n the world that does NOT have a hospital in the downtown core-Ottawa Canada, very difficult to get to if you dont have a car and live alone. So I suffer at home late at night. [SEP] best_answer: Could very well be gall stones...although gallstones do not usually produce a fever.  Sounds like you have a history of GI problems given the drugs you have available.  It is very possible to have ulcers and/or diverticuli that become infected and cause the type of pain that you describe with fever. The products that are exacerbating the pain would do so with either.  A bad gall bladder will in addition to pain cause flatulence and belching.  You are the right age for either problem.  STOP SMOKING!!!   That is the worst thing you can do if you have stomach problems.  Milk is not good for either gall bladder or ulcerative problems as it increases the production of stomach acid and phlegmy secretions.  Your symptoms do suggest that medical intervention is eminante.  Good luck and God Bless!	Health

question_title: what is xanex used for? What is it in medical terms? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Xanax is in the class of drugs called "benzodiazepenes".  It is an anti-anxiety agent effecting GABA production in your brain.  It is not generally useful as an anti-depressant.  Its most effective use if for a biological condition known as Panic Disorder.  People with Panic Disorder may need to take a small daily dose indefinitely in order to function and have a decent quality of life.  When used properly under the guidance of a physician they are actually one of the safer medications on the market as far as lack of bad side-effects, allergies, etc.  Continued use will cause a dependency on the drug, but many people with panic feel that this is a very fair trade-off.

Each time, things cleared up greatly for a few days, then symptoms returned. I know that sometimes you have to take anti-biotics for 4-12 weeks to get better. Does that mean that my symptoms won't improve for a few weeks and I shouldn't be concerned yet? I'm terrified that I have one of those cases of prostatitis that never goes away. I know this happens sometimes but just don't know if I'm overreacting because it's taking some time to get better. I'm miserable! Pain, no sexual function...I'm basically incapacitated. Has anyone had prostatitis that took a long time to clear up? Please help!! I'm only 32!! [SEP] best_answer: One of the most effective treatment protocols for this problem is a combination of frequent vigorous prostatic massage combined with long term antibiotic therapy. The prostate has a poor blood supply and in order to ensure that a sufficient amount of antibiotics get into this gland, proper drainage is required. Regular massage combined with long term antibiotic treatment should solve this problem.\nIt is most important to ensure that your sexual partner be treated as well. If your partner is a woman, any recurrent yeast infections are a definite sign of her being infected with a non-culturable STD organism. The presence of these organisms can be proven with a PCR (DNA) test.\nIf she has this problem, an effective treatment is oral fluconazol combined with a topical antifungal like terconazol together with a prolonged treatment of a newer tetracycline analogue taken orally. Although macrolide antibiotics (long acting erythromycins) work, they can become problematic when combined with  oral antifungal medications.\nIncidentally, the reason why women develop vulval yeast infections 'down there' is because the mucous membranous lining in that area has lost its integrity from an underlying nanobacterial infection. This type of bug cannot be grown in a typical lab. Keep in mind that yeast is everywhere and opportunistic. Conditions have to be just right before it can make a home anywhere on your body.\nThe unfortunate thing is that a lot of healthcare providers aren't aware of this phenomenom so it's often treated erroneously.\nAlthough the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are very effective, minocycline has been proven to be very safe when used long term.

question_title: Women, do you hate when you man.........................? [SEP] question_content: I was just wondering if any other women out there have this problem? I have caught my husband on several occasions "releasing" himself. He knows that if he wants some, all he has to do is just come to me. What makes me really upset, is that when we have a night to ourselves, he'd rather do "that'' than make love to his wife(me). I have told him that this hurts my feelings, and that it makes me feel unattractive on several occasions. But again, it continues. Am I the only one? [SEP] best_answer: I've caught my husband doing it frequently also. We had a talk about it though and he told me sometimes he just doesnt feel like sex because he needs release and just wants to get it over with. I actually woke up one night and he was releasing himself while watching a porno on mute. I freaked out about it. I love pleasing him and it offends me too. Although I can kind of relate to why he does it without me sometimes because I do it without him sometimes too. I just dont want to have sex sometimes. it seems though that he doesnt want to have sex with you at all...and if that is what your saying, let him catch you a few times...if it doesnt make him jump your bones right then...I guess the only thing to do is look into couples therapy.

question_title: How do you get the passion back into your marriage of 12 years.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Start from the beginning from when you first started dating. Go back to the place you met. Revisit old past times together.

Spice things up a little, do something that you would not ordinarily do. You may have become to predictable with your day in and day out routine. Do some new things.\n\nPray about it as well. It'll work, you have nothing to worry about.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Do guys like it when girls take the first step? [SEP] question_content: I want to ask a guy out but my friend says I shouldn't because guys don't like "pushy" girls. I don't agree and I think that if the guy is shy he may be relieved that the girl took the first step. What do you think? [SEP] best_answer: Makes her look cheap. She probably does it all the time with guys. But she could do it smartly and still make the guy think he made the first move.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Women Only!!!!! Need Advice and Tips!!!!? [SEP] question_content: I was talkin to this girl for a year and she decided right before new years to break it up cuz she felt it was gettin boring and she didnt know whut she wanted. The time we were talkin, she would say how much she loved me, and she wanted kids with me, etc. We kept mild contact like a couple phone calls a week, but 3 weeks later, I find out she talkin to another guy. I write a letter to her, but it doesn't seem to affect her cuz she tells me "why am i trying so hard", and "things are different now". I still love her a lot, and I know she still cares some what because her friend likes me more than the new guy and tells me that she thinks of me sometimes. It's been 3 mos. and the situation hasn't changed, but I dont know if I'm doin something wrong. We haven't talked for like 3 weeks. How can I bring the attraction back? the guy shes talkin to is a loser (but i dont show it bothers me)!! doesn't work or go to school!! PLEASE...any advice on how to get her back would help a lot!! [SEP] best_answer: You want her back bro. This is man to man sh*t here. Blow her off. Seriously, just trust my advice and blow her off. Pretend you are on and better off and she will see that and realize you are intriguing to her again and she will start talking to you again. But play semi hard to get with her. Take it like you don't give a damn about nothing and if you 2 ever get together again it doesn't make a differance to you. But try to be exciting around her. Do something you normally wouldn't do. Take a chance and make sure she sees it or knows about it. You can handle it. Woman are complex creatures but once you know how to get through to them, you are golden for life. Well until they catch on to your knowledge of their ways.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Should I wait or Should I panic? [SEP] question_content: I joined this love singles and was getting several responses but after trying to get to know them none were my type. We want completely the wrong thing. One day I was on there and this cute dude IM me and of course we started conversation and we realize in that 30 minutes that we want the same things in life. The basics love, marriage, and children minus the drama, lies, and challenge. We both been through relationships that we love despite of the other person. Well my dilema is that he's in Ghana at the present time. He sent me this sweet email and I responded and I sent one back and the next day which was yesterdayI had more thoughts so I sent another. He has checked both of them and he hasn't responded. Should I just wait or just put as it could of, would of but isn't. [SEP] best_answer: Give him time. Do you know his work schedule and what it is like. He may have checked the email and just not had time to respond to it. Maybe he is gathering his thoughts of what he may want to say to you. Sometimes it is harder for men to express their feelings because they don't want to seem like a pushover, or move to fast. I would wait and give him another day or so. I know that it can be hard when you are filled with anticipation. In the end, follow your heart for you are the only one who knows what makes you truly happy.......Best of luck to you	Family & Relationships

question_title: if i'm 23 and my bf is 34 is he to old for me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This is simply not enough information to answer in a helpful way. 11 years is not too much in all cases, depending on things like maturity, wanting the same things, sharing things in common, etc. The age alone is not a problem, but the greater the age difference is, typically it is harder to make things work over the long haul. That shouldn't discourage you though; even people who are 20 or more years different make it work!	Family & Relationships
question_title: How one can measure  whether one is broad minded or consevative in all aspects ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Broadminded and conservative are mutually exclusive terms.  Conservatives have a set of beliefs that narrow their outlook, and their minds are by nature geared to have a narrow outlook and to want a narrow outlook.  They thrive having their minds restricted by authoritarian ideologies like religion, law-and-order, and other such prescribing dictates.  They are very uncomfortable with personal liberty management, and that is why they fight so constantly to get enforcement of prescribing rules and regulations.  It looks like they want everyone to go by what they believe, and that sure would be fine with them, but what really motivates them is their own need to escape the frightening personal liberty management issues that broadminded people handle well and enjoy.\n\nSo you can tell if you are broadminded or conservative by how well you deal with personal liberty, how threatened you are by non-standard and traditional life-styles, how much liberty you are willing to tolerate other people having.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Please HELP!!!? [SEP] question_content: Help me my ex- boyfriend is stalking me and he wont stop I already have a restraining order on him he still wont stop he even threatins to hit me [SEP] best_answer: Try to get pics of him violating the restraining order.  ALSO get a tape recorder and tape it anytime he threatens you.  Verbal threats are a violation of yet another law. As soon as you have these things take them to the police station and tell them everything and show them your proof.  Be very careful, sometimes these types of people will escalate the bad behavior instead of giving up and going away.	Family & Relationships
question_title: when to stop making love with your pregnant wife? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The first three months are the most critical and some doctors do not recommend intercourse during that time but afterwards it is ok, it is even recommended towards the end to induce labor! So, I would say go ahead unless she becomes uncomfortable about it and it's important to choose positions where you are not pressing on her stomach.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: give it a week first, and see what happens. If he doesn't call you, call him and let him have a great time talking to you (leave him wanting more) you can even drop a hint - "call me only if you want to" then laugh.\nIf he doesnt call you after this, don't ever ever ever call him again.

question_title: did u believe that life without wife like kichen without knife? i dont believe? [SEP] question_content: me & my wife have fight yesterday iam so sad i hat women, all of them,even female angle\nsorry but iam so angry [SEP] best_answer: It must have been some fight.  The thing to do when you and your wife fight is to kiss and make up  - that's the fun thing to do.  a family fight shouldn't cause hatred of all women - even angels - You are too emotional over it. Like I said, kiss and make up - soon.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: Ask her about herself. Girls are often flattered when you show that you are interested in THEM. Ask her all about herself and then listen attentively while she talks. Not only will that take the pressure off of you to make conversation, but she'll love it that you listen to her.\n\nDr. Barb Nefer, http://www.bnlifeskills.com	Family & Relationships

question_title: What can I do to make myself more desirible to women?? [SEP] question_content: I want to be the guy at the club that girls notice, but I feel like I blend in the club.How can I stand out? \n\nHow do you decide on who to talk to? [SEP] best_answer: Simply put - self confidence.  And don't be afraid to talk to women.  I don't know how many times I will see a guy look at me (By that, I mean LOOK), but won't say anything.  A lot of women are shy, or were taught that they should not approach a guy - to let him approach you.  (My mother taught that a girl should never call a guy first, or approach him.)  I wish that when guys noticed a girl, they would just come up to us and say something (aside from a lame pickup line).  \n\nOh yeah - and you should talk to whoever you feel a connection with.  If you catch someone looking at you, and they kind of grin and look away, go talk to her!	Family & Relationships
question_title: What is your point of view in this matter????? [SEP] question_content: why do most women would throw away a man the is nice to them for someone else whom you feel isnt as nice as you.. then they'll try to come back to you after being treated like crap? Ya'll need to make your mind and the next thing you know its too late..did that ever happened to one you ladies in here? [SEP] best_answer: I think because the thrill is attracting to women. The thought of doing something "naughty" something they shouldnt be doing.\nBut in the end every women wants a good man that is going to treat them right and that wants the same things out of life as them	Family & Relationships
question_title: Can you think of any ways I can save time. Or reduce stress.? [SEP] question_content: I work 40 hours a week and single parent. [SEP] best_answer: The most important thing you can do is to get up 15-30 minutes a day earlier than normal, and take that brief time for yourself every day to reflect and plan your day out. This may take some of the urgency out of your daily tasks.\n\nReduce caffeine intake; while it may wake you up, it's a false and fleeting source of energy. Eat as well as you can, and take at least 1 hour per week to do something small you enjoy.\n\nYou didn't mention the age of your child/children. They're demanding little creatures at any age, but know this. Single parent or not, don't let guilt feelings allow you to neglect YOURSELF. An overworked stressed-out mom can hinder the effectiveness of child-rearing. Cherish the small things, and pick your battles.	Family & Relationships

On the other hand, I feel my health is suffering because of lacking of good sleeps. Any marriage advice and medical advice?

question_title: If both parents are the same  height will the children be the same height, what are your observations? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the human genome, humans have a base height that is added to the height genes. so if both parents have half tall genes and half short genes (lets just say T for tall and t for short), like the mother may have TtTTtt and the father may have ttTtTT, the the child may turn out many ways, for example it could receive all three tall genes from the mother and all three tall genes from the father (TTTTTT) or it could receive all three short genes from the mother and all three short genes from the father (tttttt) or it could be any combination in-between.(TTtTtT, TTtTTT, TtttTt,...).  However, if both the parents are have all short genes (both have tttttt) then the only combination possible for the child is tttttt, and the same goes for the tall genes.  There is one more major possibility, but the parents would not be the same height.  If the mother had all short genes (tttttt) and the father had all tall genes (TTTTTT) then the child would have 3 short genes and 3 tall genes (TtTtTt not necessarily in that order).  Also keep in mind that there are more than 6 genes that control height.  And just to screw things all up, height depends on more that genetics (environment, eating habits, sports, injuries...).  To make things more complicated, other genes indirectly affect height.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I know it is the eternal question from guys. But is 5.25 inches a small penis? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely.\n\nWhile there are some girls who truly do like the feeling of a really giant penis inside of them, the vast majority do not.\n\nMen are FAR more concerned with penis size than women are, on the whole.\n\nThe truth is that very few women can reach orgasm from penetration alone, regardless of the size of the penis doing the penetration.  In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.\n\nThe truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind ‚Äì that can be LOTS of fun.\n\nThe truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.  If you can learn how to properly stimulate a girl‚Äôs clitoris, you will be able to satisfy her MUCH more than you can through penetration.\n\nBesides ‚Äì a smaller penis is always easier to swallow than a bigger one.

question_title: Should I dump my girlfriend? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now; we're both 22. She's a sweet girl and all, but recently, she put on a little bit of weight. She used to have a real nice figure. I wouldn't mind so much, but I get a lot of hassle from my male friends and from random people in public places (including other girls). Because of all this hassle, it's getting to the point where I'm a little embarassed to go out with her. I've been pondering for the last month about whether or not I should dump her. There's another girl who's showing tremendous interest in me, and she thinks me and her would be great together. My girlfriend once said that if I ever dumped her, she'd make my life a living hell.\n\nWhat should I do? [SEP] best_answer: i hate men like you, just because your g/f has put on some weight does not mean you have to dump her, who cares what anyone else thinks and says, you dont deserve a gf but its obvious your not intrested in how a women feels or who she is as a person, all your worried about it if she is good looking or not.\nyou are the type of guy that makes men look bad and are only intrested in looks rather then who a person is.

question_title: What makes Barca so different from other clubs......? [SEP] question_content: ....... Mes que un club or More than a club, has a really new meaning now when they have a contract with UNICEF........ what do you think about this two new promotional films with UNICEF..... are they doing this just to make more money with selling products, broadcasting ,... or they really want to help all those kids that REALLY need help!!!\n\nhttp://www.fcbarcelona.com/unicef/en/ [SEP] best_answer: those vids are great, tnx for the link. i like it that they're not OA or too self-promotional.\n\nanyway, to your Q. linking up with unicef certainly creates a lot of goodwill for barca, and that‚Äôs obviously good for business.  i think the tie-up is really a master stroke bec. aside from the prestige of unicef,  football which barca is bringing into the partnership is the world game, watched by everyone young and old, rich and poor, and kids all over love it, so it‚Äôs good economics to ride on that and that‚Äôs probably why this idea was conceived in the 1st place.  but then again children‚Äôs causes are really easy to fall into, we all have a soft spot for these things, so maybe the genuine desire to help is really THERE.  bottomline is, whatever barca‚Äôs motivations are, unicef will  stand to benefit a whole lot from these arrangements and that to me is the most impt. thing: financially, there‚Äôs that cash pledge of 1.5 mil euro which is a big help, and promotionally, too, in terms of the linkage itself, unicef gets a leg up --- barca is a hugely popular team and ronaldinho with his inspiring success story and wholesome image sets a good example for evry1, so all these can only help unicef  attract more institutional support for its initiatives in promoting children‚Äôs welfare. it‚Äôs a win-win situation for both parties in terms of exposure but I‚Äôd also like to think that  barca is a club that really wants to  make a difference....

I'm definitely pulling for him to break Sampras' record for most majors won in a career.	Sports

question_title: Was the Lakers trade of Shaq in favor of Kobe one of the biggest sports blunders ever? [SEP] question_content: I mean, look, Shaq virtually guarantees your team will enter the Conference Finals at least. Kobe by himself can't get to the playoffs, Kobe with Phil Jackson can't even make it out of the first round. How could Jerry Buss be so stupid?\n\nI hear all this talk about Shaq wearing down, but the Heat have made it to the Eastern Conference Finals twice. I bet if the Lakers kept him, they would've been serious NBA Finals contenders.\n\nI still don't understand the logic. Shaq has about 2-3 more years left of serious contention. The Lakers gambled for the future and blew that AND the present.\n\nTrade Kobe...I'm telling you Dr. Buss...oh wait, you gave him that contract.\n\nOoops! [SEP] best_answer: I'm a  Laker fan and I can say that trade sucks. No offense, the Lakers need Shaq to win championships. Before, I was a solid Laker fan. Now, I'm like a Spurs fan or a Cavs fan or any team which has great players. I don't hate the Lakers, I'm still a fan, but trading Shaq was not the best idea they ever had. It's going to be a long time since will see again the Lakers as world champs.	Sports

question_title: Do any one pee in pools summer is coming and i think that is gross how many pee in pools? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no way to know.  When people are asked questions about behavior that is widely disapproved of, a large percentage of people lie.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to chemically analyze pool water and get a definitive answer.  That won't work, though, because urine and sweat have almost exactly the same chemical composition.  \n\nYou may take comfort in the fact that urine is sterile when it is passed.  White blood cells roam the surface of your bladder consuming any microbes they encounter.  Although urine is a good medium for bacterial growth, the chlorine in pool water keeps the bacteria from flourishing.  You should be more concerned about not washing your hands before you eat.	Sports

[SEP] question_content: my other backs are leon washington,,jackson,,and lundy ,,my recievers are driver,,coles ,,and chambers,,should i do it? [SEP] best_answer: No way. That trade is pratically T.J. for Gore since Addai is not even worth a roster spot and furry is a nice 4 or 5th receiver. Gore is still one of the top rb's in the game this season. He is your #2 back. Leon washington just a had a huge disappointing week against a weak D. And Lundy still needs to prove he can do that week in and week out. \n\nI still can't believe there are doubters about frank gore. Didn't he prove last week that he is for real. he just ran against the bears for 111 yards. not to mention 90 total yards against the san diego. In both occasions he averaged more than 5 yards per carry. unbeleivable 9.3 yards per carry last week against the great d of the bears. \n\nDon't trade Gore for T.J. He is worth a lot more than him. At this point of the season , I put more value for him than Tiki since tiki is getting all his goaline touches away. With troubles with robinson at goaline , no doubt , frank gore will once again get the carries at the goaline.	Sports

question_title: How to write an argumentative essay? [SEP] question_content: i need to have emotion,effect, and logically. [SEP] best_answer: First of all you need to pick a good topic, one that can be won.   Make sure it is a topic on which it is easy to take a clear stand.   Good ones are usually those on which people have very definite opinions.  Gun control, abortion, capital punishment, right to die, etc. are good topics for argumentative essays - they have emotion built in.\n\nIn your essay you have to do more than state your opinion - you have to support your argument with facts and evidence and research and statistics.  You need to be able to give examples to back up your stand.  An argumentative essay is rather like a debate - you want to persuade others to agree with you.\n\nThese sites should help you.

[SEP] question_content: a) Show that the line x + y = q will intersect the curve x¬≤ - 2x + 2y¬≤ = 3 in two distinct points if q¬≤ is more than 2q + 5.\n\nb) if the line y + 2x = p does not intersect the curve y¬≤ = x + p, find the range of values of p. \n(answer to this question is p is less than -1/24 but i can't figure the solution!) [SEP] best_answer: a) Let x+y = q -----eqn1\n       x¬≤ - 2x + 2y¬≤ = 3 -----eqn2\n\nsub x= q-y into eqn2:\n(q-y)^2 -2(q-y) + 2y^2 =3\n\nq^2 -2qy +y^2 -2q +2y +2y^2 =3\n\ncomparing the coefficients of the eqn with that of a standard quadratic eqn, ax^2 +bx +c, we have\na= 3\nb= -2q+2\nc= q^2 -2q -3\n\nAnd to check for the nature of the roots of this eqn, we need to find the determinant, b^2 -4ac.\n\n(-2q +2)^2 -4(3)(q^2 -2q -3)\n\nsolving this and you will eventually get \nq^2 -2q -5\n\nHowever, given that q^2 > 2q +5, we know that q^2 -2q -5 > 0.\n\nSince the determinant is greater than 0, it shows that there are 2 real and distinct roots of the eqn given.\n\nb) the approach is the same, but you must know that since the two curves dont intersect, we would need to find or show b^2 -4ac < 0, ie the determinant is negative.

question_title: What are BAR codes,ISBN codes,MASS code? How are they read? Are there any other code used by other agencies? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bar codes, UPC codes,  ISBNs and other such codes are like social security numbers, to distinguish different products.  No two people have the same SS number, so no two products have the same bar code. \n\nThe bars in the barcode correspond to a number- a laser run across it can read the bars and translate them into numbers. The only reason people use barcodes is because they can be read just by waving the laser in front- it's easier. Usually, you can get the same information if you know  the numbers the barcode represents, and type in the numbers.\n\nThe numbers encoded are the price the store is charging, and also lets stores keep track of how many of each product they sell. \n\nLibraries often use bar codes to keep track of which patrons have borrowed which book.\n\nThe ISBN is, in fact, not a barcode, but it is a specific number that represents that particular book all over the world. Only books that are exactly alike, (even if they are the same title. like a paperback and hardback version of the same book) have the same ISBN.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is there anyway to back out of a grant given to you by a college? [SEP] question_content: My college offered me a 1000$ grant.  I accepted but no longer wish to go to that college.  My friends said I can't back out of grants...I'm sure you can..what if there is an emergency?  Anyone know what I can do? [SEP] best_answer: Of course you can! These things are almost always non-binding. In fact, most schools will cancel your financial aid automatically when they find out you're not attending.  \n\nIf the grant is a federal grant, the process will be taken care of for you, since one of the fundamental rules of financial aid administration is that you can't disburse funding for a student who isn't attending your school.  As I said, if you told your school that you aren't coming, chances are that they already cancelled your grant.\n\nIf the grant is from the school itself, chances are that the regulations are similar.  No school wants to throw their money away on a student who doesn't go to their school, so they will check and double-check to make sure that you are a student there before they disburse your grant funds.  If you are uncertain, just give them a call to confirm this.	Education & Reference

question_title: are there any colleges that offer a surgery program in Georgia? preferbly near Augusta? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: To become a surgeon, and thus practice surgery, one must first get a four year college degree. Then, you go on to medical school, which is another four year program, followed by several years of residency before you can begin practicing as a surgeon.\n\nThus, if you're interested in becomming a surgeon, and don't yet have a college degree, that is your first step. You will want to find a college that has strong science programs, especially in chemistry and biology, although it is not necessary to major in science in order to apply to medical school.\n\nThere are many great colleges in Georgia. A good place to start your college search is: http://gacollege411.org/  There, you'll find a list of colleges in Georgia, plus information about financial aid, preparing to apply to college, and standardized tests.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about becomming a doctor and surgeon, these three sites are jam packed with information about the process of preparing for and applying to medical school:\n\nhttp://prehealth.uchicago.edu/handbook/toc.html\n\nhttp://www.amherst.edu/~sageorge/health.html\n\nhttp://hpap.syr.edu/intsites.htm\n\nIf you're already enrolled in college, I'd suggest you talk with the pre-med advisor at your college who can give you some specific suggestions regarding which medical school in Georgia might be suitable for you.\n\nGood luck!

question_title: i nid tips for saving water(URGENT)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I can tell you what we did during the water shortage in Santa Barbara a few years back.  One thing was to fill a two liter bottle of water and place it in each toilet.  that way, the 2 liters stayed in the tank, and only the remainder was washed down, same result, less water.\n\nAnother tip was to put wash basins in each sink, and capture the water to be reused until dirty, and then pour it down the toilet for the next use, instead of flush.  (This is not meant to be bathroom humour).  We switched to using disposable plates and tableware, no dishwashing, except cook pots.\n\nOf course, only do laundry when you have a full washer load.  Or better yet, take the laundry to the laundramat.  Join a health club, or YMCA, and take as many of your showers as you can at the club, instead of home.  One favorite suggestion of young people, is shower with someone, for more efficient use of water.\n\nReplace your lawn with a water efficient landscape.	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: You and a friend are looking at the stars. your friend says, "stars must always be shrinking because gravity is constantly pulling their particles together." explain what is wrong with your friends reasoning. [SEP] best_answer: Gravity is only half of the picture.\n\nThe stars gravity does tend to pull the stars material towards the center of the star.\n\nHowever, there is also an expansive force - the force of the nuclear fusion reaction that is taking place inside the start.  This reaction creates light, heat, x-rays, cosmic rays and so on.. but it also pushes against the infalling star material, trying to push it back out.\n\nThe balance between gravity and fusion energy is why the star stays (about) the same size.\n\nSometimes gravity wins, and the star compresses all the way town to a neutron star or even a black hole.\n\nSometimes the nuclear reaction wins and the star explodes in a nova or supernova.\n\nMost stars are stable for a VERY long time (billions of years).

This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid, so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food. As apples were a very common crop, teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students. As wages increased, the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit."\n\nSo I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning.	Education & Reference

Then this resin is sent to a manufacturer that will take this material and mold it. The material typically comes in pellet form or powder. The molding process will take the material and melt it in an extruder where it conveys through a screw and barrel. It can either be extruded or injection molded. Extrusion is limited to only a constant profile whereas injection molding can create more complex parts. There are however many other processes that plastics can undergo. Such as thermoforming, blown film extrusion, rotomolding, the list goes on...	Education & Reference
question_title: The nuclear fussion process is clean. So, what is meant by the term "dirty bomb"? [SEP] question_content: To wage war is not a clean thought. To clean up after ANY bomb is a devistating task.But for fussion, or fission to occur, requires the physics and math that cannot be less than exact. In the situation in th Middle East, the term "dirty bomb" is used. What would that define in differences between our enemy's bomb and the ones we dropped on Japan more than 60 years ago? [SEP] best_answer: A "dirty bomb" is one that spreads radiation through a conventional (chemical) explosion, not a nuclear one.  In a dirty bomb, a conventional explosive and fusing mechanism are surrounded by highly radioactive material of some sort.\nIt is difficult, and requires a very high degree of mechanical/electrical skill, to construct a nuclear explosive device.  A nuclear (fission) bomb uses conventional explosives fired all at the exact same time to bring together units of fissile material (usually uranium-235 or some isotope of plutonium; there are others), resulting in a "critical mass," or more correctly "prompt criticality" which results in the almost instantaneous release of large amounts of energy.  Fusion bombs (commonly known as H-bombs) use a fission reaction to create the high temperature necessary to start a fusion chain reaction.\nSo, basically, the difference between a "dirty bomb" and a true nuclear bomb is the reaction that creates the explosion.

question_title: What's the meaning of "If I tell lies-------? [SEP] question_content: What's the meaning of "if I tell lies my nose will become longer" and what's ppl stand for?\n\nthank you [SEP] best_answer: ppl stands for people.\n\nYou see, the phrase is meant to tell people not to lie.  It started off with a story of Pinocchio, a wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy.  A fairy came along and cast a spell on him; if he wanted to be a real boy, he would have to do something courageous, however, if he lied, his nose would grow longer and it would be very obvious that he lied.\n\nTherefore, in the same way, the phrase is to tell people that if they lie, it would soon be exposed and there's no good in lying, because it would only make yourself look stupid and embarrassed(imagine yourself with a long nose) in front of other people.  \n\n\nBesides, you can't take back your words.

question_title: Does anyone know any way to remember the US Presidents in order?? [SEP] question_content: I know there are a few songs, but does anyone have a long sentence that serves as an acronym or anything of that sort?? Anything will help. Thank you!! [SEP] best_answer: Try walking around your house, or some other place you know well, while you memorize them- walk in a path that you will be able to remember, and try to associate each president, in order, with some place that you know in your house.  Later, when you want to remember them in order, imagine yourself following the same path, and you'll remember the president associated with each location much more easily.\n\nThis is a common technique used by people who memorize things like a deck of cards. It is thought to work because the human brain is very good at memorizing where things are geographically located.	Education & Reference
