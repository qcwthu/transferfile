question_title: Whats the name of the horror film about big foot terrorising a familly in texas,? [SEP] question_content: It was shown on t.v. in the late 70s or early 80s. and used to scare me witless. I think it was about a big foot, at least it was a monster simmilar to a bigfoot.

It killed the familly dog and chickens. and try'd to get in to the home. I remember the end of the film, where a man -could of been a police man- standing by his car on a road and looking in to the forest/swamp he was wearing a stetson and sunglasses, there was a voice over talking about the horror that tookplace in the forrest.\ncan you help me with this? as for some reason it has been in my mind for the past few months.

question_title: Did anyone watch Nip/Tuck last night? [SEP] question_content: Who was the psychiatrist that Connor was talking to? At first I thought it was Matt because it sounded like him, but then I realized it wasn't. [SEP] best_answer: A figment of Shawn's imagination. Shawn was dreaming about what could go wrong with his relationships with his family. You can tell it is him in the way he turns out rich and successful. His ego came shining through the dream. These wher his worst dreams. Afterall, he pushed for the first hand surgery on Connor. He is afraid that Connor will blame himself for his marriage breaking up the way he blames himself for his father leaving him  and his mother when he was a child. The analyst may be Shawn or may be an analyst Shawn has seen to deal with his problems in the past. My guess is it will cause him to go see Christian's analyst Brooke.	Entertainment & Music

The movie is directed by Bryan Springer who did the first two X-Men movies.  He did not direct the latest and third X-Men film because he was busy with Superman.  Two of his screenwriters from the first two X-Men films wrote the script for the new Superman.  I think that is why X-Men 3 is not as good the first 2 films, because the behind-the-scenes talent left to work on Superman.  So that means that Superman Returns should be one really, really good movie.  I also just learned that there MIGHT be a teaser trailer for next summer's Spider-Man 3 movie played before Superman Returns; if this is true, then going to see Superman will be a great experience for a lot of people.

question_title: help do what is worng? [SEP] question_content: yesterday a car hit the back tire of my bike and i flew off as i was falling my shoulder popped out and than back in real fast. It is really sore but not like pain where i need to cry. My hand is tinglin and is sore too what happend? The doc x rayed and said it is back in place and he said i have rotary cup damage what does that mean? He said i may need surgery why is that? I am supposed to check the circulation in my hand every one in awhile by checking my finger nails why do i have to do that? Do i have to wear the colar and cuff that he gave me? \nIt just mainly hurt whn u move it forward to the side is ok [SEP] best_answer: OK...you have a fresh injury an you're going to feel the consequences of that with sore muscles and pulled ligaments.  the Rotator cuff is what keeps your arm in it's socket and helps it move around, similar to your knee joint.  If you have an injury, on the inside of the joint, you may need surgery.  Checking the circulation by pressing the fingernails indicates if the blood in your injured arm is circulating.  If your fingernails are a blue or black color, then the oxygen in the blood is not circulating properly and you should report this condition asap to your doctor.  Wear the collar and cuff for a few days and mend before you start to worry about the surgery and getting back to normal activities.  Your body uses rest to heal.  So...rest.  Then call your doctor with any other questions.  \n\nGlad you weren't seriously injured.	Health
question_title: Should i get a medicine ball or a toning tube for working out? [SEP] question_content: I bike quite often, but i'd like to help exercise various parts of my body. I'm thinking of getting a medicine ball (or a fitness ball/stability ball). I'm also thinking of getting a toning tube set. What do you think would be best? [SEP] best_answer: I would get the toning tubes first.  The resistance bands are good for working out all parts of your body and you can do many exercises with them.  Next, I'd get the stability ball.  You can use that in combination with the toning tubes and do even more exercises.  A medicine ball is different than a stability ball.  The stability ball is the big inflatable ball that you sit or balance on.  A medicine ball is a smaller weighted ball.  It is good for doing weighted crunches and other weighted ab/core exercises.  I'd get that last just because it has the least uses of the 3.	Health

question_title: Looking for place that makes good, well fitting dentures,Sierra Vista, AZ area & not TOO expensive.? [SEP] question_content: Spent $13,000 in 2001 trying to save genetically bad tooth structure. Now the gold lined crowns are breaking off at the gum line. I am younger than most who need dentures and have been putting this off till I just cant anymore. Doctor says I will get infections in my blood and possibly even my heart because of the teeth that have broken off so far. BUT I AM SO SCARED AT HOW I WILL LOOK!!!! AND I NEED TO HAVE 22 TEETH EXTRACTED FIRST!!! I can go to Tucson, AZ (110 miles away) if I have to to get dentures that will look and fit well and not cost me an arm and a leg. (Financially, not in the position to pay a lot anymore.)  Anyone with any ideas out there??? Please!!!! [SEP] best_answer: I'd say go to Tuscon and have a dentist check it out. Better to have it done now then wait. In phoenix the upper denture cost about $1500.00 and lower partial about $700.----$1200. depending on if you want metal or what they call a "soft partial" made of acrillic. Then too, you can go to Nogales for about half that price or less. I hear they do just as good of work as here. Just have to find the right dentist. Good luck	Health
question_title: Is my belly button piercing normal? [SEP] question_content: I got my belly button pierced last week and it's still kinda sore at the top. The area surrounding the top part of the ring is darkening somewhat. Is this normal also? Will the darkness go away or should I start using fade cream? [SEP] best_answer: it will be sore for a few weeks yet or even months, it all depends on your body and how long it takes to heal. the darkened area will prob just be bruising from the piercing. When i had mine done this all happened and had gunk all round it for a while. Get some salt water in an egg cup and soak it for a few mins every day. this will help the healing process.if it starts bleeding or starts worrying you go o the doctors or the place where you got it done just to be sure.x	Health
question_title: Medical test - Calcium vs Corrected Calcium level? [SEP] question_content: What is the difference between Calcium and Corrected Calcium stated in medical test?\nWhat does it means? [SEP] best_answer: albumin binds calcium to a large extent, patients with abnomal albumin content will have abnormal calcium levels for this reason.\n\nThe only (never say only in medicine) active calcium in your body is NOT protein bound.  So what really matters is the ionized version.  Simple formulas based on the ratios of albumin/calcium binding help to estimate the physiologic calcium level.\n\nIonized calcium can be tested for directly, and corrected levels are simply a guess.

question_title: is wearing of bra and panty healthy for ladies above  45 after menopause?

question_title: I really can't stand myself...? [SEP] question_content: If I knew somebody who was exactly like me, I would completely hate them. I don't understand how I have any friends. I'm often sarcastic and I hold up my feelings until I have to let them out, so when I do everybody gets sick of me complaining for a while about whatever has been bothering me. I'm also really shy, so it's hard for me to appear friendly to anybody. I can also tell that people are getting tired of my complaining about how I hate my physical appearance. I know I'm not fat, but instead of focusing on how I'm fortunate to be the weight I am, I only think about how much thinner I can be. I don't like anything about myself, really... I don't know what to do. How can I improve myself and my view of myself? [SEP] best_answer: You have just described 95 percent of the women in America.  Everyone has feelings like this.  The media helps make us sarcastic, feel like we don't have things good enough, and are nowhere near thin or pretty enough.  Maybe watching less TV would improve your outlook - it did for me.  \n\nObviously your friends see things that they like in you.  You can always ask them what they like about you. Try to do activities with them when you're together, like sports, playing games, etc., instead of just "hanging out" and talking, so you'll be more likely to be active and have new things to talk about, and less likely to ruminate and complain.\n\nJust a couple suggestions.  But don't think you have some serious disorder or anything - you sound perfectly normal to me.	Health

question_title: can anyone tell me about aortic stenosis in children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a condition where the last valve going out of the heart is not opening wide enough as the blood is being pumped out of the ventricle (the largest chamber of the heart).  AS can be a rather serious condition and if symptomatic, usually manifests in shortness of breath, lack of tolerance to exercise, and chest pain.  It may have no symptoms for many years other than a harsh mumur heard by stethoscope.  \n\nI have known cases where mild or moderate stenosis is monitored for sometime until it progresses to severe and/or becomes symptomatic.  This sometimes takes 20 years or more in an adult.  Regular monitoring via echocardiogram should be done serially (maybe once a year until there's evidence of decline then every 3 months) to gauge the condition's progress.  There is a point where the condition made be stable for some time.  Once it gets critical its time to fix it.  \n\nTo fix the problem an open heart procedure and new valve needs to be implanted.  This is a big surgery and should not be done unless absolutely indicated.  \n\nTwo types of valves exist.  Tissue valves and mechanical valves.  The tissue valves have shorter lives but do not require chronic anticoagulation medication.  Mechanical valves last for a long time and do not wear out but DO require oral anticoagulation medication.  \n\nThere are special issues with children considering the fact that their heart is going to grow and therefore require a different size valve as the heart grows.  I have not direct experience with valve replacement with children but I would imagine you want to delay the surgery for as long as possible until his/her heart is close to adult size if possible (eliminating the need to go in multiple times to replace the valve as it becomes too small).  \n\nYour goals would need to be balanced between watching for symptoms, reducing the need for multiple surgeries, and managing the condition once the surgery has been done with the need for anticoagulation medication or not.

question_title: whats the best way to shave my pubic area? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Snip a few first!Cut the hair down with scissors or clippers to about a quarter of an inch. If this is the first time you've shaved, or the first time in a long while and you are dealing with full growth again, you can do this a few days before you actually start shaving to get used to it. If you've never shaved your pubic hair before, then your skin has been covered by that hair for a very long time. The sensation of clothes and so on rubbing against it is going to be weird at first. \n\nThe first time you shave your pubic area, you may want to shave only a bit, then come back and do more later. This is sensitive skin we're dealing with here. Also, don't shave very often at first. Once a week for the first month is probably best, so your skin can get used to it. \n\nDon't worry about getting an extremely close shave the first few times; you'll get a closer one as you become more adept. \n\nIf you're female, your pubic area may become more sensitive during your period. \n\nSome people like to leave a patch of pubic hair above their penis or over the mons veneris. It may sound ridiculous, but an electric beard and moustache trimmer is perfect for keeping the patch neat. It's an extremely easy way to keep that patch short, even, and neat. In fact, if you want to keep all your pubic hair trimmed but not shaven, the trimmer can be used on the entire area. \n\nWhile shaving, sit (or lie if someone else is doing the shaving) with your legs far apart. This helps keep the skin taut and lessens the chance of the blade snagging a fold of skin. \n\nIf you have teeny little nicks or blood spots, there are a couple reasons why this might be happening. The most common reason is you're going to fast. Either you're shaving too quickly, or you're not allowing enough prep time. Remember: \nSoak the area for at least three minutes in warm water. If you're not going to take a shower or bath, lay a warm wet washcloth over the area for a while first. \nApply shaving gel and let it sit for at least four minutes. \nTake your time shaving. \nLittle blood spots are often the result of shaving over tiny bumps that are naturally there. Soaking and leaving the gel on helps make these bumps softer and smaller so that they're less likely to get nicked. The bumps also may be a result of irritation from a past shave. If this is the case, stop and wait a while before the next shave. \n\nWhen you first start shaving, or if irritation or itchiness is a problem, wear loose underwear and clothing. \n\nAlways remember to keep clean. Your genital hair helped protect from dirt, bacteria, friction and so on, so it's important to take care of yourself. Use soap and water on your outside bits -- your inside parts will keep themselves clean naturally.	Health
question_title: trichmoniasis treatment for a male is what? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How is trichomoniasis treated? \nTrichomoniasis can usually be cured with the prescription drug, metronidazole (also called Flagyl), or with a related drug, tinidazole. Topical medicines, or medicines applied to the skin, may be used in people who are allergic to metronidazole and tinidazole. The topical medicines are less effective and may not cure you. They might, however, ease the symptoms. \n\nAll women and men diagnosed with trichomoniasis should be treated. Even without symptoms, it can be passed to others. Having trichomoniasis also increases a person’s chances of getting HIV. People being treated for trichomoniasis should avoid sex until they and their sex partners complete treatment and have no symptoms. Having trichomoniasis once does not protect a person from getting it again.\n\nBetter if consult and have examination by physician. these drugs are not over the counter.	Health
question_title: Adult ADD + Questions? [SEP] question_content: I was wondering if Adult Attention Deficit Disorder is common these days. I have been on and through so many antidepressants and mood stabilers in the past 6 years it's unreal. And if that's not enough, Bi-Polar meds, sleep meds, almost xanax. Nothing has ever come close to me feeling liike one of you regular souls who have the drive to do what you do. I am only 18, and do not have a doctorates degree yet, but I can tel you one thing; all the SSRI's and MAOI's and MOI's and SSNRI's and SNRI's are NOT going to work on me. I believe I have ADD - but only because i took a test on the internet and identified all of my symptoms in a clear voice. What should I say to my doctor? It's only a pediatrition but he gave me paxil once, and that ended me up in the hospital\ni will never ever do that again.\nWhat do you think the chances of him giving me adderol? or any other popular ADD drug without going through another one of those stinking evaluations that takes months to even see a psychiatrist? [SEP] best_answer: Howdy ADD; By your writing I can empathize with your frustration; however, frustration may be a result of an emotional allergic reflex by your understanding and sensing of your inner self which may be harmful to your future emotional welfare.\nAntidepressants do work on many people especially those that suffer anxiety disorders.\nMood Stabilizers (Paxil, Prozac,etc.) also tend to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with ADD.\nI can feel for you if you had an adverse reaction this far into your treatment with psychothropic medicants.\nAt this time and in my limited psyche can only offer a comforting suggestion and that is that you may be a 'hyper-allergic' person.\nHave you had any physical allergy tests to date?\nIt is my opinion that an allergic reaction in the atmosphere may irritate the mind into a distracted state that will make short-term mamory stagnant in neural flow and therefore long-term memory retention impossible.\nRetake your psychological tests again and ask the Psychologist to place the results of both tests side by side for your personal assessment.\nIt is normal to forget the answers that you have provided in the previous test, but it you reapproach this process with a hopeful attitude I am sure that you will be that much closer to your emotional betterment.

question_title: How do I help an Alcoholic that doesn't think he has a problem and his family that doesnt want to addess it. [SEP] question_content: The guy has a bad problem with booze, however the family is too blind to see that he has a problem.  He doesnt think he has a problem, and will not go to AA.  His wife considers herself a smart person but instead keeps buying beer for him so he will not be mad.  What to do? [SEP] best_answer: As a 3 year member of Alcoholics Anonymous I'm gonna try to answer this.  Unfortunately as someone else responded to your question I agree that most likely and sadly you can't do much to help him if he doesn't want help.  As we say in AA, AA is not for those who need it but for those who want it.  As for his family you might try honestly, humbly, and lovingly letting his family know how concerned you are and that you don't know what to do.  I don't know if you have any spiritual beliefs but you might try praying for the man, I will.  James S. -Alcoholic Anonymous	Health

question_title: how do i get my girlfriend an orgasm, without her faking, a real trick that works please!? [SEP] question_content: whether its oral or regualr intercourse someone let me know [SEP] best_answer: First, get her very, very turned on. Whether orally or otherwise, the more she is excited and the higher her peak of excitement before intercourse, the greater likelihood she will have an orgasm. So don't skimp on foreplay. Being in a hurry here will get you nowhere in the end.\n\nAssuming you've done the above and you both want to assure that she has an excellent orgasm, teach her this little trick (I just hope you're old enough and mature enough to be learning all this). Regardless of the position you use, tell her that you want to touch herself, masturbate, while you are in her. Most women don't get stimulated where they need to be from most forms of male intercourse. The clitoris has to be given friction in some way for orgasm. If she manipulates herself and you do what you can, she will likely have the best orgasm she's every known.\n\nUnfortunately many men don't like to think that they can't make a woman orgasm just by themselves. Sometimes they can, but the way I describe above is almost guaranteed. Some women are too modest or are not used to self-manipulation, and they need to be assured that you want them to do this and will not think less of them for it.\n\nEnjoy. Please practice safe sex.

question_title: What is the prevalence of experiencing a miscarriage with NO SYMPTOMS? (no bleeding, cramping)? [SEP] question_content: I am 29 and I had one miscarriage 10 years ago as a teen.  I've been obsessing and worrying about miscarrying now.  Today, I am 9 weeks pregnant.  I have no symptoms (no morning sickness, no food aversions or cravings, no sensitivity to smell).  We heard a heartbeat at 5 weeks and 6 days, but I keep reading these stories of women who miscarry at about 8 to 10 weeks without even realizing it until their sonogram.  I have been tired lately and my breasts were very tender 2 weeks ago, but they feel fine now.  Thank you for your help. [SEP] best_answer: First calm down. I understand why you are concerned. Losing a baby is very tragic. But just because it happened 10 years ago doesn't mean it is going to happen now. The symptoms you have described for yourself are normal. I didn't have sickness, cravings, sensitivity to smell with my pregnancy either. Count this as a blessing! Being tired and on/off breast tenderness is normal. Try reading "What to expect when expecting" "Girlfriends guide to pregnancy" etc... Stop obsessing about losing this baby and start enjoying him/her. I truly understand the concerns. Make an appt. with your doctor to help ease your mind. As far as having a miscarriage WITH OUT ANY symptoms I don't know about. That is a question for the professionals.	Health

question_title: For deaf people? [SEP] question_content: I am currectly half deaf (completely deaf out of my right ear). it's not that bad, but i would like my other ear back, as it was. I recently heard of an operation that installs an artifical ear drum (requires the nerve ending in the ear to be still intact). but this system requries a wire coming out behind the ear and to a power source on your belt. so here's my question. dooes anyone know of any alternitive? do you know someone who has it? how is it working for them? thanks [SEP] best_answer: Well, I am in the same boat as you.  I am also completely deaf in my right ear.  I have been like this since I was about 2 years old.  I do use a digital hearing aid. I was fortunate to have one of the best doctors in this area before he retired last year.  Years ago, I told they were doing research on the birds because the little hair behind their ear drum or the nerve endings themselves could regenerate.  I am not sure as to what their progress was because it has been so long.  As far as alternatives, implants aren't the best if you still have partial hearing because you will be hearing two different sound types.  One would be true sound that you hear out the good ear and the other would be a synthesized sound like you would hear a robot talking.  So it would be just best to wait until they come out with something better than Coclier(misspelled) implants.  If you need anything else let me know.	Health

question_title: It is so easy not to start smoking or drinking, so why do so many people do it? [SEP] question_content: I personally believe that it is too easy NOT to begin smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol (and not to mention abusing drugs).  Sure, there is peer pressure and people become stressed.  But each individual is fully capable of managing stress without resorting to such unhealthy habits.   We were made to be able to cope naturally.  Smoking and drinking are simply too dangerous for excuses.  I'm stressed out all the time; in fact, I get stressed out at the drop of a hat.  But I have no desire or need to do these things, even if they are readily available.  They are obviously extremely addictive and put users at much higher risk for cancer and other diseases.  And how many people kill themselves and others while driving drunk?  I would also like to know why exactly 18 year-olds (and younger) consider themselves old enough to drink.  They're not, I'm not.  It's illegal, simple as that.  We underestimate the dangers of these habits.  My main point is:  it's just too easy to avoid them. [SEP] best_answer: It's easy to start, hard to stop, and some people think its cool so they do it to try and impress them to be cool too. So, its generally peer pressure that starts it and then that person finds out the benefits and ignores the long term damages, and keeps doing alcohol or drugs or whichever, until they are so addicted its almost impossible to stop before they die. Thats why when they go through a serious condition (heart attack) and are hospitilized, then told they have to stop its much more likely that they will rather than stopping on their own.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: Post-micturition convulsion syndrome, which often affects men, occurs toward the end of the urination session and isn't completely understood. Most speculation rather than scientific conclusions have been made regarding the cause(s). It is predominately believed that the shiver is a side effect of interactions between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN). The SNS, in this case is responsible for holding the flow of urine, and the PNS is responsible for releasing urine. Although they are far more common amongst men, women also experience these convulsions	Health

Does the year expiration date mean anything? I assumed they would just loose potancy if anything. Any ideas? Its a brand new unopened perscription. [SEP] best_answer: Technically you shouldn't - they say medicines can alter over time, some lose potency - some get stronger, some go bad.  However, it depends on the condition - I for instance had a urinary tract infection and used left over antibiotics to help  get rid of it.  People do it - but as an EMT - I should be telling you not to.	Health
question_title: On average, how long does it take after acl reconstruction surgery to be able to bend your knee all the way? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The previous answer is not correct. Depending on the type of graft that you choose, you may never fully gain your ROM (range of motion) back. Most doctors will tell you that if you can gain 120 degrees or better, then be happy with that. I was fortunate enough to gain 135. My normal ROM on my other knee was 137. It took me 3 months to gain this back. There are two obstacles that hold you back from bending your knee as far as you want. The first one is the PAIN!!! You body will tell you when it is ready to try a little further. While I was in surgery, my doctor bent my knee all the way back just to make sure that the graft would hold. You don't want him or her to do this while you are awake trust me. The second obstacle that doesn't allow you to bend your knee all the way back is the swelling. Your knee will have swellign in it from anywhere to 6 months up to a couple of years. The swelling limits the range of motion more than the pain itself. When you get the 70 or 80 degree range, you will notice a "tight" feeling in your knee. That is the swelling. \n   Overall, it depends on how much you do your excercises. The best excercise (also the most painful) is the heel-slide. thats where you lay on your back and attempt to bend your knee with your heel staying in constant contact with the floor or mat. Like I said, it hurts worse than any other excercise but it is the most productive.\n\n Good luck.	Health

question_title: How much does a college professor get paid, and how? [SEP] question_content: Does it depend on the # of students that are registered in their class?

A full professor in the field of business in a city might make as much as 250,000.\n\nThe average is about 35,000 to start, 52,000 mid-career, and topping out at about 80,000.	Education & Reference

Everything sucks. So she goes to see Friar Lawrence, who gives her the potion which will make her appear dead.\n\nUnfortunately, Romeo does not receive the Friar's message that Juliet is just faking her death. He thinks she has really died. He goes to her tomb and quaffs the poison. When Juliet wakes up, she finds Romeo dead. Despite Friar Lawrence's protest, she refuses to leave and stabs herself with the dagger.\n\nThe play is a tragedy because it has an unhappy ending and because the heroes (Romeo and Juliet) are brought down by their fatal flaws (their immaturity and impatience).

question_title: A car dealership sold me a used car that they misrepresented as new. What should I do. Should I sue?"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Was the car used...or did it have mileage on it from being a "demo" or a "loaner".  You might want to double check to make sure that the car has an MSO "Manufacturer's Statement of Orgin" .  That is the "title" you get from the manufacture.  When you take ownership, after that, you and everyone else that owns the car would get a true title.  If you received an MSO instead of a title the car would still be considered new.  If it had miles on it they might have used it for a demo (owner or manager or even salespeople get to drive the car since they work there)  or they could have some type of event that allowed them to let someone borrow the car for a while.  Oldsmobile used to let officials from the college world series drive new olds while the series was going on.

Who ever started them should be shot.\n\nI know that there are many here that English is a second language so the use of improper grammar and spelling is understandable. But when a native English speaker does it, to me it just makes them sound illiterate and stupid.\n\nSorry for venting but does anyone else feel this way? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, I agree.

question_title: if a dice is thrown ten times in how many ways is it possible to have 1,2,3 in the outcome? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Assuming that the 1, 2 and 3 are supposed to be consecutive:\n\nFirstly, for three throws of the die, the probability of throwing 1, 2 and 3 in order is (1/6)^3 = 1/216\n\nIf you throw the die 10 times then there are 8 independent chances of throwing 1, 2, 3. That's because if you have not thrown 1, 2, 3 by the time you get to the 9th throw, you cannot do it because you only have two throws left. \n\nTherefore the chance of throwing 1, 2, 3 with 10 throws of a die are (10 - 2) * (1/216) = 8/216 which is equivalent to 1/27.\n\nIf you prefer to express that as a decimal (not recommended!) then the answer is 0.0370 to 3 s f	Education & Reference

question_title: Use the limit process to find the area between the graph of f(x)=x² and the x-axis over the interval on the x- [SEP] question_content: Use the limit process to find the area between the graph of f(x)=x² and the x-axis over the interval on the x-axis [1,2] [SEP] best_answer: Let's break the area into many vertical rectangular strips between x=1 and x=2, each strip so narrow that we can assume that the top of the strip is horizontal. Thus each strip will be a very narrow and tall rectangle.\n\nLet's say the number of vertical strips we use is n. The first strip will have its left-hand side at x = 1, the next will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + 1/n, the third will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + 2/n, and in general the kth strip will have its left-hand side at x = 1 + (k-1)/n.\n\nNow, what is the y value at each of these x points? Using f(x)=x² we get, for the kth point,\n\ny = (1 + (k-1)/n)² = 1 + 2(k-1)/n + ((k-1)/n)² \n\nNow the area of each strip is equal to its base times its height. The base of each strip is 1/n. So the area of the kth strip is\n\nA = 1/n * (1 + 2(k-1)/n + ((k-1)/n)²)\n\nNow we have to add the areas of all these strips from k = 1 to k = n and rearrange the terms.\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ (1/n + 2(k-1)/n² + (k-1)²/n^3)\n.....k=1   \n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ (1/n + (2k - 2)/n² + (k² - 2k + 1)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\nGiving all fractions the common denominator of n^3,\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ ((n² + 2kn - 2n + k² - 2k + 1)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\n.....k=n\nA = Σ ((n² - 2n + 1)/n^3  + (2kn + k² - 2k)/n^3)\n.....k=1\n\nThe first term in the summation sign appears n times in the sum, so we can take it out by multiplying it by n. \n\nSum going from k=1 to k=n:\nA =  (n² - 2n + 1)/n² + Σ (2kn + k² - 2k)/n^3\n\nNow let's clear the parentheses in the summation:\n\nSum going from k=1 to k=n:\nA =  (n² - 2n + 1)/n² + Σ 2k/n² + Σ k²/n^3 - Σ 2k/n^3)\n\nThe first summation contains k=1, 2, 3, ... n, so we use the formula for the sum of the arithmetic series:\n\nS = n(n+1)/2\n\nso the first summation becomes\n\nn(n+1)/n² = (n² + n)/n² = 1 + 1/n\n\nThe last summation also contains k=1, 2, 3, ... n, so we use the same formula for the sum of a series, and we get\n\nn(n+1)/n^3 = (n² + n)/n^3 = 1/n + 1/n²\n\nFor the middle summation, we have to compute the sum of k² for k=1, 2, 3, ... n, or that is the sum of 1, 4, 9, 16, ... n².\n\nThe site\n\nhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSum.html\n\ngives the formula for the sum of the squares of a series as\n\nS = (2n^3 + 3n² + n)/6\n\nso the middle summation becomes\n\n1/3 + 1/2n + 1/6n²\n\nNow, we are almost done.\n\nLet's let the number of strips get very large, go to infinity as a limit. Let's see what each term becomes:\n\n(n² - 2n + 1)/n² becomes 1 as n gets very large,\n1 + 1/n becomes 1 as n gets very large,\n1/n + 1/n² becomes 0 as n gets very large, and\n1/3 + 1/2n + 1/6n² becomes 1/3 as n gets very large.\n\nThe area under the curve is 1 + 1 + 1/3, or 7/3.\n\nYou can see why integral calculus was invented. Using integral calculus, this problem can be solved in two steps. The integral of f(x)=x² is x^3/3. Inserting the limits of x=1 and x=2 gives\n\nA = 2^3/3 - 1^3/3 = 7/3	Education & Reference

question_title: history of tal frauenberg castle? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Perhaps this helps...\n\nIn the Altmuehl Valley  there are many castles, and quite a number of them exceed Prunn as to extent, value of equipment or age. Nevertheless, the comparatively small castle of Prunn is one of the best-known castles of Bavaria owing to its unique site and the harmonious combination of natural scenery and architectural performance.\nA document of A.D. 1037 mentions the name of the owner of the castle: Wernher of Prunn. One hundred years later the castle belonged to the family of the barons of Laaber and Breitenbrunn . At that time the oldest preserved parts of the castle were built, above all the mighty tower.\nIn 1338 the knights of Frauenberg bought the castle, and this family retained ownership until 1567. Their heraldic figure is the white horse which was painted on the outer wall of the castle. The most famous member of the family was Jack the Joyous, an experienced warrior whose marble gravestone is in the parish church of Prunn. An heirloom of his was an ornamented manuscript of the Nibelungenlied, the famous medieval German epic. It has been called the "Prunn Godex" and is now a unique specimen in the National Library of Bavaria.\nIn the 16th century the ducal councillor von Koekh remodelled parts of the castle. Two centuries later the Jesuits added rococo ornament to a number of rooms and to the chapel. Since 1822 the castle has been state property.\n\n-or-\n\nFrombork (German: Frauenburg (pronunciation (help·info))) is a town in northern Poland, on the Vistula Lagoon in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodship, in Braniewo County, with a population of 2,528 in 2005.\n\nThe former residence of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, the town and its 700-year old cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war Frombork was meticulously reconstructed and is a popular tourist attraction again.\n\nThe town was founded as a defensive stronghold on an Old Prussian site. In 1224 at Catania Emperor Frederick II declared Prussia as directly subordinate to the church and the empire only and later in 1224 the pope assigned bishop William of Modena as papal legate to Prussia. According to local legend, its inhabitants were baptised by Anselm of Meißen, a priest of the Teutonic Order and the first Bishop of the Bishopric of Warmia which was created in 1242 by William of Modena after the area was conquered by Teutonic Knights, who had received possession of Prussia by the imperial Golden Bull of Rimini.\n\nSupposedly when the stronghold's lord died, his widow Gertruda offered the settlement to the bishop, and in her honor it was named Frauenburg ("woman's or women's castle" in German). This name is not unique in German, but it usually originates in the construction of a fortified chapel, church, or monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary or inhabited by nuns. Several places were thus named Marienburg, like the nearby castle and city (now Malbork).	Education & Reference

question_title: Who was the world's greatest mass murderer? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A couple of other respondents were right.  Hitler killed 11 million people, including 6 million Jews.  \n\nStalin was by far worse:\n\nJoseph Stalin (1879 - 1953)\n\nOne of the most powerful and murderous dictators in human history, Stalin was the supreme ruler of the Soviet Union for a quarter of a century. His regime of terror caused the death and suffering of tens of millions of his subjects, but he was also in charge of the war machine that played a significant role in the defeat of Hitler's armies during World War II.\n\nA Georgian by birth, Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili grew up in modest circumstances and only learned Russian at school. He studied at a theological seminary but never graduated, instead embarking on a life as a professional revolutionary. This included robbing banks to fill the Bolshevik party chest and spending years in Siberian exile.\n\nStalin was not one of the decisive players in the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, but he soon rose in the ranks. In 1922 he was made General Secretary of the Communist Party, a post which was not considered particularly significant at the time but nevertheless became the base from which he launched his bid for supreme power.\n\nAfter Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin promoted himself as his political heir and gradually outmanoeuvred rivals. Unlike Trotsky, Stalin believed that socialism could be introduced in one country without being accompanied by a world revolution. By the late 1920s, Stalin was effectively the dictator of the Soviet Union.\n\nHis forced collectivisation of agriculture cost million of lives, while his industrialisation programme made his country militarily strong but provided little material welfare for its citizens. Moreover, the population suffered immensely during the Great Terror of the 1930s, during which Stalin and his henchmen purged the Party of 'enemies of the people' and sent millions to the Gulag system of slave labour camps.\n\nThe purges severely depleted the Red Army officer corps, and despite many warnings, Stalin was ill prepared for Hitler's massive attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941. His political future hung in the balance, but he recovered to lead his country to victory. As usual with Stalin, the human cost was enormous, but that mattered little to him. His general disregard for human lives included his own family - his eldest son perished in German captivity, his second wife committed suicide, and many in-laws were caught up in the terror.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Union entered the nuclear age and ruled over an empire which included most of Eastern Europe. Increasingly paranoid, Stalin himself became a victim of the fear he had induced in his subjects. Having suffered a stroke at night, he lay helpless on his floor for many hours, because no one dared disturb him. He died on 5 March 1953.\n\nA large part of the Soviet population reacted to his death with hysterical grief, but soon his former comrades-in-arms denounced his policies of terror and persecution. Today, Stalinism is a symbol of totalitarian rule and limitless personal power. His birth home in Gori forms part of the Stalin Museum, a bizarre and somewhat eerie Soviet monument to one of history's most bloodthirsty tyrants.	Education & Reference

question_title: Can someone help me answer the following questions? [SEP] question_content: Summarize the six components of The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975.  Can anyone help me identify the six componets I can't seem to find them anywhere. [SEP] best_answer: The following six main principles of IDEA embody the underlying spirit and intent of IDEA and provide the framework around which special education services are designed and provided to students with disabilities:\n\nFree Appropriate Public Education — IDEA guarantees that each child with a disability, eligible for special education, will be entitled to a free appropriate public education (FAPE).\n\nFree requires that the education of each child with a disability must be provided at public expense and at no cost to the child’s parents. The only exception is that incidental fees normally charged to non-disabled students or their parents as part of the regular education program may also be charged to students with disabilities and their parents.\n\nAppropriate means that each child with a disability is entitled to an education that is “appropriate” for his or her needs. “Appropriate education” is determined on an individual basis and may not be the same for each child with a disability.\n\nPublic refers to the public school system. Children with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of their disabilities, have the same right to attend the public schools as their non-disabled peers. The public school system must educate students with disabilities, respond to their individual needs, and help them plan for their future.\n\nEducation - IDEA is an education act that guarantees that eligible children with disabilities will receive a public education that includes special education and related services as directed by the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP), based on the child's individual needs. \n\nAppropriate Evaluation — IDEA requires that each child suspected of having a disability receive an appropriate evaluation: \nIn all areas of suspected disability. \nBy a team of evaluators knowledgeable and trained in the use of the tests and other evaluation materials they use. \nEmploying a variety of sound evaluation materials and procedures selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory. \nWithout subjecting a child to unnecessary tests and assessments. \nIncluding the gathering of relevant information from a variety of sources. \nBased on information that is useful instructionally in planning for the child’s education. \nAn appropriate evaluation provides information to be used to determine the child’s eligibility for special education and related services and the educational needs of the child. \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP) — In order to ensure that students with disabilities receive an appropriate and individualized education, IDEA requires that, after drawing upon current evaluation information, the IEP team develop a written document, the IEP, designed to meet the unique educational needs of each student with disabilities. IDEA contains clear language about: \nThe information which the IEP must contain. \nWho develops the IEP. \nThe public agency’s obligation to provide the special education and related services identified in the IEP. \nLeast Restrictive Environment (LRE) — IDEA guarantees that a child with a disability will receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment (LRE) appropriate. This principle reflects IDEA’s strong preference for educating students with disabilities in general education classes with the access to general education curriculum. Placement in the general education classroom is the first placement option the IEP team must consider.\n\nWhen considering placement in the general education classroom, the team is required to explore the range of modifications and supplementary aids and services that are needed to ensure that the student can receive a satisfactory education in the general education classroom. If the IEP team determines that the student can be appropriately educated in the general education classroom using modifications/supplementary aids and services, this is the L	Education & Reference

question_title: why is Ralph Ellison considered a part of southern literature ? [SEP] question_content: need  quick responses [SEP] best_answer: RALPH ELLISON\n\nIn 1936, a few weeks after my arrival in New York City, I was lucky enough to be invited by an old hero and newfound friend, Langston Hughes, to be his guest at what would be my introduction to Broadway theater. I was so delighted and grateful for the invitation that I failed to ask my host the title of the play, and it was not until we arrived at the theater that I learned that it would be Jack Kirkland's dramatization of Erskine Caldwell's famous novel Tobacco Road. No less successful than in its original form, the play was well on its way to a record-breaking seven-and-a-half-year run, and that alone was enough to increase my expectations. And so much so that I failed to note the irony of circumstance that would have as my introduction to New York theater a play with a southern setting and characters that were based upon a type and class of whites whom I had spent the last three years trying to avoid. Had I been more alert, it might have occurred to me that somehow a group of white Alabama farm folk had learned of my presence in New York, thrown together a theatrical troupe, and flown north to haunt me. But being dazzled by the lights, the theatrical atmosphere, the babble of the playgoing crowd, it didn't. And yet that irony arose precisely from the mixture of motives__ practical, educational, and romantic__ that had brought me to the North in the first place.\n\nAmong these was my desire to enjoy a summer free of the South and its problems while meeting the challenge of being on my own for the first time in a great northern city. Fresh out of Alabama, with my junior year at Tuskegee Institute behind me, I was also in New York seeking funds with which to complete my final year as a music major__ a goal at which I was having less success than I had hoped. However, there had been compensations. For between working in the Harlem YMCA cafeteria as a substitute for vacationing waiters and countermen and searching for a more profitable job, I had used my free time exploring the city, making new acquaintances, and enjoying the many forms of social freedom that were unavailable to me in Alabama. The very idea of being in New York was dreamlike, for like many young Negroes of the time, I thought of it as the freest of American cities and considered Harlem as the site and symbol of Afro-American progress and hope. Indeed, I was both young and bookish enough to think of Manhattan as my substitute for Paris and of Harlem as a place of Left Bank excitement.\n\nAnd yet I soon discovered, much to my chagrin, that while I was physically out of the South, I was restrained__ sometimes consciously, sometimes not__ by certain internalized thou-shalt-nots that had structured my public conduct in Alabama. It was as though I had come to the Eden of American culture and found myself indecisive as to which of its fruits were free for my picking. Beyond the borders of Harlem's briar patch__ which seemed familiar because of my racial and cultural identification with the majority of its people and the lingering spell that had been cast nationwide by the music, dance, and literature of the so-called Harlem Renaissance__ I viewed New Yorkers through the overlay of my Alabama experience. Contrasting the whites I encountered with those I had observed in the South, I weighed class against class and compared southern styles with their northern counterparts. I listened to diction and noted dress, and searched for attitudes in inflections, carriage, and manners. And in pursuing this aspect of my extracurricular education, I explored the landscape.\n\nI crossed Manhattan back and forth from river to river and up, down, and around again, from Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Battery, looking and listening and gadding about; rode streetcar and el, subway and bus; took a hint from Edna Millay and spent an evening riding back and forth on the Staten Island Ferry. From the elevated trains I saw my first penthouses with green trees growi	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: Does anyone know where I can download a software that helps in cutting a part of a song I like (so that I would transfer this part to my cellular phone?) \n\nThanks a lot! [SEP] best_answer: You can check out Mixxer (used to be 3GUpload)\n\nhttp://www.mixxer.com/\n\nYou have to subscribe, but it was relatively cheap. You can use their own ring-tones. The midis are usually free, but you pay extra for the real tones.\n\nWhat is most helpful is the "upload personal files" in the "my locker" section of the "my mixxer" menu. It allows you to select a file from your computer, pick what segment you want to use as your ring-tone and store it in your locker. Then you access their website from your phone to transfer it. \n\nYou need to listen to the file first in some kind of program like Windows media player, or another one of your choice so that you can find out what minute/second marker you want to start your ring-tone at, and where you want to stop it. \n\nI have used it successfully a couple of times with MP3's. \n\nIf you don't need a way to get the files to your phone, you may just need a simple editor. If you already have a CD burner on your computer (Roxio Easy CD and DVD Creator came with mine) you might be surprised at all of the different functions it has. Or there are a lot of different shareware and freeware programs that you can download. \n\nCheck out: \nhttp://www.download.com/MP3-Sound-Cutter/3000-2169_4-10242376.html?tag=lst-4-5\n\nThere are tons of others.\n\nHope that helps!

question_title: I need a smart computer nerd that knows php well.? [SEP] question_content: I have apache installed, configured, and running on my computer. I have php installed and configured. I have apache configured to run php. Now I'm supposed to test it on a web page with the script \n<?php\nphpinfo()\n?>\n\n...and then save the file as a .php file. Then I'm supposed to open it to see if the test works.\n\nThe question is, HOW in the world do you open it THROUGH a a server without loading it onto a real website? I know html very well and I know how to make websites and webpages, but this book I am using to learn php really drops the ball on this step. I was under the impression that APACHE is the server I'm supposed to use to open it, but it doesn't say that. It doesn't make any sense. Can anyone help me? Thanks.

question_title: Differences in pipelines in video cards? [SEP] question_content: 10, 12, 14, etc.\n\nWhat's the deal with "pipelines" when it comes to video cards? How would nVidia's SLI increase, decrease the numbers? [SEP] best_answer: Similar to the way a CPU has a pipeline filled with small stages that each do a single task quickly, so too does the GPU in your video card. \nWhat this does is take a large task, and break it down into smaller stages.  This allows you to do multiple things at once and make your overall clock speed equivalent to the slowest of those stages. \n\nPipelined GPU:\n    * Wash\n    * Wash->Dry\n    * Wash->Dry->Fold\n    * Dry->Fold\n    * Fold\n\nThe more pipelines a video card contains, the faster and better the image will be processed and rendered. Thats why SLI is so efficient.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how can you find our when web page last modified? [SEP] question_content: I have already attempted entering javascript:alert(document.lastModified) in address bar however this reflecting current time and date. [SEP] best_answer: document.lastModified will not work when the page is transmitted from server to client. It reflects the local time because that's the time the page was stored in the "Temporary Internet File" directory. It shows that in javascript, document.lastModified gets only the locally modified time. So, you must manually type time and date each time you modify your web-page. However I think there are some options in server sided scriptings to detect the last modified date in servers. I am not used to it.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Is Pentium M better than P4s, which one is faster? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Intel's Pentium M (m is for "mobile") and P4 are different style chips, so it is difficult to compare them on clock speed alone.  \n\nWhen I purchased my laptop (two years ago), I did some research on this topic.  The claim at that point was that the 1.6 MHz mobile was about the same as a 3.5 MHz P4.  This may have been in PC Magazine or something online.  (Can't find the source quickly.)\n\nThe main thing is that the M chips suck less energy, which is good in laptops, where battery life and heat are more important.	Computers & Internet

To solve the jamming problem, another business associate, James Densmore, suggested splitting up keys for letters commonly used together to slow down typing. This became today’s standard "QWERTY" keyboard.	Computers & Internet

question_title: why is there no volcanos in canada? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually Canada IS on the Ring of Fire, which circles the Pacific Ocean more or less.\n\nCanada does have volcanoes on its west cost where the Rockies and Cascades continue north out of the United States.  \n\nYou don't have to be on the Ring of Fire to have volcanoes either, just along an active fault typically.  There are volcanoes all over the world where the plates meet.  Canada doesn't have volcanoes over most of its land though because it is spread across a continental plate which is too thick in the middle to have hot spots (like the Pacific plate does where we see the Hawaiian islands).  Where it meets the Pacific and Juan de Fuca plate in the west though there is enough movement to form mountains and strato volcanoes (like Mt. St. Helens which is not far from Canada, in Washington State).	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Can people all over the world see the "little dipper?"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Little Dipper is near the north celestial pole, and contains Polaris (the North Star). It's only visible by people who live north of the Earth's equator.\n\nMost places on the Earth have some part of the sky that is never visible. The exception being people who live near the equator. \nAs you move away from the equator, you lose the ability to see stars near the far pole (i.e. as you move south you lose the ability to see stars near the north pole), and the further away you go the less of the opposite hemisphere you're able to still see. Once you reach the pole you can only see stars in your hemisphere.\n\nPeople who live south of the equator can't see the stars near the north pole (like the little dipper) and people who live north of the equator can't see the Southern Cross or the Magellanic clouds.\n\nHowever, as long as you don't live at one of the poles you can see some stars in the other hemisphere - just not all of them.

It is the white stuff seen on rocks where lots of birds hang out. Very concentrated and smells real strong. It is not bird poop.  It is CONCENTRATED urinary system wastes like our urine, but these organisms need to conserve and reabsorb excretory system water to prevent deydration and to help them weigh less when flying (so as to not store it in a bladder that is too heavy when they're taking off, landing,flying!) and so they "excrete" concentrated, more solid excretory wastes.\n\nSince uric acid crystals have many mineral and organic molecules, they are used as fertilizer.

Just because there isn't a hard-to-spell sciency word to describe something do we have to bring in the paranormal to explain it. Back in the dark ages when peasents saw lightening they thought it was the gods playing games or torturing them, but we quite happily believe nowadays that it is a discharge of static charge from the clouds. \n\nJust think in years to come when the flying saucers are explained the people of the future with their aluminium foil hats and flashy gadgets will think of us as idiots for thinking paranormal activities have ghostly ties.\n\nThere is no such things as ghosts because the term is meaningless. a better question is how can i explain this effect better. For example there are loads of unexplained happenings such as the infamous question of just who is voting for Tony Blair at every election, but we don't bring the paranormal in to explain that now do we???\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n\nThere is no such things as ghosts, just lazy physicists	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I was going to write this all out to explain it to you, but this website said exactly what I was going to say, but better and with more detail...\n\n"Base 60 (Sexagesimal) Numbering system\n\nThe Sumerian culture developed the Sexagesimal Numbering system some 4000 to 6000 years ago. This system was developed into a rigorous numbering system. The digits used were symbols which represented syllables instead of letters that were pressed into clay tablets. There were symbols representing ones and tens and were combined to represent the number of each place value.  See the following site for more information about the Sumerian numbering system. http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/index.html\n\nEach place value to the left is equal to 60 times the place value to the right which implies that each place value to the right is equal to the place value to the left divided by 60. It was up to the context of the number to determine where the place values began. Also, the place values may be fractions of base 60 numbers, ie. 1/60, 1/3600, etc.\n\n3600, 60, 1, 1/60, 1/3600 \n\nThe use of 60 as a grouping number was used by many cultures throughout our earth's history. This may be because 60 has many factors, including 12 (which also has many factors) and was convenient to use for trading, counting, etc. because of its divisibility. Our notations of time into 60 seconds and 60 minutes uses a from of this numbering system, but is not as rigorous because of the 24 for hours and the subdivisions of seconds into milliseconds, etc."	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is the meaning of biosphere reserve? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Background and context\n\nBiosphere reserves are areas nominated by national governments and designated under the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Since 1976, UNESCO has designated 356 members of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 90 countries. These include 13 National Nature Reserves (NNRs) in the UK, designated in 1976/77.\n\nAs the intended functions of biosphere reserves have evolved considerably since the late 1970s, many biosphere reserves designated then do not match the current criteria well. These criteria are incorporated in "The Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves" (the Statutory Framework), adopted by the General Assembly of UNESCO in 1995.\n\nArticle 9 of the Statutory Framework requires concerned authorities to submit a report on the status of biosphere reserves under their jurisdiction to the MAB Secretariat every ten years. In 1997, UNESCO requested the UK government to submit such a report with respect to all UK biosphere reserves. To date, the UK government has not submitted this report to UNESCO. This delay is regarded as constructive by the International Advisory Committee for Biosphere Reserves, which recognises the need for governments to undertake thorough reviews of biosphere reserves under their jurisdiction.\n\nObjectives of the study\n\nThis study considers the application of the criteria defined in the Statutory Framework with respect to the UK. Two main objectives were defined in the terms of reference:\n\n   1. to consider the concepts supporting biosphere reserves and provide advice on their relevance and value in the light of other designations across the UK;\n   2. to determine if there is any real wildlife gain (i.e., benefits to wildlife) to be achieved by adopting the designation in the UK and, if so, under what circumstances.\n\nFollowing discussion with DETR, the report takes a wider view of the benefits of biosphere reserves as "sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale", as defined in the Statutory Framework.\n\nEvolution of the biosphere reserve concept\n\nBiosphere reserves have three characteristics that, at least in principle, differentiate them from other ‘protected areas’: they are part of an international network of sites designated by UNESCO, rather than by national governments; their outer boundary is flexible, rather than being legally defined; and the land and water they contain is administered and managed by more than one agency or owner. In fact, only the first of these characteristics defines all biosphere reserves. According to the criteria in the Statutory Framework, they should have three zones: a legally constituted core area(s) devoted to long-term protection, according to the conservation objectives of the biosphere reserve, and of sufficient size to meet these objectives; a buffer zone(s) clearly identified and surrounding or contiguous to the core area or areas, where only activities compatible with the conservation objectives can take place; and an outer transition area where sustainable resource management practices are promoted and developed.\n\nThis scheme has evolved over three decades, reflecting both experiences of practical application and wider trends in the fields of conservation and resource management, particularly the evolution of the concept of sustainable development and the growing recognition of the need to involve local people in the management of protected areas. The emphasis of the biosphere reserve concept has shifted from the promotion of conservation, science, and education to the notion of "sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development on a regional scale" within a global network providing unique opportunities for exchanges of experience and collaborativ	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes anxziety? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The following are all believed to play a role in the occurrence of anxiety disorders:\n\nheredity \nbrain chemistry \npersonality \nlife experiences \nHeredity and anxiety disorders:\nThere is clear evidence that anxiety disorders run in families. Studies show that if one identical twin has an anxiety disorder, the second twin is more likely to have an anxiety disorder than non-identical (fraternal) twins. These findings suggest that a genetic factor, possibly activated in combination with life experiences, predisposes some people to these disorders.\n\nBrain chemistry and anxiety disorders:\nBecause symptoms of anxiety disorders are often relieved by medications that alter levels of chemicals in the brain, scientists believe that brain chemistry appears to play a role in the onset of anxiety disorders.\n\nPersonality and anxiety disorders:\nResearchers believe that personality may play a role in the development of an anxiety disorder, noting that people who have low self-esteem and poor coping skills may be more prone. Conversely, an anxiety disorder that begins in childhood may itself contribute to the development of low self-esteem.\n\nLife experiences and anxiety disorders:\nResearchers believe that the relationship between anxiety disorders and long-term exposure to abuse, violence, or poverty is an important area for further study, as life experiences may affect an individual's susceptibility to these disorders.

A 2x2 box is the most commonly seen.  I'll use this as my example:\nDraw a square. Inside, draw a plus sign, so that you get 4 identical squares inside the larger square.\nNow, we need two 'breeders.'  Let's say Dad has brown hair, with resessive blond; Bb.  Mom is the same way; Bb.\nAt the top of the square, write Dad's alleles (the big and little 'b')...one per column.  On the left side, place Mom's alleles...one per row.\nNow, multiply.\nIn the four squares, you should end up with the following:\n1 BB\n2 Bb\n1 bb\n\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that if Mom and Dad have 4 kids, the odds are they will have 3 with brown hair and one blond.  (Hopefully Dad understands recessive alleles, or Mom might have some explaning to do.)\n\nWill every 4th kid be blond?  No.  But, each kid will have a 1 in 4 chance of being blond, and 3 in 4 chance of being brunette.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is preparative thin layer chromatography? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: its a method of seperating individual molecules from a compound by placing samples on a special sheet coated with a material that will allow the molecules to seperate easily.  Then you put the place with samples in a developing chamber that will pull the molecules apart based on polarity.  That's not the best description in scientific terms, but that's pretty much how it works.  You just compare the distance each molecule traveled with the distance known molecules would travel in the same situation and it gives you a pretty good indicator as to what the unknown compound is composed of.

question_title: If molar extinction coefficient is unknown, can concentration still be found in grams rather than moles? [SEP] question_content: Only the absorbance is known (as wel as l) [SEP] best_answer: A=E*d*C\n\n(d=length of the path of the light through the solution)\n\nIf you have only one value of absorbance then obviously there is no way of determining the concentration without the molar extiction coefficient (E).\n\nIn practice even if you know E, you don't use it to find the unknown concentration. Instead you measure the A of standard solutions and do a standard curve. From the equation of that curve (which you find using linear regression) and the value of A of your sample you calculate the unknown amount. \nThe standard curve doesn't need to be A vs mole/lt. It can be A vs anything e.g. g/ml, mg/ml, ppm or even just g, mole, etc. the only thing that changes is what the slope represents.\nFor example for A vs mole/lt the slope corresponds to E*d, for A vs g/lt the slope corresponds to E*d/MW, etc.\n\nIf you  always have the same volume of sample you can do the curve A vs grams directly. Then if V is the volume of the sample, the slope corresponds to E*d*V/MW\n\nEven if your standard curve is expressed in moles/lt you can convert it to grams. You just need the MW of the compound and the volume, not E...	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Taking Amitriptyline and Citalopram (Celexa) at the same time? [SEP] question_content: My girlfriend is on Citalopram, and my doctor perscribed me Amitriptyline for sleep (which doesn't work..), but my doctor told me to make sure that she didn't take any Amitriptyline with Citalopram.  We were just wondering why, and what would happen if she did.  I know they are both anti-depressants, I just want to know what exactly will happen.  Also, wanted to know what will happen if she took that with Xanax, but the other question is more important. [SEP] best_answer: The drug literature that the FDA required the manufacture of Celexa to print stated that using Celexia with TCA's (of which amitriptyline is one of that class) should be done with caution.\n\nThere are several reasons for this, and I only mention a few:\n\nThe only drug interaction test done between Celexia was with another TCA given in a single dose, to see if it affected the blood levels of Celexia. It may take several weeks of taking both drugs together for the full effects of changes in blood levels of either drug to be fully known.\n\nThere is no reason to prescibe drugs with common goals, as antidepressants (since the primary use of Amitriptyline is to treat depression, even though side effects of drowsiness sometime promote its use as a sleep aid)\n\nThere are possible additive effects to the side effects of dry mouth, sexual, and impared mental function that would serve no useful purpose.\n\nIf she did develop an unusual condition the doctor would not know which drug was causing it or if it was a drug interaction, or whatever. It makes the job of the doctor more difficult to determine what to do.\n\nAlso, in some people, amitriptyline can cause heart problems, (a good reason to keep the bottle well away from children, and with a safety cap).\n\n\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020822s29lbl.pdf	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what are bees doing in the winter time ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Bees stay in their hives. Some die of course but more are produced to replace them. The worker bees exercise their wings and bodies to create enough heat to keep themselves and the queen warm enough to survive.These worker bees consume part of the honey in the nest to replace the energy lost by their activities in grooming the queen, caring for the larvae and keeping warm. They stay very close to the hive during winters.\n\nThis is why beekeepers never remove all the honey from a hive. Honey is the bees' method of laying in a food supply. A very long or very cold winter can kill a lot of the worker bees. The remainder will remain close to the queen to keep her and the larvae alive until the weather warms.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is homology? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Homology is a specific explanation of similarity of form seen in the biological world. Similarities can often be explained by common descent; features are considered homologous if they are shown to be inherited from a common ancestor. For example, although the arms of four-limbed vertebrates externally appear quite different, all have the same basic underlying skeletal and muscular pattern. Such shared patterns are best explained by the inference that they were inherited from a common ancestor that also had this pattern. Proposed homologies are evaluated using comparative anatomy, genetics, development, and behavior.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Did Sir Isaac Newton learn the secrets of gravity through his personal apprentice Rory Emerald? [SEP] question_content: Is this actually a fact or merely an opinion? What kind of relationship did Sir Isaac Newton have with Rory Emerald? Please tell me what you think? Isn't Emerald's discoveries just as important as Newton's? Thank You! [SEP] best_answer: Through a wild set of circumstances that took place in Beverly Hills, California, rumors started spreading that Rory Emerald, the famed celebrity, had aided Isaac Newton in his discovery of gravity.  It all started when a former silent film star, Fig Newton, started wandering the streets of Los Angeles, claiming to be a descendant of the famed scientist.  His delusions were met with skepticism, and he was finally institutionalized. Rory Emerald was doing some background research on his upcoming audition as “Frankie” for “Beach Blanket Bingo” and naturally went to the Sunnyville Mental Institution to interview psychiatric patients.  Rory Emerald was enchanted with Fig Newton and his claims.  After several months of continuous questioning, Rory Emerald began to realize that Fig Newton was not delusional - he was indeed a descendant of the famed scientist.  It all fit after painstaking research. \n\n It was then that Rory Emerald starting corresponding with Oxford University in England to discuss his findings.  He was amazed by his discovery, and anxious to share it with the scientific world.  Somehow, scientists at Oxford misinterpreted Rory’s letters and thought he was claiming to be an apprentice of Isaac Newton, and had come forward in time through a time machine to teach modern science.   Several scientists flew to Los Angeles immediately to meet the weary time traveler. These scientists held press conferences upon their arrival in the Golden State.  The media was shocked to discover that the man who assisted in the landmark discovery of gravity resided in their city in the year 1965.  They believed what they were told by the prestigious Oxford professors, and the news spread like wildfire throughout the city and the world.  \n\nRory Emerald was shocked to discover his name on the front pages of Variety, along with a full story of his time travel.  How did the story get so convoluted?  He was further appalled to learn that he was somehow involved with the discovery of gravity.  When he met the scientists from Oxford, they were naturally embarrassed by the actual story and pleaded with Rory Emerald to go along with them.  They taught him all of the correct scientific jargon and physics of gravity, and even designed a small bogus time machine made from a used dumpster, which appeared authentic.  Their sinister actions, along with Rory Emerald’s naïve compliance, started the biggest hoax perpetrated on the scientific world.  It was only 11 years later, when the hoax was exposed by a dying Oxford delegate.  By this time, Rory Emerald’s bizarre antics were accepted and he took very little flak over this indiscretion.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If, in a drought crisis, you no longer have\nfresh water to irrigate outdoor plantings, can you\nuse dishwater, bathwater or laundry water\nwithout hurting the plants? \n\nYes, if you use\nreasonable care.\n\nBut, first, a warning: Household wash\nwater-also called "graywater"-contains food\nresidues and other organic matter that may attract\ninsects and rodents. It also may contain bacteria\nand viruses that could cause illness. Public health\nofficials have indicated that it may be used for\nhome irrigation-but only in localities where no\nother water is available for that purpose.\n\nHere are some guidelines: \n\n(1) The safest\nhousehold use of "graywater" is to flush toilets.\n(Don't put it in the tank; pour it directly into the\nbowl.) \n(2) Don't let it touch the edible parts of\nplants. \n(3) Use it only as a temporary measure\nduring a water shortage crisis.\nIn any case, check with your local health and\nbuilding officials before making any use of\n"graywater."\n\nEffects on plants\n\nHousehold wash water is much better for\nplants than no water at all, but there are possible\nproblems. If your home does not have a water\nsoftener, your bathwater and rinse water from\ndishes and laundry are all of good quality for\nirrigation. Soapy wash water from dishes and\nlaundry might better be saved to flush the toilet,\nbut can be used for irrigation if you're careful\nabout certain possible problems. \n\nSee the link below for additional information.

question_title: so u have an integral 0 on bottom to .4 on top of [ tan^-1(x^7) + sin(x^7) ] dx. Use the series to approximate [SEP] question_content: the definite integral to within five decimals of accuracy. Round to five decimal places. Please help with the answer even if you dont want to show the work. I could swear i did it right, but i dont whats wrong [SEP] best_answer: First use that\ntan^-1(x)=x-(1/3)x^3+(1/5)x^5-+...\nand\nsin(x)=x-(1/6)x^3+(1/120)x^5-+...\n\nPlug in x^7 for x in these to get\ntan^-1(x^7)=x^7-(1/3)x^21+-..\nand\nsin(x^7)=x^7-(1/6)x^21+-...\n\nThen add the two and integrate term by term. When you plug in .4 and subtract what you get when you plug in 0 (which should be 0), you will get your answer.\n\nThe error from stopping at some term will be less than the value of the next term. Since .4^21 is about 4*10^(-9), you will only need the first term to get 5 decimal places of accuracy. I get .00041 for the answer, but check this.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Which is heavier: a kilogram of feathers or a kilogram of lead? [SEP] question_content: Actually I wonder which is heavier: a kilogram of butter or a kilogram of lead?  Explain the solution if you had to demonstrate to your friends arbitrarily say in a middle of the New York City’s Central Park. \nRough ideas are accepted, but please be gentle. \nYou may check this site for information:\nhttp://hypertextbook.com/physics/matter/density/ [SEP] best_answer: If you asked a scientist you might get a different answer than if you asked a layman.  Let's compare a kilogram of lead with a kilogram of aluminum.  You likely would use the same scale to measure both samples.  But, the aluminum is much lighter and would take up far more space than the lead.  The samples would displace different amounts of air and the buoyancy of air would affect the scale readings by a small amount.  Therefore to obtain accurate measurements you must weigh the samples in a vacuum or calculate the buoyancy and compensate the weight measurements.  If this is true for lead and aluminum it is even more true for lead and feathers (or even lead and butter).  Chemists often do have to compensate for air buoyancy when measuring chemicals so that when they react none are left over.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Does anyone have tips on how to sleep with PVCs or PACs? [SEP] question_content: Premature atrial and ventricular contractions are considered harmless by the 3 doctors and 2 cardiologists I've seen, but what a pain in the ass!  Those of you who are as unfortunate as me to actually feel every single one of them, how do you cope?  I can't sleep, and then being tired makes them worse.  I take atenolol, but it doesn't seem to do much.  Does anyone have any favorite medicine to control them or sleep through them? [SEP] best_answer: Those doctors aren't very helpful sometimes, are they?  (  :\n\nYou're certainly not alone.  If it's serious enough that you can't sleep, then that in itself can be a real problem.  There are medications that MIGHT help, such as beta blockers (like propranolol and metoprolol), but these all have a bunch of other effects which it would be better to avoid if you can.\n\nSo you might want to try some lifestyle changes.  Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exercise can all be triggers that increase the frequency of your arrythmias.  Unfortunately, so can stress - so worrying about whether you can get to sleep will unfortunately only make it harder to get to sleep!\n\nDeep breathing will help you relax, and some people report that magnesium, calcium, and fish oil supplements can help too.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.  If none of those work, you might at least get some consolation from others with similar problems.  The first link below is to a forum that seems to have a number of people with PVCs and PACs.

question_title: physics question help please!!!!!? [SEP] question_content: will the acceleration of a car be the same when the car travels around a sharp curve at a constant 60km/h as when it travels around a gentlecurve at the same speed? explain \n\nPLEASE!! [SEP] best_answer: Firstly, let me point out to you which answers are wrong and which answers are right. Otherwise you'll be just as confused as you were to begin with.\n\nThe first answer is confused. The second and third answers have no idea of what their talking about. The other answers are correct.\n\nHere's why the first answer is confused:\n\nSpeed and velocity use exactly the same units. \nSo it is perfectly acceptable to say "a car travels around a sharp curve a 60 km/hr". \n\nRestated, what we are saying is that the car moves around a curve at constant speed of 60 km/hr. The statement above does not include directional information. \n\n(However, suppose we said "a car travels around a sharp curve with constant velocity of 60 km/hr". Then, clearly this would be wrong. Velocity does change as it goes around the curve.)\n\nSecondly, let us recall some basic facts of 'Uniform Circular Motion' \nAn object that travels with Uniform Circular Motion has:\n- constant speed \n- changing velocity  \n- acceleration towards the centre\n\nNow, the car in question displays uniform circular motion. This is so even though we are considering a partial circular path.\n\nSo, we can use this import formula (you should memorise it) \n\n    ar = v ^2 /r\n\nThis relates the centripetal acceleration, ar, to the radius of the circle (or in the case of a partial circle, the radius of curvature), r.\n\nFrom the formula you can see that a sharp bend, i.e. a small r, will give a larger value of centripetal acceleration compared to a gentle bend, i.e a large r. \n\nSubstitute v=60 and different values of r into the formula above to verify this.

question_title: What causes the noise emitted from high-voltage power lines? [SEP] question_content: Is it static discharge, vibration from the 60-cycle field or something else entirely? [SEP] best_answer: "The audible noise emitted from high-voltage lines is caused by the discharge of energy that occurs when the electrical field strength on the conductor surface is greater than the 'breakdown strength' (the field intensity necessary to start a flow of electric current) of the air surrounding the conductor. This discharge is also responsible for radio noise, a visible glow of light near the conductor, an energy loss known as corona loss and other phenomena associated with high-voltage lines.

question_title: tricks for quickly inserting iv lines in ambulatory setting? [SEP] question_content: I'm starting a job at an amb. suregery center in a hospital, where every pt requires an iv. I usuallyenter the vein alright and get blood flashback, but have trouble advancing the catheter and frequently blow the vein.  I'm often able to float the catheter using the iv solution  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? [SEP] best_answer: Starting IV's is an acquired skill that can take a while to really get the hang of. As a medic I have seen many different approaches to getting the stick on the first try. Allot of problems I see when people can't advance the catheter is because it isn't in the vein all the way. After you get flash in the angio chamber drop your angle and advance the catheter just alittle further. Then try advancing it. This will ensure that the catheter is in all the way. Another trick is to not hit the vein from the top. You can try a slight angle and hit it from the side. This will help with troublesome veins that roll on you. Hope this helps.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the proof of the big bang theory??? [SEP] question_content: How do you prove it actually happened or is it like a religion, and something you must have blind faith in? [SEP] best_answer: There is no actual proof as such although the evidence to support the theory is pretty convincing. The first piece of evidence is that the universe is observed to be expanding. Galaxies are observed to be receding from us. This is determined by the shift in their light to the red end of the visible spectrum. It's an effect you can hear with sound; as a vehicle approaches you blowing its horn you will hear the pitch of the sound change from high to low as it then travels away from you. It's called the Doppler effect. It aslo happens with light, only light changes colour from blue (coming towards you) to red (going away from you). The lightwaves are compressed and stretched just like sound.\n\nSince galaxies are moving away from us they must have been concentrated at one point in the distant past. That the singularity of the Big Bang.\n\nThe other piece of evidence is the background radiation of heat left over from the Big Bang. This was predicted to exist by proponents of the Big Bang, and was discovered accidentally in 1963. It's the leftovers of the tremendous heat generated by the explosion, and is 2.93 degrees above absolute zero.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: how many kwh/m2 can solar  cell generate and how much is the cost of one square meter  of it [SEP] best_answer: in North America the average power of the solar radiation lies somewhere between 125 and 375 W/m², between 3 and 9 kWh/m²/day. [3]\n\nIt should be noted that this is the maximum available power, and not the power delivered by solar power technology. For example photovoltaic panels currently have an efficiency of ca. 15% and, hence, a solar panel delivers 19 to 56 W/m² or 0.45-1.35 kWh/m²/day (annual day and night average).\n\n\nGaAs multijunction devices are the most efficient solar cells to date, reaching as high as 39% efficiency[9]. They are also some of the most expensive cells per unit area (up to US$40/cm2).	Science & Mathematics

Don't worry I'm not going to try it or anything it's just someone told me it was possible once. [SEP] best_answer: An unfertilized egg and a sperm each contain one half of a parents DNA.  The whole DNA is like a set of helical twisted ladders and the ladders are split down the rungs.  For conception to occur, the sperm and egg contributors must have the same number and length of ladder sections (similar genes) to be combined into new and unique human ladders, unlike either parent.  For example, a frog has far more genes than a human even though they are much smaller creatures.  That is the main reason it is impossible for a Princess to kiss a frog and make a Prince.

question_title: what is revenue sharing and how does it work? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: all the revenue generated by the league and teams through tv contracts, team sales (jerseys, footballs, hats, etc) is placed into a pot and then divided equally among all teams. This means that some teams generate more revenue and put a larger amount of money into the pot. Also, the players union wants its share of the money also. They asked for 60% of revenue, meaning that 60% of all revenue would have to be spent on player contracts. Hope this helps	Sports

question_title: how is the turkey carcass used as a predictor of the upcoming winter.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you have to chip it out of 3 feet of ice its going to be a bad winter.\nIf your girlfriend is using them as slippers its going to be a bad winter.\nIf it died in taking refuge in a bears behind, its going to be a baaad winter.\nIf it got hit by a semi on the freeway while trying to hitch hike to California, then it's going to be a bad winter.\n\nOn the more serious side, turkeys like most forest animals accumulate more fat previous to harsh winters. Of course you would say food source is a factor, this is true, but studies have also proven( including the farmers almanac) that one of the main staples for deer and turkey, acorns, actually are also more generated to have a large crop prior to a more harsh winter.

question_title: Which is healthier cycling or running? Which helps you lose more fat? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Running actually burns more calories, about 1,000 per hour on average compared with about 600 per hour cycling. Both are great forms of exercise but as several people have mentioned here running can be hard on the body. Cycling also has its down side. There can be loss of bloodflow to the pelvic region from sitting on seat for long periods of time. If you are going for weight loss the best thing to do would be both. Strictly focusing on one or the other will get your body into a routine and after a while you may stop seeing results. Doing both also gives you the option to do something else.	Sports

A team with such a pathetic offense should not come close to winning 11 games, and since they havn't done much in the offseason it would be a stretch to expect the same from them in '06. However, they will yet again put up those numbers. Why? Defense and ,oh yeah, playing in the NFC north. The Bears by far have the easiest schedule in the NFL and that is why they are my sleeper pick.

I love playing basketball but am interested in other ways I can get rid of my belly. Any ideas aside from diets? [SEP] best_answer: Cut your carbs, my man.  A small potbelly is indicative of a carb belly.  Lay off the beer, and switch to a no-calorie, no sugar vodka or alcoholic beverage.\n\nAs far as a diet change goes, drink lots of water, and be sure to eat breakfast.  You know that saying that it's the most important meal of the day?  Well, it's true.  Breakfast should be your largest meal, and dinner should be your smallest, as your food will not metabolize as quick at night.  Avoid eating after 7pm, too.\n\nAb crunches could help tone your stomach muscles as well, but first you need to lose the gut.\n\nEat sensiblely, and remember to drink a lot of water.  Water is going to help curb your appetite and flush your system.\n\nBest of luck!	Sports

If you are talking about WWF titles.  As for IC and stuff like that, most Champs stayed loyal to their side, it made for better champs.  Even Tag Teams.  Some teams became more popular.

question_title: what are the advantages of the thoroughbred horse? and what are some disadvantages? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends on what you're going to use the horse for.  Thoroughbreds as a breed are the most athletic horses, and are great for hunter/jumper competitions.  They can be very good dressage horses, but because of their "hot" temperaments, they need a lot of patient work.  Also, if the Thoroughbred you're contemplating buying is a former racehorse, he/she may have soundness problems ranging from cracked or chipped bones to arthritis to torn ligaments or tendons.  Some of these things can be worked around, but some can't.  \n\nThe Thoroughbreds that I've known as riding horses have ranged from absolutely superb to borderline dangerous.  A lot depends on the quality of the training (or re-training, in the case of ex-racehorses) that they've had.  \n\nTo a very large degree, the kind of horse you want to have depends on what you want to do with it.  A good way to get an idea of the kind of horse you want is to look at horses that are doing what you want your horse to do, and see what kinds do well.\n\nA word to the wise:  a Thoroughbred can be a lot of horse to handle.  One of the quickest ways to get hurt, and hurt badly, around horses is to buy more horse than you can handle.  Horses absolutely do not care how well you think of your horsemanship skills.  A person can lie to other people and lie to themselves about how well they can handle a horse, but they can't lie to the horse.  Know your skill level and be honest about it when you're looking for a horse.  The most dangerous combination, an accident waiting to happen, is the unwary novice on a horse that's too much for his/her level of skill.	Sports
question_title: Howt o become a slugger? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There is no real answer to this, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, practice - a lot!  When you do, work on keeping your weight on your back foot, transfering that weight forward with a minimal amount of stride.  Keep your hands back (ie don't lead the swing with your hands), start the swing from the bottom up.  What I mean here is transfer the weight from the back foot to the front, rotate the hips sligtly, then bring the bat through the strike zone with a short, compact swing (with a slight upper cut - do not exaggerate this), your head will be the last thing to pull through, allowing you to watch the ball hit the bat.\n\nThe key to slugging, isn't necessarily how big you are - though, increasing your size in a healthy way would be beneficial.  It's more about having a quick bat through the strike zone - the faster the bat, the harder you will hit the ball.  This does not equate to taking a HUGE swing - it's just not needed.\n\nFinally, get yourself playing on a field that has dimensions that are favourable to you.  If you are a lefty, a short right field porch is beneficial, and conversely, a righty will want a short porch in left.\n\nThat's it.  Simple right?  No, but hopefully this is helpful.	Sports

question_title: do you  think  this  is right ?!? [SEP] question_content: We are more interested in making others believe that we are happy than in trying to be happy ourselves??!! [SEP] best_answer: Many people are like that, for several reasons. It could be for intimidation, or just because people don't want to worry family and friends. Normally, people are unhappy because of the everyday problems that arouse as we go on. Things like money, office work, children, social problems, health problems, and many others don't necessarily make one unhappy, but most people faced with these things don't try to appear unhappy.\nBut, on the other hand, many people are not like that. Many people are in love with life and are as happy as can be. they don't need to make others believe that they are happy- they already are! People who don't socialize much might not have as much of a need to make others feel like they are happy, though.\nIt's hard to say whether the statement is right or wrong, but there are different types of people. Let me just say that a lot of times, the superficial reality is different from the truth.	Society & Culture

question_title: who is Babylon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In ancient times, Babylon was a huge metropolitan city of the Sumerian empire.  It was located in modern day Iraq. It survived for thousands of years and was captured by Alexander the Great in 331 BC.  After Alexander's death 323 BC, Babylon soon fell into ruin.\n\nBabylon was a powerful symbol to ancient Jews and early Christians.  The book of Ezekiel describes the Babylonian siege and capture of the city of Jerusalem and the subsequent oppression of its Hebrew inhabitants.  Babylon has since been associated with sin, evil, and debauchery.  In the book of Revelation, Babylon is the name of either a city or a person from that city.  According to the book, this person ("the whore of Babylon") rules over the kings of the earth and rides upon a seven-headed beast. In one of the Bible's most famous cases of numerology, the beast is assigned the identifying number 666.\n\nThere is much debate amongst modern Christians as to who or what Babylon represents in Revelations.  Some scholars maintain that the Apostle John was talking about Emperor Nero of Rome.  Other popular interpretations include the Roman Catholic Church, the cities of San Francisco and New York, the Pope, the United Nations, and all "false" religions.\n\nIn Rastafarianism, Babylon represents the white power structure of colonial Jamaica.

question_title: What is the difference between Mahayana  and Theravada Buddhism? [SEP] question_content: It seems like there are a lot of flavors of Christianity, there are several fashions of Buddhist practices. \n\nWhich ones is best for our times? [SEP] best_answer: http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot02.htm  <<< differences on Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is the same: there is Theravada Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Yogacara Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism but it is all Buddhism and it all has the same taste - the taste of freedom. Buddhism has evolved into different forms so that it can be relevant to the different cultures in which it exists. It has been reinterpreted over the centuries so that it can remain relevant to each new generation. Outwardly, the types of Buddhism may seem very different but at the centre of all of them is the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. All major religions, Buddhism included, have split into schools and sects. But the different sects of Buddhism have never gone to war with each other and to this day, they go to each other's temples and worship together. Such tolerance and understanding is certainly rare. \n\nThe Buddha — the "Awakened One" — called the religion he founded Dhamma-vinaya — "the doctrine and discipline". To provide a social structure supportive of the practice of Dhamma-vinaya (or Dhamma for short [Sanskrit: Dharma]), and to preserve these teachings for posterity, the Buddha established the order of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkhunis (nuns)— the Sangha — which continues to this day to pass his teachings on to subsequent generations of laypeople and monastics, alike. \nAs the Dhamma continued its spread across India after the Buddha's passing, differing interpretations of the original teachings arose, which led to schisms within the Sangha and the emergence of as many as eighteen distinct sects of Buddhism.One of these schools eventually gave rise to a reform movement that called itself Mahayana (the "Greater Vehicle") and that referred to the other schools disparagingly as Hinayana (the "Lesser Vehicle"). What we call Theravada today is the sole survivor of those early non-Mahayana schools. To avoid the pejorative tone implied by the terms Hinayana and Mahayana, it is common today to use more neutral language to distinguish between these two main branches of Buddhism. Because Theravada historically dominated southern Asia, it is sometimes called "Southern" Buddhism, while Mahayana, which migrated northwards from India into China, Tibet, Japan, and Korea, is known as "Northern" Buddhism.\n\nThe main branches:\n1. Theravada / Hinayana (The great tradition or the way of the elders)\n\n2. Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle" : Variants of Mahayana Buddhism:\n-Tibetan Buddhism\n-Zen Buddhism\n-Pure Land Buddhism\n-Nichiren Buddhism\n\nhttp://www.buddhanet.net/worlddir.htm  <<< world buddhist directory (you may want to go to a temple or monastry near you & make enquiries). \nIf for whatever reason Buddhism appeals to you, obviously a bit of reading cannot do any harm. You could try a few introductory books from any tradition to get a closer idea of what Buddhism can mean for you.\n- Try not to get confused with the various traditions: just go for what feels right and ideally do a course. Amazingly, it seems to me that at least 90% of the people stick to the tradition they started in - somehow karma seems to be at work there... Anyway, the biggest differences between the Buddhist traditions are usually more on the surface than in the ideas behind the appearances. Although for example in Zen you will find very little ritual etc., and in Tibetan Buddhism you may be overwhelmed by it, at the core of the practice are the same ideas, just different methods.\n- Once you decide to get involved with a specific tradition, make sure you are not dealing with a controversial/dubious teacher or school; although someone may wear Buddhist robes or calls him/herself a lama, guru or even Acharya, that does not make him or her a saint.... There are unfortunately a fair amount of questionable 'Buddhist' teachers and c	Society & Culture

question_title: I have a serious question about gambling and prayer? [SEP] question_content: I know that most answers will be gambling is a sin, but when ones financial need is great and prayer alone isn't helping, is it really so wrong to buy lottery tickets in hopes of helping out financially?  I guess my faith may be a little\nout of whack, right or wrong? [SEP] best_answer: Understand what gambling is and what prayer is.  Gambling is buying a minute chance to win money.  It is firt of all recreation, paying for the thrill of imagination of winning.  Odds are you wont win, but one can get some excitement out of playing with possibility--even a very small one.  Gamble for the thrill, for he excitement, for the tease of possibility.  Don't gamble to solve money problems.  I don't consider gambling a sin unless you attach unreasonable hope to it and neglect to make other responsible decisions.  \nPrayer is not a tool to manipulate God or providence or a substitute for making responsible decisions.   Unreasonable expectations of prayer can be just as destructive as unreasonable expectations of gambling.  Prayer is the act of conciously putting yourself in the presence of God and finding what God has for you to know and learn. God will give what God will give. I consider the assumption of adequate status to "bargain" with God unreasonable hubris and a detriment to spiritual growth.  \nPray and be open to new understandings of God and yourself.  Gamble if you can spare the money and enjoy the thrill.  (It's no worse than spending money on stuff you dont need.) But. . .dont look to eathre to solve problems tht God intended for you to confront with the wisdom and intelligence you were given.	Society & Culture

question_title: Why are there so many kids on the internet   much more than adults? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: because kids are younger and they've learned less, as we get older we know certain ways to do things and its harder to re-learn to do them new ways than to keep doing them our old way, even if the new one is faster. kids are learning these things for the first time so they pick it up faster because they've got more space to put it and no previous experiences. thats why you must walk grandmothers thru even the easiest web-forms even tho they're designed for idiots. in short: adults dont usually like bothering learning new ways to do old things. besides, they know more stuff anyway, and have their lives in places besides home, who needs the internet?

Bush because both Bush and Trudeau asserted their countries identity to the world just as their country was going thought the worst crises in its history. For the United States, Bush asserted America’s identity to the world just as it was going through its toughest crises in its history on September 11, 2001. For Trudeau, he asserted Canada’s identity to the world when the October Crisis occurred in October 1970 from stopping the FLQ (Front de liberation du Quebec) from getting independence for Quebec.

question_title: Why are muslims so intolerant of christians? [SEP] question_content: Its so easy for them to declare jihad. Should christians retaliate? [SEP] best_answer: Certainly, not all of them are are... \n\nIn the cases they are though, so called Muslims (Muslim: believer, Islam: submission to God), believe that Christians are infidels; as in infidelity towards the religion of God as they see it, since they view Mohammad as the last Prophet. \n\nMost of those intolerant are of the elite ecclesiastical class (Imam: teacher), or the utterly ignorant because they're not even allowed to read the Koran or any other of their Holy books (which includes the Christian Bible) - the Koran is according to itself, another chapter of the continuing book of God, i.e. Bible and Torah are included in the Islamic book of God. \n\nMohammad is supposedly a Prophet like Moses, and His followers consequently have behaved like wise in their time, becoming persecutors/persecuted, but not all Jews were, nor are all Muslims today. (The books of Moses: Old testament, speak of a Prophet to arise in the place and time Mohammad did according to tradition "I shall raise up a Prophet, like unto me, Moses". \n\nThose that are not intolerant remember the sayings, or those like it that Mohammad stated "Anyone who harms a Christian or Jew has harmed me!", or "Be friends with the Christians for they are most like you in the world", or when asked what is this God you believe in, Mohammad said "The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." \n\nAbraham also had the Q'blih "point of adoration", a stone to turn to when praying for those unable to be without an alter, since both were from idol worshipers; as were the Jews before the ten commandments - the commandments Moses received before, He tossed into the water because the people were not ready (a sign of the coming of greater teaching, e.g. with Jesus).\n\nThere's always more to learn and understand. Some Muslims I've met show such Love for Christ that all but two Christians I've met pale by comparison - those two spoke of nothing but the love of God and had no hate for anyone. In generally the Muslims I've met here in the US are every bit as loving toward all, as Christians, and by that standard they are one and the same.	Society & Culture

question_title: Another important christians for christians.? [SEP] question_content: "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” [The Bible, Mathew 7:22-24]\n\n \n\nIn the verses quoted above, Jesus (pbuh) said that in his second coming, he would ask the people to depart from him, to get away from him because he wouldn’t know them. Who are these people? The Muslims or the Hindus? The answer is neither Hindus nor Muslims but the Christians, because Muslims or Hindus do not claim to do “Miracles” in the name of Jesus Christ (pbuh) nor do they cast out devils in his name.\nPLZ TELL WHAT CHRISTIANS THINK ABT THIS? [SEP] best_answer: I see where you are going with this, but your logic is faulty.\n\nYes - He is saying that some people will claim to know Him, but as he just got done saying a few verses earlier, they won't have been doing the will of His Father, and which means they don't truly know Him, they only think they do.\n\nTwo observations:\n\n1)  That does not mean that all Christians will not be acknowledged by the Messiah - only that some who claim to be Christians won't.\n\n2)  That does not mean that there are any other ways to God.  Jesus was also very clear about that:\n\n  * John 3:36 "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."\n\n   * John 14:6 "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me"\n\nI see that you honor Jesus as a Prophet, when you write "PBUH" (Peace Be Unto Him) after His name.  How do handle the knowledge that Jesus claimed to: 1) have the authority to forgive sins (something only God can do), 2) said He and the Father were one (John 10:30), and 3) claimed God granted him the authority to lay down his life  - and - take it up again (John 10:17-18).\n\nIgnoring whether or not He proved those things with the Resurrection (and there is evidence He did), these claims are very bold.  I can see two possibilities.  Either 1) These were not true (in which case you should not be saying "Peace Be Unto Him" every time you mention his name, for he was a Blasphemer, or 2) What he said was true, and he was God in human form come to save mankind.\n\nAs a Muslim, how do you handle that?

Your folks probably don't need to know either. Masturbation is a perfectly natural function of the body & humans are not the only ones who do that. What he chooses as stimuli is very personal, as is what he was doing. If you speak to him at all about it, you might just suggest that he be more careful to lock the door before he indulges.

If you do NOT like his reaction, what i would do is wait a day or two sit back and think and then talk about it again then hopefully you guys can come to an agreement that will satisfy both of your wants.\n\n\nFYI: Don't take this lightly! It is some what\n of a big deal!	Family & Relationships

If someone has gono through it please give me some advice...(I really love her) [SEP] best_answer: I don't think a threesome is too good for a young relationship if it is one. If it's a strong relationship then do what makes you happy. I'm don't think you'll be happy afterwards though with another man having his way with your girl niether will she be happy with you banging another girl. So if you love her I would suggest you don't.

I would like to start dating, but I am so picky. I only like certain types. The last date I went out on the guy already started asking me how I felt about marriage. I don't want to get married again, I just want to date. How do I go about finding a decent guy? I don't go to clubs. When I do go to church, all of the great guys are married. Is there any great online dating sites that don't cost anything? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: singleparentmeet is a great site to meet men, I am a divorced mother and that is where I met the man that I am currently dating. all the people on there are parents and they understand the stress of being thrown back into the dating world and this time having children to think about before getting involved with anyone. they truly understand that children come first.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I am sorry that you no longer want to get married, I just got married last month and it really feels right, but that is for me, not everyone is ready, and with saying that I believe the best way is to just tell them face to face, because if you wait til you get to the altar and leave them hanging it will show that you are not considerate of others feeling, especially the feelings of the person you were planning to spend the rest of your life with.\nJust remember one thing:   What if the shoe was on the other foot?  How would you want to be told such a painful thing?\nWhatever you do decide to do, just remember that, "What goes around, comes around"  Treat that person like a person with feelings, and just may be you two will be able to remain friends if you do the right thing.\nGood Luck, I hope it all turns out okay for you both.

question_title: Does he still love me? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months and we love each other like crazy. It was love at first sight. I mean every single day we would say how much we love each other at LEAST 15 times a day. I mean I love him.. i really do. just sometimes it seems like he doesnt love me.... maybe i'm mistaken. the thing is he lives 20 miles away.. so if something happens i wont know about it. i know he would never do anything like that but u know hes 17 and im 16... this guy loves me soo much he's cried for me. but lately we havent been saying i love you as much as we usually do... do you think anythings wrong? should i be worried? =&#92; [SEP] best_answer: Saying I love you isnt as powerful as showing it. If he is still treating you the same then you have nothing to worry about. One of the important things in a relationship is trust, if you dont have that then the relationship is doomed to end. Either you trust him and stay with him, or you dont and you move on.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: We don't get to hang out as much as we would like, but we have been on many dates. When ever we go to hold hands or something like that we always seem to get interupted, I just want to know if I'm wasting my time, or if she actually likes me.

He is not all there to say the least. he is a very demented person and drinks robotussin also alcoholic. I've worked my ass off sense I was sixteen. I have had drug problems but I'm a product of my invironment. Other than those small reasons, I've never done anything to him. He hates me for reasons made up in his head. To this day not a day goes by without having to listen to his stupidity. He lives with mom n pop and complains about her cooking along with other things a normal person would be greatful for. I can't stand him. He is in there now bitching... [SEP] best_answer: your question is?	Family & Relationships
question_title: How to motivate your man? [SEP] question_content: He just doesn't want to work and help me pay the bills. Likes to stay up late and drink 2 or 3 nights out of the week and is mean to me because he's hung over and has bring the girls to pre-school because I work a morning shift. \n\nI am completely out of ideas. I don't know what to do. Christmas is coming. I have a 3yr old and an 18 month old. Both girls. \n\nHe goes to college but so do I (my classes are homebased) and I work 5 days a week, still do the laundry, still cooks, still cleans. It's making me miserable and he knows it!\n\nDo people just get stuck sometimes? I don't want to be dragged down anymore. What can I do? [SEP] best_answer: Sometimes people do get stuck.  But in the same breath some just get comortable.  Through personal experience I have found that the more you enable a man to be lazy, shiftless, and not do much, the less they will do.  If you accept him not helping out he will think that is ok with you.\n\nIt is hard with children, but they should not be made to suffer just because there is a grown child in the home who doesnt want to work and help out.  It is financially a bad idea for you to allow him to stay at home.\n\nMy fiance went to college and held a full time job just to make sure things at home were taken care of.  I also worked, even throughout my pregnancy.  With three kids, we needed all the money we could.  \n\nI left my ex first for all of the reasons you had listed above.  I no longer wanted to be around such a hateful person who didnt help.  I deserved better- so i left ang got better.\n\nmost people never realize how good they had it until it leaves!

People who listen more, learn more about other people and their issues, and are the ones whom people go to when they need someone to talk to.  The second category is the one who provides the most laughter and promotes happiness.  The third category could be the one who provides the most service without expectations for anything in return, like moms and dads, sisters and brothers, and true friends, who are cognitive and value other human beings in general.

[SEP] best_answer: for one thing..you cant get high just by taking one sniff. and two..they do smell good. just my opinion though. no i dont go around sniffing them all the time and getting high, but when i do use one i like the smell of it. it can hurt you though. but not by one sniff. your friend was just messing with you when he said you were acting crazy. so you're good to go!

[SEP] best_answer: Please dont do that the first time you have sex with her... That will scare her especially if she doesn't have a lot of sexual experience. Find out how much sexual experience she has had.  Ask questions and snoop (kinda) "what the kinkiest thing you have done" or "whats the freakiest thing you would do or want to do" or  when your out at the mall somewhere and pat her but and see how she reacts... If she says OOOOOhhhh and kisses you then maybe its a good idea if you do it and she says what are doing and gives you a crazy look.... Please don't spank her...\n\nHope this helps	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: men and women think differently about sex, women have an emotional attachment to the person afterwards whereas men can just view you as someone they have had sex with, thats why they can sleep with different women and not remember her name or call her the day after....the only way a man be emotionally attached to you after sex is if he really likes you as a whole person or is in love with you. but women tend to involve alot of feelings when it comes to sex and yes they can get aroused it just takes longer whereas men are visual and really dont need much coaching to be easily aroused	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: There is a time to live and a time to die; just as sure as we all have a birthday, we all have a death date as well.\n\nNo, you can not cheat death. Regardless of what circumstance may not take your life; car accidents, heart attacks, cancer, train wreck, etc. The reality is you are here, because it was not time for you to die...but, death can not be cheated; only delayed and a delay is not a deny...it will come and it when it does, no one knows the time or hour. The bible says that death comes like a thief in the night; which only means you never expect it, nor can you really prepare for it.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Sexual life before marriage ,is it a healthy way of being in a relation? [SEP] question_content: Every one feels u have the answer for this and it is easy , but when u try to relate it to ones own life one would find no that  comfortable to answer it by saying it is ok or its perfectly fine. [SEP] best_answer: I hate to look at things this way, but I'm a factual person. The stats show that ppl who live together before getting married are more likely to get divorced. I waited until I was married to have sex. This brings a real sense of security to our relationship. I could go on about the other benefits, but I'm tired.	Family & Relationships

question_title: is being gay a sin? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Truthfully, I think that if a person looks hard enough they can find sin in everything and everyone.  The interesting thing is that people who spend their lives looking for sin in others rarely, if ever, find sin within themselves.  Personally I find it important to remember these two things:\nFirst, man not God placed a rating on sin.  In the eyes of God the person who lies is just as much a sinner as the person who murders.  So, in that regard, have we not all sinned?\nSecond there are my two favorite verses from the bible:\nMatthew 7:1-5\nJudge not, that ye be not judged. \nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. \nAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? \nOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \nThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\nLuke 6:37-38\nJudge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: \nGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Is it possible to see your period one month after you put to birth while breatfeeding, how to prevent pregnan? [SEP] question_content: That is, to avoid pregnancy using natural control method not artificial. how to count save and unsave days [SEP] best_answer: If you are going to use this method for birth control, prepare for another pregnancy. It does not work, at least not very well. You need to use some form of birth control, either condoms, or the pill. You are MOST fertile, halfway through your cycle, day14, 15 , and 16........but you can STILL get pregnant other days, even while on your period, if you have sex.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Proposed New ABORTION Law? [SEP] question_content: Women can only get abortion if the man agrees, or she is proven to be raped or under age or in the case of saving a life.\n\nIf the father does not agree he must pay the mother an amount during her pregnancy and medical bills and must have full custody of the child after it is born, then the mother must pay child support.\n\nIf no case can be proven and the mother gets an abortion the father can sue for damages for his lost child. [SEP] best_answer: In my opinion it sounds like a good law. Its may be the womans body, but its the mans sperm. If the father wants to take care of his daughter/son then he should be able to. The woman and man created the baby, not just the woman.	Family & Relationships
question_title: how do u know your boy friend really loves you? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Since I don't know your boyfriend personally, it's hard to offer good advice.  I think that some of the following guidelines would show whether or not he loves you:\n\n1)  Does he respect your wishes and morals, or does he try to pressure you into activities and ideas that he knows that you are not in favor of?  A guy who loves you will respect your wishes, even if his wishes are different than yours.  He will not try to pressure you into doing something that you have already said "no" to.\n2)  Does he ever say, "If you loved me, you'd... (fill in the blank)" or something similar?

question_title: Do yo think we have the power to lower the gas prices? [SEP] question_content: It seem to me, if we organize our daily travels by eliminating those extra unplanned trips we would use less gas,(probably 2/3s less) which would cause the limited reserve storage supply to be over filled and cause that limited storage supply to become over filled and the oil companies would be forced to lower the prices in order to keep the supply moving. \n\nI think we have control. The oil companies are trying to make us think and feel that we don't have control. I believe we can cause the gas price to be what we want them to be by managing our travels (you know those "Oh,I forgot to" trips).   I don't want to pay more than .75 per gallon but, I can't do it alone. I need your help. I think by collectively managing our use of fuel we can make them know that supply and demand really controls price. This is just a different shift in the paradigm of thinking and acting.. Hey! we have control. Pass it on..  What do you think? Yes, I think we waste 2/3s and 1/4 of $3.00 per barrel is .75.

question_title: Does my mom hate me? [SEP] question_content: Their are four kids in our family. My mom treats me and my oldest sister like we are slaves. My other sister and brother, she praises for cleaning up their own messes. I clean the house she says I missed a spot, looks at me like I'm stupid and does it herself. When my midle sisters grades come in, my mom tells her what a good job she has done, keeping her grades up. I have to work hard but my grades are as good as hers, when my grades come in the mail it gets looked over and passed on to me. No word said about my good grades. My oldest sister had pictures developed from a few years ago. My mom flipped through the pictures and commented on my middle sisters hair looked how it was soo short, finished looking at the pictures without saying a word about me or my oldest sister who were also in the pictures and handed them back to me saying she needs to get back to her work. Their are other things that she will let my middle sister do that she wouldn't let my older sister or me do. [SEP] best_answer: no, i am sure that she doesnt hate you.\n\ni get the sense, however, that she is expecting soething from you with isnt fair for her to ask: she wants you to take a back seat to your siblings. i miagine that would be a very hard thing for anyone to do...\n\ni wish that i could give you some sort of magical advice that would fix your problem in one fell swoop, but we both know there is no such answer. the best that i can tell you is that you and your older sister both need to talk to your mother about they way that you feel.\n\nexplain it to her. allow her to ask questions, and maybe vent a little if she needs to. dont approach her with a accusatory manner, and dont give her the feeling she is being ganged up on. simply tell her the way that this treatment make the two of you feel, and i bet she will understand. however, just cuz she understands, does not mean that she will then fix the problem in one fell swoop.\n\nif the above doesnt work the only other advice i could give the two of you is to suck it up, and deal with it, and thank the Lord for what you do have, and for the good in your lives rather than the bad. sometimes people are so set in their ways that they cant even comprehend change, and i pray that mother isnt one of them.\n\nanyway, i wish you both the best of luck, and i hope that this helped you, even if only a little.\n                   \n                        :-)	Business & Finance

question_title: Is it possible to get a loan to purchase your first home if you have bad credit? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: FHA guarantees loans for first time home buyers and can often offer solutions even to people with bad credit.  Shopping around for a good realtor and lender if very important.\n\nAsk friends and family who they have used.  In the market as it currently sits, almost anyone can get a mortgage, everything depends on how much you want to pay and what property you want.\n\nWhen looking for homes, make sure your realtor knows that you are a first time home buyer and interested in FHA loans since only certain houses qualify for them and some will be automatically ruled out.\n\nWhen shopping for a lender (don't JUST go with the one the realtor recommends but DO at least check them out), inquire about FHA loans and what type of points and interest would be available for someone with a credit rating of X.  find out what your credit rating is from the 3 major credit bureaus BEFORE you shop for a lender.  You want to know what they are going to be seeing before they do.\n\nThe more information you have the better.  Don't be afraid to ask questions or to walk away if it isn't what you want.\n\nStandard disclaimer: This is not legal advice nor financial advice.

question_title: Does the equator always face the sun? [SEP] question_content: Does the equator always face the sun?\nWhen the earth tilts on its axis, a majority of the sun is faced toward one hemisphere. (Thus creating Summer and Winter)\nSo therefore, the equator faces the sun, because the earth is tilted, and the earth must be faced at an angle. \nAm I right? [SEP] best_answer: The Sun, in its seasonal movement through the sky, passes directly over the equator twice each year on the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes, which occur in March and September (respectively). At the equator, the rays of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth on these dates.\n\nPlaces near the equator experience the quickest rates of sunrise and sunset in the world, taking minutes. Such places also have a relatively constant amount of day/night time on every day throughout the year compared with more northerly or southerly places.	Business & Finance

question_title: fire destroyed my house..what to do? [SEP] question_content: i was renting in CA in 2006. single family home. the AC unit cause a spark in the attic and burnt down my entire house. my cat and dog died in fire. \nthe official fire report states fire was started by AC, it also states we've made several complaints to landlord about weird electrical outages in various parts of the house (he never took any action to fix it). but in the fire report, he says he has fixed it.\nand now, the whole house is non-repairable. \nwe didn't have renters insurance, but landlord has insurance on the house. i think he's fighing insurance for his share of the loss (the ttl loss is around $800,000). he has not even made an attempt to call us since the fire happened 3 months ago.  \ni want to know if we have any hope of getting our losses back by getting legal action again landlord for unsafe living for past year. i just want to get some money so i can start out new again.\nthanks for your input in advance. [SEP] best_answer: There's really not a whole lot that a landlord is responsible for but I can tell you that they are responsible for providing a safe place to live which includes plumbing and electrical.  Even if you don't have any written documents showing you complained about the electrical stability, it will be his word against yours and since he never fixed it, he won't have any receipts.\n\nMy advice is to get a lawyer.  You shouldn't have too much trouble finding one if the house if worth $800,000.  The lawyer should take it on a contingency fee (they get paid when you get paid).  If your claim is less than $5,000 you can take him to small claims court.  If you win you can put a lien against the property until he pays you.  Your winnings will also collect 10% annual interest until paid.  Also, if he tries to sell the property you will get you money before he gets his.	Business & Finance

question_title: what should I do? [SEP] question_content: What should I do after work? Go to the gym, go to the groceries with mommy, watch a movie with a friend (if so, should we watch Lakehouse, or Nacho Libre?), or should I just stay home and play ps2 and sleep? [SEP] best_answer: You should read.  Read a good book, or something so that you can learn.  Going to the gym is good, but not all of the time.  Movies and video games are too, and occasionaly an extra nap - although if you would go to the gym more often you wouldn't need to sleep as much.  Here are some books that I've read that were pretty good:  "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card, along with the other books in the series: "Speaker for the Dead", "Xenocide", and "Children of the Mind".  They were really interesting, and really fun to read.  Then there is the "Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy" series by Douglas Adams.  Really funny:  a lot better than the newer movie:  I read the book before even any trailers came out, and it was really good.  Then, there are some classic books that are pretty good.  Mark Twain is really great; maybe a book of short stories.  Reading is great, man.  If you're not into reading, go to the gym and then play PS2, so you get more than one activity in.

question_title: can i start a business with great ideas but no cash in hand? [SEP] question_content: i want to start a good life within this year [SEP] best_answer: There are many businesses who started with so little yet grew to become good income vehicles down the road. From the article "How to Start a Business with Little Cash" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol30/nocash.htm  here are some tips on how you can start a business and earn more money even if you are short of cash today:\n\n1. Find a business that you can start for little money (e.g. an errand business where your main cost is telephone and gasoline is easier to start than starting a Subway franchise)\n\n2. Consider your time and effort - if you have little cash, you may have to work harder for the money because you will have no resource to outsource or employ others to do certain tasks for you; or you have no money to buy equipment so you can only do certain things the long way\n\n3. Get your creative juices flowing. With no money, the only thing you have is your imagination. Be creative and find ways to get things done \n\n4. Be prepared to do all the work yourself - from doing your business plan, finding financing, writing emails, shipping and handling, marketing or whatever processes your business requires. \n\n5.

question_title: how do you keep pimples from breaking out? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It's impossible to keep pimples from breaking out that's apart of puberty and life, but to prevent them from coming then eat fruits and vegetables drink water, have a healthier way of eating.  Pimples are caused by the pores being clogged and by producing too much oil or sebum from your sebaceous glands that can form either a white head or a black head.  So wash your face with something that has benzol peroxide in it or salic acid, and use an on the spot acne medication, The best stuff to use depends on your face type whether you have dry or oily skin or a combination of both.  So you have to find a cleanser that won't overdry your skin, or make it too oily.  Recommended products Neutrogena on the spot acne cream, only has 2.5 % benzol peroxide so it won't dry your skin too much, and Clearsil daily face wash guarenteed to clear skin in 3 days.  That's the cheap route, and it works.  Other than that you can use an astringent or toner all of them are pretty much the same but some can overdry your skin so you just have to test them to see which ones are best for your facial type, and those are good to use after doing some sweating and with make-up to take it off.  Sometimes having too much make-up on can clog your pores so use a light base so that none of the cosmetics can still be left behind.  Last, wash your face in the shower, and you don't need to use everything morning and night, You'll notice if you need to wash more than once a day, if it overdrys your skin, or if your skin is too oily.  Use the on the spot medication at night only so that your skin won't feel tight and dry all day long.	Business & Finance

question_title: does anybody know how earn online job means work from home?

Your own business is something you create yourself, not find on the internet. You create it based on your skills, your passions not on what someone else tells you is the GREATEST thing going.\n\nIf you are looking at one of the endless "opportunities" out there be careful - most are scams. Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n* What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n* Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n* Who will pay me?\n* When will I get my first paycheck?\n* What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n* What will I get for my money?

[SEP] question_content: The below statement is false\nThe above statement is true [SEP] best_answer: Actually, that is simply another way of expressing a very old paradox, called the Epimenides paradox. The paradox goes like this. \n\nYou sail into the harbour in Crete. A native of that island, a Cretan, comes up to you and says, "All Cretans are liars". The  logic problem here exists in the paradox that because a Cretan himself has said this, it cannot be consistently true, nor consistently false.	Business & Finance

This will give the price without the tax.\n\nFor example: Total price is $106.50, sales tax is 6.5%, divide 106.50 by 1.065 = 100.00 (the price before taxes).	Business & Finance

During the physical, they induced him with histamines and induced an asthma attack.  He was rejected when he had an attack.  I would ask a recruiter.

They often will state what the requirements are.  You could also try picking up an application.  Try scheduling a ride along with the local pd to see what it's like and if that might be the route you want to go.  It will also give you an opportunity to talk with the officer and they can provide you with a better idea of what you're getting into.  Best thing to do is talk to someone who's doing it.

question_title: what is facism? [SEP] question_content: i know kinda how it works but how does it work in the big picture? [SEP] best_answer: In the bigger picture when a country's economy is in danger tehn fascism comes to play. The equation is a bt complicated. It is generally beleived that a country is run by a govt but the capitalist lobbist and top officials are the actual show runners. In a situation when the industries of a country have gone into so much profit making that the general people on the streets have run out of purchasing power, political forces have to be bred that will divert the people away from analysing this. One of the proven solutions is to wage a war as that gets the military running and hiring and whatever problems people have, they shut up under the name of patriotism. Keep in mind the post war economy and the massive recruitment in the army for this. Sometimes before waging external wars redistribution of resources in the country solves the problem before a larger war. In effect rulers come up and resort to zenophobia or community pride or something similiar to whip up popular emotions. Thus jews resources were distributed and then in order to live the patriotism hitler waged war. This is how fascism works in the bigger picture.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why is President Bush a really great president? [SEP] question_content: Tell me why you think our president is doing a great job, and deserves more credit than he gets.  \n\nGO BUSH !!!! [SEP] best_answer: How fickle people are, these polls out today are a joke. I would like to see this question posed...what don't you like about Bush, factually, not just off the cuff running your mouth...give me facts.\n\nIsn't it interesting that some 96% of the US population approved of the war in Iraq 4 years ago?  Yet, they don't approve now, sorry folks, you don't just change your mind about war in midstream.  It doesn't work that way.  We didn't have it easy during many wars, and didn't give up and pull out, eventually the tables turned and we were very successful.  I think of the Revolutionary war, WW1 and  WWII.  People seem to forget that we activly fought WWII for 4 years (after it was already in progress for 3 years).  It was awful, it was tough, but we got dragged into it by Japan, just like the terrorists draged us into this one.\n\nSo why is Bush great?  Number one, he has named his priorities and goals and stuck with them.  The economy is very strong, growing so fast the Feds can't raise interest rates fast enough.  I can't see what it is that Americans can blame Bush for when it comes to the economy, most of the damage was done by the terrorists on 9/11.  Bush said he belived in tax cuts, he didn't want new taxes and he wanted Americans to have more money in their pockets so they spent more.  All of the above happened.  I didn't see anyone complaining when they got their $300.00 a few years ago.  The democrats are dying to use taxes to lower the deficit...okay, that means our money folks, you okay with that?\nThere is a time a place for everything, raising taxes during war is not the way to go.\n\nWe have not had another attack on American soil.  If you want to keep the terrorists from attacking innocent Americans, send the military to the terrorists, keep them occupied and kick their asses somewhere else.  The men in the military are all for being out there kicking terrorism in the butt.  That is their job, they signed up for it and trained for it.  They don't just want Americans support they want success, that means letting them finish the job.  Some of these men and women are on their 4th and 5th tours, and wanting to go back for more.\n\nBush tells it like it is.  If he screws up he acknowledges it.  He doesn't mess around with anything.  He gets to the point and moves on.  You can tell how much he learned from his dad and President Regan.  Sometimes he so reminds me of Regan it's astonishing.  \n\nI'm sorry but when Hurricane Katrina came and Bush got the report on the dykes a few days before landfall..what was he going to do about them?  Send peple out to dump dirt on them?  It was too late to rebuild, it was not feasable to get everyone out of the City, hell that shouldn't even be the governments job to do that.  We have been through 3 direct Hurricane landfalls in 2 years where I live in Ft. Pierce, FL (not to mention the 4 indirect storms and depressions) and we took care of ourselves.  This is the land of the elderly.  If we had waited for the government we would have been standing in waist deep water for weeks.   Bush came and saw us, he gave us support, it's more emotional than anything else.  That is what we needed, when you dont' have TV, radio, phone, you feel very isolated.  Having your President come to see you is a great moral booster.  He is very good at that.\n\nBush has reached the point where he really doesn't care what everyone thinks about him.  He is out for doing what he thinks is best for America, not whats best for the social circle.  So if the other countries don't like it well, I'm sorry, but that is the way it is.  As soon as everyone begins to wake up and realize that we are all targets, we will be better off as a nation and a world.  If your President doesn't look after you first, then what good is he?  It's like having a dead beat dad...no thanks, I'll take GW!	Politics & Government

I sure do wish they wouldn't be so hard on fetuses and soft on terrorists. What a bunch of D-bags. [SEP] best_answer: It's not what they're smoking -- Libs just NEED to feel good about themselves.   I use to be a Democrat and somewhat liberal.  It made me feel good to be on the side of the party of the "common man."  It made me feel good to trash the "rich" Republicans.  It made me feel good to be for peace.  It made me feel good to be for equality.  It made me feel good to support social welfare programs.  Then I started reading and listening and thinking and I concluded that today's Democrats are not the Democrats that my parents and grandparents supported (and therefore I supported). They are more like Socialist who want the CENTRALIZED CONTROL OF AMERICA and a political-economic policy that boarders on communism.   The Socialist programs of the New Deal and The Great Society have failed for the most part and are destroying our country.  Now I am much more conservative, and a great deal worried.

IS THE BUSH FAMILY AN AMERICAN ENEMY ALSO?  THE FRIEND OF MY ENEMY IS NOT MY FRIEND. [SEP] best_answer: Because America's enemies are not Bush's enemies. Bush is oil, always has been, and always will be.  The oil industry transcends politics, because the money to be made in oil can literally make or break any countries economy.

[SEP] question_content: He has been left a certain percentage but his mother now wishes to be his guardian ad litern any one know what benefit this would be for him or her [SEP] best_answer: A guardian ad litem (GAL) is an independent attorney or guardian appointed by the court to ensure that the interests of a minor or an incompetent person are being fully protected in a legal proceeding.  The court will appoint a GAL regardless of the fact that the minor or incompetent (called a ward) may have already retained legal representation on his or her own.  This is to ensure the ward is not unduly influenced to make a decision which doesn't really benefit him or herself. It doesn't end the realtionship between your brother and hs current attorney.  \n\nOnce the legal proceeding concludes, the GAL usually ceases in this capacity.  \n\nNext time your brother appears in court, tell him to ask the judge why he or she is appointing a GAL.  The judge will be glad to explain the whole process and answer any of his questions.  His lawyer should be able to explain it in more detail as well.  That's what he's being paid for.

question_title: how much notice is a landlord required to give prior to entering an apartment according to North Carolina law? [SEP] question_content: my sister has an apartment in an upscale college complex, but recently came home to find that her apartment had been gone through, and they had found evidence of a pet on the property. They hung a "removal of pet" notice on her door. We understand that she was in breach of the contract, but we want to know if they unlawfully entered her apartment, and if there is anything we can do about it. She has a roommate that  doesnt actually live there, and sometimes this roommate's mother will come stay in her room, and we think that perhaps that is who complained about the pet. Her and the roommate do not get along. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: I am not sure how N.C. law works exactly...but I can tell you how this would be resolved in Pa.  They probably aren;t that different regardless.  In Pa. a land lord is required to give 24 hours notice unless there is an emergency situation.  I do not see how a pet constitutes an emergency.  I'd also check your contract/lease, although I am sure that this is probably not listed.  As for the pet....your land lord has NO RIGHT to remove a pet of yours from the building.  None.  That is completely outrageous.  He can evict you for violating the lease.  He can ask you to remove the pet.  But he has absolutely no right at all to remove a pet from an apartment.  I'd sue.

[SEP] best_answer: Go to court. Wear a suit.  You can win if the officer who wrote the ticket doesn't show up. \n\nIf they do, you then just explain the facts.  REHEARSE this many times, get the sequence down right so it's clear, don't talk about irrelevant matters such as paint quality, get comfortable with the facts so when you suddenly realize where you are it doesn't matter.  Think about their questions "But part of your car WAS outside the space?"  and your answer "Your Honor, my car is a Toyota, with a wheelbase of x inches. The average midsize has a y inch wheelbase.  The space in question is Z inches, and the average space is Q.  They created a space so small that few cars can legitimately fit into it, so they basically have set a trap for anyone that parks there without a tape measure." \n\nWorst case, you lose and pay the $105.

What do you think?  Do you really think this will hurt America? \n\nWhat was the Repubs. plan?  What was going to be done for us, besides suppressing medical technology via stem cell banning or repressing individual autonomy by interfering w/ women's and gay rights? Enlighten me please!? [SEP] best_answer: I Can't enlighten you I am with you...\nWhat they are saying is...By saying Dems do not have a plan...\nDemocrats do not have a plan that Republicans support or care about...they will increasing minimum wagemakes businesses shut down and prices go up...Well really..Oregon has had an increased minumun wage and have grown jobs by 10%...

question_title: Why does't America attack North Korea? [SEP] question_content: America attacked Iraq just because they possessed weapons of mass destruction.\nBut there were nothing. Then Bush have changed the reason of the war to liberating Iraqi from Saddam.\nAs you know, North Korea is making nuke weapons and Kim Jong-il oppresses people.\nActually many people has died from starvation.\nHow do you explain this kind of double standards. [SEP] best_answer: Well, considering that both North and South Korea still have their weapons aimed at each other, the window of opportunity just isn't there.  The terrain is god aweful, it's extremely cold and hot as hell.  The US forces alreay stationed there would take a huge hit and the capital of South Korea would cease to exist.  So lets hope no one gets too cavalier and lets diplomacy work things out.  If we're applauled by the loss of life with the war on terror, wait and see what happens if the Korean war resumes.  A little side not, the Korea's are technically still at war.  They have been under a cease fire for about fifty years, hence their weapons are still aimed at each other.	Politics & Government

question_title: Is it a soldier's duty to say no to an illegal war? [SEP] question_content: It is an obligation as a leader to speak out against the willful misconduct at the highest level of the chain of command.\n\nhttp://www.commondreams.org/views06/0616-31.htm [SEP] best_answer: No Soldiers, according to the book , have a duty to obey any illegal or immoral order or command. Thus no soldier can be compelled to act illegally or immorally. However a claim of an illegal war is defined by the seated government and the juxtaposition of the Geneva Accords & Conventions. As for the chain of command, the proper channels and protocals define proper obligations for tose initiated, like them or not!	Politics & Government

When the President's salary was raised in 1909, the inflation adjusted rate was $1,419,792.55 in 2001 dollars, compared to his last raise to $400,000, less than a third as much.	Politics & Government

question_title: y do Iran looks for nuclear weapon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I dont think Iran looks for nukes now as they always claim they are looking for nuclear plants for electricity but it is also true that the process of enrichment of uranium will enable Iran to make nukes specially with blue prints that CIA gave Iran for making nukes some years ago.\nit also must be noted that after decompositon of USSR there are vast amount of uranium on sale on underground military black market and Iran was able to buy some and I think it already have and also Iran has missles which can target Israel from its northern borders so if they really want to wipe Israel they can.\nFact that I want to tell is some of famous Israel leaders are born and grown in Iran and Israel is originally enemy of arab countries which Iranians have problems with them for so long.\n The most hostile act of Iranian governments is some support for anti israel groups specially palastinians which I think is comparable with US budget for overthrowing Iran government and I think both parties gain more from each other.\nits exactly similar to cold war where both parties have nukes but the only output was some James Bond movies.

No shells other than his were found at the scene.  Then the cops pull up to my house, I walked out expecting to make a report on my car but I found myself looking at shotguns and pistols and no one has ever heard my side of the story.

question_title: What is an instrument that searches emergency channels? [SEP] question_content: i think it might be police something or something police or maybe anttenia if you think it's anntena could you spell it right for me. [SEP] best_answer: its called a police scanner... you can access any police, fire, EMS, or private channels with it. you need an antenna which has to be secured to the exterior of your vehicle (assuming you want it for a car). police scanners allow a person to only listen... you aren't allowed to speak on these channels, or access them in any way unless you have fire department/ police department credentials. you can access your local fire/ police websites and it will tell you what channel they are broadcasting at. although a heads up... if you dont understand police and fire radio code then it is pointless to get a radio. you can get a small scanner at radio shack, or other electronic stores for about 150 dollars. there are only a few that are commercially available to the general public, and are usually in the range from 100 to 400 dollars. your most basic scanner will be able to do anything you can need though, because it provides access to hundreds of channels, and will give you a chance to select your favorite channels.

[SEP] best_answer: Bush is no Christian, if he was he would not allow all these things to happen to our country. I believe that this man was born to destroy America. The first thing he did was to take the surplus, that everyone in this country worked so hard for, and distribute it amongs his round table friends. Thank God he was not given a chance to put our Social security dollars in the stock market, a place where his frinds could make billions more on the hard working class. Given enough time, this man would cause more damage to our country, and the world, than the evil Hitler himself.....KECK	Politics & Government
question_title: Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? [SEP] question_content: In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? [SEP] best_answer: By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at "SoundPolitics.com")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: "the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . "  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure "conspired" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that "there must be something to it".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this "conspiracy" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a "bubble" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much 	Politics & Government
