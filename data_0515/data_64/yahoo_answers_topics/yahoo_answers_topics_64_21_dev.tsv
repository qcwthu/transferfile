question_title: Am I the only one who gets hate mail from the Neanderthal Neocons? [SEP] question_content: Just wondering if they send this stuff to all liberals, or if I'm just the lucky one. In the past two days, I've been called a:\n\nhomosexual, a p*ssy, a Communist, an imbecile, and an ignorant lemming.\n\nIt's been suggested to be that I:\neat sh*t, eat ****, and die.\n\nSo, does anyone else experience stuff like this from the right when they open mail that starts out: You've received a message from another user! ?\n\nNote: These are actual emails, not responses to questions I've posted. [SEP] best_answer: I experience the same from the Left wing.  Cuts both ways...there are hateful people across the full spectrum and our job is to recognize it on both sides (so we don't become subject to marginalizations for showing subjectivity) and ignore them.\n\nI have received death threats from pacifists for editorials I have written about 9/11.  I have received physical threats in my classes for speaking against various topics.  The e-mail...never ending.  That is just the way some people think.  They are not smart enough to hold a debate and think that what they are doing will intimidate the other side enough to silence the other side.  The fact is this shows they do not know WHY they believe what they believe and thus are unable to intelligently defend what they believe.	Politics & Government

Look there are treaties and laws that we must live by. Even the fuhrer himself says this when it is convenient for him to say(like talking about illegal aliens) war on terror or not I don't think anyone should give up 1 right under the constitution for any reason.No matter what anyone says give up one and others will surely follow.

question_title: Why do Americans feel the need to demonize people who feel differently on issues than they do? [SEP] question_content: As a follow-up, if you are one of the many people who see "liberals" "conservatives" "republicans" or "democrats" as hating America and all it stands for, why do you feel compelled to attack someone based on your image of what they believe without discussing the issues at hand? [SEP] best_answer: Most people seem to take it personally when a conflicting viewpoint is brought up.  It can be so frustrating when people are blatantly disregarding viewpoints.  I have trouble when I am trying to have a rational discussion with someone and they are obviously not looking at the merits of my own argument and just see it as an attack on themselves.    What are you supposed to do when someone is being completely closed minded and willfully ignorant?  It's difficult.\n\nThere is no more rational discourse or comprimise, only two sides of which you need to pick one.  People aren't even expected to be able to back up their own beliefs as much as attack others' beliefs blindly.  I feel your pain, and hopefully there will be a time when this can change.

The size of the two animals is in direct proportion to the size of power each party possessed before the election. \n\nIt also reminds of Virginia's State seal.

question_title: did ya get cash or debt? [SEP] question_content: Everyone is getting in on the cash, except the American tax payers, they get the debt.\n\nAs President Bush embarks on a new effort to shore up public support for the war in Iraq, an uncle of the commander in chief is collecting $2.7 million in cash and stock from the recent sale of a company that profited from the war. \nA report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that William H.T. Bush collected just under $1.9 million in cash plus stock valued at more than $800,000 from the sale of Engineered Support Systems Inc. to DRS Technologies of New Jersey.\nThe $1.7-billion deal closed Jan. 31. Both firms have extensive military contracts.\nWilliam Bush was a director of Engineered Support Systems. Recent SEC filings show he was paid cash and DRS stock in exchange for shares and options he obtained as a director.\nBefore DRS purchased it, Missouri-based ESSI experienced record growth as a result of expanded U.S. military contracts — many to supply U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe contracts, some awarded on a no-bid basis, include a $77-million deal to refit military vehicles with armor for use in Iraq. [SEP] best_answer: Well we got debt too, my island is so rich they can afford to give every person living here legally and ilegally $1 mil and still have change,but what do we have instead a massive oil boom and half the nation can't afford to put a roof over their own heads, and the Government borrows $800mil to build a massive stadium for cricket ( just to give you an idea the island has 1.5 million people) and they put it in the middle of a settlement of squatters. Hospitals are short of doctors and medicine and equipment, schools are in terrible condition and the roads....well!!!! Where is the money going? Nobody knows and this is after years of being technically debt free as an island and then experiencing an oil boom. So it's not just the American taxpayers that are getting the shaft I think it's all of us.	Politics & Government
question_title: Is this guy any better to take rummy`s place? [SEP] question_content: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gates [SEP] best_answer: That is a very good question. Bush put him there so that's way up in the air. Time will tell. \nIt seems very odd, that the day after elections, Rumsfeld steps down. Makes me wonder why he's cutting and running. I think Maliki's call for us to keep troops on the ground in Iraq, Saddam's death sentence, and Rumsfeld's resignation are closely tied. I have a feeling there will be more fallout to come in the next few months. Rice? Cheney? Or with any luck, Bush? I suppose that would be asking too much.	Politics & Government
question_title: Who would you like to see become U.S. President in '08? [SEP] question_content: Who would you like to see become U.S. President in '08? And 'WHY'? [SEP] best_answer: Joseph Biden. He's got the most overall experience, has worked through 6 or so administrations now, and esp. has the most foreign policy experience since he's the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Compared to most of the politicians running he doesn't just have sketchy details about what to do about Iraq, or no details, or just "pull the troops out" thus leaving Iraq in civil war, and let's face it, I think Colin Powell was right we do have some kind of moral and/or ethical duty not to just run out of Iraq and leave it in total quaqmire status, i.e. the Pottery Barn rule. Biden has http://planforiraq.com/ which details an actual plan for dealing with the situation with Iraq. \n\nHe is probably the only candidate that I have seen that could step into the job and be able to handle it well, because it's going to be a major mess by the time Bush steps out of office (well it already is, but could be even worse). Additionally, he has the extensive experience to deal with any other crisis that may come up. \n\nHe also is very diplomatic, can "work well with others", so I think he will not alienate the Republicans like Bush has alienated many Democrats. Note that the website for his campaign is called "uniteourstates.com".\n\nI also think he will be more easily electable than Hillary. I think Hillary might win the Democrat nomination, but then not win the overall election because she is an overall polarizing kind of person, you either love her or hate her kind of candidate. Some people I've talked to will not vote for her; seem turned off by her. I'm not saying that's right, but it's something that needs to be considered. I personally didn't like her whole stance on the war; she was one of the last Democrat senators that seemed to think the Iraq war was justified. \n\nI think a great pairing would be Biden and Barack Obama as  Vice President. Obama doesn't have nearly enough experience to step into the Presidency yet, but that would give him a great position to be in I would think for the following election, plus give Biden some of Obama's star quality on the ticket.  I love Obama, but heard him on Larry King with his details on Iraq, very sketchy with any details, only about 20 seconds worth, not well thought out it seemed; he just doesn't have the knowledge and depth of Biden yet. But I think Obama will be awesome in 6 or so years!	Politics & Government

question_title: democrats wanna up the minimum wage? [SEP] question_content: are they trying to destroy the countries economy? upping minimum wage means inflation to the max. im sorry the poorer working class cant afford to live on $6.15 per hour, but upping it for them will cause prices to rise anyways, so it wont even make any difference...we'll fall faster and faster into depression and our enemies will become stronger and stronger. [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately, many people do not understand economics whatsoever. \n\nPeople who support a minimum wage should have a maximum-earnings cap placed upon them. The earnings could be used as capital so minimum wage earners could get more schooling and develop their own businesses. Pelosi & Kerry & Kennedy are rich enough.\n\nThe minimum wage schtick is just a ploy to get votes from the uneducated. It results in inflation and more jobs going overseas.\nIf it hasn't worked it over the past 40 years, it won't solve the problem now.	Politics & Government

question_title: What are the negative and positve effects of urban renewal? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I agree with the first poster, I would like to see more of it happen. It might not work out too great short term but I think it would pay off in the long run. Hopefully it would help diversify more communities, and help people learn about differant cultures and point of views. I think it would also be beneficial to the school systems that would in turn take in more money and even things out a little more. Might be a lessor crime rate and less of a gang problem as well. But on the other hand it could also be devastating to the inner city. Forcing them into an even smaller area and having even worse problems. So yea, I don't know really..	Politics & Government
question_title: Why is there are always labour problems, union problems, strikes, hartals more in Kerla/India? [SEP] question_content: Kerala state in India is called "God's Own Country" - and yet there is an apprehension in the minds of entepreuners setting up industries with labour force. \n\nVery few days pass , it is presumed ,without a Strike, Lock Out, Hartals and Unions threatening the management/sometimes the government to forcing them into ceding their unjustified demands, causing great revenue loss to the state.\n\nClaimimg to be 100% literate stae they should realise the pros and cons of loss of manhours and productivity.\n\nYet most of these people from Kerala working outside the state / country have proved to be ONE of the BEST work force any country could find !\n\n\nIs Kerala shifting from "Gods Own Country" to "Gods Forsaken Country" ? [SEP] best_answer: The best way of looking at this problem is a multifaceted one: first of all the dominence of the leftist parties dominated by the unions and secondly the understanding of the voter when he puts his vote - does he actually value that vote - if not why is he allowing governance of this type.\n\nThe other aspect of looking at this problem is that labour laws are shifted more to the employee - which is good I guess if you are the employee - but does make it difficult for the employer/entrepreneur  to sack someone who is a poor worker.\n\nBut Kerala is still definitely not God's forsaken country - its a beautiful land - and it can change with more people realising that change is better than resisting it for the sake of resisting it.\n\nHave a nice day...

question_title: Please provide economic and policy arguments for and against nationwide adoption of a so-called "living wage." [SEP] question_content: The U.S. currently has in place a nationwide minimum wage which guarantees most unskilled labor currently $5.15 per hour.  Many states and/or cities with higher costs of living have a somewhat higher minimum wage.  Social activists are lobbying for adoption of a living wage which, unlike the current minimum wage policies, is supposed to give unskilled workers a better opportunity to live above the poverty line.  Please give me your best arguments for or against implementing a living wage policy in place of the minimum wage laws. [SEP] best_answer: The biggest losers when Living Wage laws are implemented are often the ones who are supposed to benefit.  This is because employers are forced by such laws to decide whether the affected employees are actually worth the extra money, and if they aren't then they lose their jobs.  And the folks who disproportionately hold minimum wage jobs are immigrants and teenagers.  For immigrants this forces them to find work that is often off the books and outside the protections of labor law.  Teenagers are also penalized by not getting that important experience that first jobs afford.  This has repercussions later in life, since future jobs and salary are contingent on experience.  Black male teenagers are the most affected.\n\nIn addition to the discrimination and unemployment that living wage laws engender, there is also the fact that such laws actually contribute to skyrocketing cost-of-living.  Think about it, if you are a small business owner who is forced to pay all your employees $10/hour then you are going to raise your prices to cover your cost.	Politics & Government

question_title: Are we voters the actual "boss" of Congress? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Every two years Americans have the opportunity to vote for the House of Represenatives and 33-34 Senators.\n\nThe problem currently,  if you want to call it a problem I do,  is that the districts have been so "gerry mandered" that the districts are pretty much set as to what political party they are going to go for.\n\nFrom what I can tell its largely based on economics.  In speaker hastert's district home ownership is like 78 percent, and in nancy pelosi, top democrat, its like 29 percent, \nthere seems to be an almost one to one correlation with home ownership and voting republican because as you look down the list and the percentage there arent that many "51% and above who go the other way - democrat"\n\nbecause of how the districts are drawn, it becomes harder for someone of the opposite party to become elected,\n\nsince the voters have a very specific criteria,  and turnout is "traditionally republican" or "traditionally democratic"\n\nthe system makes it hard because elections lately are about TURNOUT of your base,  not PERSUASIAN\n\nbeause of this the elected officials have simple messages, \n\nIm george bush,  im for safety,  im working hard,	Politics & Government

Their actions are living up to the 'axis of evil' title that mr.bush said. For the safety and stability of the innocent people of the region, their nuclear facilities should be bombed. They looked like a religeous people with great morals before. Now they look like fanatics who want to wipe Isreal off the map and are developming weapons of mass destruction. Korea is unlikely to use any of its stockpile. Iran is more likely to use theirs to kill innocent people (Israel). And if you can justify using nuclear weapons there, where would they stop?

[SEP] best_answer: If you've already filed the I-751, you should have received a notice from USCIS extending the validity of the I-551 for another year, which you would then use to re-enter the US along with the expired greencard.  \n\nIf you did not receive the extension notice, if you were in the US, you would have been able to make an infopass appointment to receive a stamp in the passport to extend the I-551 another year.\n\nWithout the extension notice, I think your wife will be denied re-entry to the US.  Lying to the CBP and entering as a visitor will not work if her passport is scaned, as all her immigration information is available to the CBP, just by scanning her passport.	Politics & Government

question_title: what is quiet deed? [SEP] question_content: What is quiet deed, can anyone sue for it? [SEP] best_answer: An action to quiet title is a lawsuit brought in a court having jurisdiction over land disputes, in order to establish a party's title to real property against anyone and everyone, and thus "quiet" any challenges or claims to the title. It comprises a complaint that the ownership (title) of a parcel of land or other real property is defective in some fashion, typically where title to the property is ambiguous - for example, where it has been conveyed by a quitclaim deed through which the previous owner disclaims all interest, but does not promise that good title is conveyed. Such an action may also be brought to dispel a restraint on alienation or another party's claim of a nonpossessory interest in land, such as an easement by prescription.	Politics & Government

This is also before 9/11. The standards are lower now because they cant keep people in the army even today.\n\nI would go to the recruiters office and just straight up tell them what the crime was. They have a book and will look up the offense for you right there and then. It might require a waiver. If its only a couple of waivers they might work with you, if its too many waivers they wont wast their time, these waivers have to pass through their chain of command, if theres a chance someone in the  COC will  deny it they wont even look at you.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Genome projects are scientific endeavours that ultimately aim to determine the complete genome sequence of an organism (be it an animal, a plant, a fungus, a bacterium, an archaean, a protist or a virus). The genome sequence for any organism requires the DNA sequences for each of the chromosomes in an organism to be determined. For bacteria, which usually have just one chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. Humans, with 23 pairs of chromosomes will require 23 separate chromosome sequences in order to represent the completed genome.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a landmark genome project and some have argued that the era of genomics is one of the more fundamental advances in human history.

question_title: If the universe is expanding, then what is it expanding into? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well there are lots of things I do not completely understand about the structure of the universe. \n\nFor example, some current theories are that our 4 dimensional space-time continuum is just part of a higher dimensional entity, where some of the other dimensions are rolled up. However, the time dimension of our 4 dimensional environment is clearly much different than the spatial dimensions, since we appear to only be able to travel in one direction along the time dimension, although many of the equations capturing the physical laws of our universe are invariant when we replace time with -time.\n\nThe expansion that people refer to when they say that the universe is expanding refers to the entire 4 dimensional space-time continuum and possibly some  of the other dimensions as well. This gets very hard to visualize. What I do is think of us as ants living on the surface of a balloon that is being slowly inflated, so the dimensions of the balloon are increasing, and distant parts of the ant's space are becoming increasingly distant. However, this is probably a very limited analogy. \n\nTo get a better picture, you need to consult someone who has thought very hard and very carefully about what the universe is, or supposedly is.

question_title: What is a TSB tube/plate? [SEP] question_content: More specifically, what can I determine about the organism (bacteria) that was grown in the medium? Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: TSB stands for Tryptic Soy Broth. It's just a nutrient broth that facilitates bacterial growth by supplying its nutritional needs. Most bacteria will grow on TSB plates, but if they do not, that is usually a sign that the bacteria you are trying to grow has very specific needs. It can also mean that the conditions were not right for growth of that bacteria though. For example, different types of bacteria grow at different temperatures. If you take a sample from the human body and try to grow it at room temperature, you will not get much growth. Also, some bacteria are anaerobic and cannot tolerate oxygen. If you incubate your plates aerobically, these organisms will not grow.\n\nIn a TSB tube, it is easy to see how a bacterium reacts to oxygen. If you only have growth at the very bottom of the tube, your species of bacteria cannot tolerate oxygen and is termed an obligate anaerobe. If you have growth all throughout the tube (but maybe a little more on top near the surface), you have a facultative anaerobe: it grows more efficiently in the presence of oxygen, but can also grow without it. Growth throughout the tube may also mean you have an aerotolerant bacteria. Aerotolerant bacteria never utilize oxygen, but dont have a problem growing in it's presence. Last but not least, if you have growth strictly at the surface, it shows that your bacteria needs oxygen for growth, and is an obligate aerobe.\n\nIt may seem confusing, but I hope it helped!

[SEP] question_content: Sometimes, I will see that the current temperature reported on, for example, Yahoo!Weather says "37" with a low of 40 and high of 51. [SEP] best_answer: Weather forecasting is not an exact science. There are numerous factors that effect the actual temperature.

question_title: Frogs can be frozen, then unfrozen? [SEP] question_content: And they're still alive???\nReally? [SEP] best_answer: The common wood frog freezes solid every winter and then, come spring, defrosts and mates. \n\nFrogs that survive freezing excite our imagination with visions of immortality. Underlining this excitement is the unexpected: our experience tells us that freezing kills. We've all read news stories of people who have lost fingers or toes to extreme cold, or even their lives. Thus, a whole animal that can survive freezing comes as a shock. Yet during the past two decades we have also read or even experienced the successes of in vitro fertilization, which involves the routine storage of sperm and embryos in a frozen state at cryogenic temperatures (-40°F or lower). So why is the survival of a frozen frog at 26°F surprising? \n\nThoroughly confused? You should be. Freezing has a yin-yang effect on biological materials—it can both preserve and destroy tissue. This paradoxical nature has led to two different fields of science and medicine built around freezing: cryopreservation and cryosurgery.\n\nSurviving the deep freeze\nLife is a complex set of electrochemical reactions. The rate at which chemical reactions take place depends on temperature, and usually the lower the temperature the lower the rate. At absolute zero Kelvin (-460°F), the rate is zero. Therefore, lowering the temperature of biological materials such as cells, organs, or entire organisms to absolute zero causes life to stop indefinitely. If a person or his or her body parts could survive the excursion to absolute zero and back, scientists and physicians could theoretically use such freezing as a vehicle to transport that person or parts to any point in the future. \n\nBecause we humans are mostly water, however, any journey into the supercool is physically traumatic. At about 31°F, the water in our bodies begins to freeze. It starts at this temperature (rather than 32°F) because biological water is in the form of a solution, mainly of ions or charged atoms. The survival of any cells during freezing depends at minimum on the rate the temperature changes. For most organisms, even the slowest cooling results in an assault on their cells that is just too great.\n\nResulting cell damage is related to the dissolved substances or solutes in biological water, to the cell membrane properties, and to the fact that ice has a very tight crystallographic structure and cannot contain solutes. When biological materials freeze, the solution between cells usually freezes first. Solutes found in the original solution are ejected and concentrated in the unfrozen space between the ice crystals. Cells usually remain unfrozen though supercooled.\n\nIn order to balance out the resulting difference in potential energy between the inside and outside of the cell, water leaves the cell through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, this loss of water causes an increase in the ionic concentration and leads to chemical damage. Interestingly, ions, not ice crystals, trigger cell injury during freezing. Theoretically, an infinitely fast rate to absolute zero would eliminate this harm. This is not possible, of course, and at higher cooling rates the supercooling of water in cells causes ice to form within those cells, which also brings about damage.\n\nNatural antifreezes\nCells in freeze-tolerant wood frogs experience the same mechanism of freezing injury as any other creatures' cells. The frogs freeze very slowly to a temperature often several degrees below freezing. This should destroy the frog's cells, yet those cells and the frog as a whole survive. How? A primary mechanism is through the production of glucose and its incorporation in the frog's cell. By lowering the amount of water that leaves the cell during freezing, the glucose offers protection against the rise in ionic concentration and excessive cell shrinkage, thereby reducing chemical harm.\n\nWhile the wood frog spent millions of years perfecting the use of such chemicals, scientists in the field of cryobiology disco	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Is matter mass? [SEP] question_content: Really what i want to know is that if matter is mass and there is such a thing as antimatter [ which there is ] how come it can be measured in grams and micrograms and stuff, also if mass equals energy than how can antimatter produce ebnergy [ which it does] at 100% efficiency. [SEP] best_answer: In physics, matter is everything that is constituted of elementary fermions. Matter occupies space and has mass. It is composed predominantly of atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. All gauge bosons (of which the photon is one), which mediate the four fundamental forces, are not considered matter, even though they certainly have energy and also some mass.\n\nMatter thus consists of quarks and leptons. There are six types of quarks (strange, charm, top, bottom, up, and down) which combine to form hadrons, primarily baryons and mesons, through the strong interaction and are actually thought to always be confined. Among the baryons are the proton and the neutron, which further combine to form the nuclei of all elements of the periodic table. Usually these nuclei are surrounded by a cloud of electrons. A nucleus with as many electrons as protons, which is thus electrically neutral, is called an atom, otherwise it is an ion.\n\nIn bulk, matter can exist in several different phases, according to particle density and energy density or alternatively pressure and temperature. These phases include gases, plasmas, liquids, fluids, superfluids, solids, and Bose-Einstein condensates. As circumstances change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called phase transitions, and their energetics are studied in the field of thermodynamics. In small quantities, matter can exhibit properties that are entirely different from those of bulk material.\n\nHomogeneous matter has a definite composition and properties and any amount of it has the same composition and properties. It may be a mixture, such as brass, or elemental, like pure iron. Heterogeneous matter, such as granite, does not have a definite composition.\n\nIn chemistry, matter is often restricted to chemical substances, as elementary particles such as quarks and leptons are not known to participate in chemical reactions.

question_title: is a snowflake traveling the same speed  from begining to end? [SEP] question_content: if everthing travels at the same speed why doesnt it hurt when it lands on you [SEP] best_answer: Snow flakes do not fall at a constant speed. They start out slow, and will often be caught in updrafts that will halt or slow their downward progress or even make them temporarily rise. Snow flakes will accelerate until they reach their terminal velocity [1]. \n\nBy the time we encounter snowflakes, they are falling at a roughly constant rate, as long as there is no wind. This is called the terminal velocity, which is reached when the acceleration of gravity is balanced by the frictional force of the air [1].\n\nFor something like a snowflake, the terminal velocity is usually very slow. According to the attached reference [2], the terminal velocity of snowflakes varies between 1.5 mph and 9 mph, depending on the shape and density of the snowflake (for comparison, human beings fall at about 125 mph). The reference [3] gives a more complete summary of the terminal velocities of a variety of different snow flake shapes. A discussion of the relation between snowflake size and terminal velocity is also attached [4](there appears to be some controversy about the correlation of these variables). \n\nThe fastest snowflakes are those that are "rimed", that is, that have fallen through regions of supercooled water vapor, so extra ice builds up on the snowflake as it falls.  \n\nIf one couples the very minimal terminal velocity of snowflakes with their tiny mass, they will have a very small momentum, translating into a tiny force delivered to your skin, so they will hurt very little. The typical mass of a snowflake is 3 mg [5]. It would have a kinetic energy of about 6.7419e-007 Joules at terminal velocity, and a falling 220 lb man has a kinetic energy of about 1.56e6 Joules at terminal velocity. That is, it would take 2.31e11 falling snowflakes to produce the kinetic energy of one falling 220 lb body; about 230,000 million snow flakes, or about 1.53 million pounds of snow. \n\nIt might be noted that snowflakes fall much slower than raindrops, which fall at 5 to 20 mph [6], so raindrops can deliver more force than snowflakes can for "precipitation objects" (snowflakes or raindrops) of the same mass. \n\nAll of this analysis assumes that there is no wind involved. Of course, if the snow and/or rain is being driven by wind, it can strike at greater speeds (but maybe less than the speed of the wind, given the air resitance of the drop or snowflake). \n\nHail stones can have much greater terminal velocities (40 mph for pea size hail, and greater terminal velocities for bigger size hail)[7]. Therefore, hail stones can really do serious damage. Having grown up in regions that get a lot of hail, I have seen hail stones as big as grapefruit that break car windows, dent cars, punch holes in buildings, plow under crops, strip leaves and bark and branches from trees, and would probably injure or kill people caught in the barrage. A hail stone that is 2 inches in diameter (51 mm) will fall with a terminal velocity of almost 72 mph [8,9], delivering 28.9 Joules of energy. I guarantee, if that hits you, you will feel it.

question_title: Conservation of momentum? [SEP] question_content: I came across this problem while studying for physics: A 92-kg astronaut and a 1200-kg satellite are at rest relative to the space shuttle. The astronaut pushes on the satellite, giving it a speed of 0.14 m/s directly away from the shuttle. Seven and a half seconds later the astronaut comes into contact with the shuttle. What was the initial distance from the shuttle to the astronaut? Can someone please explain how to solve this problem? Any help is highly appreciated. [SEP] best_answer: from what I remember conservation of momentum states that: \nm1v1=m2v2\nwhere in this case, m1= mass of the astronaut\nm2=mass of the sat.\nv1= unknown\nv2=speed of the sat.\n\nyou can find the speed by solving the above equation for v1:\nv1=m2v2/m1\n\nFrom there, once you have the speed you can calculate the distance by multiplying the speed (v1) times the time (7.5 s) given in the problem.

question_title: Is there anyone out there who can help me find institution for HVAC training course, 1 or 2 days here in Mla? [SEP] question_content: I already tried Meralco, Tesda, they don't have training or seminar for HVAC. [SEP] best_answer: First of all, you need more time to become an HVAC Technician.\nThere are no 1 or 2 day courses. If you mean seminars, then there may be technical schools that offer them. However, seminars will not make you a technician. Seminars, mostly, touch on certain portions of a course, not everything you need to know or would want to know. Meaning they may be offered  to beginners or advanced.\n\nYou may try the local yellow pages under HVAC training or Air Condtioning Training or Technical Schools.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Can you solve this??? [SEP] question_content: a jet is traveling at 720 mph towards a thunderstorm. when the pilot sees a lightning bolt, the jet is 8 and a half miles away from the storm. when will the pilot hear the thunder from the lightning bolt? (sound takes 5 seconds to travel a mile.)\n\nexplain. [SEP] best_answer: 720 mph = 12 miles/min = 1 mile every 5 seconds.\n\nSo the jet is traveling at the speed of sound. The plane meets the sound half way 4 1/4 miles.\n\nNote: If he were flying away from the lightning, the sound would never catch him.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: A penguin in Africa . What happens if we bring a pengin to Africa ? lives ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are penguins in Africa, which belong to genus Spheniscus. However, Antarctic species would suffer from excess heating (they have very insulated bodies) and probably die. \nThe African jackass penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is a small species. In fact, all continental penguins that live in South America, Australia, and even the Galapagos islands are small (smaller size helps to better dissipate excess heat). \nCheck penguin species by geographical area here:\nhttp://www.penguins.cl/penguins-region.htm	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is double integrale {(x^y + y^x) dx dy}? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: god man.  what kind of horrible painful calculus class are you taking?\n\nfirst integrate over dx.  the integral of x^y dx is just a power integral, so you have y*x^(y-1).  the integral of y^x dx is just an exponential, so you have y^x/ln y.\n\nnow integrate y*x^(y-1) + y^x/ln y over dy.  and there, my friend, is where i stop because frankly i can't be arsed to do something so brain-curdling.  actually the first term doesn't look so bad, i think if you integrate it by parts it should come out in one step.  don't really want to think about doing the 2nd one.\n\nyou might consider trying some kind of fancy thing like transforming to polar coordinates or something.  might make it easier.\n\nbtw you should know about this site:\nhttp://integrals.wolfram.com/	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Does anyone know how to easily make "aero-gel"? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Unless you have an autoclave for doing supercritical drying, you won't be able to make a true aerogel.  Supercritical removal of the solvent is critical (pun intended) to making aerogels because in the supercritical region, there are not distinct liquid and vapor phases with large molar volume differences-- just a single fluid phase.  This nearly eliminates the shrinkage and cracking that typically accompanies drying of a gel under non-supercritical conditions.\n\nWithout an autoclave, you'd be restricted to making xerogels or ambigels -- low-density, high-surface-area materials that are made by simple drying of gels.  \n\nSee source.

question_title: Any Stratagies?? [SEP] question_content: How many 50g birds moving horizontally at 10m/s would have to fly at the windshield of a 10,000kg airplane traveling 125m/s horizontally in order to stop the plane momentarily? Assume birds stick to the windshield and ignore the thrust of the engines. [SEP] best_answer: I would say use conservation of momentum.\n\nmb*vb + mp*vp = 0\n\n(x*0.05)*(10) + 10000*(-125) = 0\n\nIt equals zero since the plane has a final velocity of zero (as would the birds, I'd imagine!) "x" is the number of birds.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Area bounded by ln(x) and x-2? [SEP] question_content: How do you calculate the area bounded by ln(x) and x-2?\nAs I can't solve ln(x)=x-2 I'm not sure what to do here. [SEP] best_answer: You're trying to equate them.  What you really need to do is take their difference and then take the integral of that term:\n\nA = ∫(lnx - (x-2))dx = ∫lnx dx - ∫(x-2)dx\n\nLooks a little easier now, eh?\n\nThere's still a problem.  To find the limits of integration, you have to solve the 2 eqns simultaneously to get the intersection points.  I don't think there is an algebraic way to do that, so here are the limits (determined numerically); x = .158594 and x = 3.1465	Science & Mathematics
question_title: hi,do you think tht teachers are good? [SEP] question_content: no most of teacher is bad [SEP] best_answer: As with all professions, there are people who really like what they do AND are good at teaching. There are others who like what they do BUT are not any good at explaining anything, or simply lack the knowledge (believe me, I work at a school for teachers and some are abysmally ignorant!! and still get to go out and teach). And there are others who don´t like teaching but have to do it (because of the pay, or academic requirements). Those are the worst, I think. \nBut luckily you'll have a good mix of different kinds of teachers. Next time that you feel like attacking a teacher, please stop and think that maybe he/she's just tired and disheartened, and needs some good attitude from the students. I know that a good response works for me!	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What are the possible causes of Hydrogen cooler leakages of a 248MVA Generator? [SEP] question_content: Cooling water quality is being well maintained vis a vis pH & Dissolved oxygen content. The same water is being used in other coolers with out any complaints of corrosion. is this phenomena electrical related? [SEP] best_answer: Using two or three standard cylinders of helium mixed with air or CO2 as a tracer gas the generator can be tested, repaired and re-tested prior to being filled with hydrogen for operation.\n\nLeak testing of operational generators is easily accomplished using one a hydrogen detector. This test is performed in the same manner as the helium test and provides similar test sensitivity.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: can you explain gm>>1/rds for MOS transistors? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I believe you are referring to the transconductance of a MOS transistor.  gm >> 1/rds must mean that the transconductance must be much larger that 1.  "rds" must be the unit of transconductance (which is not typically shown) possibly radian*seconds.  This might be given to you so as to simplify a calculation.  For example is you have a term anywhere in your calculations that looks like this: (gm+1) you can change it to just: (gm).  This can often simplify complex algebra that may arise.

question_title: What path does blood take to get throught the entire body? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the human body, the heart is normally situated slightly to the left of the middle of the thorax, underneath the sternum (breastbone). It is enclosed by a sac known as the pericardium and is surrounded by the lungs. The apex is the blunt point at the base of the heart. A stethoscope can be placed directly over the apex and count the beats. In normal adults, its mass is 250-350 g, but extremely diseased hearts can be up to 1000 g in mass. It consists of four chambers, the two upper atria (singular: atrium) and the two lower ventricles.\n\nA septum divides the right atrium and ventricle from the left atrium and ventricle, preventing blood from passing between them. Valves between the atria and ventricles (atrioventricular valves) maintain coordinated unidirectional flow of blood from the atria to the ventricles.The ventricular systole consists of the contraction of the ventricles and flow of blood into the circulatory system. Again, once all the blood empties from the ventricles, the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves close. Finally complete cardiac diastole involves relaxation of the atria and ventricles in preparation for refilling with circulating blood.\n\nThe function of the right side of the heart (see right heart) is to collect deoxygenated blood from the body and pump it into the lungs so that carbon dioxide can be dropped off and oxygen picked up. This happens through a process called diffusion. The left side (see left heart) collects oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the body. On both sides, the lower ventricles are thicker than the upper atria.\n\nOxygen-depleted or deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium through two great veins, the superior vena cava which drains the upper part of the body and the inferior vena cava that drains the lower part. The blood then passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs, through the pulmonary artery. In the lungs gaseous exchange takes places and the blood releases carbon dioxide into the lung cavity and picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood then flows through pulmonary veins to the left atrium. From the left atrium this newly oxygenated blood passes through the mitral valve (also called the bicuspid valve) to enter the left ventricle. The left ventricle then pumps the blood through the aorta to the entire body. Even the lungs take some of the blood supply from the aorta via bronchial arteries.\n\nThe left ventricle is much more muscular (1.3 - 1.5 cm thick) than the right (0.3 - 0.5 cm thick) as it has to pump blood around the entire body, which involves exerting a considerable force to overcome the vascular pressure. As the right ventricle needs to pump blood only to the lungs, it requires less muscle.\n\nEven though the ventricles lie below the atria, the two vessels through which the blood exits the heart (the pulmonary artery and the aorta) leave the heart at its top side.\n\nThe contractile nature of the heart is due to the presence of cardiac muscle in its wall which can work continuously without fatigue. The heart wall is made of three distinct layers. The first is the outer epicardium which is composed of a layer of flattened epithelial cells and connective tissue. Beneath this is a much thicker myocardium made up of cardiac muscle. The endocardium is a further layer of flattened epithelial cells and connective tissue which lines the chambers of the heart.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart itself is supplied by the left and right coronary arteries, which branch off from the aorta.

question_title: Why does my pee smell after I eat asparagus? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One possible reason may be the glucosinolates present in asparagus and other brassica vegetables.  Through a series of chemically transforming steps during digestion, glucosinolates become molecules such as Indole-3-carbinol that modulate (usually up-regulate) the activity of certain enzymes in your body involved in detoxification and metabolism.  This process may lead to a transient increase in certain odoriferous metabolites that are eliminated in urine.\n\nBest wishes!	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What are our options? [SEP] question_content: My husband and I live together in the USA. He has a 5yr old daughter with his ex-wife, and they live in Aruba.\n-She would call his phone once (sometime twice) per week, asking for money for all kinds of random expenses. My husband would send money because she told him she was not working. Unfortunately, just a few months ago we found out that she has been working for years, and earning a tidy sum…even tidier when you add all the money that my husband sent.  When he did not have the money to send, she would refuse to let him speak to the child.\n-And when he did speak with the child, she would take the phone and tell the child what to say. [SEP] best_answer: First, they are in Aruba, US law doesn't apply there.  Nor does Aruban law apply here.  If you want to fight her over these issues, then you need to either bring her and the child to the US, or go to Aruba and hire a lawyer and fight her under Aruban law.  It is admirable that you want to pay for the child's education, and I think sending the money for that to the school is more than adequate, of course, she must allow the child to attend, which she may not out of sheer spite.  I would not send another penny to her, not one.  IF she claims medical costs, ask her where, and contact them yourself as you did the school and make arrangements for the child's treatment cost.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE SEND HER ANY MORE MONEY.  Unfortunately, the money you have already sent her is a total loss, you cannot recover a penny, but learn from the past and don't repeat it.

question_title: i am in  love a true love but the girl whom i love does not believe in love wat should i do kindly tell me? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I was in your shoes, my friend, years ago. And this is what I did and learned:\n\nI waited & waited to be loved in return... five years as a matter of fact. I had many sleepless nights, I had a whole migration of butterflies in my stomach everytime we spoke over the phone, whenever i saw her, & even a simple thought of her. Not a single day, night & moment went by that I did not think of her. I was there for her emotionally, physically, financially, spiritually... & evermore optimistic for her to one day feel the way i felt. Yet, she did not reciprocate the same intensity & desire as i did. Mind you that nobody knew that i was feeling soo ga-ga over her, so i had no one, not one soul to talk to for advice or direction of what i should do. \n\nSo what happened? What did I do? \n\nWell, one nite i finally broke down, emotionally, like i had before and got down on my knees and prayed to help get over her. A warm blanket of feeling came over me and realize that I was just alone, too lonely & barking up the wrong tree. In that instant my head was clear & had enough gusto to say myself & her "no mo". I moved on. Since then, I had many friends to count on and goals that kept me busy.\n\nThe Truth is: I was infatuated. I "loved" someone who did not loved me back; who did not reciprocated... for five long years! It was a waste of my time, energy & not to mention financially. In that instant in the dead of night, i realized one love is not enough... it takes two.\n\nSo my question to you, my friend, how long can you wait?\n\n-Taz-	Family & Relationships

question_title: Are you closer to your mother or father? [SEP] question_content: I never knew my father..but my stepdad was okay he never really said much he just said "Ask your mother" or agree wit her\ni never really got along with my mother  I guess i was always i reminder of my real father who left her\ni guess that why i went through my "rebellion" stage [SEP] best_answer: Well... i always felt like a damn bastard even though i wasn't. My stepdad (for 12 freaking years!!!) was a child molestor. You wont believe the things he has done to me during that whole time. And my mom always stood by him even though he beat her a$$ up every stinkin day. Sometimes I felt like she deserved it, but then when I saw her face covered in blood I couldn't help but crying. I cried myself to sleep every night, thinking that I would wake up the next morning with no mother. I never felt close to neither of them, but if I ever did, I would always stick with my mom. I never felt like she cared, cuz even after I told her about my stepdad, she still had the fuck1ng guts to ask me to forgive dat b*tch cuz he "loved" me." And she HAS been a witness of what my stepdad used to do with me. Some people are lucky they dnt have a dad"... I always think. But to tell you the truth, I waz alwayz close to my grandmother. She would kill a n*gga for her baby. lol.... which is me. I always felt comfortable with myself and avoided being with them. But I waz only 5 years old back then. But yeah... my grandpa is like yo stepdaddy... he be telling me "Preguntale a tu abuela" (Ask yo grandma) and my grandma would tell me the same thing. lol. its mad crazy. And you think it's crazy not getting along with your mom cuz you "remind" her of your dad.... How crazy you think it iz to have a mom who actually HAD your dad by her side, cheat on him, dump him, go with sum other dude, and love that MAN more than you no matter wat a monster he is. And on top of that.... keep you from knowing who your real dad is and lie to you by saying it's someone else???\n\nIt all ended ONLY 2 years ago... (dats not very much)\n\nAnywayz..................... so u ask... "Are you closer to your mother or father?"... my answer... my mom... especially now dat she in a wheelchair, she's blind, she goes to dialysis (with needles) every other day, has had open heart surgery, has NO legs (they amputated both... i waz devastated), almost got her rite arm cut off, is always throwing up, takes like 30-40 pills a day, has a bad-azz Diabetes, died (her heart stopped) and had to go to emergency room and get relived......... i seriously dnt kno where to stop.

question_title: What do you think about this dream? [SEP] question_content: I dreamed that I was in a forest next to a fire I had made. I looked up into the sky and I noticed a mirror inside the moon. There was a woman's reflection in it and at the same time mine. I saw both of our eyes glow as if they were stars. Suddenly those four stars started to combine into one form making both reflections into one, a dream. Something in reality that is far far far from true. [SEP] best_answer: I believe you were seeing your TRUE self reflected in the moon. The combining of the stars shows that you are looking to reunite with your true self. By this I mean who you were at the time of your birth ...when you came into existence on this plane. Quite a beautiful and hopeful dream!!!!	Family & Relationships

question_title: How long does it take for a women to size up a man? [SEP] question_content: Do woman have two categories? 1 friend material 2 bedroom material [SEP] best_answer: Personally I know w/in 30 seconds of meeting a guy if we'll ever be more than friends.  Usually w/in a week after that we're either seeing eachother or not.  Then it takes me around 3 months to start gettin comfy and our routines of seeing eachother down.  By 6 months I know if this is really something that's gonna last or not....and if I don't feel good about whatever I'll say something.  It either works out or we go our separate ways.  ......I think what you're asking though is does a woman know if just friends or more though right?  ....that's the first 30 seconds.....IF there's even a possibility anyway.

question_title: Is it really possible to love like you've never been hurt? [SEP] question_content: I am sure most of you have heard Mark Twain's phrase before,"Dance like nobody's watching; love like you've never been hurt. Sing like nobody's listening; live like it's heaven on earth." My question is, having been hurt, is it really possible to love like you haven't? Is that even someone you would WANT to do? [SEP] best_answer: I think the real question behind is do we let fear or love be primary in our life?\nFear has it's obvious advantages like self preservation. It's unseen and not so obvious side effects are a decreased feeling of being alive. It's like pills we take to aleviate an illness. They are great untill we start becoming dependent on them and they start to slowly seep their poisonous side effects into our body.\nLove on the other hand is difficult to live with because it makes us feel vulnerable, not in control and this makes it possible for us to be hurt.\nActually I think it's even worse than that! When we love or feel happy we are going to be hurt and feel unhappy. Life is a cycle like the seasons, like our breath.\nWhen you see life just as that, a cycle, hurt and love complement each other and they are both OK.\nLook, you will be hurt again!\nSo why dwell on it? Why not let the free bird in your heart fly up to the sky on loves wings?	Family & Relationships

question_title: ??HoW YOU DEFINE MAKING LOVE?? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The word defines itself: Having sex with the one you love and is the one who loves you. It should please both of you phisically and mentally. For me it's the best way to enjoy your sexual life, because every time your physical feeling is taking you to heaven, your heart and soul are also soaked with the feeling of love and being loved. Making love is just the very emotional and delightful way to express love to each other.	Family & Relationships
question_title: who is your rolemodel? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: My role model would have to be my daddy. Although he is dead now, he instilled in me the character, and resposibility to be the man I've become. He said, if you owe a bill, pay it. If you are supposed to do something , do it. Work hard, be fair, and respect others........good role model, huh?	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: if you know he is reluctant and apprehensive about marriage and he feels his ex pressured him why would you even think about it? if you are so happy why try to push him into something? sorry but if this is something that is still on his mind he is going to feel like you are trying to pressure him regardless of your intentions. wait and be happy with what you have, let him come to it in his own time, thats what love is being able to put someone elses needs above your wants.

I want to go out but I have no clue.He really wants to go out with me and I know it's against the law to date a guy who 18 yrs ld. So should I just go ahead and say yes or just say something else? [SEP] best_answer: There is NO WAY ON EARTH that a 14 year old should be going out with an 18 year old.  It is not "against the law" to date, but anything sexual with him is a crime (for him, not for you).	Family & Relationships
question_title: how do you tell a man that his penis is too large nicely? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, he'll probably be proud of that! So don't worry about his feelings! \n\nHowever, are you really too tight for him or is it because you're not wet enough? Try with more lubrication (either lube or more foreplay!).\n\nBut he might really be too big. I knew someone who had the same problem.	Family & Relationships

question_title: does taurus goes with aries? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They have both similarities.\n\nThe Taurus was a very successful model for the Ford Company selling almost 7 millions units during its 20 years life span.  It was at its peak between 1992 and 1996 when it was the best selling car in the USA.\n\nThe Aries total production was just under 1 million before Dodge cease production in 1989.  It won the Motor Trend car of the year award in 1981 and its popularity helped Dodge towards financial recovery.\n\nSo I guess that both cars were big success stories for their respective companies.  However, I'd give the Aries a little edge for what it did for Dodge on a larger scale.  \n\nSo strictly on a business basis, we have an excellent chance of a good match.  The Arian, being a fire sign is the ideas and go getter half and the Taurean, an earth sign, is very practical and will excel at keeping the production flowing and the books in tip top shape.   In this Partnership we have the salesman and the bookkeeper combination.  And, if the planets are well aspected, it can be a winning combo.\n\nBut although at first blush the Aries and Taurus pair seems to be an excellent match, it is a different story for the long haul as the calm, logical Taurus would soon drive the active, fun seeking Aries right out of its mind!   Aries must be caught up in the moment, with the involvement in new ideas being its life blood; not so with Taurus.\n\nSo there you have it.  Hope this was helpful to you!	Family & Relationships
question_title: are there any woman who like a man who is abusive? this is a serious question? [SEP] question_content: ive been trying to change me and t you know its pretty touch mostly when i am sitting on the side lines. i dont care to deceive and lie .if i am being my self i lose the relationship. please tel me what your experience is ?will you respond? \n God bless you [SEP] best_answer: Wow Robert, that's a deep question.  While I'm not exactly sure where your position is in this question... are you the one abusing or watching someone be abused?  It appears that you are the one abusing, so I will go with that.  I have been an abused woman, mentally, physically, monetarily and sexually.  I didn't like it one bit.  It is a demeaning and horrible thing to do to another person.  After the initial shock of it all, one begins to think they deserve it until it becomes a way of life.  Thankfully, I woke up before he killed me.  \nThere are people who are submissive totally by nature who are into BDSM and to them, they need a dominant figure in their lives.  Someone to guide them and discipline them and to them this is love.  To their Masters or Owners, who crave this, between both of them, it is the most generous gift one can give to the other.  I will not disagree with these people because they are the only ones that know what they "need" to exist and feel at peace within themselves.  \nIf I understand your question correctly and you are wanting to change the fact that you abuse women and then loose the relationship, I would suggest finding a support group of some kind to help you with it.  If you find it is something you truly need in your life, then perhaps you may want to do some research on the BDSM lifestyle and learn what it is about.  My best friend is a Dom and explained it to me in a way that I truly understand what he means when he says he does not "abuse" his submissive.  While it's not something I would be interested in, I feel it gives him and his partner an opportunity for them both to get what they crave.  I will add here that that lifestyle requires a certain mind set and a complete understanding of it.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: Ex boyfriends come back more frequently than they stay away!  They break things off with us for odd reasons, then miss us when we've moved on.  The question is, what do YOU want?  Does he bring anything new to the relationship?  Why are you letting him dictate the terms?  I'd date other guys with a view to allowing the best guy to attract your focus.  This one may compete for you if he wishes, but you should not accept his crumbs when he's in the mood to toss them to you.	Family & Relationships

question_title: my girlfriend wants time from each other for a month but she said to wait for her.what should i do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well,I now understand your second question you asked,but I'll answer this one instead. Any time that someone needs a break from a relationship,there is an underlying cause to why this person NEEDS time away. Even if it's just to think through where their life is going,if their on the right track. Most of the time though I truly believe that if the relationship is a stable one that the 2 people involved should be able to communicate their thoughts,feelings and hopes,dreams,wishes,whatever...to each other.\nI don't know your age,but I am assuming that you're younger,because this tends to happen a lot more in young love. I'm older so this answer may not suit you.\nMy advise would be to let her go,obviously she was the one who wanted out of the relationship in the first place. Don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Get out and do things that you enjoy and live life to the fullest. There is so much more of the world to see than what is right outside your own back door.\nHope this helps if even just a little. You are a real person with real feelings and you need to take care of YOU first and foremost. Good luck.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] question_content: I just broke up with my boyfriend of 7months. \nWhat are some of the things you did to get over your ex boyfriend. p.s i lost my virginity to his guy. Please help!! [SEP] best_answer: i know it hurts right now. a lot. there's probably nothing anyone can say that will make the pain go away completely. just ease the pain by spending time with friends and family, who will give you support and get your mind off the situation for a little while.\n\nremember that sometimes people are in your life for a short time, for you to learn from them or for you to teach them something. and then they're just gone.\n\nsometimes the best relationships don't work out for one reason or another, but there are so many bright stars in the sky!\n\nkeep your memories! the good ones are yours to treasure forever. the bad ones are yours too, to learn from! sometimes relationships are just stepping stones to get us to where we are meant to be in the future.\n\nkeep smiling! i know it's hard. but soon you will begin to be able to laugh again and you'll be okay!

question_title: How do I get my parents to stop partying so much? [SEP] question_content: My parents never used to drink all that much, but the past 6 months, they've stayed at the bowling alley on Fridays & Saturdays (They bowl on a league) and they stay until about 3am (They go at 5pm). They've been drinking immense amounts of alcohol, to the point where my dad was about drunk, and screwed up a wall in the house. They didn't start staying out late, until they started Saturday bowling, and my mom has been hanging off of other guys, but they claim that there is no problems. My sister and I have been "giving my mom stress", according to my dad, who has been the one who's making her cry lately. My dad has been drinking, before going to work at night (He's an engineer) and my mom had two beers when she got home yesterday from work. They /never/ used to be this way, they would stay home with me, and everything, but now it's the total oppisite. If you would like more info, please email me.. thanks for your time. [SEP] best_answer: Hey, sounds like it sucks at home lately.  I have some words of wisdom for you, but I'm not going to drag your parents through the dirt in public, simply because you said "please email me."  So I've done that.  Keep an eye out for me, and we'll talk.\nOh, and for those who insist that you talk to them about it, I'll agree to a point, but right now it sounds like I wouldn't recommend it.

Now I feel just ill and I wish it could all go away.

question_title: What is a better baitcast reel a Shakespear Alpha or a Rhino? [SEP] question_content: I want to purchase a baitcast reel but i don't know which one would be better. [SEP] best_answer: Shimano and Daiwa are still #1, followed by Quantum,Pflueger,Abu Garcia,Browning,and then Bass Pro Shops brand, and Cabelas brand.\n\n     If I were you, and I was looking for an inexpensive BC reel I would probably look into buying either a "Bass Pro Shops Mega Tournament"(which is $50) or a "low-end" Cabelas Brand reel. Looking at your question, I think you may be wanting to ask "What is a good SPIN-cast reel"? \n\n     In that regard, I would have to say the Daiwa "Procaster" ($24.99) would work well or any $20-30 "Zebco" reel. Match it with an "Ugly Stik" and you've got a good low-end combo.\n\nHowever, Shimano reels are fantastic and rarely have any mechanical trouble. They are expensive($99-400 dollars) but you can have them a "life-time". If you are really interested in buying a reel, get a Bass Pro Shop catalog and a Cabelas catalog. They are free, just go to there web-site and order one.	Sports

question_title: who here likes charles barkley and the guys at the tnt studio at halftime? [SEP] question_content: i think they're hilarious LOL plus they give indepth analysis on the game. charles' opinions are pretty one sided though, but he's pretty much always right. [SEP] best_answer: I like Barkley in the studio.  He's not afraid to criticize a player for doing something stupid out there. I can't stand announcers or analysts who won't criticize a player because they think their job is to 'promote' the game, not criticize it...\n\nAnd Charles is usually right on in his criticismss. He knows good basketball when he sees it. And he knows when someone's playing like crap...\n\nThe guy I can't stand is Kenny Smith... just becuase he rode Hakeem Olajuwon's coat tails to a couple of titles, he thinks he knows more than anybody... and he thinks he knows what it takes to be a champion.... (yeah, just have Olajuwon as your teammate, and make sure he's at the peak of his career, and you'll do just fine).\n\nAt least, when talking about championships, Scottie Pippen not only won some championshps, he was actually a contributor to those titles, unlike Kenny Smith, without whom  Houston STILL would have won in 94 and 95.

Soccer is bigger with woman in this country because growing up it's more or less considered a woman's' sport.  Imagine our US team with Allen Iverson, Terrell Owens, Dwayne Wade, Lebron James, Edgerin James, Reggie Bush, Justin Gatlin, and so on with someone like Kobe  or Randy Moss playing goalie.   it's fun to think about at least but really most American men think soccer is for pussies,  sorry to burst any bubbles, just speaking the truth	Sports

question_title: If there is a draw in the standings in the World Cup, what is the method for determining who moves on? [SEP] question_content: I know hardly anything about Soccer or the rules of the game, but I noticed the USA team got a draw with Italy in their last match.  I notice the Czechs and Italy play each other for their next game.  If Italy wins and the US wins, it would put the US a point ahaid of the Czech Republic and they would move on.\n\n  However, the thing that confuses me is if there is a draw and the US wins.  The US would be tied with the Czech Republic.  Italy could possibly lose their match, with the US winning theirs, and there would be a tie between Italy and the US in the standings.\n\nWhat would happen in the event of a tie? [SEP] best_answer: The first round is the only round where there could be a tie, this is because the system of play will be the league system, each team playing one match against each of the other teams in the same group, with three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat.\nBut the round of sixteen, quarterfinals, semifinals, play-off for third place and final will all be played in accordance with the knock-out system. That means, that if after 90 minutes, a match ends in a draw, extra time of twice 15 minutes will be played. If the score is level after extra time, penalty kicks will be taken to determine the winner.\n\nUNTIE THE TIE OF THE FIRST ROUND:\nThe ranking of each team in each group will be determined as follows:\na) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;\nb) goal difference in all group matches;\nc) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria,their rankings will be determined as follows:\nd) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;\ne) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;\nf) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;\ng) drawing of lots by the Organising Committee for the FIFA World Cup	Sports

question_title: What is the franchise tag on an NFL player? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Both these answers are basically correct, just one part left out: If the player signs an offer sheet with another team, his current team gets a chance to match it.\n\nThere is also a "Transition Player" tag a team can slap on a player. It is the same as a "Franchise Player", except two differences:\n\n1) A Franchise Player gets a salary of the average of the top 5 players for that position or 120% of last season's salary whichever is greater. A Transition Player gets a salary of the average of the top 10 players for that position or 120% of last season's salary whichever is greater.\n\n2) If either type of player signs with another team, his current team gets a chance to match or beat the offer. If they do not match it, the team gets compensated with two 1st round draft picks for a Franchise Player, and no compensation for a Transition Player.	Sports

question_title: How are the candidates for FIFA World Player of the Year Award picked? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The FIFA World Player of the Year is a football award given annually to the male and female player who are thought to be the best in the world, based on votes by coaches and captains of international teams. In a voting system based on a type of a Borda count, each coach gets three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the winners are ordered based on total number of points. The award started in 1991 for men and 2001 for women.Following criticism from some sections of the media over questionable nominations in previous years, in 2004 FIFA drew up a shortlist of 35 men and 21 women from which national team managers and, for the first time, team captains and representatives from FIFPro (the worldwide representative organization for professional players) could vote [1].\n\nAnother criticism brought up against the men's nominations is that no player in activity outside of Europe has ever been nominated for the award. Although players from several nationalities, of three continents, have been nominated and won the award, they were all playing for European clubs at the time of their nomination or victory. It has been suggested that players active even in the more prestigious Leagues in Latin America (such as the Argentine, the Brazilian or the Mexican Leagues), are generally overlooked for the award. Others have noted that because of the money involved almost all of the world's best players play in European leagues by the time they mature as players.\n\nLa Liga players have won the men's award 5 years running	Sports

He will probably get more RBs and will definitely get more steals. KG will have plenty of guard help but is all alone down low. That equals more opportunities. Don't discount Kaman as he may take away a few of Brand's opportunities. I think Brand is great; I took him with the 9th pick of the first round in a recent draft. But I think KG is #3, after LBJ and Dirk.	Sports

question_title: Who Is Better? [SEP] question_content: Which one of these guys is the best?:\n\n1. Babe Ruth\n2. Reggie Jackson\n3. Barry Bonds [SEP] best_answer: Babe Ruth without a doubt, he revolutionized the game, baseball wasn't that big until he came around, people started coming in droves when he started hitting home runs, one year he had hit more home runs than the entire league combined. He also played in what was called the "dead ball era", the baseballs weren't as tightly wound as they are now, and for a guy with his built he was surprisingly fast, and had a rocket for an arm. Many people agree that no matter what era he had played in he still would of hit all those homers and in all probability would have hit more. \nReggie Jackson would have to be 2nd, he hit tremendous home runs as well and was a winner, he too was fast and had a rocket for an arm when he was in his prime.\nBarry Bonds has always been a very good player, but the fact is he's never one a championship, and all the home runs he's hit be it with the help of some juice or not haven't.helped his teams ever\nwin. This all being said with an objective point of view.....even though I've always been a Yankee fan.	Sports

Worried [SEP] best_answer: With those figures, your best bet is probably to set up an appointment with a credit counseling agency or financial advisor and they will be better suited to advise you as to the variety of plans available to you both "in" your area and "for" your financial situation.  Have your dad go w/you for personal support.  You may be able to get out of the hole you're in WITHOUT digging a deeper one.\n\nIn the meantime.....\n**Destroyed the cards?

Pick up a cheap answering machine for a one time expense rather than have the voice mail that you pay monthly for.\n*Any other "installment" plans that you have PAY BEFORE THE DUE DATE! You'd be AMAZED at how much more will go to the principal instead of the interest.\n*If you have "high-end" internet, cut down to basic for a while...that too can be re-upgraded later.\n\nThere are ALOT of little ways that you can cut down on some of the "over-head" while you get things straight.  And you'd be surprised what you discover you can live without, You may end up realizing just how much and wonder why you were wasting so much money!\n\nGOOD LUCK!	Business & Finance

question_title: what size is a one carat diamond? [SEP] question_content: what are the dimentions is a one carat diamond and what is the color I?

This is what my wedding diamond is, and I really don't even notice.  The only way you can really tell, is if you hold it next to a D color stone on a white peice of paper.  Only when you get to a K color, then you can start telling that its a little bit yellow.... unless you are a jeweler.  \n\nWIth the Dimentions, it really depends on what cut you have.  A princess or radient cut will look differently than a round or oval cut.  \n\nA good website that will educate you on Cut, Clairty, Color and Carat is the following:  \n\n(There is some interactive slides that will show you how large a diamond is and also the color)	Business & Finance
question_title: If you were a business consultant, what would you charge your client? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I look at things several ways:\n\n1) How much are you helping your client? For instance, has your advice saved them $80k/year in costs, even though it took you only a week? Then it might be better to negotiate a project fee higher than an hourly rate.\n\n2) How much do others offering similar services to yours charge, given similar levels of skill and experience? Try to be much better than average, and charge a higher than average rate. (sounds obvious, but it is a much better choice than being the low-price-leader and trying to make up for it on volume of work)\n\n3) How much time will the project actually take you, and what will your expenses be during the project? You could always calculate your hours and expenses, and charge exactly that. Your hourly rate will depend on you, your industry, the market etc. but we charge 150 for consulting, and 95/hour for production/implementation work.\n\n4) What is the opportunity cost of taking the project? Will taking this project make it impossible for you to land other, potentially more valuable, work? If so, you should charge a higher rate.\n\nAfter considering all these factors determine a fee that will both compensate you for your time and knowledge, and guarantee that you will be adding value to your client's business.

question_title: what do you mean by OUTSOURCING? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The general concept of outsourcing is having other firms do the work of a particular internal company functions.  Good example of that are the federal government agencies that looks for contractors to perform specific tasks.  An example is the company Lockheed Martin where they have a billion dollar contract with the Department of Defense to design and manufacture the F-22 Raptor.  \n\nOutsourcing can help a certain organization to save a little in terms of paying their own employess, and give other firms (usually start-up firms) an opportunity to take the work, which could give opportunities to potential to work in a different firm and perform the same duties.\n\nHowever, outsourcing can be a negative as well, a good example are call-centers owned by American firms.  Due to the labor costs in the United States being expensive, these firms reach-out or venture their business overseas where in most likelihood labor is cheaper.  Since call-center operators doesn't need to perform their business face-to-face with their customer, they don't need to travel to the United States to work.  This result to a lower cost in labor.  This sets gains in the part of the company but not to the average worker, which will lead to a higher unemployment turn-out.	Business & Finance

I am intereseted in becoming a partner but i have no idea how to move to america and be legally allowed to work.  I am a student so i do not have alot of money. does anyone know how hard it is to get some sort of visa so i can work and perhaps help with loans and such.  any input would be very greatly appreciated... [SEP] best_answer: There are several options:\n\n1. Get an investor's visa, but you said you do not have a lot of money and the requirement is $500,000 at the minimum (if you are going to invest in a "targeted employment area")  http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/residency/investment.htm\n\n2. Employment based immigration - the company that your American partner will form can sponsor you BUT your partner needs to prove that no Americans can do the job as well as you will; and that no Americans are available to do the job. The US employer will first have to apply for a labor certification with the Department of Labor http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/residency/employment.htm and the process even includes advertising and inviting Americans to be interviewed for the job (the state's Department of Labor will handle the interviewing). The process is long and in some states, backlog is quite substantial (some states are only processing 2002 applications). \n\nIt is best to consult with an immigration lawyer to discuss your options. It will not be cheap.	Business & Finance

question_title: How do you start looking for Venture Capital Funding? [SEP] question_content: For an online company, located in a small rural area, that has been in business for over 5 years, how does one go about attracting venture capital funds and investors? [SEP] best_answer: Venture Capital is just another name for private investor. There are some private investor groups but they are not well advertised. Typically a venture capitalist does not engage in the business of private investing because there is usually no or very little return on the investment. They expect to get their money back at best. That's why it is hard to find them, it's not a business. However, there are some organizations that provide business resources, councilling, consulting, advice, and these are usually staffed by successful business people. The chamber of commerce in your city and the state will provide you with local information. Often, those groups will point you in the right direction for fund raising. Another resource is to join a country club and/or a golf club where business executives tend to favor. Networking is key to many aspects of business success. To get your online business producing sales revenues you can hire a professional online marketing company and put me to work making you money.

question_title: How can you treat stringy hair? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Eating a balanced diet is essential for maintaining good hair health and also your overall body health. According to nutritionists, people who have nutritional deficiencies in their diet have dull and stringy hair and can at times even suffer from a temporary case of hair loss. \n\nA diet, which is very low in calories, can affect your hair. Eating too much of only certain food groups and eliminating others from your diet, can also cause hair loss. Studies have shown that a deficiency of Zinc can severely affect your hair and cause it to fall. Zinc is present in meat, seafood, and eggs; so you should try and incorporate these in your diet. For vegetarians, a zinc supplement may help. \n\nHair, to remain healthy, needs essential fatty acids. The omega-3 fatty acids provide the hair follicles with the nutrients necessary for good health and to keep the hair and scalp from drying up. If the hair follicle will not get its share of these fatty acids, it becomes weak and this results in hair loss and thinning of hair. Thus a diet, which all but eliminates fat, is not good for the hair. Omega-3 fatty acids are present in mackerel, salmon, flaxseed oil, macadamia nuts, and walnuts. \n\nAnother constituent of the Vitamin B complex, known as Biotin, is very essential for healthy hair. A deficiency of biotin is known to cause hair loss. Any foods which give you a good amount of protein such as meat, eggs etc, should take care of your biotin requirements for preventing temporary hair loss. Vegetarians can take milk products, cereals, cottage cheese, and tofu to increase their protein and biotin intake. \n\nHence, from all the above, it can be seen that people who have a poor diet or eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, are at an increased risk of temporary hair loss due to nutritional deficiencies that weaken their hair shafts and follicles. Thus it is important to have a proper diet. A healthy and balanced diet will definitely help in improving your hair condition as well as stop it from falling due to any diet related deficiency.

These steps are described in their naturally occurring sequence, emphasizing the salient features within each step. Compost provides nutrients needed for mushrooms to grow. Two types of material are generally used for mushroom compost, the most used and least expensive being wheat straw-bedded horse manure. Synthetic compost is usually made from hay and crushed corn cobs, although the term often refers to any mushroom compost where the prime ingredient is not horse manure.

question_title: What is with the young girls on here asking such sexual questions? [SEP] question_content: I have read a lot of questions on here from very young girls asking "My boyfriend wants me to have sex, but I am a virgin", "Does sex feel good? - I am a virgin and don't know" Has the world really gotten this bad that girls who are 12, and 13 are having sex? Where are their parents? This really shocks me... [SEP] best_answer: There has been a decline in general American morality that is especially evident in the media. Millions of people watch Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy, for example, including children. These shows abound with adultery and the fallacious concept that being in love merits sexual activity. It's really disheartening to know that many girls as young as fourth graders regularly wear thongs and watch Sex and the City. And I don't even want to get started on pop and rap...	Society & Culture
question_title: Did Mary and Joseph have other children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No and yes.\n\nHow was James, “the brother of the Lord,” (Matt. 13:55, Acts 15:13-21, 1 Cor. 15:7, Gal. 1:19) related to Jesus? All believers agree he was related, but no one knows exactly how.\n\nThe possibilities are that James was:\n\n1. A full brother of Jesus, another Son of God born of the Blessed Virgin Mary. No one to my knowledge accepts that God had another child by the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n2. A half-brother of Jesus, a younger son of Joseph and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Some Christians believe this possibility but most Christians including those who are Catholic and Eastern Orthodox believe that Mary remained a virgin for her entire life.\n\n3. A stepbrother of Jesus, a son of Joseph and a previous wife. Many Christians believe that Joseph had a least one previous marriage that resulted in children.\n\n4. A stepbrother of Jesus, an adopted son of Joseph and the Blessed Virgin Mary. When parents died, relatives frequently took their children in and raised them as thier own. An adopted orphaned boy would be considered the brother of Jesus.\n\n5. A cousin of Jesus. The Aramaic language has no word for cousin. Aramaic frequently uses the word “aha,” which we translate into Greek as “adelphos” or English as brother, for cousin.\n\n6. A comrade of Jesus. This is a remote possibility. Greek uses adelphos the same as English does in “a band of brothers.” \n\nPossibilities 1 and 2 obviously go against Catholic beliefs.\n\nThe Catholic Church prefers possibility 5 but 3, 4 and 6 would not go against doctrine. \n\nWith love in Christ.

question_title: Why do Hispanics have trouble coming OUT to their families? [SEP] question_content: I think my brother in law is gay and he dosen't accept it, nor would he ever come out to his family. Hispanic familes are so close, so why is it hard for them to come out? [SEP] best_answer: I think that because it's a very tight-knit family it is hard. You always aim to make your parents proud, and hispanics grow up in a religious, Catholic setting in most instances. I know growing up that there were extreme homophobic undertones at most family gatherings. When my cousin came out as bi they were extremely nice to her face but were so cruel behind her back and told their children to stay away. You can usually sense the dislike there and family especially extended family seems so much closer and in your business, they tell your parents things and try to get you to straighten up their kids. One uncle asked me, "How many girlfriends do you have in college?" I said, "None." and his reply: "You're not becoming a fag are you?" Just too machismo.	Society & Culture

question_title: why are rama and krishna not mentioned as historical kings? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: They are mentioned as Historical figure and accepted as our ancestors in India.\n\nThe fact is that history of India has been written by christian s in last 200 years and then by communists. They really challenged everything about ancient India be it Rama and Krishna or other achievements of India.\n\nDo you really think people who made up myth of Aryan race and its invasion in an attempt to propagate that even Hindus are aliens in India would ever accept Rama or Krishna as historical figures?\n\nBy the way Dwarika , ruins of the city of Krishna has been found again under the city.\n\nThe first clear historical record is dated 574 A.D. and occurs in the Palitana Plates of Samanta Simhaditya. This inscription refers to Dwaraka as the capital of the western coast of Saurashtra and still more important, states that Sri Krishna lived here. The establishment of one of the four of his pithas at Dwaraka by Sankaracharya attests to the great religious sanctity the place must have attained by the eighth century A.D. \n\nAnd now the scientists at NIOT (National Institute of Ocean Technology, of the Department of Ocean Development) have established this. While working for British gas in the Gulf of Cambay region, a few years ago, the scientists of the NIOT, were stunned to see images of objects and things, completely alien to the marine domain. Immediately a team swung into action and samples were collected and sent for analysis and dating (it is usually done to scientifically establish the antiquity of the excavated objects).\n\nSamples collected include artefacts, wood pieces, pottery materials, hearth pieces, animal bones. They ere sent to Manipur University, Oxford University, London, Institute of Earth Sciences, Hanover, Germany for analysis and dating. The results were astonishing. It was found beyond doubt that the samples belonged to a period varying from 7800 to 3000 years (BP) Before Present !\nhttp://www.atributetohinduism.com/Dwaraka.htm\n\nThe recently discovered bridge currently named as Adam's Bridge made of chain of shoals, c.18 mi (30 km) long, in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka, reveals a mystery behind it. The bridge's unique curvature and composition by age reveals that it is man made. The legends as well as Archeological studies reveal that the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the a primitive age, about 17,50,000 years ago and the bridge's age is also almost equivalent. This information is a crucial aspect for an insight into the mysterious legend called Ramayana, which was supposed to have taken place in tredha yuga (more than 17,00,000 years ago). In this epic, there is a mentioning about a bridge, which was built between Rameshwaram (India) and Sri lankan coast under the supervision of a dynamic and invincible figure called Rama who is supposed to be the incarnation of the supreme. This information may not be of much importance to the archeologist s who are interested in exploring the origins of man, but it is sure to open the spiritual gates of the people of the world to have come to know an ancient history linked to the Indian mythology.

question_title: how has kumina impacted on the society? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Kumina is the most African of Jamaican cults. Kumina ceremonies are usually associated with wakes and entombments, but can also be performed at births, anniversaries and thanksgivings. During a Kumina ceremony the exponents call upon their ancestral spirits. The dance and music are two of the Kumina's strong features - the drum playing an integral part in this dance ritual. \n\nKumina is both the religion and the music practiced by the people of eastern Jamaica. These people have retained the drumming and dancing of the Bantu-speaking peoples of the Congo. Like the Kongo practitioners from Cuba, they have kept a large amount of the Kongo language alive. In the Americas there are many Kongo-derived religions still being practiced today.\n\nOne main aspects of Kongo religion is the practice of bringing down spirits of the dead to briefly inhabit the bodies of the faithful. The purpose of this is so that the ancestors may share their wisdom, providing spiritual assistance and advice to those here on Earth. Without exception, all such faiths in the Americas retain this central feature of Kongo faith.\n\nAt a "real Kumina" one can expect just about anything, as one of the aspects of Kumina is "being possessed by the spirits of the dead". Anyone can become possessed and there is no limit as to how many spirits can enter an individual. At this point the possessed person enters into a trance called the Maya.\n\nSo, to answer your question, one of its impacts on society today, especially in Jamaica, is the promotion of the false teaching about spirits of the dead.

question_title: Is it important to always be honest? [SEP] question_content: I'm trying out a total honesty policy at the moment. The only problem is do people always want to hear the truth? [SEP] best_answer: Immanuel Kant (a famous philosopher) said it is crucial to be honest because lying is the worst thing a person can do. This is because our society is built on trust.  All the time we trust people not to do curtain things (like blow-up the place you are in).  If you lie, you break down the trust that keep society together and if people lie to much, society will crumble to nothing.  For me sometimes you have to lie, but most time it is good to be honest.

[SEP] question_content: Some get mad at Christianity because it is exclusive in you must believe in Jesus, but all religions demand something for its members or followers.  Name one that does ont. [SEP] best_answer: A good point. Religions are supposedly faith-based, but then tack on requirements to keep that particular label. Even an agnostic has to meet the requirement of believing there is no God, so I guess the answer is no religion meets the parameter of not requiring anything to be a part of it.	Society & Culture

question_title: I need evidence against ghosts. Can someone help me? [SEP] question_content: I am in a debate and I am supposed to be against ghosts. I need "evidende" against them. PLEASE HELP! [SEP] best_answer: Try this:  Based on the number of souls that have died over the centuries, ghosts, if they existed, shouldn't be hard to find at all.  Point out that on the Travel channel's "Most Haunted" series where a crew goes to a new 'most haunted' place every week they never have captured a ghost on video!  Nor has the Sci-Fi channel's "Ghost Hunters" series.  You may want to point out that if ghosts exist that it would be logical for them to appear on security cameras and surveilence cameras all the time...but this seems to never happen.  Sylvia Browne appears weekly on the Montel Williams show and tells people on the show that she sees their deceased loved ones "standing right beside them".  But the cameras never catch anything, nor do the microphones.  I heard a skeptic put it this way, and it's the most plausible explanation I've ever heard: "There are no haunted places, just haunted people."  Good luck with your debate.	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: Definitely, thank her for her rapid response and all her hard work. You could comment on how people such as herself make it easier to decide such a difficult decision such as where to go to college. You could say that her thoughtfulness has assured you that you have made the right decision. Administration either makes or breaks a college, trust me I have three degrees. A little flatter can move mountains and having a friend in administration can get you your degree faster. Especially, if you are having problems getting classes they usually have connections.

question_title: How fo you say, "I sometimes eat breakfat" in japanese? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The most proper way (the textbook answer for foreign learners), is to say:\n\nKanji: 時々私は朝食を食べています.\nHiragana: (ときどきわたしわちょうしょくをたべています).\nRomaji: Tokidoki watashi-wa choushoku wo tabete imasu.\nEnglish: Sometimes, I eat breakfast.\n\nA more common way is to say:\n\nKanji: 時々朝食を取る\nHiragana: (ときどきちょうしょくをとる).\nRomaji: Tokidoki choushoku wo toru.\nEnglish: Sometimes I take breakfast, or: Sometimes I have breakfast.\n\n(The Japanese word here is to take, but the common English translation can also be "have", because that is the way we commonly use this phrase).\n\nYou can also just use the verb to eat in the infinitive, like this:\n\nKanji: 時々朝食を食べる\nHiragana: (ときどきちょうしょくをたべる).\nRomaji: Tokidoki choushoku wo taberu.\nEnglish: Sometimes I eat breakfast.\n\nNote that Japanese do not insert "I" (私は　わたしは　Watashi-wa), into their sentences, since it is understood that the direct object (indicated by the the particle "を, wo" in the above sentences), is positioned so that the subject "I" is understood. In Japanese, the use of "I" is rare in common speech.	Society & Culture

question_title: in elim the israelites found 70 palm trees and _______ springs(fountains)?  where found? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Exodus 15:27  And they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees. And they camped there by the waters.\n\nThe 70 palms were sustained by the 12 wells of water. 70 is the number of nations that were formed by the confusion of the languages at the tower of Babel. 12 is the number of Tribes of Israel, they were to be a nation of priests to all the other nations. So symbolically the 12 springs represent Israel sustaining the 70 nations of the world.\n\nDuring the Feast of Tabernacles a total of 70 bulls are offered up, see Numbers 19:12-34.  These 70 bulls are thought to be an offering on behalf of the 70 nations.	Society & Culture

question_title: What is wrong with Scientology? [SEP] question_content: It seems a lot of people don't like it.  Why? [SEP] best_answer: It is a CULT. Despite what a few fanatical members may say, it IS a cult. The church harasses and bullies anyone who they deem an "enemy" (basically anyone who has anything negative to say about the "church"). They will RUIN YOUR LIFE if you speak out against them long enough.\n\nThe founder is L. Ron Hubbard, the science FICTION writer who once told a friend that the best way to make lots of money is to start your own religion. Though being a very outspoken critic of psychiatric drugs, it was discovered upon Hubbards death that the anti-anxiety drug hydroxyzine (Vistaril) was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric and pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years. (link to page explaining what hydroxyzine is: http://www.drugs.com/MTM/V/Vistaril.html )\n\nScientologists believe the evil alien ruler Xenu killed a lot of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by bringing them to earth & blowing them up inside volcanoes. They believe the souls of these aliens (called "Body Thetans") have attached themselves to us & cause many of our mental & physical ills. Even members of the Church of Scientology who know of Xenu will publicly deny the existence of Xenu & Body Thetans, or attempt to minimize their importance. Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress. Many who remain at lower levels in the church are unaware of much of the these doctrines, which mostly begin at Operating Thetan level three, or "OT III". Because the information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked. OT III recipients must sign a waiver promising never to reveal its secrets before they are given the manila envelope containing the Xenu knowledge.\n\nTo rid ourselves of "Body Thetans" and also “engrams” (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind) so that we can become “clear”, we have to go through "auditing" with a member of the “church” who uses an "e-meter" to measure our “reactive mind”... & we have to pay lots and lots of money for “auditing” (purchased in 12.5-hour blocks, costing anywhere from $750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions) and to take courses on Scientology to advance to higher “levels” in the “church”. The “church” has also taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional in everyday life. They deny the reality of chemical imbalance & profound mental disturbance & accordingly do NOTHING to effectively stabilize the dangerously unstable. The “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from member (with deadly results).\n\nScientology is undeniably a cult. For more information on what a cult is & what their damaging effects are, please visit the link provided at the bottom of the sources. Just know that Scientology DOES qualify by meeting these 5 criteria:\n\n(1) It uses psychological coercion to recruit, indoctrinate & retain its members. (2) It forms an elitist totalitarian society. (3) Its founder leader is self-appointed, dogmatic, messianic, not accountable & has charisma. (4) It believes 'the end justifies the means' in order to solicit funds & recruit people. (5) Its wealth does not benefit its members or society.	Society & Culture

question_title: Do Scientologist take their kids and themselfs to the doctor and do they vaccinet their children? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Of course.\nI have a really good medical Dr. \nScientology is about a persons spiritual nature. It's basic principle is that YOU are your own immortal soul. Dianetics which came out about a year before Sccientolgy was founded, is about "what the soul is doing to the body" and addresses spititually caused unwnted physical and emotional problems.\nHowever, if a Scientologist needs medical treatment or a medical exam they go to a medical Dr. Dianetics is not medical treatment and is in no way intended as a substitute for it.\nThe issue of child vaccination is one of personal parental choice.In fact any parent has the right not to get their children vaccinated for reasons of conscience.\n Both my kids got all their shots, however, I personally am not certain of the true validity of child vacinations, and even medical Drs have expressed doubts as to whether introducing a weakened strain of some disease causing mico organism into a childs body at a young age to promote immunity, (which is what a vaccination basically is) may not have more overall negative effects than positive. There are certainly plenty of actual cases where this has infact been the result.	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.'" (1 Cor 1 18-19). For two thousand years people have jeered at the cross, but it is our only means of salvation and should be honoured on Christian buildings.  Yours is a good question and the day may come when the crazy authorities running our country might order the removal of crosses from churches.  Let us hope that Christians will have the courage to refuse.	Society & Culture

question_title: why isnt there any king in england? [SEP] question_content: when the king dies the prince becomes king correct? [SEP] best_answer: When the King dies, the eldest child becomes sovereign. If the king has a son, then they become King, if he has only daughters then the eldest daughter becomes Queen.\n\nThere is no King at the moment because the Queen inherited the throne in 1952. When her father became King in 1936 he had two daughters, the present Queen and Princess Margaret. As he had no sons, his eldest child inherited. \n\nThis will be the case when the Queen dies, Prince Charles, as her eldest child, will become King. However, should Charles predecease the Queen then Prince William will suceed. Should Prince William have no children, after his death, Prince Harry becomes King. \n\nAt present, male primogeniture exists, therefore should Prince William have a daughter and later a son, the son will take precedence to inherit the throne. \n\nPrince Charles' sister Princess Anne (the Princess Royal) was second in line to the throne until the birth of Prince Andrew (the Duke of York) and Prince Edward (the Earl of Wessex). Despite Princess Anne being older than Andrew and Edward, because they are male, they take precedence in the line of succession.	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: You can't "make" a hard drive an SATA2 drive.  It either was SATA2 when you bought it, or it wasn't.  You're talking about RAID 0, which can be done with either SATA1 or SATA2 drives.\n\nRAID will make a definite difference in throughput, but those weren't fast drives to begin with.  I'd recommend you spend $95 on a drive that's almost 3 times as big, and roughly 3x as fast: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148140  Then, just use the Maxtor as either a spare drive, or as additionaly storage space.

question_title: Question about Windows XP Pro.? [SEP] question_content: I need to know what files to delete, to uninstall XP. I am trying to erase the HDD, so I can install a new copy. Also, which format takes up more space, FAT32 or NFTS ? [SEP] best_answer: If you chose to keep your old Windows installation and the FAT32 file system, you should be able to uninstall Windows XP. Please see "Sources".\n\nIn case you do not have an option to uninstall Windows, back-up all your important files onto CDR/CDRW/DVDR/'another hard disk'/'other forms of memory', (create a boot floppy as described in next paragraph,) format your hard disk, and install the version of Windows you want.\n\nWindows XP's CD is always bootable, so you won't require a boot floppy. I assume it must be the same for 2000, but for 9x, most probably you will need a boot floppy. After you finish backing up, insert a blank floppy and (from within XP) format it as a start-up disk. To format,\n-Open My Computer (in your new XP Start menu).\n-Right-click the floppy drive icon.\n-Select "Format".\n-Put a tick mark in the check box named "Create an MS-DOS startup disk".\n-Click "Start" button (the one in the Format dialog box)\nOnly then should you format your hard disk.\n\nI'm not sure of FAT32 taking up more space, but if you use NT/2000/XP, then it is highly recommended that you try your best in sticking to NTFS. Check out the Sources for some information regarding the two file systems.\n_______\nViva La Dvorak! - www.dvzine.org	Computers & Internet
question_title: differentiate vcd to dvd? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: VCD (also called video CD, video compact disc or "disc") is a compact disk format based on CD-ROM XA that is specifically designed to hold MPEG-1 video data and to include interactive capabilities. VCD has a resolution similar to that of VHS, which is far short of the resolution of DVD. Each VCD disk holds 72-74 minutes of video and has a data transfer rate of 1.44 Mbps. VCDs can be played on a VCD player connected to a television set (in the same way that video cassettes can on a VCR) or computer, on a CD-i player, on some CD-ROM drives, and some DVD players.\n\nDVD Short for digital versatile disc or digital video disc,  a type of optical disk technology similar to the CD-ROM. A DVD holds a minimum of 4.7GB of data, enough for a full-length movie. DVDs are commonly used as a medium for digital representation of movies and other multimedia presentations that combine sound with graphics.\n\nThe DVD specification supports disks with capacities of from 4.7GB to 17GB and access rates of 600KBps to 1.3 MBps. One of the best features of DVD drives is that they are backward-compatible with CD-ROMs, meaning they can play old CD-ROMs, CD-I disks, and video CDs, as well as new DVD-ROMs. Newer DVD players can also read CD-R disks.

question_title: Are we being manipulated? [SEP] question_content: Yahoo Answers gives "points" for doing things, then limits the rate at which you can earn points by limiting the number of questions you can answer in a day, the number of questions you can ask in a day, and the number of questions for which you can vote for the best answer.  Is this psychological manipulation? [SEP] best_answer: Yes, there's certainly a psychological aspect to it - if you could do everything you wanted to, you'd be more likely to show up once, spend a long time, and then never come back. By making you spread out your involvement over a few days, it makes it more likely that you'll continue to return.\n\nAlso, limiting the number of actions is a good anti-spam feature - if someone turns out to be a poor user, then the amount of damage they can do is limited by time, which gives more time to catch them and shut down their account.

What can I do to fix this?  \nJust a note:  My laptop doesn't have a cd-rom so I copied the files to the laptop drive via a USB adapter from my desktop.\nScandisk finds no errors on the drive either. [SEP] best_answer: Go into your CMOS and check its settings, just because it is capable of going 133 MHz, does not mean it is set to go that fast.  If you cannot up the speed in your CMOS, if it is not set correctly, you will have to get a manual so you can adjust the jumpers.\n\nThis also could be being cause by how you are installing it, you might want to purchase or borrow an external drive and use that for the installation.\n\nJohn B.

question_title: what does a positive crp test mean and what is the treatment? Does taking an aspirin a day make sense? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: a Positive crp test means that you are at risk to have a heart attack, at some point in your life.\n\nCRP = C-reactive Protein Test\n\nas for taking the aspirin, I would encourage you to discuss that with your doctor, he/she will probably reccomend some other tests for you do, echocardiogram, treadmill stress test, ekg's, etc, he/she will probably also reccomend that you take 1 81mg aspirin tablet a day, because aspirin thins your blood, and if you have coronary artery blockage, it helps the bllod to get through easier.

question_title: If you are cloned , does your soul enter your cloned body ? and will you feel like you and be the same person? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: This question DOES have an answer. The answer is that since souls do not exist, no soul would be entering another's body. When, yes WHEN, a human is cloned (unfortunately someone WILL do it), the clone will have the same genes. They will look alike and theirs traits that are determined by genetics and not environment will likely be the same as well. However, they will still be two different human beings. Both are still alive and the clone will be a baby. You won't feel any different. Why would you? There are many ethical implications involved with cloning. It would be sort of like identical twins (who share same DNA and fingerprints etc) but the result would be very odd indeed especially if the two talked to one another. How alike would they be?	Health
question_title: Does sugar raise pulse rate? [SEP] question_content: Before I eat, I have a normal pulse rate.   \nIf I eat like a tiny bit of sugar.....it goes through the roof!\nIm a huge carb attick, so I love to eat like 6 bowls of cereal and thats it.   But after i eat the sugary cereal, or the chocolate, or cake, my pulse is out of control for the next couple hours!  Whats up? [SEP] best_answer: I will explain this as best I can.  I am a first year medical student so I can't assume to be an expert but I will tell you  what I have researched.  Please read this all because it could be important.\n\nA large amount of sugar in your diet (sugar, cake, etc.) will be absorb into your bloodstream and cause your pancreas to dump a lot of insulin.  In your case, your body may be releasing too much insulin.  Insulin helps get the sugar out of your blood and into the cells of your body.  In this case, a large amount of insulin could actually cause so much of that sugar to enter your cells that there isn't enough left in the blood.  The brain is very sensitive to sugar levels in the blood.  If the brain notices low sugar it sends out hormones that cause your body to release more sugar into your bloodstream.  One of the hormones it releases is called cortisol.  Cortisol causes a different organ in your body (adrenal glands) to release something called epinephrine, or what you know is called adrenaline.  Adrenaline causes your liver to produce and release sugar into your bloodstream.  Adrenaline also causes the heart to beat much faster.\n\nNow I have to ask you some questions.  Do you ever feel: nervousness, perspiration, shakiness, dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, and feeling anxious or weak?  Do you feel any of these at the same time that your heart rate increases?\n\nThese are signs of hypoglycemia (just means low blood sugar).  Low blood sugar can be very serious if allowed to get too low.  A person can actually go into a coma.  This is seen in people who have diabetes and take too much of their insulin and do not eat enough sugar.  They can act confused and even appear a little intoxicated.\nIf you seem to experience these symptoms I suggest you go to this website: http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia/index.htm and also call your doctor for an appointment.  Don't freak out, it is quite manageable and not at all uncommon.\n\nIt could be that your body is producing too much insulin or that your body just seems very sensitive to insulin or sensitive to adrenaline.\n\nIf you have hypoglycemia it is the "reactive" form and not the "fasting" form (which can be very bad).\n\nIf you releasing too much insulin, you could have hyperinsulinemia.  In your case "reactive hyperinsulinemia".  This is sometimes seen in people who have insulin resistance or also diabetes mellitus.  I suggest that you look into the symptoms of diabetes.  The typical symptoms are increased thirst and frequent urination.  If you have these symptoms as well you should definitely go see a doctor.  Again, nothing to freak out about but very important to get treated.  Here is a site on diabetes.\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/type-2-diabetes/DS00585/DSECTION=2\n\nAgain, this could mean nothing, but I do believe that you should schedule an appointment with a doctor.  It is common for a medical school student to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Only a doctor can tell you for sure.	Health

If they are also morbidly obese you may find it necessary to find some help outside of your family. \n\nThe TV needs to be turned off or given away......no video games or computer.........except as a "reward" for being outside walking or otherwise exercising.\n\nThe fridge and the pantry need to be cleaned and SCRUBBED till there are no more places to hide unhealthy food choices. It could be quite an adventure if the whole family pitched in and lost weight together......but you will find that in life, sooner or later, we alllll must accept the consequences of our own behaviors and life-style choices.\n\nI know you'll do well and you have a whole summer to get a head-start before school starts next fall.\n\nIf your family can't help..... then find a close friend to challenge you and maybe you can compete with them in something THEY need to accomplish this summer.\n\nFriendly competition can get a WHOLE lot done and it'll be easier if you have someone to talk with.\n\n\nGood luck............make the changes for the long-haul and you'll find yourself more fit by the time you are in high-school.

Ever since highschool it’s been telling me I’m obese. How can anyone with a washboard stomach be obese? I’ve always been proud of my body. I’ve been swimming 10 years, I was on the swim team in middle school, H.S., and college. People ask me if I lift weights, I don’t, it’s boring, so I swim a lot, and play a lot of baseball and football so I don’t have to do something as boring as lifting weights. I have big pecs, big arms, super thick thighs, claves, and a big butt. I take every single shirt I have to the tailor because they have to be custom fitted since I have a 32 inch waist and a 49 inch back. People always tell me I’m skinny; I have a small waist, and I have a thin face. \n\nI hate when people get obsessed about their weight, I always proudly tell them, “I’m 220 pounds, that weight doesn’t matter”. John Cena is just as tall as I am, and he weighs 240, does anyone call him fat? \n\nWhy do people obsess about their weight?

question_title: What are some good workout clothes for fat people? [SEP] question_content: Y'know clothing that doesn't show off every roll on your fat body... [SEP] best_answer: jogging pants and a big t-shirt.  But don't allow this to stop you from working out.  Your goal is to get out there.  And remember, the rolls won't be there for long because you are doing what needs to be done to lose the weight.  Keep in mind the following when losing weight:\n\nDiets and changing your eating to healthy food choices can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called "emotional eating" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.\n\nYou may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. \n\nThis all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. \n\nPlease learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:\n\nYou already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually you’ll see the pounds come off. What’s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same “Emotional Eating.” Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, that’s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, that’s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesn’t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we don’t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.\n\nP.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.	Health

[SEP] question_content: It always occurs when im asleep in the middle of class, and that class is quiet, and i burst out spasming....i get funny looks, it IS pretty funny, lol.  Its weird... [SEP] best_answer: Oh, yes, this is fun one.  What is happening is that sometimes when you are falling asleep, as your heart rate lowers and your muscles relax and your breathing slows, your brain thinks, just for a split second, that you are dying (you can see the similarities).  As a "check," your brain sends a test signal to your major muscle groups, causing them to spasm and you to jolt awake.  It is more likely to happen if your brain doesn't "think" you should be sleeping- like sitting up at a desk, for example, or if your internal stress levels are high at the end of the day.  I know it sounds crazy, but it really is a defense mechanism.  If you really were in danger, your body would not react to the test signal, and your brain would go into "fight or flight" mode to try and save your life.	Health

[SEP] best_answer: try to cut down on the coke intake-i know this can be hard. caffeine and sugar not only effect teeth but your organs as well.\n\nfor example-caffeine speeds up your heartrate, making your heart pump faster which in turn raises your blood pressure. if you are drinking alot of caffeine throughout the day-your heart is getting more of a workout than it needs.\n\nsugar can also cause unwanted weight gain.\n\nas far as your teeth go..\n-drink your soda through a straw-this will help the liquid bypass getting in between your teeth and breaking down the enamel.\n-make sure to brush a minimum of 3 times a day\n-floss at least once a day\n-rinse your mouth out with water after finishing the soda if you are unable to brush\n-make sure to see the dentist once every 6 months and ask about getting the special sealant put on them to protect them from cavities\n\nwater is the best thing for you but i know most of us out there don't drink as much as we should (me included). and on the occasion-we need that quick "pick me up" that the caffeine in soda provides.\n\nif you can't stop drinking the coke-at least try stepping down to diet. i didn't think i would be able to but that was 2 years ago and i can't stand regular soda now. coke makes their diet with splenda so it doesn't taste too different.

Im thinking of starting it and wanted to get some feedback from people who've tried it. Do you reccomend it? any tips i should know before starting it?

Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)	Health

Call him atleast 5 times in one hour, 3 times the next and 1 time every hour till 10pm. Make him feel that you want to meet him, but dont meet him, keep calling him on the phone. You dont have to talk for too long, but strike up a conversation. it can be about the weather, a sports game he likes, or your friends, or his work/classes. \nAfter this, day 2, you should call him again once every two hours. Then, talk about something intimate. Like your family or something personal to you. Dont expect him to talk too much. He will say only a little.\nDay 3, you should try to say, 'i like you' in a different way other than words. One way would be to send him a flower and something else he likes. If he likes football, send him the latest scores. If he likes cars, send him a car magazine. Send it to him  or give it in person.\nDay 4, meet with him and ask him out on a date. It might be strange, but if you LOVE him, you should as him on a date. He should pay the biils still, but its like you pay half the bills. Take personally on the date. and try not to be too obivious.\nDay 5....continue this with your own efforts. You should use your own heart to guide what to do next.	Health

I'll just have to go off the cuff here. Darkness seems to be a common setting for the Capulet party at night, the sneaking around between major scenes, going to see the Friar, inside the family tombs, etc. Darkness itself does not necessarily mean evil in this play, but more of the fact that due to miscommunication and violent grudges, people keep acting while being left mentally "in the dark" as to what other options would be available. Darkness may also serve as a sort of foreshadowing of a sad and dark ending to this tragedy.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is there a difference between  Marine salt and Sea salt? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are all sorts of salts.\nIn common usage, 'salt' refers to sodium chloride. Table salt is refined sodium chloride together with various additives, e.g. anti-caking agents, iodides, etc.\nMarine/sea salt is sodium chloride from the solar evaporation of sea water. It contains associated impurities such as calcium sulphate and magnesium chloride.\nWhen I did a Google search with the term "sea salt"+"marine salt" most of the references were to do with products for marine aquariums, so I think that the phrase 'marine salt' is used to describe stuff mostly intended for aquariums whilst the term 'sea salt' is for human consumption. If this is the case then I would expect 'sea salt' to be more strictly controlled as far as imputities are concerned.	Education & Reference

question_title: Is it true...? [SEP] question_content: During the California Gold Rush of 1849 miners sent their laundry to Honolulu for washing and pressing. Due to the high costs in California during these years it was deemed more feasible to send the shirts to Hawaii for servicing. [SEP] best_answer: yeah, since everyone was rushing into Califonia at the same time during the gold rush, the chances of finding gold was very limited, so some people decided to open small business that sold everything twice as much as it cost in all the other states, so hiring people to wash your clothes in California at that time would have been more costly then sending them to Hawaii.

You really shouldn't be that worried at all, not yet anyway...lol If you really wanna worry I guess you can start your sophomore year, first just decide if you're gonna go into humanities or science, then you can narrow it down eventually. Remember most ppl change their majors in college a couple times and do fine. In most cases the first year in college will consist of core courses anyway, so you'll have to take most of them regardless of your major.	Education & Reference

question_title: Does anyone know of any teach-yourself piano lesson stuff? [SEP] question_content: I want to learn the piano, but I dont know anyone who teaches, I have access to a piano, just no one to teach me. Any d-i-y piano lessons? [SEP] best_answer: If you're looking for a way to quickly play the piano you're going to love this. Listen... most of you already know that the quickest way to play the piano is by learning chords.\n\nBut what most of you don't know is what kind of chord to start out with. There are triads, seventh chords, diminished chords and thousands more. There are closed position chords and then there is something called the open position chord, and with it, you'll be able to create your own music in less than an hour!\n\nLook.. the reason why so many people have problems with the piano is they give up out of sheer boredom! They sense that it will take months if not years to create something that sounds like music on it. So they give up.\n\nBy starting out with open position chords, you'll immediately sound like a pro! Why? It all has to do with the way the chord is structured. First, it's a modern sounding seventh chord. All this means is the seventh note of the scale is used to along with regular triad notes to give it a more contemporary sound. Jazz musicians use it all the time.\n\nSecond, it covers more than 2 octaves of the keyboard giving you a very nice "open" sound. If you love contemporary stylings, you'll be playing them in no time with it.\n\nAnd last but not least, you use both hands right away to create with! In fact, the chord is so wide open that you can literally create music without moving your hands around at all.\n\nIf you love the idea of playing piano but don't want to start with boring triads or note reading, you're going to love learning to play the open position chord!

question_title: Okay, there was this movie with punk bands.....? [SEP] question_content: This movie was a comedy of some type, had something to do with metal/punk bands.

Out in the crowd, a singer/announcer/whatever is encouraging people to dive from the balcony.  Then there is an older black man who had smoked/consumed some substance and ends up walking on air with colored lights playing about him.\n\nThis is an older film, prolly early 80s or 70s even.\n\nIt is NOT a documentary of any sort... [SEP] best_answer: Sounds sort of like "Get Crazy" Starring Daniel Stern (Home Alone), Malcom McDowall, and rock musician Lou Reed.

To culminate his life, he gathers the best musicians he ever promoted for the biggest concert ever.  Stern plays the promoters protege who has to handle the craziness this causes.  Lou Reed pretty much plays himself, McDowall plays the Mick Jagger type and there is a punk band, a hippie group, and a blues act.\n\nI have not seen the movie in ages, but I do remember theold blues musician who walks on air thanks to pot, and comments "Good reefer here."

question_title: What is Calvin's Dad / Mom's name? [SEP] question_content: Calvin of Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. [SEP] best_answer: Calvin's mother and father are for the most part typical Middle American middle-class parents; like many other characters in the strip, their relatively down-to-earth and sensible attitudes serve primarily as a foil for Calvin's outlandish behavior. Both parents go through the entire strip unnamed, except as "Mom" and "Dad", or such pet names as "hon" and "dear." Watterson has never given Calvin's parents names "because as far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad." \n\nCalvin's father is a middle-aged patent attorney who is portrayed as an upstanding middle-class father, as his son might see him. An outdoorsman, he enjoys bike rides and camping trips, and insists that these activities, like Calvin's chores, "build character\n\nCalvin's mother is a stay-at-home parent who is frequently exasperated by Calvin's antics. On the rare occasions when she is not reacting to Calvin's misbehavior, she seems to enjoy quiet activities, such as gardening and reading. The "daily disciplinarian", she is frequently the one forced to curb Calvin's destructive tendencies; in one Sunday strip, she allows Calvin to smoke a cigarette in order to teach him how unpleasant smoking can be. She also usually seems sympathetic towards her son's relationship with Hobbes, and a few times has found herself speaking to Hobbes as well (although she refers to one instance as "talking to a stuffed animal").
