question_title: Iran Fiasco- can U guess what next? [SEP] question_content: The president of iran allowed females to go to the stadium with their faces and body covered, suddenly there are furore over the announcement. One group wants total ban on it. What are they treating their females- slaves-stones...Does the president think that he is the Holiest interpreters of Islaam. your comments please [SEP] best_answer: He probably considers himself a descendant of Ali since he is the head of a theocratic Islamic state.  As such, what he says goes.  I believe it's a major difference between Shi'i and Sunni Islam, with the Sunni being less apt to allow their political leaders to determine their mode of expressing their faith.  Islam is a religion of orthopraxy and not orthodoxy.  In such religions, one places more weight on what they do everyday than they do in other religions.  Leaders are expected to perscribe what rules of behavior are to be followed by the people of their countries.	Politics & Government

Unfortunately the British just drew country lines to suit the oil companies. Oh well.\n It will be difficult to split as the oil is not throughout the whole country.

question_title: How does one become an Honorary Consul? [SEP] question_content: What are the procedures and requirements for an American citizen to become an Honorary Consul? [SEP] best_answer: Having been an honorary consul I can tell you that depending on the duties it is very simple indeed.  State Department regulations are not applicable to honorary consuls as they have no official diplomatic status, therefore no diplomatic immunity or need to present formal credentials.  Most of their duties are merely ceremonial, cultural or social and are totally volunteer.  They are not supposed to have a staff nor are they supposed to be paid for their duties.  A major difference of an honorary consul versus a consul general is of nationality.  An honorary consul is usually of the nationality of the host nation not the represented one.  To be selected an honorary consul requires the nation making the honorary consul to nominate the person through the embassy of the host nation who send on the notice to the State Department which merely records it.  To be made an honorary consul is a great honor but a tremendous amount of work.  You need to be nominated from the country and they must not have a registered Consulate in the city where you would be an honorary consul for obvious reasons.  You would need to contact the embassy of the nation you wish to represent, offer your services to HE, the Ambassador, and see if they wish to nominate you.  They will then send your request onto their Foreign Office who will ask their respective executive branch of government for a decision.  Then they will send the decision back to thei embassy who will contact you.  Good luck!	Politics & Government

question_title: Why does no one care about Iraq's WMD? [SEP] question_content: We finnally find 500 muntions of WMD in Iraq, and what happens? Nothing.  I don't care how old they are, the weopons were still lethal, they could still kill. Why does no one care?\nIf you haven't of this news yet, see http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200726,00.html [SEP] best_answer: The story has been reported on various news media. The problem is that the version of story that Fox "news" is running isn't the whole truth. The WMD we went to war for have not been found. We did not go to war to find decades-old chemical weapons that had been buried since the Iran-Iraq War. We were looking for WMD proving an ongoing weapons capability that could pose a threat to world peace, not these aging remnants. President Bush has already accepted the findings in the Duelfer Report dismissing these weapons as irrelevant. (See link below)\n\nMore importantly, we already knew about those weapons and turned the other cheek when they were originally produced. Google "Rumsfeld" "Reagan" and "Saddam Hussein" and you'll learn all about the U.S. support of the Iraqi ruler during the Iran-Iraq War, when we supported one monster (Hussein) in the hopes of defeating another (Khomeini). We knew at that time that Saddam Hussein was using chemical weapons against his enemies and his own people, but we did nothing about it. Or more accurately, we signed a piece of paper saying we disapproved of his use of chemical agents, but we continued cutting deals with him because he was fighting a common enemy. We even sold him some of the chemicals that he used to construct these weapons because he seemed like the lesser of two evils at the time. Ironically, we were therefore partly responsible for creating the monster that he is today.\n\nAs a result, the real reason why the WMD story isn't any bigger is because the Republicans want it just big enough for their conservative supporters to hear it and say to themselves, "They found WMD!" but not so loud that people actually start asking questions about where and how these chemical weapons were manufacture or, more importantly, about who supplied Iraq with the raw materials to make them. That would make Reagan, Rumsefeld, and by extension, the Republican party as a whole look like hypocrites. So it's best to keep the story just large enough for Fox news addicts but not so large that the rest of the world hears about it.\n\nIncidentally, I don't suppose you remember what the liberal response was when Bush originally announced his intention to break international law in order to attack a sovereign nation, claiming that  we "knew" Iraq had WMD? One of the most quoted responses at that time was, "Of course we knew he has WMD! We sold them to him!!!" \n\nOnce again, if you people had only been listening to the liberals in the first place, you'd be so much farther ahead in the game.	Politics & Government

question_title: What is involved when being seqesterd in jury duty? [SEP] question_content: like the duties eating or entertainment. do i watch movies or listen to music...what?

That means you are away from family, friends, tv, radio, even religion (your bible)...basically anything from the outside world that can influence your decision. Your role is to hear all the evidence brought by both sides of the law and give a totally unbiased opinion. Being a sequestered juror is a very important thing! It will probably be very hard at first, but hopefully by the end u will feel fulfilled as a citizen.

question_title: I need some help defining what politcal party I most fit with.? [SEP] question_content: I am now non-partisan but I do have strong feelings about my political views.  For instance, I don't want more taxation and I want government out of every little thing, but I'm for protecting the environment, for social justice, no death penalty, I'm christian but don't think my religion equals my politics.  I think politicians are power-hungry and that government is too bloated. My biggest desire is to "live off the grid".  So where do I fit?  Please, no personal insults about my views.  I tolerate you, you tolerate me and remind each other this is a free country. [SEP] best_answer: There are various quizzes:\nhttp://www.politicalcompass.org/questionnaire\nhttp://www.politicalbrew.com/politest.cgi\nhttp://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html\n\nIt sounds like you're somewhere in between a Democrat/Green/Libertarian/or "Independence Party" (i.e. Ross Perot's old party).\n\nDem: Yes -- social justice env. death penalty, free exercise of religion No -- lower taxes, bloated government.\nGreen -- Environment, Social justice,  No -- Government, taxes.\nLibertarian -- yes -- "live off the grid." No -- social justice, no death penalty.\n\n(P.S. all the libertarians love to say "you're a libertarian," and people love to claim it.  The problem is that "true" libertarians get very close to anarchy.  Do you want the government to ensure quality education and health care for Americans? Do you want businesses regulated responsibly so that they do not destroy the environment or rip off consumers? Do you want to ensure that quality jobs stay in America? Do you think social security, food stamps, unemployment insurance, and the minimum wage are good ideas? Then you're not really a libertarian.  We all like to have the government "leave us alone," the problem is exactly where do we want to leave us alone.)	Politics & Government

question_title: Should the American Republican Party be eliminated, if not destroyed? [SEP] question_content: Many people opine that the Republican party is the most repressive, greedy, racist organization in the history of the planet, far more repressive than nazis, old line Russian communists and czars, and midieval huns.  In addition, people say its orgiastic support for corporate plundering and capitalism has engendered a permanent rift between haves and have-nots, glorifies nuclear power and oil over the alarming cries of most people who claim that global warming will destroy the planet, and represent an absolute, irreversible culture of corruption and terroristic actions against most decent people.  Without the republican party, many people say, we could have more inclusion of people at the policiy levels, enforce Kyoto protocols, eliminate corporations in favor of national and international co-ops of people, enforce racial and gender equality worldwide, and most of all, end tax cuts.\n\nAre all these plausible reasons, or, like me, do you think it's rubbish? [SEP] best_answer: It's rubbish.  Republicans aren't whacking millions of people like the Nazis did.  The Kyoto protocols didn't treat developing nations the same way as developed nations.  India and China are pumping much more green house gas into the atmosphere than the US, but they wouldn't have to play by the same rules.\n\nIt's generally not a good idea to eliminate people with whom you disagree.  Why not become politically active and promote your own ideas in a peaceful way.	Politics & Government

question_title: What is extortion? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Extortion is a criminal offense, which occurs when a person either obtains money or property from another through coercion or intimidation or threatens one with physical harm unless they are paid money or property. Euphemistically, refraining from doing harm is sometimes called protection. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence or a lawsuit which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence or lawsuit is sufficient to commit the offense. The simple four words "pay up or else" are sufficient to constitute the crime of extortion. An extortionate threat made to another in jest is still the crime of extortion.	Politics & Government

question_title: Is the USA going to go to a war agaings IRAN? [SEP] question_content: Is that correct for you, American Cittizen, in order to protect your self againts the Terrorism, to go to that war?\nIs it really because of the Terrorism? [SEP] best_answer: To me, the fact that Bush is investigating Iran because of possible nuclear weapons facilities has nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nEver wonder why the 9/11 hijackers were allegedly from Afghanistan, but somehow we ended up shortly at war against terrorism in Iraq (hm, more oil there....)? It seems pretty clearly to be about the oil. \n\nFirst, we also said we invaded Iraq not only to combat terrorism (with no prove of terrorists from Iraq), and to "free the Iraqi people", which really only destroyed their public facilities and started a civil war. And now suddenly we decide to inspect a neighboring, oil-soaked country for weapons, who are too poor to be making any anyway. Meanwhile, North Korea has confirmed to us that they possess nuclear weapons and would use them, but suspiciously we have no desire to touch them....nothing to gain there!\n\nI feel sorry for people that believe blindly what Bush says to the media and the people, lies that create hatred in our country against the unknown and different. It is quite possible that we will start a war in Iran, but more likely we will just disable them by destroying all they have to get at their oil and not send in what's necessary to take care of the people!

question_title: How would the Fairtax improve your life? [SEP] question_content: Go to Fairtax.org.  read and think.  If you are under 40, you should support this [SEP] best_answer: The fairtax would not only improve my life, but the life of everyone.\n\nUnder this plan, I would not be punished for saving money or selling stocks for a profit.\n\nI am not sure why Steve thinks this would increase taxes on the poor, and give huge tax breaks to the rich.  This is simply not true.\n\nThis plan, like many national sales tax plans I have seen has a tax refund for all money spent up to the poverty level, which means the poor would pay nearly no taxes at all.  This plan would give an automatic $10,000 refund for a single person household, which increases for each additional person, meaning the poor would have at least an extra $10,000 a year of income.  If you are poor than you will not buy enough goods and services to surpass the $10,000+ yearly refund, so the net effect is more money in the pockets of the poor.  Remember a sales tax is a percentage of money spent on goods.  If the national sales tax is 23% and the refund is $10,000, a single person who pays $20,000 a year on goods and services, would have paid $4,600 in taxes.  However, under this plan he would receive a $10,000 refund yielding a net gain of $5,400 each year to either spend or save, and if he were to save it, he would not be taxed on the interest earned on the $5,400 savings.\n \nThe rich are the ones spending the most money, so they will pay the most under this tax plan. \n\nThis plan is the most fair, since if you do not want to pay any taxes then all you have to do is not buy anything and you won't pay any taxes!\n\nGreat Question!

question_title: if some one gets arrested for control device, what are they charged for. what does this mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: if you mean "controlled substance" that means any kind of drug or narcotic that is either illegal or requires a prescription.  if they don't have a prescription or it's on the DEA's schedule of drugs, they can be charged with "possession of a controlled substance".\n\non the other hand, i've sometimes heard "control device" used for when someone is arrested multiple times for drunk driving.  in some states the judge will order that a device, basically a portable breathalyzer, be installed in the person's car.  this makes it so that they have to blow a clean (no alcohol) test in order to start their car.  presumably someone could be arrested for disabling or removing it.

question_title: What will President Bush's guest worker program do? [SEP] question_content: What will President Bush's plan do, and are there any opposing plans being considered? [SEP] best_answer: Guest workers sound great in theory.  But it will be like having illegals with a voice.  Are they citizens?  No.  But they will march just like the pro-illegals marching tomorrow, and guest workers will have a legal foundation to their argument.  People will be more sympathetic:  "Oh, we invited them in."\n\nI'm against the guest worker program.  Read the following.  It's long but good, and I wrote it.\n\n----\n\n\nIllegals aliens are NOT citizens.  They have only HUMAN rights in the USA.  THAT'S IT.  They have no Constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nDeporting them is NOT a civil rights issue.  We have the right to manage our immigration policy however we see fit.\n\nAnd regarding compassion, I have tons of compassion for them.  But we have a country to run, and we can't let people just waltz into the USA.  WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO IMPORT POLITICS.  Poor, uneducated, illiterate people tend to like SOCIALISM.  I don't.  I'm not talking about good all-american bleeding heart liberalism. I'm talking about Castro quality SOCIALISM.\n\nAlso, they are massing in the Southwest by the MILLIONS.  Do you realize that the population of TEXAS is 22 million.  And the proposed legislation wants to make 12 million illegals citizens.  And MOST of those are in the Southwest.  So, don't you think the people of these states have the right to not get their vote diluted by potential SOCIALISTS. This is not about race.  I have no problem with people who are here legally.  But when you allow millions of people in, they congregate together and hold the same political leanings (like allegiance to Mexico and socialistic beliefs).  The fact that most can't speak English just strengthens their solidarity and reinforces their beliefs because they can't understand what most Americans are saying.\n\nThis has the makings of ethnic strife written all over it.  Look at Northern Ireland. Iraq. France. Cyprus. Sudan. Turkey AND Iran with the Kurds.  Quebec in France.  Rwanda.  Yugoslavia.  Chechnya.  China.  And let's not forget Mexico itself, with the indian uprising in the Chiapis.  There is a clear correlation between ethnic strife and large areas that do not integrate into the whole.  This is what will happen if we have entire cities with millions of new non-English speaking citizens spring up in the southwest.  And this will happen if we have an open border.  The 12 million that we're talking about right now is just a start.  What about the next 30 years???  \n\nThe homogeneous culture of America is probably what made America as great as it is.  It is the most populace country in the world with a homogeneous culture.  Yes, we are filled with different races, religions, and ethnicities.  But they all came in, interacted with the other ethnicities, and diffused into living side by side.  Small areas did spring up with primarily one race/religion/ethnicity -- and there was almost always some amount of strife in that area.  Fortunately the areas were small enough to not expand to the level of a national conflict.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by the "guest worker" program.  They'll still be dirt poor, but "legal."  Then they'll have a basis for petitioning for rights.  They WILL want citizenship EN MASSE.  It will be the exact same situation, but worse since they'll have been INVITED.\n\nThe best outcome would be that we can integrate them all in.  But that will not happen.  They are poor.  We are typically the product of our homes, and the homes will be uneducated and spanish speaking.  The second best outcome would be a peaceful secession.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather pay a dollar more per pound of oranges, rather than have my kids or grandkids bombed or have to fight a civil war.

I don't ever recall supporting the capturing of Saddam and taking over their country and building it up brand new.  I don't think it's our business, I realize that Saddam did horrible things to the people in his country, but the country was in better shape then than it is now.  The focus of our war is no longer about 9/11, it's about Bush's personal family issues, he's not doing this for the good of our country, he's doing it for himself.

question_title: how they discovered  the dinosaur and when? and whet it was eat?how many kind dinosaurs of were there? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For hundred of years, bones were found in China, labelled "dragon bones" ground to a poweder and used as folk remedies. Discovering a dinosaur bone was not hard, identifying such bones as being from a disappeared animal required a bit more imagination, running against the "teaching" of religious beliefs.\nThe first full dinosaur skeleton discovered which was recognized as such, occured in 1858, 148 years ago (see link).\n\nAs to the number of dinosaur spieces, it must have been nearly one million.  There are 5500 species of mammals alive today, and most of them are less than one million year old (the ancestor of those mammals living today disappared, along with some speices that dies off without leaving descendants). If one assumes that dinosaurs occupied essentially all the ecological niche that mamallians do today (there were tiny dinosaurs the size of mouse, no all dinosaurs were huge) and given that dinosaurs lived and ruled the Earth from 230 million years ago until 65 million years ago (so 165 million years), and assuming that a speice lasts one million years, that is about one million indeed.\nWe will never find them all, many dinosaurs may have disappered without leaving traces that we will ever find.

question_title: Is new medical technology actually screwing us in the end?? [SEP] question_content: We've all heard of natural selection, only the strong are supposed to live on and reproduce. But with today's technology people with bad genes continue to live, reproduce, and pass on their genes to their children. [SEP] best_answer: If you mean "are maladaptive genes being increased in the population because conditions that would otherwise reduce or eliminate the potential for propagation are being corrected?"  Yes, that's a reasonable assumption.  To talk about it seems to scare some people since it raises the possibility of eugenics, or selective breeding like Hitler's people tried.  \nWhile gene mutations occur very slowly, it doesn't have to take very long for genetic frequency shifts to occur.  The maladaptive gene potential exists at low levels because it may, in certain combinations offer an adaptive trait like recessive sickle cell trait appears to reduce malaria infections.  Even if the recessive gene seems to confer no survival advantage, probability suggests that it may continue to remain at a low rate as a recessive gene within a population.  These recessive genes are only a problem when two recessive carriers mate.  Under "natural" conditions, when two healthy carriers of a maladaptive trait mate, some children may be free of the trait, some may be healthy carriers, while some unfortunate children will have inherited only the recessive genes and would be too sick, or die before they could pass the trait forward into the next generation.  Now that we can treat so many otherwise disabling, or fatal disorders, one could expect a gene frequency shift as the prevalence of these maladaptive genes rises with the now possible successful reproduction of the 100% carriers.   Genetic counseling may ameliorate some of the potential maladaptive gene propagation, but not all  - - and some people will shriek in horror at the possibility that anyone might be made to feel pressured to forgo their right to reproduce.  \nYou know that we have always been selectively breeding ourselves, and that now, more than ever, we have the potential to breed in or out those traits that we want, or are willing to allow.  The next big battle will be over whether we should be allowed to permanently alter genetic make-ups.  Maybe we will one day be able to "fix" mutations and maladaptive genes.  But should we?  Would it be wise to keep the genetic diversity intact in case it somehow confirs an advantage in the future?  Will the same crowd that opposes cloning of any kind allow genetic modification?  Is it "fair" to allow parents to select genetic moidifications of their children when other modifications such as steroid augmentation is wrong?  - - - So many ethical issues here!\nIt would be interesting to hear some of your conjectures about what the human population might be like 100 or 1000 generations from now.

question_title: A gas sample is collected in a balloon. What happens to the density of the gas sample as the sample is heated? [SEP] question_content: A) decreases\nB) increases\nC) does not change\nD) could increase or decrease, depending on how much it was heated\n\nPlease explain also. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: The density will decrease.  This is because heating the gas will cause its pressure to increase.  The rubber (or whatever fabric the balloon is made of) will respond by moving outwards.  Therefore the volume will have increased and, since the mass of the gas will not have changed, it density will decrease.  The actual amount by which it decreases will depend on the elasticity of the fabric.\n\nIt's much easier to quantify the decrease if you are dealing with an open-necked balloon (such as a hot-air balloon), as the density of the gas is, to a fairly close approximation, inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.  So, if it is heated from 200°C (473K) to 300°C (573K), its density will decrease by a factor of 573 ÷ 473  =   1·211 (or, its density will become 0·825 (82·5%) of what it was before).

question_title: is there more ways to get a different 3x3 of magic squares using #'s 1-9? [SEP] question_content: Can you make more than one 3x3 magic square adding only using the numbers 1-9?.... [SEP] best_answer: Discounting rotations and mirror images, there is only one way to make a magic square using the digits 1 through 9.  \n\nFirst, we can prove the 5 has to go in the middle:\n\nLet the numbers in the top row from left to right be a, b, and c.  Let the numbers in the middle row from left to right be d, e, and f.  (Note e is the middle box.)  Let the numbers in the bottom row from left to right be g, h, and i.     \n\nWe know a + b + c = 15 and g + h + i = 15\n\nWe also know a + e + i = 15, b + e + h = 15, and c + e + g =15.  Therefore, (a + e + i) + (b + e + h) + (c + e + g) = 15 * 3 = 45.  We can rearrange this to (a + b + c) + (g + h + i) + 3e = 45.  Since a + b + c = 15 and g + h + i = 15, that reduces to 15 + 15 + 3e = 45, or 3e = 15.  Therefore e (the middle box) must equal 5.   \n\nKnowing the middle box is 5, try 9 in a corner and you'll notice a problem - the 6, 7 and 8 can't all be placed in the square without the row or column with the 9 exceeding 15.  So, the 9 has to occupy a side box.  Since we are discounting rotations and mirror images, we can arbitrarily select box b for the 9.  This forces the placement of the 1 in box h.   \n\nWith the 9 and 1 now placed, the 8 and 6 have to go in the row with the 1.  So, we'll put the 8 in box g and the 6 in box i.  (We still haven't done anything to create a second square if rotations and mirror images are discounted.)  That forces the placement of the final four numbers.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: is a pole reversal happening right now?explain.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Yes, it is likely that we are experiencing a reversal at this time. \n\nThe earth's magnetic field has been decreasing in field strength by about 5% per century in recent times. This is one of the fastest decreases of the magnetic field that has ever been verified. Around 700 AD the earth's magnetic field was about 50% higher than it is now. At this rate, it is estimated that the earth could reach a zero-strength magnetic field in about 2000 years. Magnetic reversals are usually triggered when the field strength approaches zero.  Another indication that some geologists and geophysicists believe may be pointing to a reversal is that the poles have been wandering at a faster rate than is commonly seen in the rock record. This instability of the magnetic field suggests we may be close to a reversal. \n\nAlso consider that since we have never experienced a reversal this is hardly a certainty. The earth's magnetic field fluctuates quite widely during what are known as 'excursions', and these are as frequent as every 50,000 years. Our current changes in the magnetic field may result in nothing more than an excursion, which is not a reversal of the field. There have been at least 11 of these excursions since the last reversal at 730,000 years before present. \n\nI've done magnetostratigraphic work.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what function of proprioception? [SEP] question_content: physiognomy [SEP] best_answer: Propioception tells you how streched or under what tension your muscles are.  When you close your eyes, and move your arms and legs, you still know, almost exactly, where your limbs are-how far away from each other, what shape your fingers are in, etc, because propioception tells you how stretched or relaxed each muscle is.  It also tells you how heavy or light something is, based on the tension on your muscle.  It has to be learned, and is generally learned in infancy and early childhood, but athletes and weightlfters show that you can continue to hone this, and sharpen your sensation with practice.  Propioception is strongly effected by alcohol, and is why they do the "touch your nose with your eyes closed" test, because this is a fairly pure test of propioception.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the turle legend? [SEP] question_content: mAth [SEP] best_answer: The Beast of Busco is the subject of a local legend in Churubusco, Indiana about an enormous snapping turtle named Oscar which terrorized the citizens back in 1949. Despite a month's long hunt that briefly gained national attention, the Beast of Busco was never found and is considered long gone. But Oscar's memory lives on in Churubusco's Turtle Days festival held each June. It includes a parade, carnival and turtle races.\n\nA turtle shell labeled "Beast of Busco" hangs in the Two Brother's Restaurant in Decatur, Indiana. It is most likely a fake.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Where Homologous Chromosomes pairs? [SEP] question_content: Cell Division [SEP] best_answer: In every cell of the human body there are 46 chromosomes: 44 somatic coding chromosomes (body coding) and 2 sex chromosomes.\n\nEach chromosome is part of a pair.  Each one of the pair codes for the same thing, though not necessarily the identical way (for example, one of the set may code for blue eyes, one may code for brown eyes). \n\nThe idea of homologous pairs is important during meiosis, when the chromosomes replicate, and find their homologous pairing, forming a tetrad (a structure with 4 chromatids from the joining of 2 replicated homologous chromosomes).\n\nHope this helps.

question_title: Where is the oldest tree of the world is found? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The Guinness Book of World Records currently lists a 12,000 year old California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) named "Eternal God" as the oldest tree on earth. Previously, the "Methuselah" Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) held the record at about 4,700 years.\n\nThe Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) was first identified as a long-lived tree by Dr Edmund Schulman following surveys in California's White Mountains in 1954. The oldest pines grow at elevations above 3,000 metres in arid, rocky areas of the Great Basin that covers the state of Nevada and parts of Utah and California. (This mountainous area of 500,000 square kilometres has no rivers or creeks flowing out of it.) They exist on the tree line in severe conditions, and often appear to be mostly dead, with only part of the trunk having living bark and leaves. This growth strategy is a response to damage from climate and lightning strikes, and allows the tree to exist on limited resources.\n\nThe bristlecones of Wheeler Peak in Nevada were believed to be older than those found in California. In 1964 a geology student called Donald R. Currey came to Wheeler Peak to study ice age glaciers, partly by collecting tree ring data. Using coring tools, he identified trees over 4,000 years old.\n\nWhen his coring tool jammed inside a massive tree, he asked for, and received, permission from the US Forest Service to cut the tree off at 2.4 metres above the ground and keep a horizontal slab for study. When this slab had its rings counted, it turned out to be over 4,844 years old. Later cores taken closer to ground level by dendrochronologist Don Graybill showed it to be 4,862 years old - the oldest living thing ever discovered.\n\nWheeler Peak is now part of the Great Basin National Park, which was created in 1986.\n\nThen a 4,600+ year old bristlecone called "Methuselah" in the White Mountains of California was considered as the oldest tree now living. Some reports have it as 4,789 years old.\n\nWe can say,today,as ref to The Guinness Book of World Records,12,000 year old California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) named "Eternal God" is the oldest tree on earth!!

question_title: What GC stationary phase can withstand temperatures up to 400 C and is completely nonpolar? [SEP] question_content: For separation of alkanes C20 - C30.\nIf no such stationary phase exists how do I perform the experiment? [SEP] best_answer: I am not familiar with such a stationary phase, but you should check Agilent's website. They offer a variety of stationary phases for GC, and also have good tech support. There are several other companies out there, but Agilent is the one I have used. If there isn't one for GC, maybe they have some recommendations for HPLC. You might have to derivatize your compounds somehow and use a polar column. You are trying to separate out some really "greasy" compounds. I don't envy you! Good luck. :-)	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Suppose we could somehow extract 1.0% of the Earth's rotational kinetic energy to use for human needs? [SEP] question_content: By how much would that change the length of the day?  For how many years would 1.0% of the Earth's rotational kinetic energy supply the world's energy needs, assuming these needs are a constant 1.0 x 10^21 J per year? [SEP] best_answer: the earth rotational energy is calculated to be  2.58×10^29 J , thus 0.01 of this is 2.58*10^27J , and this enough for human needs for about  2580000000 years .\n\nand if we asume that the energy decrease the rotational energy by the same portion (0.01%) then the day length will decrease by 14.4 mins.

question_title: what is the greatest force in the universe? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would say the strong nuclear force, that holds quarks together in protons and neutrons. This is the strongest if you add up all the individual forces in the universe, as it is present in every proton and neutron in every atom in the universe. If the strong force disappeared, the entire universe would instantly explode into fundamental particles.\n\nOn the other hand, on an everyday scale, the electromagnetic force is most noticeable (it is responsible for everyday forces between objects), and is stronger than gravity (by standing up the electromagnetic forces between atoms of your feet and the floor are overcoming the gravity of an entire planet.)

question_title: Have you ever really touched anything in your life?  What do you think it was? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: One of my physics professors believed we can never truly touch anything.  The outer part of every atom is the electrons.  Since electrons are all negative, when we try to touch something our own electrons would cause a repulsion of the electrons in the object we are trying to touch.  He believed that we actually feel the electrons repelling each other - not the actual object.  The electric repulsion would be too great for our hands to actually touch the object.

question_title: why do we get satellite peaks in XRD pattern of superlattices? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: because some are geostationary, and others are orbiting, so sometimes there are plenty in the sky above you, and other times there are only a few. In order to stop them hitting each other when they are bunched up they need to move in a synchonised pattern (XRD) of superlatticing and interweaving their trajectories through the crowded field. Eventually society will determine this method is inneficient and put a ceiling on the sky, engulfing the earth in a thin layer of high tech equipment, and this dome ceiling will write the history books as the first major internationally organised and build space structure, paving the way for a human society in space. One day earth will be gone, but humanity will live on.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think marriage is a wise decision only if you love the other person. You should care more about the other than yourself. Your life should be truly devoted to providing happiness and well being for the other. You should be able to communicate.

[SEP] best_answer: I do believe it depends on the state that you are getting married in, however, you can always call city hall, and find out what they would be willing, or not willing to do for you.  They may send out the license to you to fill out, and send back to them, maybe with copies of drivers license and such...On the other things, use your relatives to book for you....you don't have to be the one who books the church and such, and long as someone gives the money, that is why people hire a wedding planner most of the time.

[SEP] question_content: questions that say \nhow do i know if he likes me?\nhow do you talk to your crush?\nwhat do i do, i like this boy but...? [SEP] best_answer: It's annoying cause you'd think they'd just read other questions like it. I mean when you ask a question, it lists other questions like yours right under the box you're typing in. You'd think they have enough sense in their heads (even if they are teenagers) to just click on the other questions and read what advice they're giving there. No, they have to make users retype the advice. I've just learned that there's nothing you can do to stop the 200 questions that are asked like this a day. So I just put the link to another question like it in my answer...and still get my two points :D.

In 1997, this so-called friend slept with my boyfriend of about a year.  Yes I was deeply hurt and disappointed, of course.  At the same time, she had recently been through a very traumatic, life changing experience, so I forgave her.  In 2002, she slept with another one of MY men, someone I was only with for a couple months, but it still hurt.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, and yes it's such a shame because I forgave her again like the sucker I am.\nI am now married, only for a few months, and she recently asked my husband for a ride two times because she was stranded, without my consent or knowledge.  My husband didn't go get her, he cant stand her for all the pain she's put me through. \nTo finally get to the point, I'm extremely angry with her and told her to go fucc off.  Am I wrong for kickin her to the curb? [SEP] best_answer: I don't think so-- at all. She's the one that should be apologizing to you and asking for your forgiveness. It sounds like this woman is more concerned about herself than she is anyone else. If she can't be respectful, you shouldn't have to be around her. I think she definitely deserveed that kind of slap in the face. She had it coming.	Family & Relationships

question_title: Ladies: What really leaves an impression on you? [SEP] question_content: I'm an organizer of a singles' group in my area, and occasionally make the presentation for the week. My next topic: Ways a Man Can Impress a Woman He is Interested In (the guys in the group are sooooo looking forward to this one!).\n\nI have my topic pretty much prepared, but this forum is a valuable opportunity to hear from the rest of the world. So, girls, give me the goods. For you, what makes a guy stand out from all the others trying to get your attention? How does he go the extra mile to let you know that you are the icing on his cake? And what makes you take that next step - responding to him?\n\nGuys, this could be golden info for you! ;-) [SEP] best_answer: On the last date I went on, we were eating at a restaurant and when we got up to leave, my date helped me put my coat on.  He was really good at it!  I made a comment about it and he said that his grandfather had taught him how.  It was a smooth little detail but it was very impressive.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering about the trick, he said it's to hold the coat lower than you would think.  This makes sense because it's hard to put your arm up when it's behind you.\n\nThat was a little thing, of course.  What really attracts me to a guy is a positive attitude and if he's willing to just have an open conversation with me.  If I feel like I'm doing all the work to keep the conversation going and on a positive note, that's a turn-off.	Family & Relationships

question_title: i need help with relation problems? [SEP] question_content: i have this bf and i really like him but he acts like he likes my cousin and not me. but he tells everyone that he likes me and not her what should i do should i tell him that i am gettin jealous? or tell him that it is me or her?his friend dosent even know how to help so if you can help me then it will mean alot to me. [SEP] best_answer: If you find out it is her he's interested in, make him choose but don't say "her or me". Here's how you do it. \n\nStart "losing interest" in him....start making it noticeable that you might be interested in one of his friends, or talk to one of your friends to set this up. Make it appear in front of him that you are losing interest in him and gaining interest in someone else. See if you can get 1 of your friends to play along...that would be safest.\n\nTheres only 2 ways he can react. He'll either go for your cousin, if indeed he even likes her. or he will get jealous and be protective of you...and come back to you. Thing is you won't be able to keep him from going to your cousin if he does like her but if i know guys and if i know myself, I will be twice as likely to act out of jealousy and go back after you. See you are his "territory" so to speak, in guy language, and once he sees it being invaded on, he will most likely drop everything to protect what he has. Only don't be too flirtatious so as to cause him to get very angry. Just a bit of interest in someone else should spark his jealousy. But don't make him choose by telling him. I have a rule for myself........I'm never the first one to fall in love....never. This way I have a lot more control to do these sorts of things in order to protect what I really want. It will be very hard if you are already in love with him.\n\nSome guys won't react because of fear of confrontation. If this is your man, observe him out of the corner of your eye whenever you start showing interest in someone else. If you can see he's starting to sweat it, go back over to him and stay with him and make him feel secure. Do it however many times it takes until you get a reaction. Then do it 2-3 more times after that but no more. Once he realizes that what he has is in jeopardy, you've got him.	Family & Relationships

question_title: I de-pants my step son in public. His underware did not come down. I thouhgt it was funny,he did not.He is 10. [SEP] question_content: He told his real mother that i did this and his grandma know the whole family is mad at me for doing this.  The reason i did this was to prove a point that he must wear a belt when he goes to school or out in public.  otherwise his pants and being held up by his privates.  I do not approve of that. So i pants him. [SEP] best_answer: What are you - a juvenile?\n\nI am not surprised your stepson is upset and the family is mad. What you did was assault his person in public. Proving a point is one thing but you did not have to humiliate your stepson by pulling down his pants in public. A private demonstration would have sufficed and as the adult in this particular case, you could have picked a better way to demonstrate why you felt a belt was a good idea.\n\nNext time try explaining the risks to him and then, if he still doesn't get it, demonstrate on yourself (in front of his mother) what could happen if he does not take the precaution of wearing a belt.

Trust me, he will be impressed and hopefully, like you back.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: I think that if you have to ask, then no, it wasn't a good idea.  I'm glad that he asked, and I'm glad that you consented.  I'm also glad that you regret it.\nWhat's done is done.  More than likely you will continue the activity, but I want you to consider something....\nJust because the deed is done, doesn't mean you have to keep doing it.  If you really regret it, and feel that you truly were not ready yet, there is absolutely no shame in declining to engage further.  If you feel it appropriate, get together w/ your bf & tell him, "Look, it was really great, but now i regret it, and I just don't think I was ready.  So I'd really like to wait...before I do it again."\nAny good guy will respect that.  If the dude has a fit, drop him.  It's a good test of character.\nAs for you, you can run that game all you want, but I'm willing to bet you'll still be weak enough to give in if the situation comes about  ;-)  Just a fact of life, babe.\nSOooo... yes, it's too late to go back; no, it's not too late to wait; and yes, if you choose to wait, you should avoid situations where you can get caught up in the lust.\nDon't worry.  It happens to the best of us  :-)	Family & Relationships

I am in good shape and confident.  I have younger women hitting on me all the time.  It seems like the older I get the more frequently this happens.  They know I am married, but that doesn't seem to matter.  This question is for women between the ages of 18-24.  What would you want from a married man almost twice your age?  Is this a common fettish for younger women?  Could it just be the uniform? [SEP] best_answer: Hmmm. Take out the married part and I could see the attraction.  Older men are more mature, and a lot of younger woman find that attractive.  Especially if they're sick of dating immature people.  And it could be the uniform, especially if it is a type that puts you in a place of power (think cop, lol).  I don't really have respect for anyone who goes after a married man.\n\nBut who knows.  Maybe you're just cute and they like flirting?	Family & Relationships

question_title: Can you see the NHL having expansion teams in the future? If so, where?

[SEP] best_answer: the talent pool is currently so diluted, and there is already too many teams... expansion wont happen unless teams start folding which isnt likely. what is most likely is that teams will move into some of the cities you mentioned. \n\nCleveland: that is possible\nOklahoma City: that is possible\nLas Vegas: there has been rumours of that, but i dont think it will happen\nSeattle: they need a new arena to be able to have a team; Portland Oregon is more likely\n\nToronto: Not likely because the leafs like being the only team in town and would have to approve another team entering their market which they likely wont do!\nQuebec City: Always possible\nWinnipeg: the next team that moves will likely go to the 'peg\nHalifax: probably need a bigger arena and a bigger population, but possible years from now\nst john's: probably need a bigger arena and a bigger population, but possible years from now	Sports

question_title: Hunters Only!? [SEP] question_content: Yeah, like that is gonna work!!!\n\nI have noticed that there is an increasing amount of harrassment from the antihunters that cruise the site looking to cause trouble and harrass the hunters.  This is unacceptable.  I posted a question previously, concerning this topic, but I believe it is time to level the playing field.\nEvery time someone has a complaint filed against them and the complaint is found valid, it knocks points off that user's score...I have reported every insulting or threatening reply as harrassment.  That is exactly what we are dealing with here....they have nothing positive to say, nor can they speak in a polite or even an intelligent manner, instead using insults and threatening remarks. Therefore, the antihunters are violating community guidelines.  Join me in my attempt to stop such harrassing communications!  Report them!\n\nSo, to make this a valid question, (see "got my first deer") here's the question:  WILL YOU STAND UP AND JOIN ME??? [SEP] best_answer: I join & applaud you, I have been a  hunter for many years & will continue to do so. I would never torture & maim an animal just for cruel sport & shoot to kill..and to put in my freezer..As I said in another post, if anyone of these people went to a slaughter house, where their bacon, sausage, hamburger & steaks came from & saw what really happens as these animals are slaughtered, they would think twice about what they say & think about hunters, and as for the folks that dont eat meat, that is a choice of yours & not ours..

The fact that after all their hard work, their fate was decided by a replacement goalie SUCKS.   We played better than they did.

question_title: will the Oakland Raiders be in the playoffs in the next two years? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You never know because of how unpredictable the NFL is. Did anyone expect the Panthers to make the Super Bowl after only winning 1 game in 2001?  Did anyone see the Rams winning the Super Bowl in 1999 after being 4-12 the previous season?  No.\nThe Raiders have a chance at making the playoffs, but if had to be $100 on it, I would say no.  They are at the very beginning of a rebuilding phase in which they gradually phase out their veterans and replace them with younger talent.  To keep fans interested, they'll still keep some of their high priced veterans like Moss and Sapp. Al Davis will not admit that's where the team is, but that's what the team is doing. Maybe in 3 or 4 years the team will be contending but not within the next two years.	Sports

question_title: Any truth to this rumor? [SEP] question_content: A friend of mine owns a couple of claiming racehorses. He usually races them at Hoosier Park in Anderson. He recently told me that Churchill Downs Inc. (who owns the track) sold HP and next year the new owners are only running harness racing. Please tell me this isn't true! [SEP] best_answer: I am from Anderson, Indiana and I have not heard about this development. It seems quite unlikely that CDI would sell their shares of Hoosier Park at this time. There will be slots legislature considered soon that could give Hoosier Park a large share of the machines and revenue share from them.\n\nLet me say that we in Anderson are looking forward to hosting the Indiana Derby for many years to come. In addition more and more Indiana bred runners are making their mark nationally. The horse racing industry appears to be very stable in Indiana. Until slots are decided, I cannot predict they will pull out of this market before then.\n\n The company DID sell HP in fact. They sold their controlling interest of Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California last year. The new owners are now running on a very expensive, new  "Polytrack"  surface. I predict that they will conduct racing at that facility for the foreseeable future.\n\n There is some pressure on Hollywood Park to sell the property they own for significant commercial development. I would say the owners response can be measured by their investment in a new track surface. They don't intend to move!\n\n Harness racing is very big in Indiana but they cannot shut out thoroughbred racing interests from the scene.  You or your friend can e-mail to me if you would like to discuss the issue further. I have covered every detail of Hoosier Park since before the day they opened their doors.\n\nHere is a link to their 3rd qtr. earnings report that details their recent activity.\nhttp://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com/our_company/company_news/2006_news_releases/company_news_11072006.html	Sports
question_title: Why do so many people love to watch Nascar Racing? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, first of all about 5 years ago I thought it was really boring until I started watching it. Now I am total addicted to it, I watch all 3 series of the racing, from the trucks, Busch and Nextel! Once you pick a driver and have friends that watch it, it is alot of fun. It is a very competitive sport actually. Also it is a total adrenaline rush when your driver takes over the lead in turn 3 on the final lap...nothing better to get the blood totally pumping. \nYou have to think of it another way though too, why do so many people watch football? Where with football it is not just one person doing all the work...he has alot of help out there. Where in Nascar if the drivers car is total junk...he has no one else that he can rely on other than himself and his crew to make it better. And if he gets loose and crashes they can't blame anyone else. Where in football...if one player is off that day, they have many more to rely on.\nI say the people that don't know why people watch nascar, probably haven't watched it much and probably haven't given it a chance.\nMy suggestion is to pick a driver (just not Jr. to join that ban wagon) but someone that you can connect with and start watching and than maybe you will understand why people watch.

question_title: Ever been to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park? [SEP] question_content: what is your opinion?  did you camp?  did you kayak?  did you dive?  did you snorkel? where is the best place to get a good shot of the sunrise, or sunset?  let me know about your experience with the park. thouse who fill in the most details will be voted best. [SEP] best_answer: I've been there several times as I lived nearby for six years. You can rent kayaks, snorkel, and dive in several places along the keys. I went snorkeling off of Key Largo and there's plenty to see. If you are interested in seeing sharks I recommend getting a kayak and go to Cudjoe Key which is a few miles up from Key West. Expect to see black tip reef and nurse sharks, sting rays are plenty. If you snorkel, watch for jellies, they will leave you itching. \n\nI don't know of any camping on the keys but if you have the time I believe you can overnight at the Dry Tortugas which is off the coast of Key West therefore only accessible by plane or boat, this former military fort site has excellent snorkeling.  Best place to get a sunrise/sunset pic is there and another good sunset pic would be from Mallory Square in Key West. Be sure to catch the Sunset Celebration every night at Mallory Square, too! Sunrise pics are best from the east side of any island. There are plenty of web sites you can get info from. Don't forget sunscreen!!!	Sports

I've seen these advertised in hockey magazines like the USA Hockey members magazine. They are easily found on the web as well. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, you will minimally need to put together some kind of frame and potentially lay out plastic to keep the water from seeping into the ground.  If you have a natural depression in your yard (as was the case with my dirt driveway when growing up) and you don't care about the shape of your rink you could just fill it with water when it gets cold enough.  You can't get much cheaper than that!	Sports

Where can i get my self trained ?\nesp online . It would be great help. [SEP] best_answer: SAS Institute Inc., headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, USA, has been a major producer of software since it was founded in 1976 by Anthony Barr, James Goodnight, John Sall and Jane Helwig. SAS was originally an acronym for Statistical Analysis System but for many years has been used as an arbitrary tradename (for which the company has received trademark protection in the US and abroad) to refer to the company as a whole, its products having long since broadened beyond the statistical analysis sphere.\n\n\nIts main and original product was the SAS software package used in statistical analysis, consisting of numerous modules which ran on IBM mainframe computers. In addition to the usual mainframe practice of writing and submitting programs in batch, SAS offered the option, somewhat novel at the time, of a windowed programming environment, where the program being written or edited appeared in one window, the program output appeared in another window, and the program log appeared in a third window.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute\n\nAlso A specialist regiment of the British army that is trained in commando techniques of warfare and used in clandestine operations (especially against terrorist groups) - Special Air Service	Business & Finance

I asked my manager what should I put on my application for reason for leaving, I quit? She told me that would work and she wouldn't tell what happened. I went to apply for a new job and put that I quit for not enough hours. I was at my new job for only a month and they fired me because I lied on my app. My new mgr told me my former mgr ratted me out. I called her and asked her why she did that?! She had no answers for me.  I have had 3 other jobs since then. On two of the job apps, I did not tell them I worked where I was fired. I go to fill out applications and I do not put either of those jobs on my apps. I am scared because of this. What should I do on future apps? Or when I start my career? [SEP] best_answer: You need to stop whining, and then you need to stop lying on your job applications. Once you mature, maybe you'll be able to keep a job.	Business & Finance

question_title: Is common law marriage still common law marriage if you live in your parent's house and not your own? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend and I have been living together for over two years but in my dad's house, if we don't have our own place that is ours could we still be considered married? [SEP] best_answer: Under TX law, both parties must (1) both act as if you are married to each other, so that an objectively reasonable person would view you as married; and (2) both intend that you be married to each other.\n\nThe fact that you live in a particular abode or circumstances is irrelevant, unless it is evidence showing that you are not acting as married so that the public would view you as such, or that you don't intend to be married.\n\nHowever, in order to be actually granted legal status as married, a court must find that you satisfy the common law requirements. So, until you sue your boyfriend/husband for some injury you suffered that can only be redressed by a court as between married persons, then it really doesn't matter, because, in the eyes of the law you're not married.\n\nSo, if your objective is that both you and your boyfriend wish to be viewed as married, then just tell people that you are married, and they will believe you.\n\nConversely, if you want to assert some right against your boyfriend, then you'll have to ask a court to grant you the right first, before you can legally enforce that right.

question_title: Are online/correspondence/distance learning degrees respected? [SEP] question_content: By you?\nBy the public?\nMost importantly, by employers? [SEP] best_answer: Online, correspondence, and distance learning degrees are gaining some acceptance and respect as programs are proven complete and successful.  One thing to look at before jumping into one of the is the accredation of the company offering the course(s).  In order for the credit that you earn with one of them to be transferable, the place offering the credit MUST be accredited by a national AND regional accrediting body.  I STRONGLY suggest that you locate contact information for the accrediting body in your area and check it with them.  If you simply ask the school that offers the credit for the program you are considering, you will be told something like, "Every institution evaluates credit from another school based upon their own criteria and we can't tell you if our credits will be accepted by them or not."  That is a HUGE RED FLAG!  Do your own research!!	Business & Finance

[SEP] best_answer: Hi,\n\nLuis Galarza here...\n\nWell my friend if you really want to earn more money in 2 month and maybe build a business that will generate a monthly residual income and not just "more money" I really recommend you to go for Partnership business and MLM or Network Marketing... Why? Simple because you can start any of this business with no or little investment from your part.\n\nPartnership Business: When I said partnership business I am talking about that you can earn more money with JV or Joint Venture Partnerships and Affiliate or Associate Program Marketing. \n\nThis type of business can be very lucrative if you know how to market on the internet the right way. Plus, you don't need:\n\n- A product\n- Employees\n- Office or storefront\n- Merchant Account\n- Phone\n\nAnd you don't have to worry about returns, customer service or sales support, the merchant does all that for you. The only thing you have to do is send traffic to the unique link or links the merchant provide you when you sign up for their affiliate program.\n\nMLM or Network Marketing: Is just another form of Affiliate Program where you can make money by selling the merchant's products or services and you can earn even more money by introducing more people to the business opportunity and teaching them to do the same, which is what network marketers call "Downline".\n\nThe bigger your downline the less work you need to do and the more money you can earn. You can do the same thing on some multi-tier or multi-level affiliate programs... (See resource box for some useful links).\n\nDid you know that even Donald Trump knows that Network Marketing is the way to go... That's exatly what he recommends to anyone who wants to start a new business on a low budget. \n\nAnd he's right... Because you get everything you need from the business plan, business training, and business supplies design to help you earn more money.\n\nPros: Low or no investment, and big money to be make\n\nCons: 95% to 98% make little or no money on ths industrys.\n\nThat's why I really recommend you to get the training you need to have a successful business venture that can earn you more and money for years to come...\n\nHope this little tip will help you.\n\nTo YOUR Success,\n\nLuis Galarza, CEO of\nFree Affiliate Marketing Training Membership Site\nhttp://www.AffiliateCashSecretsClub.com/ \n\nP.S. Test you marketing until you find what works for you, don't be like those poeple that can't earn any money on a affiliate program or network marketing opportunity and then they call it scam.\n\nRemember any business have the potential to make money and you are the only one that can make it happen!\n\nAlso you can visit my blog for more tips at:\nhttp://luisgalarza.blogspot.com/ \n\n\n\n\n.

question_title: What to do about a harrassing creditor? [SEP] question_content: I have a credtor that has been calling me about 2-4 times a week for about 2-3 months now. I have requested that all information about the account to be sent to me four times and still I haven't received anything.I asked on the phone three times and once with a notorized, certified letter. I also requested in the letter for her company to not contact me over the phone anymore and only through the mail. They are still calling me! I feel very harrassed at this point! And I am aware of what my rights are in this situation. But I am unsure of if it is time for me to turn this over to an attorney, or file a complaint to the department of consumer affairs, or what do I do now? Because I am running out of ideas here. If someone has an idea please give it. Thank you. [SEP] best_answer: You tell them, and send a letter, that you will report them to the to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You have rights. You can take action to stop the abuse. The links are to the FTC and their complaint form. Please check it out to learn about your rights. Good luck.\n\n"Report any problems you have with a debt collector to your state Attorney General' s office and the Federal Trade Commission.

question_title: Has anyone invested and tried the Save Avenue Online store bussiness website?? [SEP] question_content: I'm interested in investing to start my own online store with this company cause they cover all the expenses- host fees,merchant accounts,shipping and there's no yearly or monthly fees- just a one time set-up fee- to get your own web-site to promote -you can even feature your own products to sell (like crafts or things you make your self) - Its with the BBB and the FCC and there is a 100% money back garentee - I just want to know if there is anyone out there who is currently running a site from this Co. to see how you like it. The guy on the phone did not pressure me in any way and out of all the options I've come accross for a home bussiness this one seems the best cause not only will I be featuring their products but I can sell my own personal stuff as well with 95% profit and you get 5 paychecks a month -one a week and one a month - so let me know if you own on of these sites - I'd love to hear what you have to say about it [SEP] best_answer: There is something in the ripoffreport.com warning against this company. \n\nhttp://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/ripoff153493.htm\n\nOne thing I'll warn you against is basically you are paying them to give you a website that is EXACTLY what other of their customers have, with the same EXACT products as the other members. How do you expect to earn money from that?\n\nTake a look at their sample store pages and the first two sites they feature http://www.ecashstreet.com/?pg=samples\n\nhttp://www.estorebiz.com/snic/\nhttp://www.greatfindsbyshari.com/\n\nOne thing that jumped at me is that these two pages look VASTLY DIFFERENT from the screenshot in the sample pages page of ecashstreet.com. Greatfindsbyshari.com on the sample page looks very professional with a woman standing in the top middle - but clicking on the site goes to a drab looking template and the only sign of greatfindsbyshari.com is the logo.\n\nI say stay away with it. You are not going to make money by signing up with them. Having the same replica website offering the same exact products with hundreds or thousands of other websites is the surest way to lose money on the Web.	Business & Finance

question_title: How far in advance should you start the home buying process compared to when you'd actually move in? [SEP] question_content: For instance..we plan to move around November December is it too soon to begin looking?  Or is now the perfect time to at least start getting ideas and looking around to see what's out there? [SEP] best_answer: You will usually take as few as 15 days to as many as 45 days to close from the day you sign the agreement. So ideally you would make offers you expect to be accepted at 45 days from the move in date. You will then raise the offers them and tighten up the closing date as the deadline approaches if you have to move. Remember there is usually a day or two before it funds and you get the keys, or put in the offer you take possesion at closing. Otherwise it is at funding.\n\nYou should start getting comfortable with the market by looking on your own. You probably don't want to tie up your own agent for this long. So call the listing agent when you want to see inside a house. Otherwise just look at the prices and the paper and maybe drive by. Once you are ready to start making real offers within a month then get your agent lined up. You will even have several that you already talked to and you might like.\n\nAnother option is to start making lowball offers in the mean time and see if any get accepted. My wife and I started looking in Jan a few years ago and made offers 15% below the listed price if it was a very reasonable price, and as much as 20-25% if it was inflated for a big sell. (you can use www.zillow.com to help with valuation, but it isnt perfect remember). It took 8 offers (7 rejections) and we moved in in July to a house that was appraised for 10% more than we paid! Just tell your agent what the plan is so she isn't surprised when you don't come up to reasonable offers. You might even consider springing for lunch once in a while since you are really making her work hard.\n\nMake sure you can afford to have the house early if you get it, otherwise you might not want to try that.\n\nGood luck	Business & Finance
question_title: prequalification? [SEP] question_content: if I was prequalified for $90,100 for a home purchase, the program say's that I have 100% financing, with $0 down, but I want to purchase a house for $250,000, how does that work. Also my closing cost is included in the package. how does this work and how would I calculate a mortgae payment? [SEP] best_answer: First of all, just to let you know, being "pre-qualified" is really nothing. It doesn't take into account your credit history or score, it isn't based on any facts, it is to loose to be taken seriously.\n\nSo, what you need to do is get pre-approved. And the only thing that should cost you is 30-35 dollars (maybe) for the cost of the credit report the mortgage company is charged by the company that supplies them the information. If anyone tries to charge you more than that to get pre-approved, they are ripping you off and you should go elsewhere! \n\nPre-approvals actually take into account factual information you supply such as income (which they verify), savings/bank balances/investment (also verified), pulled credit history, so on and so forth. It shouldn't take more than 48 hours to get the pre-approval letter.\n\nNow, in regards to the whole 100% financing plus having closing costs paid through the loan rather than out of pocket - BEWARE!!!!!!! That means that they are upping the interest rate to pay all that stuff and chances are they are also raising it to the point that they are getting more then 1% commission out of you and you will never know it.\n\nGo someplace other than who has "pre-qualified" you and start fresh. Tell them you want to be "pre-APPROVED" for 100% financing for the highest amount you qualify for and ask them to give you the "par" interest rate which means the rate you can get where there is no "cost" and no "rebate". After you find out what the "par" rate is, THEN you can ask them what your rate will be if you have a large enough rebate to cover the closing costs. Otherwise, if you get the whole closing costs paid out of the rate thing from the beginning, you are asking to be taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, if your particular situation is more difficult than the average borrower's, then it is perfectly ethical for the lender to make up to a 1.5% commission off of you and if you also only can get a small loan on top of that a maximum 2% commission - but even that's pushing it when it comes to fairness.\n\nJust be careful who you go to because the mortgage lending business if FULL of crooks and sharks. Ask friends and family who they recommend.\n\nGood luck!	Business & Finance

If you knew the deceased well (and, for example, he loved sunsets), you might mention the sunset tonight was made especially beautiful for (name of deceased), and he had the best view from heaven. I think Robert said it best, depending on how well you knew the person. Also, "I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nPlease let me know if there's anything I can do to help." is always appropriate. Depending on how close you are to the grieving person, a gentle touch on the arm, shoulder or a gentle hug is usually welcome. Your heart will guide you.\n\nThe comment, "it will get easier with time" I think is not appropriate, not sympathetic, and will sound heartless to the grieving person. Older people seem to say that sometime; it's not out of cruely; they just don't know what to say.\n\nwanabelong.com had this to say:\n\nBut what do you say to the family? What can be said, other than, “I don’t know what to say?” and “I’ll keep you in my prayers.”  Sometimes it better to say less than more, or to just be there, with a hug and a cup of tea. Why is it we are uncomfortable with death, when it’s probably the only thing we all can guarantee will happen to us in our lives?\n\nOur awkwardness often leads to saying stupid things trying to fill the space of our discomfort with empty statements that still leave us feeling stupid.  When the person grieving does not hear, their hearts breaking with the grief, their energy taken in a journey to revisit every laugh, every argument, every memory, and the words often lost in a sea of internal thoughts.  \n\nThe most profound thing someone can do for another person when someone dies is to listen, to hold them, to just be there, to give comfort and to resist having to have something to say. \n\nYou'll help a lot of people with your question, Jason.\n\nPeace.

question_title: All things change or evolve over time, should religion? [SEP] question_content: Why or why not?\n\nor...\n\nName something that hasn't changed since the beginning of time and/or before.\n\nI’m truly curious. [SEP] best_answer: Yes, it should, and it does.\n\nThe evolution of religion is a slow process which seems to change old religions out for new ones every 2000 years or so.  It seems to follow along with the astrological age for the time.\nIn the oldest written histories, from the Age of Taurus, we see gods who are very material oriented, very grounded in the Earth; an example would be the Egyptian gods from the times of the early Pharoes.  \nLater when the Age of Aries came around, we saw the old gods replaced by new gods, mostly war gods.  Great Empires rose up and conquored the world: Greece, and then Rome.\nStill later came the Age of Pisces, the one we're still in.  Pisces has seen the old gods replaced by the One God.  The dominant religions of the world today (Christianity & Islam) embody the archetype of Pisces in that it encourages its followers to blind obidence to church authority (or to the sheikh, for Muslims).  \nNow that the Age of Pisces is coming to a close, soon to be replaced with the Age of Aquarius, I expect to see a new religion come about and replace Christianity and Islam.  Based on what I know, I expect this new church to embody humanitarian ideals and place more value on individual expression than Christianity and Islam have; it will probably also be one worldwide church, or, perhaps, a worldwide federation of churches.

question_title: Why is it that we stopped using the gas chamber on people because it was deemed "cruel and unusual" punishment [SEP] question_content: but it's still ok to use in animal shelter. It's bad enough that we have to kill all these animals (most from irresponsible owners) but do they have to die such a horrible death? And can you imagine what that must do to shelter worker who have to put them in and listen to them die? It can't be good emotionally or psychologically? [SEP] best_answer: I'm no vet, nor do I know anything about the gas chambers used for animals. Its possible they might use a different gas for animals than they do for humans. However, when I took my budgie (who had a large tumour, and no quality of life) to the vet to be put down, they used gas to put him to sleep and then gave him a lethal injection.	Society & Culture

Like, do the women that have big and/or nice ones actually have implants? [SEP] best_answer: jimlive247 said:\n\n"Fake ones are usually round on the top and bottom, while real ones are not round on the top"\n\nThis is essentially not correct, because of a technicality-there are two types of implants- round and anatomical, or "teardrop shaped".\n\nWomen who want fullness at the top will opt for the round implants, and women who want real looking implants will opt for the teardrop shaped ones- teardrop shaped implants look just like real boobs- rounder and fuller on the bottom, with a concave top.\n\nAnother way to tell if boobs are fake is that when they jiggle, they will "slosh" at the top.\n\nI personally think only about 2-3% of boobs are implants for several reasons-\n\n1) it's expensive (around $8,000- $12,000 here in the States)\n2) Many people are afraid of surgery, including women.\n3) Time restraints.\n4) Opportunity restraints (no good surgeon in the area)\n\nJust my take.

question_title: What is the wicca religon? [SEP] question_content: I have always wondered. [SEP] best_answer: Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries, though most commonly in English-speaking cultures. Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act, by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner. He claimed that the religion, of which he was an initiate, was a modern survival of an old witch cult, which had existed in secret for hundreds of years, originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe. Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion. The veracity of Gardner's claims is now much debated, and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s. Since its founding, various related Wiccan traditions have evolved, or been adapted from, the form established by Gardner, which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca. These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs, rituals, and practices. Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated, however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary. Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca. you can find more information also in the address that i give you	Society & Culture

[SEP] best_answer: Personally I haven't felt that way, but then again I've lived a pretty sheltered life.  I don't bring it up with people I'll only associate with for a few minutes because they'll have just enough time to look at me incredulously, make some sort of snarky comment and then walk away thinking of me as an idiot before I get the chance to say "and here's why" (because, of course, no one can ever just ACCEPT atheism... they always need justification UNLIKE people who believe in some way).  I don't discuss religion with many passing acquaintances so it's also not a big issue.\n\nAll of my friends and coworkers know I'm an atheist.  My family knows, my husband knows, and my son will know when he's old enough.  No one bothers me about it.\n\nThe only place I catch any flack about it is on the internet.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You mean like recent immigrants?  Well, if you mean like straight-off-the-boat immigrants that can't yet speak english, then that's probably because the kind of guys who chase them are hoping to cut down on pillow talk, or some stupid "macho" reasoning like that.  But it you mean, like, immigrants that have been here for a while...i'm not sure, it might be because the media usually portrays foreign men as the ultra-suave "love 'em and leave 'em" type.

question_title: Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much? Seems like a double standard.? [SEP] question_content: Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a "chocolate" city. [SEP] best_answer: From my perspective, it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term "offensive."  It has everything to do with wanting POWER.\n\nOne form or POWER is the "double standard," in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group cannot.  \n\nThere have been double standards since the dawn of time, and to this day, you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women.  \n\nA newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness, in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.\n\nWhen one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same, the first group "feels" a sense of control or power.  I say "feels" because any such quest for power, based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power.  it really changes nothing (at least in the short term).  About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target.  If you're motivated by guilt, it has worked.  \n\nIn the scheme of things, it's minor.  You can choose to fight it if you want, but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society, who has accepted, for whatever reason, the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced, not legally, but socially, via scorn, derision and ostracization.  That may mean losing friends, losing your job, or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers (or even your entire account).\n\nSo that's the way I see it.  And If the people who are trying to control the speech, be they black or female, or whatever, really look at it objectively, they can't help but admit that there's a grasp for a modicum of power involved.

question_title: what is the POINT of circomsition? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Directly Quoted:\nCircumcision substantially reduces an infant´s chances of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) during the first year of his life. Although the rate of urinary tract infections for infants is not very high (around xxx %), UTI´s are becoming increasingly difficult to treat (see here for a discussion). \nCancer of the penis - that effects xxx men in a thousand - is essentially eliminated in circumcised males. \nResearch shows that males who are circumcised have a lower risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, partners of circumcised males are less likely to contract vaginal infections (e.g. yeast infections). \nCircumcision eliminates foreskin infections that occur throughout childhood. \nCircumcision prevents phimosis, a narrow opening that makes it impossible to retract the foreskin at a later age. \nGenital hygiene is easier after circumcision. \nCircumcision virtually eliminates the accumulation of smegma.

The government isn't the ones that said hey im being discriminated against because of my race or nationality it is a few squeaky wheels that messed with the cog so much our government had no choice but to acknowledge there is a difference in skin tones.

Like him being bi, he said that it is all in my head.  He blames ms for him not wanting to have sex.  Are there other people out there that are too nice and feel guilty for leaving?   I am sooo frustrated. [SEP] best_answer: At the end of the day, you have to put yourself first. That can be easier said than done, but you do yourself no favours by staying in a relationship that causes you unhappiness. When you do eventually walk away, you will soon realise that it was a good decision, and you will feel better for it. In fact, you will wonder why you did not do it before. No good person wants to break a relationship, but no bad relationship is worth the suffering of a good person. It is your goodness that he is exploiting, but he probably does it unknowingly, because he is not well. I imagine that he needs help, but professional help, and that there is nothing that he will let you do for him. Maybe your departure will alert him to his defects. Let's hope so.	Society & Culture

question_title: Any one has a Guardian Angels experiences???? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Absolutely!  Three years ago, I was in a terrible auto accident.  As I was spinning out of control for the third time, I heard my Grandmother's voice tell me to let go of the wheel and just ride it out.  My Grandmother died when I was 14-I'm now 42.  I took out 15 feet of guardrail and impaled the metal from it into the back of the drivers seat. The next day the State Trooper and tow truck driver both called me at home to tell me that they had gone to look at my rig during the daylight.  They both  told me that I must have a Guardian Angel, because there was NO WAY I should have walked away from that crash without a scratch.  I had a small bruise on my shoulder and hip from the seat belt.  Thank you, Grandma!	Society & Culture
question_title: Why do atheists always try to convert humble followers of God? [SEP] question_content: Does it bring them joy to take away another persons hope and joy? Most atheist ideas are "We are all ignorant so you are too" when it really comes down to it. God and our logic don't mix so therefore since we don't understand God doesn't exist, or something like that tell me your thoughts. [SEP] best_answer: For the same reason that so many Christians try to convert not only atheists, but followers of other faiths. \n\nIf one is so convinced that one is correct, there will be that tendency to spread one's beliefs.\n\nAlso, I'd question your use of the term "always".

question_title: What is your funniest holiday memory? [SEP] question_content: It can be Christmas, thanksgiving, whatever holiday you celebrate  just let it be funny [SEP] best_answer: We were having Thanksgiving Dinner a few years ago and we had the whole gang of about 20 people around.  My husband's Dad who was about 95 at the time and who had had recent chemotherapy for cancer all of a sudden got ill at the table and vomited into his napkin.  I quickly grabbed his napkin took it to the kitchen sink, shook it out and rinsed it out really good.  I then turned on the garbage disposal and all of a sudden there was this horrendous racket in the garbage disposal.  I turned it off and reached down into it and pulled out a very mangled set of false teeth. I screeched , oh my and everyone crowded around me and we all started to giggle, even though it really was not entirely funny.  We gave grandpa back his false teeth and he put them back in but they were totally missing teeth.  We all tried not to laugh but it really was a bit humorous. We will all never forget that moment.  Dad has passed on now about 7 years ago but that moment will live on and be passed on to future generations.	Society & Culture

question_title: So, it's good thing Jesus didn't walk funny. If he had, he wouldn't be good enough for God - according to the [SEP] question_content: Bible:\n\n Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron that in all future generations, his descendants who have physical defects will not qualify to offer food to their God.  No one who has a defect may come near to me, whether he is blind or lame, stunted or deformed, or has a broken foot or hand, or has a humped back or is a dwarf, or has a defective eye, or has oozing sores or scabs on his skin, or has damaged testicles.  Even though he is a descendant of Aaron, his physical defects disqualify him from presenting offerings to the LORD by fire.  Since he has a blemish, he may not offer food to his God.  However, he may eat from the food offered to God, including the holy offerings and the most holy offerings.  Yet because of his physical defect, he must never go behind the inner curtain or come near the altar, for this would desecrate my holy places.  I am the LORD who makes them holy."

question_title: where can i get a spell/potion to get rid of obsession?? [SEP] question_content: my brother is hardly God damn obsessed in a certain sport here in our place and he never stop watchin a t v show w/c airs his favorite sport and he is going nuts! [SEP] best_answer: I think the "spell" you are looking for is called "reverse psychology".  The more you let go of your reaction to his obsession, the less it will be one.  Some ideas:\n\n(0) Ask yourself why is this conflict happening?\nWhy are you sharing a place? Is this a sign that you need to get separate places? Who pays the rent? If you pay more, you make the rules. If he doesn't like it, he can leave.  If you'd rather leave, why not? Could be advantages to having your own place.\n\n(1) Does he normally go through an obsession, burn out, and go on to another?  If this is his pattern, let him OD on it and get over it faster.  \n\n(2) Anytime he sits down to watch, invite people over to "enjoy" it with him, who he doesn't want to share it with.  He will go somewhere instead.  \n\n(3) Is the enthusiasm a true interest? If so, does he have any other friends to share it with? Encourage him to take turns enjoying at friends' houses, at least 50-50, if not rotating the days of the week. That will reduce your turn to host it in your place.\n\nOverall, sounds like he needs more of a social life. If he has nothing else to do, he is projecting all his emotional needs on this one joy he has discovered.  Either let him have his joy, or ask friends of his to help him share it in other ways or other places.\n\nAs for you, what do you want and where would you rather be? if you can occupy your mind with more engaging things than his sports obsession, you won't notice or care as much where his mind is. What are your goals? What creative projects would you like to pursue? Think of your interests, and don't worry about his.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: Hi, \nI have cable internet from Comcast, they installed a wireless router during my installation but the router is terrible. I want to upgrade my router by buying the best router on the market. However, all the routers on the market don't have a cable outlet on the back like the one I have, although almost all wireless routers out there claim to work with both cable and dsl. So my question is how do I get these routers to work with cable without having a cable outlet on the back? Is there an adapter? [SEP] best_answer: I have three PC's networked with a wireless router at home. (Netgear 54Mbps Wireless ADSL Firewall Router). This router is a combination of five products - ADSL 2 +modem+router+firewall+802.11g access point and a four port Ethernet switch.\n\nTwo of the comps are wireless connected, while one is wired. The wireless connected PC's have a wireless antenna each that receives the signals.\n\nHas the installation and configuration been done correctly?\nWhy not ask your new router vendor to look into the problem?\n\nAs far as the cable outlets are concerned, the jack has to crimped on to the wire and then connected, else use an adaptor. Repeat for this too Why not ask your new router vendor to look into the problem?\n\n(My arrangement cost me about Rs.6000/- in India, that's about US$130 to 150/- and included free installation by the vendor, including a wire of 5 meter (15 feet) Length and matching jacks at each end - that's about 9 months ago.)\nst\n\nAll da best!

Spoofing is where someone uses your email address as the address on an email they sent to others. Difficult to defend against.\n\nAnother possiblity is that you have a computer virus that has taken over your email address book, but then the emails would come from people that were in your address book. You should use an antivirus software program at all times. Just in case you might want to do a virus scan of your computer.	Computers & Internet

[SEP] best_answer: Start your pc in safe mode, generally as soon as you turn on the pc you hit the key combination F8 and choose safe mode. Don't be scared, it's supposed to look this weird. Safe mode runs the bare minimum, which is why you want to remove problem programs in it, they can't hide in safe mode like they can during normal start up. Then run your virus software. This should remove it. If not completely then you need to go to the trendmicro or symantec web site for further instructions. & try hitting it with the programs I listed below.\n\nFor future reference:\n\nAlways make sure your Window’s is completely updated, along with Office and Internet Explorer (if you insist on using it – version 6 is the worst so far for known issues).\n\nUse a firewall, zone alarm is free & pretty user friendly. & get the following products.\n\nGet Spybot Search & Destroy by Patrick Kolla Great free program for finding spyware. Don't be cheap, give the guy a donation.\n\nAd aware by lavasoft is free for personal use.\n\nwww.ewido.net - free after 30 days, limitation is that you have to manually update.\n\nhttp://www.superantispyware.com is free.\n\n& dump Internet Explorer. It's got more holes than swiss cheese. Get firefox, it has some really great add on extensions that block scripts, pop-up's & more ... & it's free. Depending on how you access the internet (some programs like Yahoo dsl, & Netzero try to force you to use Internet Explorer) just click on your Firefox icon to surf the web not Internet Explorer.\n\nYou can stop most programs from loading by using "msconfig". It's not on XP so you have to download it from a site such as perfectdrivers. Most programs beyond firewalls and virus protection do not need to run at start up. It's too bad that "Blackvipers" site is still down. He had an incredible list of how to stop unwanted and unneeded services in 2k & XP from running & slowing pc down. It is however still being posted on sites, so google his name.\n\nHijack this is a great program to see what programs are doing on your pc. Generally, you don’t need most of those programs. Hijack this has a lot of information about what is safe to disable & what is not safe. In general, you don’t need the vast majority beyond programs that have to run at start up, your web browser page of choice, virus protection & firewall hooks.\n\nHope I helped. & don't forget --> Just because you have protection doesn't mean it will work if you don't keep it updated & run it once a week. Just think of all the time you'll save not trying to repair a virus infection! It’s a lot of information but once you run through it & play with it it’s pretty simple.\n\nhttp://www.michaelhorowitz.com/removespyware.html	Computers & Internet

It's new, based on research, doesn't exist, improves massively the yubnub technology, and most importantly is damn useful and can make you a millionaire. it also uses concepts you have probably learned on your networks module.\n\nIt's a command shell for the web. \nIt's missing badly. Few people tried but failed.\nYou'd have to Implement pipes and filters, matchers and transformers. Make it multithreaded, fast and scalable. Make it extendable by Internet users. \n\nLook at yubnub and the web/os project to get ideas. \nLook also at a crawler/spider project called sphinx.\n\nIf you make it I'd be happy to use it and let all my friends know it finally exists. Probably a big company would buy it from you for X mil $. If you choose it you have a lot of work in front of you.	Computers & Internet

question_title: What is the technical difference between a vlog and a vodcast? [SEP] question_content: I know that a "vlog" is a video-based blog and a vodcast is a video-based podcast.  But when it comes down to it, aren't they the exact same content? [SEP] best_answer: A vlog is a weblog which uses video as its primary presentation format. It is primarily a medium for distributing video content. Vlog posts are usually accompanied by text, image, and additional meta data to provide a context or overview for the video. Vlogs or videoblogs are created by vloggers or videobloggers, while the act itself is referred to as vlogging or videoblogging. \n\nVODcast is an emerging term derived from the audio "podcast" and video.\n\nThey are essentially the same thing; although, vodcasts are distributed just like podcasts distributed.

question_title: C Programming? [SEP] question_content: I m having trouble to find even, odd, and prime numbers with this question...\n\nIn this program you must use nested loops to print out the following details for each number from\n3 to 100:\n\n• Is it even or odd?\n• Is it prime?\n\nA number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and 1. So 3 is a prime, because it is only\ndivisible by 3 and 1. But 4 is not a prime, because it is divisible by 2. [SEP] best_answer: Well, I can tell you - you don't have enough in your program to answer the question.  I won't do your homework for you - but this is what you need.\n1) Remember that when divide two integers you ALWAYS get an integer.  FOr example 5/2 is 2!  \n2) So, use this fact to test for even.  In other words take the number and divide by 2.  Now take the answer and multiply by 2.  If that result is the original number you have an even.\n\nExample:\n7/2 = 3.  3*2 = 6, 6 is not 7 so odd.\n12/2 = 6  6*2 =12.  12 is original number so even.\nFor primes all you really need to go up to is the square root of the number.  If you have not found a factor by then you won't!\nExample...\n49....1, 7, 49  7 is the square root of 49.  You cannot think of a number who has BOTH factors larger than the square root of that number.  One of them HAS to be smaller than the square root.\nExample:\n100.  Square root is 10.  You cannot think of two numbers larger than 10 (call them a, b).  Such that a*b = 100.  They both must be 10 or ONE of them has to be smaller than 10!\n\nSo, now hopefully you can do your homework!\n\nGet busy! :D	Computers & Internet

Sound isn't a problem for me, but my family might get disturbed by it. [SEP] best_answer: I have a MacBook Pro 2.0GHz/256 VRAM with 2 GB RAM, 100 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive, and a Superdrive.  Yeah, it gets hot, but from my experience, it depends on my surroundings.  At home, it's gets warm and stays warm just a few minutes after I wake it up, but at school, i can keep it going and it stays pretty cool.  I've also used it outside in shade with a good breeze.  It stayed pretty cool then.  Pillows block the airflow to the bottom and also insulate the heat...not a good idea.  I'm currently using a piece of wood cut close to the size of the machine, but my dad has a plastic laptop holder thing that he got from the Sharper Image store. The wood seems to hold the heat, but the plastic seemed to keep everything cool.	Computers & Internet

question_title: which desktop enviromrt should i use gnome or kde or xfce? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are confused about choosing which is better then don't get confused it depends totally on your needs...\n\nYour need for speed:\n\nOne of the big differences between the GUI is the relative workload they put on your system. The more a GUI has goodies, features and eye candies, the more it will need power to run properly and the slower it will be.\nKDE and Gnome are two of the most developed, and heavy, GUI available for Linux. Thus, if speed is of prime importance for you (for example, you want the maximum of power to run a task or you have a slow PC), you may be better to use a lightweight GUI, like IceWM, Fluxbox or Afterstep. In other word, the lighter your GUI is, the faster your overall system will be...\n\nWhich applications are you using?\n\nThe fact is that some applications just run better in one GUI than others.\nKDE and Gnome are based on a different set of programming libraries and tools (named GTK for Gnome and Qt for KDE). Thus, it's easy to understand that applications designed and based on the same GTK libraries than Gnome will work better under Gnome than under KDE. And the reverse will be true for applications based on  Qt.\nSo, it may be better to use the GUI that works best with your applications. If don't know the libraries used by your applications, just try them with different GUI and see if it makes any significant difference. For some applications it will, for others it won't. Thus, your favourite applications may help you determine which GUI you should use.\n\nConviviality and ease of use:\nThis point is more a personal choice, some peoples may find that KDE is convivial and easy to use, but others will be overwhelm with the hundreds of features and options... The choice is up to you, each GUI is, more or less, easy to use, you just have to make the best choice for you...\nHowever, if you're familiar with Windows, you may feel more at ease with Gnome or KDE, which are similar, than with a less classic GUI (like Enlightenment for example).\n\nThe default GUI of your distribution:\nAll distribution give preferential support and integration to one or several GUI. If you have Mandrake, both KDE and Gnome are equally supported. But Red Hat never hides their preference for Gnome, and SuSe for KDE...\nAll other things being equal, it may be a good idea to use your distribution's favourite GUI. It will be less hassle since it's the default installation and configuration. Integration and the "polish" will also be better, default settings being usually just fine. It's also easier to get support, since most peoples using this distribution will use the default GUI.\n\nYour need for eye candies:\nAll the GUI have a different look, some are gorgeous with lot of effects, font anti-aliasing, nice icons, and all kind of goodies, others look pale and simple in comparison. The choice between these two extremes is only a matter of personal preferences. Some will prefer a GUI with lot of eye candies, others just want a clean desktop on a simple background. None is better than the other, it's up to you to make your choice...\n\nFinal words:\n\nWith these points in mind, you should now be more able to choose a GUI. However, remember that choosing a GUI doesn't mean that you have to stick with it for the rest of your life! Nothing prevents you to install many GUI on your system. Then you choose the one you want when you log in. You may choose the GUI that's the most appropriate for the task...	Computers & Internet

question_title: who invented the Internet? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Creation of the Internet\nMain article: History of the Internet \nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik spurred the U.S. to create the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead. DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the "eve" network of today's Internet. In December of 1970, Charles A. Petrik contacted the U.S. Navy and suggested that a special communications network, that the Department of Defense had built for use in the possiblitity of a nuclear attack, could also be used during peace time. Petrik convinced the military to connect the computers of the U.S. National Laboratories for scientific research purposes, and to allow these labs to get data to other labs faster, and safer.\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by 1 January 1983 , when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. (This date is held by some to be technically that of the birth of the Internet.) It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nThe network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN, which straddles the border between France and Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN (which was set up by international treaty and not bound by the laws of either France or Switzerland). In 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign released the Mosaic web browser version 1.0, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word "Internet" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.

question_title: How do you connect an F type plug to the coaxial cable? Is there more than one type of F plug? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you are asking how to connect an F connector to a bare end coax cable then the answer is usually with a crimper.  What type of crimper depends on what type of F connector you have.  Some use side crimps that actually pinch the connector onto the cable, some actually screw onto the cable, and the last and most often used by professional installers is the compression fitted connectors requiring, you guessed it, a compression crimper.  You should be able to pick up many of these at your local hardware store or radio shack.  I will tell you though that the compression tool itself can be quite expensive, I've seen anywhere from $50 to $100 and the actual connectors usually run about $1 to $2 each, and these can be harder to find.  Unless you are looking to run alot of cable, it might be better to find someone, like a local satellite installer, to make some cables for you.	Computers & Internet

question_title: what are some symptoms of colon cancer? [SEP] question_content: i think my husband might have colon cancer. he complains that he feels like he has go to the bathroom but doesnt need to, throws up every night, tired/weak, stomach hurts alot and little blood in toilet. could that be what it is or something else? [SEP] best_answer: 1. You're pooping more or less often.\nThe presence of a tumor in your bowel throws things off. As your body tries to adjust to its presence, demands, and byproducts, you may experience changes in your bathroom habits. For example, let's say a tumor is slowly growing in your colon, inhibiting the flow of solid waste. You may or may not notice that you're defecating less often.\n\nBut if the tumor gets large enough, it may become very difficult for your poop to get by it and you'll end up constipated. Sound like a crap shoot? (No pun intended.) The tumor may obstruct your bowel. You may notice a difference. You may get constipated.\n\nThat's why, in general, it's best to get regular screenings rather than rely on symptoms to alert you to the presence of the cancer.\n\n\n2. Your stool is thinner than usual.\nImagine a three-lane tunnel full of cars, all driving through with a nice, steady flow. Now imagine that two big rigs decide to block the left lanes in tandem... then they slow to a stop. Both of them. Blocking both left lanes. What do the cars do? They start filing to the right so they can get around the obstruction.\n\nThe same sort of thing happens in the bowel. Everything is flowing fine and dandy until a tumor starts to grow, causing an obstruction. As the obstruction gets bigger, the space around it gets smaller. So, as you might expect, tumors toward the "tunnel exit" tend to cause this effect of narrowed stool.\n\n\n3. You have stomach cramping or bloating.\n\nBloating may be the result of a bowel obstruction. Cramping may be caused by constipation or diarrhea. In more advanced stages of colorectal cancer, severe abdominal cramping may be caused by the tumor perforating (poking through) the bowel wall.\n\n\n4. There's bright red blood in or on your poop.\nTumors tend to bleed. Not a whole lot and not constantly, but they do bleed. As a result, some of that blood may be found in your stool. If the tumor is in the right colon, the blood will most likely be dried and virtually invisible by the time the poop leaves the body. However, if the tumor is in the rectum or toward the end of the left colon, it may still be fresh and therefore, bright red.\n\n\n5. You've experienced unexplained weight loss.\nMany of us wouldn't want to question unexplained weight loss. We'd just be happy to be losing weight! But, even though the prospect of losing weight without even trying may seem a blessing, it really is something to question. It's the old "if it sounds too good to be true..." idea.\n\nSee more at http://coloncancer.about.com/cs/thebasics/a/Top10CCSymptoms.htm	Health

question_title: norm-reading blood suger? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: As you can see from the answers you have about 3 levels to choose from.  This is the fun part about normal blood sugars.  It all depends...\n\nHow long have you eaten?  What have you eaten?  What type of activity have you done?  Any stress?  All of these effect your blood sugar level.  The glycemic index of food also plays a part.\n\nTake a normal day.  You could eat an apple, apple sauce, or a apple juice.  Each of these items, even with the same caloric value will change your blood sugar differently.  The apple will raise your blood sugar over about two hours with a moderate elevation, the apple sauce will raise your blood sugar over about an hour with a slightly sharper increase, and the apple juice will spike your blood suger in approximately 15 minutes.  This has to do with the glycemic index of each item.. The best way to think about this is if the food is easy to digest your body will convert it to sugar quickly.\n\nStress, such as an automobile accident, can cause your body to produce adrenaline(sp?) which in turn will cause your liver to release glycogen so your body can handle the fight or flight response.  This will cause a blood sugar spike.\n\nAll in all with no outside factors you blood sugar should be targeted to be kept in the 70 to 120 range.  After a meal your blood sugar should return to under 120 by an hour. Longer then this and you can run into problems.	Health

question_title: What causes a tumor? [SEP] question_content: I have one (non-cancerous) on my leg, what causes them. [SEP] best_answer: A cell with many mutations to specific genes (tumor-suppressor and proto-oncogenes) cannot stop dividing, and all of the cells it produces cannot either. This results in a mas of cells that take up the body's resources, do not perform their necessary functions and crowd the cells around them. If the cells stop dividing for some reason (but still do not function), the tumor is benign, rather than malignant. A benign tumor can be removed more safely than a malignant tumor.	Health

question_title: What is beta glucan? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone know what beta glucan is?\nWhat is it good for?\nDoes it really help you to loose weigth? [SEP] best_answer: Beta Glucan is primarily cultured extract of Baker's Yeast cell wall. It is used as an immunostimulant.  Beta glucans are sugar molecules (polysaccharides). They are found bound together as a sugar/protein complex.  Certain plants and microorganisms are naturally high in this polysaccharide compound.  The richest concentrated source is baker's yeast cell walls. (Because there is basically no yeast left in the products and they have low protein levels, it is considered hypoallergenic.) It is present in lesser amounts in mushroom extracts and Lentinen, Barley, Oat, etc. Sodium alginate is also an excellent source, but the high sodium content is a major drawback in the processing for supplemental use. An expensive research extract called Zymosan™ has been used for doing research for over 45 years. Much of the research has been in combining it with conventional approaches, such as chemotherapy, but it has been found to work well on its own.\n\nWhat glucans seem to do is to stimulate/irritate your white blood cells called Macrophages into action. There is actually beta glucan receptors displayed by immune cells that the lectin fits right into like a lock and key and switches on or activates the macrophage to do it's job...clean up. Increased macrophage activity triggers a whole cascade of immune events, which basically boost immune response, which improves Natural Host Resistance. It also stimulates the production of immune cells.\n\nWhen taken with meals, beta-glucan increases the viscosity of the food in the stomach and forms a gelatinous mass. This slows the passage of food from the stomach into the small intestine, thereby sustaining satiety (the feeling of fullness) and reducing hunger and cravings. The basic principles of weight loss still hold true: eat less and exercise. If you are better able to control your appetite, you will find it much easier to meet your goals of weight loss or maintenance.	Health

What they don't tell you is that the inhaled meds for asthma further damage your lungs (a catch-22) and you become worse over time. For more than 3 years I have completely stopped taking my asthma meds. How? I changed my diet to organic and wholefoods. Asthma is a typically reactive disease. Your body is reacting to an irritant. The 2 main irritants that our body is reacting to is 1) our unhealthy environment, and 2) our steady diet of artificially flavored, presevative loaded, hormone induced, antibiotically treated, chemically laced, saturated fatty foods. Check your food labels. We are making ourselves sick and sicker by what we eat. Asthma, diabetes, High blood pressure, High cholesterol and Obesity are attacking the youth by the thousands. Go organic - Drink Water (not soda) - Begin a moderate exercise and jogging program -Wean yourselve slowly from those asthma meds until you don't need them anymore. To your health.	Health

[SEP] question_content: is there a medical condition out there that will make you have periods twice a month that could decrese your fertility? also what else could this cause and also what could be causing me to have my period every other week... [SEP] best_answer: "Anovulatory uterine bleeding" or AUB is diagnosis of exclusion arrived at when other causes of abnormal bleeding have been ruled out (examples include uterine fibroids or polyps, injury or disease caused by intercourse, infection, genital warts, fluctuation in hormone levels, stopping and starting birth control pills or estrogens, low thyroid function, IUD use, anticoagulant drugs, cervical conization or cauterization procedures).  \n\nOcurring in 20% of adolescents and 40% of women over 40, AUB is typically characterized by less than 28 days between menstrual periods and/or otherwise abnormal menstrual periods, menstrual flow ranging from scanty to profuse, mood swings, hot flashes, vaginal tenderness, and Hirsuitism (excessive hair growth, often evident in women with PCOS).  Unfortunately, AUB can cause infertility, resulting from lack of ovulation.  It can also cause anemia.  Oral contraceptives or progestogen therapy are frequently used to treat AUB,  and ovulation induction may also be necessary if fertility is desired.  \n\nTreatment is successful in about 80% of cases, but some women experience such resistant, severe symptoms that they opt for surgical therapy like endometrial ablation.  \n\nYour GYN can help you diagnose whether AUB or another condition is involved.  Depending on the cause, he or she can help you choose the right treatment and get you on your way to feeling better.\n\nGood luck.	Health

Well today it was really swollen around the tooth...my gums. And my right side of my jaw hurt too. well I was touching my tongue around the gum of my mouth and it pooped the weird bubble around it. it was gross there was blood and some tan colored stuff. But it wasn't bleeding after I spit. My jaw doesn't hurt and the pain is gone. I think I may need a root canal my mom says maybe it is my wisdom teeth. I'm only 17. So what the heck is going on and why was it swollen and popped? Please help thanks [SEP] best_answer: Abcess.. Oh yeah! \nBasically, your tongue popped it and the 'uaually' yellowish color was the infection. Yes, you now need to get the doctor (dentist) and have him/her xray it and get you started on antibotics. If the tooth is able to be saved, then yes.. Root Canal Treatment, is going to be needed. Then a crown, is needed. If the tooth cant be saved, then he'll pull it. They'll need an x'ray to determine how bad the infection was and if any bone loss has occured. Thats how they'll decided if it can be saved or not. \n\nBTW... Warm salty rinses, is GOOD ADVICE! BUT.. wont stop it from coming back. It's a temp, fix.  \n\nGood Luck....	Health

question_title: Keratosis pilaris, NO CURE! seen mostly in pale obese people now i seem to have it on the backs of arms? [SEP] question_content: there must be a cure somewhere..Anyone know of studies one can participate in? [SEP] best_answer: There is a cure for every disorder. Yoy can only help yourself out with temporary cures if you do not address the the cause. Dehydration is the most probable cause of setting off this condition. 75% of Americans are 6-8 glasses of water dehydrated and their taste response is so misguided that they sense hunger when they are thirsty. The other problem that Americans have is their food has poor mineral content. \n\nDrinking 6-8 glasses of distilled water with a pinch of unrefined sea salt will rehydrate and remineralize your body. This could by itself make your skin supple and healthy. \n\n30 minutes of sunlight every day will help.\n\nEating oily fish or a fish oil supplement could help.\n\nAlmond and walnuts are great sources of good oil.\n\nSwitch from drinking toxic milk to almond milk or walnut milk.\n\nConsider externally usiing coconut oil with squeezed lemon juice for lightening. \n\nEat less processed foods and more raw foods.\n\nThe cure is out there but is it worth the changes of diet and lifestlye? Our bodies are wonderful mechanisms that want to be healed. Chicken Skin is just an indicator to change your diet and lifestyle. Later in life it might be in the form of much more dangerous symptoms. Keratosis Pilaris should be a wake up call. Will you answer it?	Health

question_title: Who was Frederick Douglass? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Frederick Douglass was born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, a slave in Talbot County, Maryland near Hillsborough, twelve miles from Easton. He was separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, when he was still an infant. She died when Douglass was about nine years old. Douglass never knew anything about the identity of his father, other than that he was a white man, although some believe that his master, Captain Aaron Anthony, was his father. When Anthony died, Douglass was given to Mrs. Lucretia Auld, wife of Captain Thomas Auld; the young man was sent to Baltimore to serve the Captain's brother, Hugh Auld. When Douglass was thirteen, Hugh Auld's wife, Sophia, broke the law by teaching Douglass to read. Douglass later referred to this in his first abolitionist speach.\n\nIn 1837, Douglass met Anna Murray, who sold a poster bed to buy sailor's papers needed for Frederick Douglass's escape. Douglass escaped Slavery on September 3, 1838 boarding a train to Maryland dressed in a sailor's uniform and carrying identification papers provided by a free black seaman.\n\nDouglass continued reading. He joined various organizations in New Bedford, including a black church. He regularly attended Abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to William Lloyd Garrison's weekly journal, the Liberator, and in 1841, he heard Garrison speak at the Bristol Anti-Slavery Society's annual meeting. Douglass was inspired by Garrison, later stating, "no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments (the hatred of slavery) as did those of William Lloyd Garrison." Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass, and mentioned him in the Liberator.\n\nSeveral days later, Douglass gave his first speech at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention in Nantucket Island. Twenty-three years old at the time, Douglass later said that his legs were shaking. He conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his life as a slave.\n\nIn 1843, Douglass participated in the American Anti-Slavery Society's Hundred Conventions project, a six month tour of meeting halls throughout the east and middle west of the United States. He participated in the Seneca Falls Convention, the birthplace of the American feminist movement, and was a signatory of its Declaration of Sentiments.\n\nDouglass later became the publisher of a series of newspapers: "The North Star", "Frederick Douglass Weekly", "Frederick Douglass' Paper", "Douglass' Monthly" and "New National Era". The motto of "The North Star" was "Right is of no sex--Truth is of no color--God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren".\n\nDouglass' work spanned the years prior to and during the Civil War. He was acquainted with the radical abolitionist Captain John Brown but did not approve of Brown's plan to start an armed slave revolt. Douglass believed that the Harpers Ferry attack on federal property would enrage the American public. Douglass would later share a stage in Harpers Ferry with Andrew Hunter, the prosecutor who successfully convicted Brown.\n\nDouglass conferred with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 on the treatment of black soldiers, and with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage. His early collaborators were the white abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. In the early 1850's, however, Douglass split with the Garrisonians over the issue of the United States Constitution.\n\nDouglass had five children; two of them, Charles and Rossetta, helped produce his newspapers.

question_title: Why was Wills cigarette production stopped? [SEP] question_content: Talking about Pakistan Tobacco Company, when they decided to stop its production why they did so? One clue that I've got so far is they did so because of copyright problem. They were having there brand copied. I know they started its production again but what particular reason was there behind it. Any help will be much appriciated!\n\nAcctually this is my assignment and I am not getting ang sutiable answer for this. [SEP] best_answer: In England there is a Wills cigarette company that has been in existence for over on hundred years. Their main brand is 'Wills' Woodbines' and the also make 'Park Drive' cigarettes. Both these cigarettes have lost popularity as they do not have filter tips and since the introduction of filters in the UK in the 1960's sales have fallen. However they are still popular brands with older smokers and they are cheaper than most others. Naturally Wills need to protect their trading name hence their assertion of copyright laws. If the Pakistan Tobacco Company had persisted they would have had great problems in selling their products overseas due to the slice of the market that Wills already have and would have been subject to legal action.

The cube root of a negative number is not a problem.  So the domain is all real numbers not equal to +11 or -10.	Education & Reference

question_title: find x   find y? [SEP] question_content: In a 30- 60 -90 triangle where the length of the hypotenuse is 20, the shorter leg is x, and the longer leg is y. find x    find y [SEP] best_answer: First of all, look at the link in my sources... It contains a picture that will help you understand what I'm trying to explain!\n\nIf the hypotenuse is 20, you know the shorter leg (x), or the leg across from the angle that measures 30°, is half of that.  You know this because of the 30°-60°-90° triangle that you will probably want to memorize for your math classes (see image).  So 20*(1/2) = 10.  x = 10.\n\nNow that you have the lengths of 2 out of 3 of the sides, you COULD simply use the pythagorean theorem to solve for y.  But if you have a calculater and your 30°-60°-90° triangle memorized, then you can do it easier and faster.  According to the image, the ratio between the shorter leg and the longer leg is 1:rt.3 (rt.3 meaning square root of 3.)  That means that all you have to do is take the length of the shorter leg, and multiply it by rt.3.  Since you know the length of the shorter leg (x) is 10, this is very easy.  10*rt.3 = 17.32.  y = 17.32\n\nIn conclusion, to answer your question, x = 10, y = 17.32.\n\nYou could also use sine and cosine formulas to solve this problem, but I personally like my way better.  If you'd like me to explain the sin and cosine way of solving this problem, hit me w/ an e-mail and I'll help if you need it!\n\nI hope I helped, and I hope my explanation wasn't too difficult to understand!

So an ideal snooze time has been designated so that a person is really ready to 'touch down' in about 9-10 minutes after he or she wakes. \n\nSnooze time in some clocks/phones is 5 mins while in others it is 10 mins. Some models allow the user to set their own snooze time.	Education & Reference
question_title: what play activites can i use for young children with autism? [SEP] question_content: such as ages 3yrs old and 6yrs old [SEP] best_answer: Autistics remain in the infancy level of play because of their difficulty with socialization (at least until they are older and able to learn the "why" behind social rules). They parallel play rather than interact with others.\n\nTherefore, any games that are individual play are good. Many autistics do enjoy social company, with careful respect for their personal space and interaction focused on their own interests.\n\nTry puzzles, interactive educational computer programs (like Reader Rabbit), art activities, etc.  Many autistics will "play" with objects that spin, swirl, etc. because it keys in to their fascination for repeating details.\n\nWith older autistics who like puzzles, we  often use them to start to teach the idea of "turn taking." Your crowd is a bit young for that, though.\n\nDon't forget that autistics absolutely must have rigid structure and routine. "Play time" should be carefully defined, organized, and at the same time every day... and you may have difficulties the first few times you do it until the kids get used to it being part of the routine.

[SEP] best_answer: I believe it is "Alec."  Sick and tired means that you are NOT literally ill, just sick (or tired) of the situation.\n\nHere is the info that you might be interested in as far as Smart Alec:\nFor many years, Smart Alec or Smart Aleck was thought to be no more than a generic character, first cousin to Clever Dick. The problem with seeking his original is the obvious one that, with so many possible candidates, only a stroke of luck might lead a researcher to the right Alec. A plausible candidate has been put forward by Professor Gerald Cohen (for the full story, see G L Cohen, Studies in Slang, Part 1, 1985). He argues that the original was Alex Hoag, a celebrated and clever thief in New York in the 1840s.\n\nHoag worked with his prostitute wife Melinda and an accomplice called French Jack to fleece unwary visitors to the city who were looking for a little fun. The key to his activities was that they did so in close association with two police officers, who shared the loot and provided protection. Most was done by what was in effect pickpocketing, with Melinda taking the victim’s pocketbook while they were otherwise engaged and surreptitiously handing it to Hoag or French Jack as they walked by. So far, so commonplace. However, his downfall came because he got into financial difficulties and tried to cheat his police protectors out of their share of the loot. One way was that Hoag lay behind a wall in a churchyard and had Melinda drop the goods over the wall to him so that the constables couldn’t see the exchange.\n\nAnother of the standard frauds, practised by many, was called the panel game. George Wilkes, the assistant editor of the Subterranean, met Hoag while Wilkes was falsely imprisoned in the infamous New York prison called The Tombs. Wilkes described the trick in a diary of 1844, The Mysteries of the Tombs: “Melinda would make her victim lay his clothes, as he took them off, upon a chair at the head of the bed near the secret panel, and then take him to her arms and closely draw the curtains of the bed. As soon as everything was right and the dupe not likely to heed outside noises, the traitress would give a cough, and the faithful Aleck would slily enter, rifle the pockets of every farthing or valuable thing, and finally disappear as mysteriously as he entered.” The victim was then persuaded to leave in a hurry through a window by Alec banging on the door, pretending to be an aggrieved husband who has suddenly returned from a trip away.\n\nHoag used this trick to avoid paying off his police protectors, so that when he was caught, the police were in no mood to aid him. He was sentenced to jail, but escaped through the help of his brother, only to be recaptured following extensive police searches (by one of those odd coincidences, having been recognised by Wilkes).\n\nProfessor Cohen suggests that Alex Hoag was given the sobriquet of smart Alec by the police for being a resourceful thief who outsmarted himself by trying to avoid paying graft. It’s impossible to be certain this is the true story, since the expression doesn’t appear in print until 1865, but it does seem extremely plausible.	Education & Reference

question_title: I'm a taurus and I really like this guy who is a scorpio, does anyone know if we would be a good match? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: the compatibility depends: like family, romantic, coworker;\n\nthis is bout love:Taurus & Scorpio \n\nWhen Taurus and Scorpio come together in a love affair, their union is nothing if not intense, whether that's in a positive or a negative way. They are opposite Signs in the Zodiac, giving them a special, complex connection. They can combine to make a whole, each partner's strengths balancing the other's weaknesses. Their sexual attraction is likely to be off the charts! Taurus and Scorpio have tons in common, but because their personalities are so powerful, they often swing between passionate love and passionate disagreement! \n\nTaurus and Scorpio both have deep desires, Taurus for possessions and Scorpio for power. They're both concerned with wealth and resources, and they're both intensely passionate about all sorts of things. Taurus is a bit more self-focused than Scorpio, who is more concerned with their lover and immediate family. Both of these Signs have a great, deep-rooted need for security in a relationship, but with slightly different focuses. While Taurus prizes honesty and forthrightness and abhors infidelity, Scorpio loves to be mysterious. A Scorpio's need for security is more about the need to be constantly reassured that their emotional connection with their loved one is strong. The good thing is, Taurus needs this reassurance too -- and is also willing to provide it for their Scorpio lover. \n\nTaurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Scorpio is ruled by Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). This combination is very intense, thanks to Pluto's influence, but it's an excellent balance of masculine and feminine energy. Scorpio and Taurus together form the basis of all love relationships -- love and passion. Venus and Mars go well together; Venus is about the beauty of romance, and Mars is about the passion of romance. Scorpio is smoldering and intense (and intensely sexual), and Taurus, a sensual and tireless lover, is attracted to this intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the devotion inherent in Venus-ruled Taurus. \n\nTaurus is an Earth Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. Scorpio tends to be very deep -- like an ocean, too much upset will cause a tidal wave! When Scorpio feels crossed by a lover, watch out for that Scorpion's tail, which can whip out and sting their lover without warning! It's a good thing that these two Signs are so strongly loyal to each other. But while Taurus is open, with everything laid bare on the surface, Scorpio is more secretive and inscrutable. They can both teach one another about their opposite views of life (direct versus complex). Another factor adding a tantalizing dimension to this union is the two Signs' mutual tendency toward jealousy. Taurus loves it when Scorpio displays their jealous -- it means Taurus is adored and appreciated! \n\nTaurus and Scorpio are both Fixed Signs. This means they're both pretty stubborn and resolute once their minds are made up. Let's hope their minds agree -- if not, they're prone to fights the likes of which neither experiences with any other Sign. Taurus seems to prevail as the dominant partner, but that's not always the case. Scorpio can ""win"" through more devious means, such as employing emotional manipulation to get what they want. These partners must learn to discuss their views and needs openly and to reach a compromise if they want their union to be lasting and happy. This largely depends on Scorpio's ability to learn to trust Taurus. The relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot overcome their opinionated, fixed stances. \n\nWhat's the best aspect of the Taurus-Scorpio relationship? Their powerful connection that can shine when obstacles to intimacy are cleared away. When Scorpio realizes that Taurus is there for the long term and won't create the misery that some Scorpios attract to their lives, this relationship can blossom.	Entertainment & Music

They generally will need a friend to help them through the bad times and then will tend to lean on the one that stuck with them through thick and thin. Leo males in my family are this way as well. When they've been scorned, they may go from one girlfriend to another until they find the right one and settle down. This just keeps them from being hurt again.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Quick Draw McMgraw was  a what, with a sidekick named who, and an alter ego named what? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Quick Draw was the bumbling horse sheriff of a lawless Western town. He was "the high-falutin'est, fastest shootin'est cowboy you ever saw," and he spoofed every Western cliché television has ever offered. Quick Draw was assisted in keeping the town free of wrongdoers by his friend and deputy Baba-Looey, a Spanish-accented burro who sounded a bit like Desi Arnaz's Ricky Ricardo, on "I Love Lucy." In episodes that ranged from amusing to absurd. Several cartoons featured Quick Draw, in a parody of Zorro, as a swashbuckling masked avenger called El-Kabong, who used a guitar in place of a sword. Other Quick Draw cartoons featured Snuffles, a treat loving canine who would help Quick Draw and Baba-Looey only after being awarded a dog biscuit. When given the biscuit, Snuffles would moan in joy, hug himself, float up into the air and slowly return to the ground in total ecstasy.	Entertainment & Music
