However, mad cow disease is a real thing, BSE - Bovine (meaning cows) Spongiform Encephalitis. Encephalitis is a form of brain disease, hence the 'mad' element.

question_title: Do you think that motivation is all that is needed in order to succeed in life? [SEP] question_content: If I want to be, let's say, an actor, or a writer, do you think that you just need motivation and then the rest will fall into place? Or is money and talent just as or more important? [SEP] best_answer: Motivation and determintation are required to succeed in life.  You don't have to know everything to get ahead; You just need to have the motivation to find the answers and the ability to LEARN. Some people have the drive to succeed and others just don't.\n\n5 years ago I got out of high school and was waiting tables.  I now own my car, my house, my own business, and earn a great living.  I didn't accomplish this by "knowing the right people" or being absurdly talented in one area.  I accomplished everything by the motivation that I wanted to be financially secure and successful.\n\nFaith in God didn't hurt either. ;)	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] question_content: A distraught young woman decides to throw herself into the ocean. \n\nDown at the docks, a handsome young sailor notices her tears, takes pity on her, and says, "Hey, you’ve got a lot to live for. All you need is a new start. I’m off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can stow you away on my ship. I’ll take good care of you and bring you food every day." Moving closer, he slips his arm around her shoulders and adds, "I’ll keep you happy, and you’ll keep me happy." She agrees, and the sailor brings her aboard that night and hides her in a lifeboat. Every night he brings her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit and they make passionate love until dawn. Three weeks later, during a routine search, she is discovered by the ship’s captain. \n\n"What are you doing here?" the captain asks. \n\n"I have an arrangement with one of the sailors," she explains. "He’s taking me to Europe, and he’s scr$wing me."\n\n"He sure is, lady," says the captain. "This is the Staten Island ferry."

question_title: is paula abdul a drunk? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: She's had a (eating?)disorder in the past that she really struggled with. It left behind some emotional scars, as you could expect.\n\nAs to whether or not Paula drinks before/during "Americal Idol" is a question that the producers don't want to answer. After all, by now, Paula's oddball character is as much a part of the show as Simon's blunt answers. I don't think the producers would dare answer "yes" to that question, because it would de-mystify this perpetual myth that helps the Idol buzz machine.\n\nIn my experaince, I've known some people who would be that loopy and emotional without the aid of alcohol or drugs. While I wouldn't put it past the judges to be sipping on some alcohol during the show, I don't think that it's too big of a concern.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: LOST Fans!!!....? [SEP] question_content: Wasnt last night's episode great?!  R.I.P. Eko.  But there are many intriguiging things here.  Why didnt the smoke monster seem scared of Eko this time?  Last time he stared it down and it went away.  What changed?  I also think that Juliet has something up her sleeve for her and Jack to rescue Kate and Sawyer and then get the heck out of Dodge.  And in the next episode, Kate finally chooses Jack or Sawyer.  I'd have to say that Sawyer's ahead of Jack right now, but I hope that changes.  I love Sawyer's character, but I sure hope Kate chooses Jack.  What say you? [SEP] best_answer: Great episode. I don't know about Juliet though. She may be playing Jack because he already thinks that Ben is evil, but maybe she's worse. She could be playing nice now so that Jack will get Ben out of the way during surgery, but then turn on him after he does her dirty work (but no matter how much Jack despises Ben, I don't think that he would deliberately kill him/let him die).\n\nAs for Kate, I think that Sawyer is a better match for her than Jack is, but you never know. \n\nAs for the black smoke monster, I thought that it was intriguing how Locke said he saw it too, but then added wasn't it "beautiful, white light(s)" or something like that. So....maybe if you're pure and have led a righteous life you see a "bright white light" and if you were a killer/thug (even if you're trying to be righteous now) you see the "smoke monster". Remember, Eko told his brother (or the apparition of his brother) that he wasn't sorry for what he did (killing those people and the man he killed to protect his brother when they were kids) so he did not repent...just something to think about.

question_title: are taurus males and female sagittarius capatible? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A big flaw of astrology is that astrology seems to be biased against itself. It does not consider age differences, education, race, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or economic stature important. Nor family upbringing. Don't social issues like single parenting or divorce matter?\nBut basing compatibility just because of birthday, time and location of birth is a bigotry as well. Nobody has control when or where they are born.\nIf you can apply this to relationship compatibility between two unrelated people, can you be bias toward your family as well?	Entertainment & Music

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A Marketing Specialist usually does a slightly different job than a Marketing Analyst, or someone in the field of marketing analysis.  \n\nA marketing specialist position could lead to a marketing analysis position.\n\nA marketing specialist is given specific duties, or client care responsibilities, while a marketing analyst oversees, researches, surveys, and reports the results of the company's marketing effort.  The reports from marketing analysis are used to direct the company's marketing efforts in a certain direction, and improve the company's overall marketing effort.\n\nThe term marketing specialist is used because the employee specializes in a specific marketing campaigns or specific duties within a campaign.  Marketing Analysis or a marketing analyst, may have less direct client contact, but more project management, oversee, and reporting duties.  \n\nIt's hard to tell why the company wants to change your job title, it might just be a change in company policy.  The same change could be happening for more employees as well.  It's never a bad idea to talk things over with a supervisor to see what their view might be. Hopefully, you'll get a raise as well as the change in title.	Business & Finance

question_title: Have you ever bin to paris and if so what did you think of it.? [SEP] question_content: if not explane why. [SEP] best_answer: I just got back from Paris and Versailles a couple days ago. I have to say that I wish I could spend more time there. It was wonderful. The only problem, for tourists, are the peddlers on the streets trying to get you to buy really cheap stuff. Outside The Louvre, there are guys who make a bracelet on your finger and distract you while others pickpocket you.\n\nBut like I said, other then that there are a lot of cool things to see. The foods not so bad, either. The sucre crepe and ice cream I had was a great dessert, not to mention other things. I'd recommend it.	Business & Finance

question_title: i want to apply for a job in australia. what will i do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: #1: Get the work visa! (chances of getting a job without first having the visa are pretty low, so....). Check the Auzzie employment link below which is their official website for forms and brochures for those wanting to apply for a job visa or to migrate. They have different work visas available - I was applying for the skilled visa. You can also qualify for more points (its a scoring system to qualify) if you apply for jobs within certain smaller regions (i.e. Adelaide). They'll list those towns on this website and you may also want to check out the specific municipal websites of those towns as well (they might sponsor if I'm right). Although, I'd go that route if you're low on the point scale. The funny part, is that if you speak english fluently, you already receive a whack of points.\n\n#2: I found that www.seek.com.au was the best job site for Australia (You can have it so certain keyworded jobs are automatically sent to your email)\n\nBest of luck! A little reading is in order for the forms, but that should give  a good starting point. Long live the Auzzies!	Business & Finance

question_title: Trying to get started on paintings for an exhibition. Need motivation and other help, please!? [SEP] question_content: I gave up a career selling art to develop, make and sell an odd kind of moving painting. First experiments worked nicely, sold a few on card. Now making more solid works on canvas. Went back to school to learn AutoCAD to enable me to draw more complex designs. This learning widened my skills, but also seemed to freeze me up.\n\nCan't get started. Please rescue me from the hell of self-loathing and daytime TV. [SEP] best_answer: Hello, fellow painter--\n\nIf you are trying to do a body of work, you can try doing a theme.  Sometimes a theme can be based only on something as simple as a unifying color or unifying size of canvas/paper/frame.\n\nThemes don't have to be evident to anyone else, you can use it in your own head without ever disclosing it to anyone or using it as the title of the show, but you could if you wanted to.  Think Monet's haystack or lily pond series.  Van Gogh and those sunflowers.  Cindy Sherman always using herself as her own model.  Unity will also develop in your work as you go along with what's referred to as "voice".  You don't need to try and develop that style or voice, it is intrinsic to who you are as an artist.  For a painter it might take years for you to see that style in your own work, don't strive to create an artificial style unless you are a commercial artist.\n\nI think your background selling art might be a block for you.  Selling/packaging art for a market is a lot different than creating it.  To really create, really let go, you can't be at all concerned with the bottom line of sales.  Often what you like the best is the last to sell while the one you think is crap is the first one out the door.\n\nI deal with the marketing of my work after creating the work.  so, several months in the studio, when I have a body of work that is done, then I focus on great slides, documenting the series and then finding a venue to show it.  I don't create work to sell it but it does sell...you just can't let that desire to sell your work creep into the work because then you'll make crap.\n\nAnyway, I'll keep an eye out for your posts and try and help when I can!  Good luck on your show!	Business & Finance

Do you believe this is our higher selves or Spirit communicating? [SEP] best_answer: A kinder made me laugh so hard, my tummy hurts! \n\nOn a more serious note, I have felt very intensely in tune with nature before. On a seperate incident have felt at one with the universe...I guess you could say I saw a vision of the universe. Sort of an epiphany after thinking a lot on how we are all connected and the oneness of life.\n\nEdit: I just saw that a kinder is snoopy!

question_title: Where should I look for employment? [SEP] question_content: I have a bachelor of general studies degree with a minor in economics, and concentrations in education and communications.  I spent 6 years working in a classroom with "special needs" children, and have spent the last few years in banking and mortgage lending.  Currently I'm a "Home Loan Advisor" for a nationwide lender.  However, I hate writing loans.  I would really love to find a job where I can use my knowledge and talents to help people.  I was married about a year and a half ago, and have a 9 month old son, so I have to make a decent living.  Does anyone have any ideas?  \nThe other major problem is that I live in the suburbs north of Detroit Michigan...the job market around here is VERY tough...mostly reliant on the auto industry.  \nI would like to get into working for an organization that is dedicated to helping people, but am open to all suggestions. [SEP] best_answer: Why not start up your own website, you work from home but could travel to those who need your skills. Start as a freelance teacher then as you become more successful you could employ more careing people like yourself. Post you service's in local shops, health centers, Local phone books etc.	Business & Finance
question_title: how can i proceed to immigrate to canada? [SEP] question_content: I AM A PHARMACIST,GRADUATED FROM CAIRO UNIVERSITY 1978,HAVING AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE IN MARKETING ESPECIALLY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETING,I SPENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS AS WORKING EXPERIENCE WITH MULTINATIONAL HEALTHCARE BLUE CHIPS ORGANISATIONS..take in consideration that i am 53 years old,married with 2 independent children .. [SEP] best_answer: The process to become licensed to practice pharmacy in Canada involves several stages. There is an organization that assesses competency for practice anywhere in Canada, the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC). Their website is http://www.pebc.ca/\nEnglishPages/General/HomePage.html. \n\nInitially a foreign-trained pharmacist would need to have their qualifications assessed. Once that assessment has been made, the next step is to write the Evaluating Exam. Once that is passed, the next step is the two-part Qualifying Exam. Part I is the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) exam and Part II is the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). \n\nA foreign-trained pharmacist may choose to start working on the PEBC requirements before making the commitment to actually move to Canada. For example, the process of having qualifications assessed can be done from overseas and a candidate could come to Canada on a Visitors Visa in order to attempt the Evaluating Exam.\n\nHaving completed the PEBC requirements allows a pharmacist to apply to any provincial licensing body (College) in Canada for a license to practice. In British Columbia, the College of Pharmacists of British Columbia (CPBC) requires completion of a language assessment, a jurisprudence exam and some internship hours. Information regarding these requirements can be found on their website www.bcpharmacists.org\n/registration\n/pdf/QC_Info_Guide_info.pdf. There may be slight variations in these requirements from province to province, but they are essentially very similar. Websites for the various provincial licensing bodies can be found at \nwww.napra.ca/docs/0/745.asp. \nComparative information from the provincial licensing bodies can also be found at \nwww.napra.org/\ndocs/0/94/109.asp.\n\nUBC has a program to help foreign-trained pharmacists learn the skills they need to practice pharmacy in Canada, the Canadian Pharmacy Practice Programme (CP3). Information can be found at \nwww.pharmacy.ubc.ca/\ncppd/programs/CP3_Program.html. \nIn order to be able to register for the program, a pharmacist must have passed the PEBC Evaluating Exam and have completed the CPBC language requirements. Working on their own to prepare for the PEBC Qualifying Exam, foreign-trained pharmacists frequently take 2 or 3 attempts to pass each part of this exam. A program such as CP3 provides the candidate with the necessary competencies for practice, and those are the competencies that PEBC is testing for.\n\nImmigration and visa information can be found at www.cic.gc.ca/english\n/immigrate/index.html. \nIf a pharmacist wished to come on a Student Visa and take the CP3 course, there is a process in place to help with obtaining the visa, but the pharmacist would first need to have passed the Evaluating Exam. If the pharmacist took the course, there is also a process to help arrange a Work Visa or Permanent Resident status once the necessary Qualifying Exams have been passed.	Business & Finance

question_title: in govt organisations the employees get sat and sun as week 's off day but private co give only one day holida [SEP] question_content: IN go vt orgn employees get sat sun as weekly off days where as in private co 's they get only one day as their off. this happens in one country and in one place. is it okay??? when govt labour rules are same for everyone. why this difference. [SEP] best_answer: The govt. employees are the fortunate lot and njoys this two days in a week off. But I do not think all govt organaisations have the two days off concept specially thise in the essential services. Having said that, there are not many jobs available in the govt. sector to offer jobs to the entire work population...so one has to take up jobs in the pvt. sector. I do not see anything wrong in 6 days working concept. Today, pvt. sector offer better pay package and work environment compared to most govt. sector. In any case, in most organisations sat. is a half day working. Instead, of complaining lets make the most out of it .	Business & Finance

I am tired of paying 1000 a month for rent just to make these people richer, but houses here are crazy exspensive! Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!! [SEP] best_answer: Heres is some advice! If you are looking to purchase a home, first get pre-qualified. If you log onto http://www.justgetaloan.net we can get a you a fast free pre-qualification with access to great service,programs and low rates. Getting pre-qualified will let you know how much you can afford. Also when dealing with a realtor the realtor will work harder for you knowing that they have a real client. Many people want to buy homes, those who have the ability are the ones realtors work for. Also it will give you buying power. I.E. Seller is selling home for 200k you have been pre-approved for a mortgage up to 190k the seller is more likely to come down on the price becuase you have been qualified for the mortgage.

question_title: Fedex online tracking shows "delivered" but I haven't received? [SEP] question_content: I ordered something from buy.com and it is delivered through Fedex. I track the package on Fedex website and find it shows "delivered" . There is also a "signature proof" showing "Signed by for F.DOOR". (should be front door, I guess, but I don't know who could sign it, the driver?) The problem is I have never received this package and I was at home at that deliver time. \nWhat should I do? It is a good online deal and I hate to lose that package even if I could get the money back. [SEP] best_answer: Phone Fedex \n 1.800.Go.FedEx\n(1.800.463.3339)\n \nSigned by F.Door is what bad drivers use when they just leave the package outside the front door.\n\nCheck around the front door just in case, I once found a package under my hedge.\n\nIf the package can not be found Fedex will be liable, as signed by F.door is not a person signing for the package.

question_title: I bought something online.... and....? [SEP] question_content: from the FAQ section of the site, there was a column that said \n"Shipping Choices" and another that said "When should I expect to get my package?"\nthe two do NOT make sense. look at this:\n What types of shipping do you offer?\nUPS Ground: $7.95\nUPS 3-Day: $14.95\nUPS 2-Day: $22.95\nUPS Next Day: $32.95\nUPS Canada: $18.95\nINTL UPS Worldwide: $39.95\nUSPS: $9.95 (For Alaska, APO, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico ONLY)\nPLEASE NOTE WE DO NOT SHIP TO POST OFFICE BOXES.\n\nWhen can I expect my order?\nClick here to estimate your package’s arrival. Weekday orders received before 1pm EST will ship the same day. Orders shipped outside the continental United States (International, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico or any APO/FPO addresses) ship within one business day. Orders received after 1pm EST, on weekends or Holidays are scheduled for the next business day. WAREHOUSE PICK-UP orders will be emailed within one business day to confirm order is ready for pick-up. \n\ni got this from the site, copy/paste [SEP] best_answer: There are two timeframes here that determine the total amount of handling/shipping time. Add #1 and #2 together to figure out when you'll get your package:\n\nTime #1: FredFlare - to - UPS in NY\nTime it takes from when you place your order to when they give it to UPS in NY. This is covered in the "When can I expect my order" section that you cut-and-pasted.\n\nTime #2: UPS in NY - to - UPS in Cali - to - You\nTime from when UPS in NY gets the package to when UPS in Cali delivers it to you. This is covered under the "Shipping Choices" section that you cut-and-pasted above("UPS Ground", "UPS 3-Day", etc.). This depends on what option you choose.\n\nExamples:\n\nSuppose you place your order BEFORE 1pm EST on Wednesday and that you choose UPS 3-day shipping.\n- Time #1 = 0 days(it goes same day because you got order in before 1pm EST and it's not the weekend)\n- Time #2 = 3 days(because you chose UPS 3-day shipping)\n- Total Time = 3 days\n\nSuppose you place your order AFTER 1pm EST on Wednesday and that you choose UPS 3-day shipping.\n- Time #1 = 1 day(it goes out next day because you got order in after 1pm EST)\n- Time #2 = 3 days(because you chose UPS 3-day shipping)\n- Total Time = 4 days\n\nSuppose you place your order AFTER 1pm EST on Friday and that you choose UPS 3-day shipping.\n- Time #1 = 3 days(it goes out on Monday because you got order in after 1pm EST and because they don't ship on weekends)\n- Time #2 = 3 days(because you chose UPS 3-day shipping)\n- Total Time = 6 days\n\nBottomline: just don't order it after 1pm EST on a Friday and you should get it in between 1 - 5 days depending on what option you choose.

question_title: can anyone help me summarize this? like in ur own words? [SEP] question_content: There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. \n\nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. [SEP] best_answer: At some point, every man will come to understand that  it's futile to try to copy other peoples' work or envy them.  He must accept himself as he really is, and understand that nothing good will ever come to him in life unless he works for it.\nTrust yourself completely, the purpose of your life and in your fate that God has arranged for you, your role in society and in the company of your friends, and believe it was all put there for a reason. Great men have always had this childlike trust in themselves and their fate.  This trust and purposefulness is at the core of their being and so genius works through them.	Education & Reference

question_title: what is the meaning of constitutional law? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Constitutional law is the study of foundational laws that govern the scope of powers and authority of various bodies in relation to the creation and execution of other laws by a government. A constitution binds a government or governments, limiting the contexts in which rules may be created, interpreted and force may be applied. Constitutions may reference various bodies, including organizations, associations, stateless peoples and nation-states.\n\nMost commonly constitutional law is the law of these foundational laws, customs, and constitution a conventions in regard to nation-states. Not all nation-states have constitutions, though all such states have a jus commune, or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules, that may be customary law, oral law and written law that apply in the various jurisdictions of such state. Of those nation-states that do have constitutions, not all are considered strictly written constitutions, as the laws that govern such issues may not be consolidated into one single constitution document or instrument. The constitutional law may be the fact of interpreting a variety of text which may also be informed by history, custom and unwritten constitutional conventions . Compare, for example, the written Constitution of the United States with British constitutional law, which arises from multiple sources including Magna Carta, the common law, and other customary sources. In some countries, the constitution is known as the Basic Law.\n\nConstitutional laws may often be considered second order rulemaking or rules about making rules of exercise power. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. Thus, for example, in the case of a unitary state, the Constitution will vest ulitimate authority in one central administration and legislature, and judiciary, though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities. Whereas when a constitution establishes a federal state, it will identify the several levels of government coexisting with exclusive or shared areas of jurisdiction over lawmaking, application and enforcement.

question_title: im a sophmore in highschool doing report on joseph mendele,I need help what did he do to children in ww 2????? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: He was responsible for the more horrible experiments on Jewish children, (he certainly used adults to).  Twins were used a lot.  Children were operated on and put back together wrong for the amusement of the sick rich also. His experiments have led to the psyhcotronic generator that can read minds or the telepathic radio used in submarines since the 60's.  Our government saved a lot of the scientists and brought them here after giving them a new identity to continue there work.     Our government, the Deutschland government, Britain, France even Japan to some extent was and is controlled by the same people who manipulated and caused world war one which set the stage for world war two and gave them millions and millions of people to experiment on.  Our government brought back  the top Deutsch scientists from the Third Reich.  They changed their faces and gave them a new identity and had them continue their experiments but hopefully not on people, it was mainly nuclear fision, but the mind breaking experiments of Mendele were continued, hopefully with volunteers. It was called operation paper clip. Those same experiments continued in the korean war where our govt. tortured our soldiers to further break into peoples minds. (I know a cia agent who was there, he's an american hero)   In the early or mid sixties the Japanese provided a breakthrough with the microfrogs which proved the persons mind being broken into sound from the source.  A persons own thoughts are reflected back loud, and other subliminals are reflected to the person too.  We can hear up to I would estimate 67 subliminals.  In China they can hear over three  hundred,  making those people more locked in,  because they have a richer language that is more melodic.             If and when we are bombed, and I beleive a bomb is due to drop on L.A. what mendele did to the Jews will cause everyone in America to hear in their heads, whether they are aware of it or not. end of the world as we know it,  we need a world government to prevent this from ever happening again, etc etc.   And if this happens we will live under a complete dictatorship, in a prison until the world dies.  You asked only about what he did to the Jews, I thought the continuing effect of some of his experiments more important than the gruesome details.	Education & Reference

question_title: what does "Dont cut off your nose to spite your face" mean? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Don't make a stupid decision that could cost you just because you aren't happy with terms\n\nThis is what the professionals say....\n\n"Don't cut off your nose to spite your face" is a warning not to act out of pique or pursue revenge in such a way as to damage yourself more than the object of your anger.  It's not a good idea, for example, to express your (entirely understandable) distaste for the sorry state of broadcast journalism today by tossing your TV set out the window.  Peter Jennings couldn't care less, and you'll miss The Simpsons until you buy another set.  \n\nThe precise origin of "Don't cut off your nose to spite your face" is slightly fuzzy, but it seems to have first appeared around 1200 as a Latin proverb cited by Peter of Blois, a French poet of the day.  The phrase then crops up a bit later in a history of France, written in the mid-17th century, attributed to a courtier who supposedly employed it to deter King Henry IV from destroying Paris to punish the occupants' low opinion of his rule.  The proverb apparently didn't really become popular in English until the 19th century.\n\nSince the advice contained in ""Don't cut off your nose to spite your face" is good, it's not surprising that similar proverbs have been popular in other languages and cultures, including the Chinese ""Do not burn down your own house even to annoy your wife's mother."

You can teach them by simply talking to them in English and making them answer you, correcting as you go. There is no need to explain why something is wrong, just tell them the right way to say things.\n\nHaving conversations with a native speaker is one of the best ways to learn. Your only problem will be finding ways to divide your time amongst your students so that everybody has a chance to talk. Get them to talk, that is the hardest thing for most people.

question_title: I don't know what to do!!!!!? [SEP] question_content: I like to go with an extanche to milken L.A., I have everything; I have good references, etc., but to go you need 8.0 or more of your promedio grades, bu I have 7.95, I have to talk to the teacher and I don't know what to say.\n\nPlaese help me!!! [SEP] best_answer: Wow.  You have everything?  Except the .05 for your grades.  Guess what, I got into college with lower than a 2.0 before.  You just need to talk to the teacher and say something like: I really want to go, but will I be able to even though I am .05 below the 8.0 grade scale?  I could boost this up if given the opportunity, but to prevent me from going because of a minor thing such as .05 which is not much compared to 1.0  which is not as close as 7.95 as it is exactly 8.0, so if you are as confused as me, would you consider a solution to this problem because I am so close to having an 8.0.  Do I have to go to summer school to improve that by .05 points in order to go?  Is there something I can do to ensure I can go?  Will I be allowed to go even if I do not meet 8.0?  And out of how many others have perfect scores and are allowed to go?  "Just because something or somebody tells you that you cannot, or you will not do this or that, then you must step up and say how come?  Why?  Then after they answer, do you easily give up?  No, you fight back with your words because you really want to go to L.A.  So, do as I have suggested, stay calm and collected and speak softly, but carry a big stick, that is your mouth, and the words that come out of your mouth shall stick to them faster if you go over it like a rational adult without arguing or complaining.  So, be brave, be courageous and when you are ready to speak, let your heart do the talking for you.  Believe it or not, I have always gotten farther with a positive attitude.  But this nation is so accustomed to complainers and whiners that they easily quit on what they really want to do.  No wonder we have psychology!  So, you really do know what to say now, don't you?  Remember the last time you got what you wanted without asking for it first?  Who hands out anything on a silver platter here?  I work hard and earn everything just like you.  So, having a physical disability didn't keep me from acheiving my goals or accomplishing my dreams.  But others who wouldn't allow me to do these did, and they got the wake up call when I spoke from my heart's content, that they were so touched they just had to give me what I wanted because God did the talking for me.  I am just a vessel He uses to get what He wants for me, believe this and you will not need to know what to say when He speaks through your mouth and out comes the words, and it makes you happy because you gained more bravery.  Or you can accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior since He died for your sins, man.  That we are brothers no matter what anyone else may say or do, and it is because God answered your question through me.  No one in their right mind can reject Him.  Hence the words: Right mind.  That means: Free from stress and disappointment in yourself, as well as others.  And I am not a preacher, yet I preach the message as it is universal understanding of getting from one point to another.  You have the help you require when you help yourself first.  Help yourself by speaking and verbalizing your concerns to the teacher, to the administration, to even the president of the United States, but who is going to listen unless you do something out of the ordinary.  Remember, you are like a stranger in a country of your own.  You speak the language differently now.  You should love yourself, so you may do what you really like, then you can use this to help others love themselves so the entire world will love one another, even their enemies and strangers they do not know.  This is the message and it has never changed.  Do you believe it?  Do you want it?  You have to want it more than going to L.A. in order to get to L.A. for those who trust in Jesus get what they need, and even what they want.  And those who do not, I tell you, are suffering needlessly.	Education & Reference

[SEP] question_content: I just really need to know if there is a date that the goverenment uses to cut off applications. [SEP] best_answer: No, you can continue to file a FAFSA until the semester/year you are applying for is finished, but your school will require it by a specific date. Remember, too, that it takes a couple of days for the school to receive and process your application, and they may request verification of dependency or income. That is random- one out of every 30 at my school, Texas Tech. So, this could slow the process. \n\nApril 1st was the recommended FAFSA due date for the Fall semester at Tech. Your school may have an earlier or later date, but it's important to get it in as early as possible because each school has an amount they give out in grants, and you don't want to find out too late that you're not getting what you need.

question_title: what are medium format camera's. where do you used them..how do they differ from the range finders? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A medium format camera takes 120mm film so the negative is larger than a normal 35mm.  The larger negative gives a clearer print and so was and still is used largely for commercial work.  Lots of wedding photographers use this format; think Hasselblad.\n\nRangefinder and Single Lens Reflex (slr) is a different matter.  The difference here is how you see, what you see when you look through the viewfinder to compose your picture.  The view finder for a rangefinder is just a clear piece of glass giving you and approximate view of what you camera's lens is seeing.  On an slr the image in the viewfinder is the same as the len's view because the light is going through the lens and then being bounced off a mirror so you can see it through the viewfinder.\n\nClear as mud?

You will retain more information througout the entire semester that way. Then, about 2.5 weeks before the exam, start skimming over the chapters again. Focus on what was covered more in class, also. \n\nIf you book has review questions at the end of each chapter, do each review question. I also have a tendency to outline every chapter. It's always better if you are able to apply what you learned instead of only spitting out some memorized stuff (likyou said, you don't want to memorize). So, it might even help if you browse the internet for more information/exercises related to the topic you are covering.	Education & Reference

question_title: can you get hiv thru this mode? [SEP] question_content: RECENTLY I VISITED A LAB TO GET MY MALARIAL TEST DONE, BUT I NOTICED THAT THE LAB TECHNICIAN  HAD FRESH BLOOD STAINS ON HIS GLOVES WHEN HE INSERTED A NEW BUTTERFLY NEEDLE INTO MY VEIN. HE HAD OPENED THE NEW NEEDLE AND UNWINDED THE PLASTIC TUBE WITH THOSE BLOOD STAINED GLOVES. ALSO THE TIP OF THE NEEDLE HAD TOUCHED THE PLASTIC TUBE BEFORE HE INSERTED THE SAME INTO MY VEIN..I AM VERY MUCH CONCERNED AND SCARED THAT IF THOSE BLOOD STAINS ON HIS GLOVES CARRIED HIV GERMS THEN CAN I ACQUIRE HIV GERMS THRU THIS MODE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW THAT WHAT SHOULD I DO? IS THERE A NEED TO GET MYSELF TESTED. WHICH TEST DO I HAVE TO GO FOR? I SINCERELY NEED HELP AND AM SCARED TO DEATH. [SEP] best_answer: Based on my knowledge on this issue, if blood is exposed out in the open (air), the virus inside can only survive for a few seconds. Therefore it won't be harmful.\n\nReading from your statement you mentioned it was a fresh stain. I will imply it as dry.\n\nIf you are still worried you can always go for a HIV testing. There's only one test to see whether you're HIV positive or not. Most government hospitals give free testing and the result is strictly private and confidential.\n\nDo inform the doctor of how this matter came to be. There is a 'window period' which means that you might/might not carry the HIV virus. This 'window period' means you have to go for regular testing because they can't detect the virus for a certain period of time. \n\nHope this helps.	Health
question_title: I'm scared of the dentist? [SEP] question_content: Hi. My name is Lucy, I'm 13 years old. I'm really afraid of the dentist, but I think I need fillings in my teeth and I'm really scared. I know if I tell my mum my tooth hurts she will make me go to the dentist but I'm really scared and I keep crying because I don't want to go, but my tooth hurts and I think I will have to go. What can I do to make myself less scared? [SEP] best_answer: I know its scary honey, but trust me - if you don't tell your mum and go to the dentist, the pain in your tooth will get really bad. I'd advise that you take a personal stereo with you and listen to some music while the dentist is doing your fillings because the noise of the drill is the scariest part in my opinion. Try not to worry too much about it, I know it's scary when you've never had fillings before and you don't know what to expect, but it's really not that bad, I promise.	Health
question_title: I am a massage therapist how should I go about getting clients? [SEP] question_content: I have tried handing out cards and putting up filers. I have a degree in Michigan and I am planning on getting certifed in the USA but so far I am haveing trouble getting people to come see me what should I do? [SEP] best_answer: Someone else on Yahoo recently asked a similar question and my response would be the same...\n\nConsider speaking on massage. As a former massage therapist, I used to offer programs on "self help" massage. In other words, I would teach a combination of bodywork movements done by the client or with the help of a partner. This includes the use of hands, stretching, and commercial or homemade massage tools. Such programs focus on the science of massage; in other words, the reasons why specific movements benefit the body or a health condition. Whereas, the art lies in the personality and passion that blend each movement together into the dance that comes from a professional massage.\n\nBesides the potential for direct income from public speaking, there are other professional benefits. Public speaking provides name recognition. It sets you above the competition. Even if the presentation is free, when an organization hires you to speak, it conveys a sense of endorsement. After all, as a speaker on massage, you must be a great massage therapist!\n\nPublic speaking puts you in front of potential massage clients. Because they come to your program for the opportunity to learn, their natural sales resistance is lowered. Compare self-help massage programs to a first aid course. You learn to treat minor ailments, but still go to the doctor for acute problems and a periodic check-up. Since nothing can replace a professional massage, the audience will automatically think of you when seeking a personal therapist.\n\nPromoting yourself as a personal consultant is a logical extension to public speaking. There were certain techniques that I did not teach in my programs because it would have been almost impossible to demonstrate in a group setting. However, I easily taught these techniques to one or two people who would pay for my time as a consultant.\n\nPublic speaking allows you to market other products and services. Let’s say you are affiliated with a spa. It should be relatively easy to weave discussion of these spa services into your massage program. But what if you are an independent practitioner? Using the spa example, find one locally who would help cover your normal speaking fees in return for mentioning their spa services and providing marketing materials during the program. This allows you to charge lower speaking fees, while getting in front of potential massage clients.\n\nThe marketing value of a presentation extends beyond the program itself. Most organizations hosting your presentation will publicize the event. Even people who do not attend might read the information or hear about you from other attendees.	Health

I hope my mom wont get cancer from booze. [SEP] best_answer: Cancer has many causes, depending on the area of the body involved. \nCigarette smoking, alcohol and family members with the diagnosis are not a very good combination and your mothers chances of developing it are increased. \nTalk to her about it and together look for more information so you'd be able to take better care of yourselves.\nAlso, it wouldn't hurt to go get that stomach pain checked, it could be an ulcer and is best not left untreated.\nHope this helps.

question_title: Dead protective liner of the intestines? [SEP] question_content: My daughter has been having great adominal pain.  She was told that the protective liner of her intestines has been twisted and is dead as well as possibily infection from it.  Is there a name for this?  What type of surgery will it entail?  What type of recovery will she have?  Is it life threating? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not sure what your daughter's diagnosis is, so you should try to find out, but one type of "twisted" intestines is called volvulus.\n\nHere is part of an article from emedicine about volvulus:\n\n"In 1992, Messineo et al determined that the most important factors influencing mortality are the presence of necrotic bowel, associated abnormalities, and younger age. Risk of mortality increases 25 times in the presence of bowel necrosis and is influenced heavily by length of viable bowel. They determined that the survival rate is maintained above 93% with 10%, 25%, and 50% of the bowel necrosed; however, the survival rate drops to 35% with the loss of 75% of the length of the small bowel. The presence of other serious abnormalities also increases the risk of mortality by a factor of 22. Given the high association of malrotation with other congenital anomalies, this risk factor heavily affects mortality figures. In addition, Messineo et al found that patients who died after surgery had a significantly lower median age (4 d versus 30 d)."\n\nThis is basically saying that the more of the bowel that dies, the worse off she is.\n\nIn the article, one treatment is a bowel resection, which is when they take the dead part out.  Her recovery would depend on how much they take out.  I would imagine 6-8 weeks or around that unless it's really severe; that is what the below articles say.\n\n\nTry to find out the exact diagnosis--googling that will give you better clues of what to expect.

But something in the air at night triggers my allergies so when I wake up, my nose is stuffed up. Are there any allergenic (don't know if I used that correctly) screens for the window to help me. Thanks for any help. [SEP] best_answer: Hi there\n\nAllergies are a pain in the butt, I have hayfever and for years the same thing happened to me, major sinus headaches and stuffed nose, sore throat every morning when I got up.  I used to take an antihistime before bed, sometimes it would be too drying and I'd have a nosebleed.  What I finally did was buy an air conditioner because of other health problems and it helped.  But you could try an air cleaner with a hepa filter that's supposed to filter out alot of pollens and dust/dirt that comes in the windows.  Pollens are higher at nighttime and early morning so if you can open your window and cool things off earlier in the day, then shut it and use a fan and air cleaner it might help.  You could get allergy shots too that would help desensitize you from the pollens.	Health

[SEP] question_content: Before surgery I was pretty fit so it sort of worries me. I now look like I'm pregnant. Is it just a temporary thing after surgery? I had surgery 3 weeks before to remove my perforated appendix. [SEP] best_answer: If you had your appendix removed Laproscopically, it is probably the co2 they used to air your belly up to visualize and remove your appendix. The air will eventually work its way out. If you had it the "old fashioned way", where they cut you open to get it out, it could be that your muscles were stretched some during the procedure. You should be able to resume your exercise routine as soon as your Dr. releases you, and get your tummy muscles toned back up.	Health

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: There are a lot of challenges to living with Manic Depression but it can work as long as there is communication and some planning.  Some of it will depend on how well the person takes their medication. Some people will take their meds only until they feel better and then stop because they feel better {they don't realize they feel good only because of the meds so then they start spiraling down hill} or they stop because they don't like the side effects of the meds.  Also the mood swings can not be rationalized some of the time which can be very frustrating, and people with this affliction tend to isolate themselves only having a few close friends. \n\n If you choose to live with someone with this disease try to keep an open mind and keep plans flexible so stress is minimal on both of you, also try to talk about how they handle bad days so you know ahead of time what you can do to help or so you don't make it worse. Good luck.	Health

question_title: When i bend knee i can feel the entire thing snap n move.?

I'm wondering is it bone chips in the knee lack of cartiliage or possibly osteroposis(sp) because i have crohns disease and Osteroposis comes with crohns. same thing happens with my right ankle oddly enough. i have no pain in it just the feeling. i havent  ran into anything or banged my knee up seriously at all. any ideas? [SEP] best_answer: Id agree with seeing a physical therapist which i am or a doctor doc would be better to see first. being your not having any pain it cant be cartiliage it could be a bone chip or  osteroposis but id believe that if your knee is snapping youd either be in pain or be heavily swollen. if you dont want to see the dr. right away id suggest doing some stretches because it may also be fluid in the knee. stretching would eliminate that problem for the most part.

question_title: Do all men cheat their wives? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Everbody is answering as if your question was: Do all men cheat on their wives,............   but what you wrote was:  Do all men cheat their wives?\n\nTo some extent, all men (and all women) cheat their spouse out of something.   Whether it is your 100% attention, love, loyalty or providing a 100% consistently fulfilling sexual partner......... there are times when each of us cheats the other somehow.\n\nAs to whether all men cheat ON their spouses.  No, I believe that some men are capable of keeping their promises and staying faithful.  Unfortunately the 'bad-apples' ruin the reputation for men.	Family & Relationships
question_title: why is he doing this? [SEP] question_content: theres this kid at my high school (we're in 10th grade) who i've known since 9th grade but never talked to. recently i sat at his table in lunch because i have 2 friends who happened to be sitting there b/c they know him. randomly, he turns around and asks me, (note, these words are the first words he's ever said to me in his life) "do you think five inches is small?" one of my friends saved me by answering fo me, but it still was rele weird... he's the popular kind of kid, he knows almost all the "popular girly-girls" so why, out of all the girls would he ask me? (i'm a shy girl) since then (happened around 2 weeks ago) he's been staring at me. and i mean CLOSELY staring. i actually dont notice it. my friends do.  a friend would say, "i think he's staring at you" and when i'd look,  he'd look away. i notice it more and more from the corner of my eye and it's starting to creep me out!\nwhat does this mean, and why is he doing this???\n*sorry that this is so long* [SEP] best_answer: Because he likes you, but being in this day in age in schools he has to keep his image up to all his cronies.  So if you are in a "lower" click than he is, he has to show off in order to talk to you.  don't do it.  it will be one of those hidden sexual relationships.  Not worth your time.

question_title: in a relationship, is sex the most imp thing or love is also there??  will a guy ever say that he loves a girl [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: in a relationship, a guy should make his feelings clear. if he doesn't say that he loves her, either he doesn't love her or he is afraid of getting emotionally attached or commitment. simple sex without love is just that. if he can't say it, she should move on to somebody who is more mature and can honestly and openly show their emotions. hope the best.

[SEP] question_content: Has anyone had any dealings with fostercare?\nany experiences?\nand what do you think is the perfect family for a fosterchilds background? [SEP] best_answer: My experience with my foster parents was truly awful and has scarred me for life.\n\nJust make sure you don't beat and rape your foster kid and keep them locked in the cellar. But I guess you're not planning on that anyway were you ?\n\nin general I'd say :\n\nIf you treat your kid as a real person, try to make them feel part of your family and that they are valued and cared for. BUT you need to respect that they know they are not part of your family and that they are not your child and could reject you if you try to be too close to them and try to totally replace their real parent, as that is not a good plan.

question_title: She loves me, but I don't love her.? [SEP] question_content: About a month and a half ago me and my gf of 2 years broke up. About two weeks after, I met this other woman, I thought she was very good company and after a month of talking we slept together not once but twice. She's going through some things so I help her out financially, and so forth. I love her company, but recently me and my ex has decided to give "us" another chance. I would love for us to rekindle our relationship, I told the girl that I have been talking to that we can't sleep together anymore, but I would love to still be her friend. She took it terrible, telling me I can't go back with my ex, and that she's in love. She is also living with her "ex"-fiance`, I don't understand how she could fall in love with me so quickly. I care about her, but I don't love her, I love the woman I have been with for the last 2 years. What do I do about this other woman? How do I tell her I don't feel the same way she feel about me? How do I tell her we can only be friends, w/o hurting her? [SEP] best_answer: Ouch!!\n\nOK to me you are doing the right thing in being honest and stopping the sleeping part of your new found friendship with this lady but I cant help feel this new friend is trying emotional black mail on you if she is living with her ex as you mentioned and who isn't to say she isn't sleeping with him why she has been with you?\nI would be more concerned about STD in this situation than her letting go.\nJust stand your ground and be firm and stick to what ever you decide.\nI think your current relationship will rekindle if you both put time and effort into it like you are.\nThey say a break is as good as a holiday.\nSadly some people can think they are in love because they are craving for any type of attention which they could be lacking in there own life or present relationship so they go and search for it else were.\nWe are all guilty of that at some point of time in our life! If we are honest.\nSo once someone nice like you seem comes along and gives them that attention and gives them the inner emotional needs like sex or comfort,then financial help and any other type of assistance whether its companionship or just a cuppa and chat and most times can be taking out of context making it hard for you in this case to break away or "get away".\nSadly some people cry wolf when they see another vulnerable person like them selves which is an easy target to latch on to.\nAs she has found with you!\nPlease just end this other connection with this other lady but sadly I cant help feel she may start giving you a hard time if not your partener of 2 years. \nAs she will feel jealouse of you going back to her and most probly wonder what is wrong with her for you to leave her after a month but honestly this her thinking and doing and not yours.\nDont fall for any emotional words as they are based on making you feel guilty..\nBe strong..And good luck.

question_title: How to relocate family to another state? [SEP] question_content: My husband and I are trying so hard to start our lives over in another state with our family.  We have 5 children ages 12,10,3,and twins ages 20mos.  We have very little money and will be looking for work and a home as well as childcare.  The reason we're moving is to have a chance to make it, because it's very hard on our family barely making it each day.  We were thinking about MN or GA.  If we have to, then we'll start out living in a family shelter until we get on our feet, but how do we go about doing this? [SEP] best_answer: Before going anyplace contact your local housing authority to get telephone numbers of public housing or Section 8 housing agencies. You need to find one that has openings.Section 8 is a good program. You can move into a house, apt, trailer and HUD will pay your rent, you only pay 30% of you adjusted income.  Most agencies also have a Family Self Sufficiency Program that would be excellent for you and your famiy.  It helps you set goals, employment and eventually gets you into homeownership. IF your housing authority where you live now has Section 8 voucher available, perhaps they would let you go portable to where you want to be.  If you have any questions about this program you can call my office 501 624-4405 ext 102 and I will help you in anyway I can.  Good Luck	Family & Relationships

question_title: ive been dumped and its been over six months, im still not over her, what should i do? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Tony Robbins says that pain either breaks us, or motivates us.  Try to find out why you were dumped, and do something to fix it.  Work on self improvement projects - look better, work out, get a good hair style, read self improvement books, etc.  Anything you can do to improve yourself.  It will make you feel better.  You will become more attractive to the opposite sex.  Don't focus on the problem.  This will not cause it to go away.  Force yourself to think positive.  Eventually you WILL be thinking positive.  Set goals.  Set a goal to go on a date with someone new in the next month.  Improve yourself everyday in some way.  Get OUT of your house and DO something.  I've been there myself, and it is tough.  You have to BREAK this pattern in radical way.	Family & Relationships

question_title: 10 reasons why most men are smarter, more responsible, and more mature than women? [SEP] question_content: 1. Many of you B*tch over small things that no one should be upset over, especially in the morning and evenings.\n2. Most women in the world still depend on men for their finacial needs. Most (not all) of you need us men to give you money to burn, which is irresponsible.\n3. Most of you women CANNOT completely get along with other females. You argue amongst yourselves and some of your so called friends. Men find ways to deal with each other as friends and enemies.\n4. We climax easier in bed. While you women complain about it, you all secretly wish you where able to climax as easy as we can, because if you could, that would mean every sexual experience would be fulfilling, similar to what it is for us men.\n5. Most women have tried to "change" a man who would beat them and/or treat them wrong instead of  going for the guy that would treat them right. Very naive and immature. Men dont do that. [SEP] best_answer: At 20 you have a lot to learn about yourself before you can put down 10 good solid reasons why men are smarter, responsible and more mature:  Here's a few that you should consider the opposite: \nIf you climax before the woman, then that means you are in for your own pleasure and the fact that  it means maybe you are a minute man or just in a hurry.\nHow many men stay around when they HELP make a baby, where's the child support, etc. (where's the maturity )\n\nSo what if you have a home, car, etc.,  those are the materialistic things some men (like yourself) think make a man.  Maybe you got up  on the wrong side of the bed, if so, go back to bed and try again.  At 20 you are still trying to find yourself.  In fact, you have to depend on someone to go to the liquor store for you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: How can I encourage my wife of 22 years to initiate love making and to learn creativity in this area? [SEP] question_content: It is strange that I feel like I have to initiate our love making sessions. That I have to teach her how. She has no desire to seek out creative lovemaking techniques. She is critical of me trying to spice things up for us. I feel trapped and bored. I have mistakenly turned to the Internet, but have since stopped and am trying to work on things here. Any other guys, Ladies out their want to weigh in on this? [SEP] best_answer: First off congratulations on 22 years, that is an incredible feat in today's society.  I can't wait till I hit that mark with my husband.\n\nThere are several courses of action you could take.  If you think  your relationship is strong enough just simply sit her down and tell her how important it is to you that you need a change.  Be honest with her.  Be specific about what you'd like her to do more often.  Give her examples of what you'd like her to try, and make them easy ones at first.\n\nMaybe suggest to her that you see a sex counselor.  I'm guessing that your wife is at least in her low if not mid 40's.  For women of that generation we were told to be sexually free but not how to go about it.  You'd be suprised at how many middle aged women need to even learn the art of self pleasure.\n\nAnother route would be to lead by example.  Set up a romantic evening and introduce a new toy, or a soft core video.  Maybe a massage with some lotion.  Maybe once you help her to discover her sexual self she'll be more open to initiating it.\n\nBe patient and hang in there.	Family & Relationships

question_title: what do you mean by love? [SEP] question_content: only tell me about love,dont go to sex. [SEP] best_answer: I think everyone means something different under the word 'love'. I think love is when you want to spend every second of your life with the lucky person, when you accept him/her the way he/she is - with all their mistake (and vice-versa). When you stand by the person through all the good and hard times. This is just very brief - but I hope you'll consider it... So, what do YOU mean by love?	Family & Relationships

question_title: the break up? [SEP] question_content: the day before thanksgiving my bf decided to break up with me.he said it was because he had doubt about a lot of things.he's a freshman in college and i'm a senior in high school. So after he used this "reason" i didn't believe him because i figured that he just wants to play around while he's there and i told him that i didn't want to see him again. later, he told some mutual friends of ours that he didn't trust me but he wanted to talk to me.they also said that they asked how i was doing because he wanted to know. he's even tried to contact me through facebook and even one of his friends, who had a part in the break up tried to request me as a friend through the site. i happily declined. for me, it seems like he wants to be friends to make himself feel better about everything. when we broke up he hinted at getting together again in the future. i told him that i never want to speak to him again. lately, i've wanted to contact but i don't want to be the one who caves. Advice? [SEP] best_answer: Girl, please.  Trust me don't even waste your time.  Don't call him.  I repeat DO NOT CALL HIM.   You will appear desperate.  Actually you are too young to even be stressing about the situation.  You have your whole life to live.  Men come and go.  Trust me he will want you back.  You're headed for college and there are plenty of guys there.  \n\nGood luck	Family & Relationships

question_title: will i ever find happiness in love again? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. -Hugh Downs \n\nHappiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself. -Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nIf you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.\nIf you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.\nIf you find serenity and happiness, they may be envious. Be happy anyway.\nIf you do good today, people will often forget it tomorrow. Do good anyway.\nGive the world the best you have, and it may not be enough. Give the world the best you have got anyway.\nYou see, in the end it is between you and God, never between you and them anyway. \nMother Theresa   \n\nLove is not the place to find happiness.  Learn to be happy with yourself, and you will find happiness anywhere.  You will even be able to share it with someone you love.  \n\nAnd if you are happy with yourself, you will be better able to receive love and enjoy it more fully.\n\nWe often get caught up in struggles with someone else when what we need most is to make peace with God and within ourselves.  \n\nIf you find that you are unhappy with you, that's actually good news.  You then know where to start turning things around, and it's something you can do.  That's empowering.\n\nForgiveness is usually the place to start.  What haven't you forgiven others for?  What haven't you forgiven yourself for?  Forgiveness is the only thing that will set you free so that you can move forward.\n\nForgiveness is not saying it's okay that someone did something or that something happened.  It's releasing someone from the debt of making it up to you.  In the end, they really can't.  There is no making it up.  What we want is for the deed to be undone - and it can't be.  When you can accept that it can't be undone and you find peace with that, you can move on, unhindered by the grief that unforgiveness brings.\n\nWhatever hurts others have caused you, let it go.  Whatever expectations you had that didn't get met, let them go.  Learn to be happy with who you are and all the other disappointments in life will not be so hard to bear.\n\nWishing you much peace, happiness, and love...	Family & Relationships

question_title: Please help me! I have a prob with my bf's ex!!? [SEP] question_content: I've been together with my boyfriend for about 2 years and we are planing to engage this summer.\nBefore me, he was dating with a girl that lived 5 hours away from were we live. They broke up because my bf couldn't stand it .\nAnyway, she used to call him quite often and my bf kept telling her that he didn't want to talk to her any more.\nAnyway, this week she send to my bf a letter telling him that after they broke up, she realised that she was pregnant (she was taking the pill, and as she said, the sperm of my bf was very strong and overcome the drasis of the pill!!!!!. So, she said that she had an abortion back then and she didn't tell him because we (me&my bf) were just starting dating and she prefered to tell him now that he is about to be engaged!\nFrom what she said i understood that all the pregnacy staff was a lie and also my bf did (it didn't match with the dates, the facts etc)\nHow can i get her to stop annoying us???\nI am really tired of this sick girl!

question_title: i like this guy but i don't know if he likes me!? [SEP] question_content: i asked him out and his response was: "damn i like you and all but i have all kinds of other shit on my mind. \nand i dont think that i would be a very good boyfriend rite now cuz i'll never have time to spend with you. \nand i'm always to tired to talk on the phone rite now. \nbut yea we can just be freinds for now rite?" \n\nfootball is over.....what should i do?\n\nand do you think that he really likes me or nott? [SEP] best_answer: If he said he likes you, he probably does. Just like if he says that he won't be a good boyfriend, he probably won't be. If you're just looking for someone to date casually he might be a good guy, but if you're looking for more, you should probably just move on.  If he's already telling you he doesn't have time for you, that's not a good sign.	Family & Relationships
question_title: What's her interest level on me? Very confused!? [SEP] question_content: I'm an attractive boy, 21 and I knew a girl(Jéssica, 13) of my city by internet(orkut) the first contact I made with her was at my job. She passed by me a couple of times, I think 5x, she made eye contact sometimes but very fast. Some days later she contacted me over internet asking if was I on the same party she was. note: at this party she looked at me sometimes fast(3 or 4) so stopped. On the msg she said something like "hey, was it you at the party that day?" just that. So I answered informally saying yes, I mentioned I saw here at the party and made a little compliment.\nSo a week after that without any contact, she passed in front of the restaurant I work again 3 times this time she didn't give a look, but at the third time she stopped exactly in front of the restaurant with her friends(smiling and talking) so she looked at me very fast.\nA day after I sent her another message, saying I saw her and asked how she was, life at all and if she'd hang out saturday...to be continued... [SEP] best_answer: Well if she acts like that then I'd say that she is definatlly interested maybe in a crush on the " older guy" type way. If she says she'll hang out then go for it. Otherwise she may just be too shy.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Am I the only one.....? [SEP] question_content: who is afraid they will be alone forever? [SEP] best_answer: i'm always amazed that some people can write the nasty stuff they do just because they know how to type! rather than giving violations for writing adult content, they should give violations for being rude and nasty...anyways...we're all afraid at some point we're going to be alone and even when in a relationship when we feel comfortable there is always a risk that it might not work out and we'll be alone again. what is it you're looking for in a relationship, what is it you are looking for in a guy? i think you need to find someone you can be friends with before anything else, that way you'll always have stuff to share. also what is it, you feel that you want that you haven't gotten yet that means you are still alone? feel free to email me if u want to talk more ;-)	Family & Relationships

question_title: What are your opinions about me not being able to go with my parents to look at houses? [SEP] question_content: Here is my problem. I love looking at houses to buy them. When I went with my dad it was so fun. That is why i was excited when my mom told me i was moving, but then she told be i'd be a distraction if I went?! I just need some opinions. Are there any parents who have had this problem with their kids? How do you feel about me not going with my step-dad and mom to look at houses?\n\nsomeone help me understand why adults don't want me to go! I am not 5! or irresponcible\n\nthanks [SEP] best_answer: if they are insisting that you will just be in the way, then leave it like that. as exciting as it was before and probably will be for the rest of your life, you have to take into consideration in what your parents say. you should work on improving your behavior and prove to them that you are r-e-s-p-o-n-s-i-b-l-e and that you can act civilized when doing grown up things with them. \n\ni understand as a child that they dont have much of say when it comes to adult decisions, but you can mention that you want to feel comfy in your new home too and that you would like to see what houses they're looking at. buying a house is a big thing and all family members should be a part of agreeing with the house, but if youre going to act wild and run around an empty house- youre not going to get anywhere.

question_title: How can a guy tell if a girl/woman is desperate? [SEP] question_content: Why is it such a turn-off? Also, why is it guys want to try and "pick you up" once you are in a relationship? I was just wondering. Thanks! [SEP] best_answer: Ways a guy can tell if a girl/woman is desparate...she is overly aggressive and never says no to anything, she calls too much...she emotionally pours out all her feelings toward you before the two of you are considering even dating....those are signs....I dont want to make this sound primative but guys usually prefer to be the predator we like the chase it gives us a feeling of conquest...(we are weird like that..).....and to your 2nd question....For us it's a competition (sometimes within ourselves)...so we can blow up our ego...unfortunately it may not always be about you....(we men suck like that sometimes...sorry)	Family & Relationships

However a family member of mine works for a different cable company (that I can't get) and I am wondering if one of their modems would work.  I could get it cheaper if it would. [SEP] best_answer: Yes you do. Your Internet provider will send you a modem along with all of other necessary equipment that you'll need.

The work is located on the client's webhost account which I have access to. Is it legal to temporarily shut down the website until payment has been remitted in full?\n\nI understand that I could take the client to small claims court, but even that is no guarantee of payment coming due. Meanwhile, the client is getting what amounts to free advertising.\n\nBoth myself and the client live and work in NJ, and the webhost resides in CA.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!

question_title: How does the speed of the internet connection affect the dowload times of web pages? [SEP] question_content: Could someone explain this to me [SEP] best_answer: When you open a web page, the information on that page (pictures, sound, text, etc.) are sent from the "Server" to your computer through the internet.\n\nSome pages have lots of information on them ... the Yahoo home page, for example, has pictures and links and text.  You'll note also that there are little applications that run a well.  These little applications are called scripts.\n\nA script is a part of the web page that works like a little program.  Ever noticed how when you move your mouse over the icons in the upper right corner of the Yahoo home page, that they buttons "expand" to show you more choices ?\n\nAll of this information and data must be sent from the Yahoo server to your computer.\n\nThink about it this way ... If I had to send you 20 gallons of water, you could get that 20 gallons a whole lot faster if there is a bigger pipe going into your house !   If I'm trying to send you 2000 gallons of water (like a page full of pictures and stuff) and all you have is a soda-straw sized pipe (i.e. dial-up), then it's gonna take a while !

question_title: how to set up a website? [SEP] question_content: My club members want to set up a site [SEP] best_answer: The options for setting up a website are as varied as the options for choosing a car. Choose what you think your needs are from the left-hand column and follow the instructions in that row. \n\nWho You Are  What You'll Need to Invest  Do This  Don't Do This  \nI'm a student and need to be able to put my class projects on a website. \n\nI just want to set up a personal site with a few photos and some generic information. \n\nI'm campaigning for public office and don't want to spend any money on the Internet, but someone told me I need a website. \n\nThere's no way I'm going to spend anything on building a website, but I'm sure I need one.  Free websites are available everywhere. You'll need to spend at least half an hour to set up what you want, but you don't need any special skills. Your only investment is time.  Go to Geocities or Angelfire and follow their very simple step-by-step instructions for setting up a website. If you can follow directions, you can put up a website with one of these services. There are plenty of others available, but these two are the best-known. \n\nWhen you're done, be sure to add the address of your website to the signature line on your e-mail. If you have business stationery or other printed literature, put it there as well. It's just about the only way anyone will find your site. \n\nIf you know anyone with a website, ask them nicely if they would mind giving you a link. Unless some other site links to yours, the search engines will never find it. \n\nExpect to grow annoyed with the ads on your site. Free web hosts use pop-up ads, pop-under ads, and banners built-in to your pages in order to pay for their services. If you're not bothered, don't worry about them. Most users eventually grow tired of them.  Don't expect a lot of visitors. Your address will be long and hard to remember, so unless someone is really intent on finding your site, not many folks will visit. \n\nDon't expect to be taken very seriously. If you aren't willing to put any money into your site, don't expect visitors to think you're an authority. \n\nDon't get caught up in design. There's not much you can do to make your free site look great. Just put the basic information up and see whether it does the trick for you. Crazy backgrounds, wild color schemes, lots of pictures, and sounds that play whenever people visit your site will only serve to irritate. Keep it simple. \n\nDon't forget to add content. Since your page probably doesn't look very special, be sure to add things to it often enough that it serves a real purpose. \n\nDon't put your e-mail address on the page. Anywhere. If you do, you'll get so much spam you'll never forgive yourself.  \nWho You Are  What You'll Need to Invest  Do This  Don't Do This  \nI have a lot to say, and I want to blog.  As little as nothing. Some fees may apply, especially as you become more sophisticated. Expect it to become a regular consumer of your time.  Go to Blogger or TypePad or LiveJournal and follow their instructions. \n\nHave something interesting to say, and often. Keep your site fresh. Political campaigns and businesses are starting to realize the power of fresh information posted to people who actively want to follow what's happening directly from the source. \n\nYou may eventually decide to go solo and run your personal site without someone else's software or hosting. When that time comes, use PairNIC to register your domain and Pair Networks to host your site. Their prices are excellent and so is their service.  Don't expect it to be easy. Well-done blogs often absorb lots of their authors' time. \n\nDon't post so often that you create unreasonable expectations.

question_title: Hurry..please help!? How do i back up my computer?!? [SEP] question_content: I have an Windows xp Home Edition..im updating my system and need to know how to back up my system in case something goes wrong?! [SEP] best_answer: The most convenient way is to backup your system using special software, such as Acronis True Image, to the CDs or DVDs. True Image has very friendly interface and I think that it won't take you a long to time to understand how it works. The latest versions of ATI can burn a CD or DVD but one can just use ATI 7 (free version) to create an image of a hard drive/of a partition on a hard drive and then just burn it to CD. However ATI 7 can just burn a bootable CD and in case your system fails you'll be able to boot from it just in minutes.\nYou can purchase the latest version of ATI here: http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/\nOr download a free version of ATI here: http://www.acronis.com/mag/vnu-ati7	Computers & Internet

A good book, as someone mentioned already. I don't know of any personally. Perhaps someone can suggest one.\n\n2. A tutorial or two :)  ... A good resource for Java tutorials (well, lots of programming tutorials actually) is ... http://www.programmertutorials.com/tutorials/7/1\n\n3.

question_title: isnt there a way to format a partition which is a a boot or system partition? [SEP] question_content: further wat is the difference between a boot and system partition.Is there any difference between formatting the drive and selecting everything and simply delete it? [SEP] best_answer: First off you can not format your main "Boot Partition" unless you are going to create a Ghost disk to install after you FDISK or format and keep the OS still.  Once you format / FDISK your Boot Partition it is gone and you have to reinstall your O/S from scratch. (I format my system about once every 6 mo. to make sure crap is cleared up anyway.)\n\nThe difference between a "Boot" and a "System" partition is the boot partition has your MBR (Master Boot Record) loaded on it.  Which in all means the Boot information for your O/S.  (You can have multiple bootable partitions called a Dual/Tri/or even now I've seen Quade boot systems.)  And is your system has to have this partition to boot into any OS.\n\nThe "System" partition is a partition doesn't have to be on a system but can be setup if you have a large hard drive.  (i.e.  300GB drive and you want to make 3 partitions 1-100G "Boot Partition" 2-100GB "System Partitions")  This type of partition doesn't have an MBR.	Computers & Internet

question_title: What is the best program for streaming music off the internet to your PC? [SEP] question_content: Examples: Musicmatch, Yahoo, etc.\nFree music downloads would also be nice. [SEP] best_answer: I think Yahoo's LAUNCHcast service is really great.  You can find it at http://music.yahoo.com/\n\nThey have pre-programmed stations that play music based on themes, such as Big Hits of the 80s or R&B or New Releases.\n\nThey also have a custom station called "My Station" which will play music that you'll like.  This is based on how you rate songs, artists and albums, which you can do on the website or in the radio player.  Once you've started rating, the station will get better and better.  I love it, and I don't think anybody has as good of personalization as the "My Station"\n\nMusicmatch is pretty good too, although it hasn't been getting as much attention since they were bought by Yahoo!\n\nI don't think anybody is going to offer free music downloads (at least legally), other than maybe some obscure indie music.

question_title: How much money monthly you get from Google Adsense? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Your mileage may vary. No one could predict how much one website could earn. A website with the same amount of pageviews may earn $100 per month while the other website with the same amount of pageviews earn $10,000 a month.\n\nIt is important that you experiment, but keep in mind that your mileage varies. Some sites fit so well with Adsense and can earn thousands from it (example is my website), while some can earn very little from it -- EVEN with tremendous amount of traffic. Here's a thread I recently answered where the site owner said that her site was even featured in 60 Minutes show and is enjoying an avalanche of traffic - yet she earns only $10 from it http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Ar5WQhJtsb8LJN4NbpDeivgjzKIX?qid=1006032112980 \n\nYou have to remember that your income will depend on several factors: \n\n1. keywords shown on your site\n2. level of advertiser bidding on your site - e.g. keywords "diamond" is worth more than "squirrel games" because more advertisers are willing to spend money on those interested in diamonds\n3. your traffic levels - the more traffic you have, the better\n4. your CTR rate - the higher the better and this depends on your ad placement, your ad colors\n5. responsiveness of audience to ads\n5. smartpricing - the big unknown in Adsense\n\nThe only way you can learn about how your site will perform with Adsense is through trying it.\n\nWebmasterWorld has a lot of discussions on Adsense and one of the most active discussions right now is the thread "How I made a Million in 3 Months with Adsense  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum89/12751.htm . The person who started the thread is Markus Finch, who operates the immensely popular online dating website PlentyofFish.com. PlentyofFish.com's business model is different from the subscription based model used by the big online dating websites. Instead of subscriptions, Markus relies on advertising, specifically Google Adsense to derive income from his website. The lessons he shares are:\n\n1. Understand your traffic and how it could affect your keywords.\n2. Create sites that will bring in repeat traffic.\n3. Have your users create content and lots of it.\n4. Do not enter markets with a lot of competition monitized via adsense.\n5. Keep your site simple.\n6. Learn from various forums and if people are not talking about your market, there is a good chance you will make money.\n\nMarkus' website has an impressive Alexa rank of 1,407. What is more impressive is that the site is only a two-person operation, with Markus getting help from his girlfriend unlike his big competitors run by big corporations (e.g. Viacom owns Match.com).\n\nI suggest you read the following articles:\n\nGoogle Adsense: How Small Business Entrepreneurs can Earn from Online Advertising http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol123/adsense.htm \nEarning Revenues from Contextual Advertising http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol139/contextual.htm \n8 Tips for Maximizing Contextual Advertising Revenues http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol146/contextual.htm \nContextual Advertising: Why Are You Earning Only Pennies? http://www.powerhomebiz.com/022006/adsense.htm	Computers & Internet

If you read the article I cite in the source, it makes more sense.  Google has devised their own file system, but the operating system they use in their data center is a version of Linux.  So, is it a completely new OS?  Doesn't sound like it.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Where can I download a church membership database model for MS-Access? [SEP] question_content: In my expanding duties to manage a church membership, I decided to move from an MS-Word (my forte) table to a full-featured database application in MS-Access (my proficiency in Access is limited).  The wizard’s models aren’t flexible enough (won’t allow me to delete unnecessary fields, etc.) so I decided to create a new Access database application without the wizard’s assistance.\n\nIt then occurred to me that millions of others must have wanted to put a list of church members together into an Access database so I’m probably reinventing the wheel.  However, when I did a Google search for an Access church membership model, all I could find were trial applications that cost hundreds of dollars and weren’t compatible with MS-Access.\n\nSurely with all the “brotherhood,” somebody must be willing to share their Access database model with other Christians.  It seems like everyone is using “God” as a vehicle to run enterprising businesses with proprietary rights protecting their financial advantage.  I never realized how much opportunity “God” is providing to the religious purveyors of the faith until I tried to find a database application that someone might be willing to share, just to further the gospel.\n\nSo how about it?  Do you know of a place where I can take advantage of someone else’s hours of labor in setting up a church membership database in MS-Access?   Thanks, Johnny [SEP] best_answer: (also answered in the Religion and Spirituality Section)\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMicrosoft has a huge section where you can download things like this.\n\nFor a membership database, you can go to:\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/TC010185841033.aspx?CategoryID=CT063459131033\n(I used this one for a photo club membership database.

But it takes two to complete a reception.\n\nRB situation doesn't look too promising, but after all the ups and downs of last season who knows?\n\nD# needs to seriously tighten the ole belt, but it helps if your offence doesn't put you in a terrible spot.\n\nLast year, the offense self distructed with injuries and they STILL managed to come close to winning several games. But this isn't horseshoes OR handgrenades.\n\nAfter last year's terrible luck, I'm bumping them back up in the end of year rankings for 07, unless that turns into a streak. Then I'm writing another "Maybe Next Year" wish list to the fat man in red and white.\n\nSuperbowl? Nu-uh. Play-offs? Unlikely. This is a rebuilding year regardless of who is back and until Farve retires and a successor is found (Note: Not just a starter but a GOOD QB, so who knows how long.) don't hold your breath waiting to see that silver football in the hands of someone in green and gold.\n\nBut I wouldn't be shocked if they had a winning season either. That is what I love about the Packers. Unpredictable.\n\nDon't feel bad. I'm a KC fan first and foremost. HERM EDWARDS!? Bah humbug!	Sports

Is there anything that you're not really flexible at, such as needing more stretch in your spirals? If you can narrow it down a bit, it might be easier to answer. \n\nBut in general, yoga, ballet and pilates are good places to start looking for stretches and exercises that will help your skating.

[SEP] best_answer: Theres little point in having these kind of conventions or protocols its hardly realistic to expect that a country which treats people in a way that makes them want to escape and seek asylum in another country would give a toss about protocols etc. The UK seeks assurances from certain countries that returnees will not be tortured,to even pretend that a country that tortures has the morals or ethics to stick to an agreement is laughable.they know exactly what they're sending these poor people back to.

question_title: lady feeling violated? [SEP] question_content: lady I take care of came home to her house open.  Thinking that her house was broken into found out by neighbor that the police were called to her residence by the agency that I work for because she didn't answer her door.  The police in this Illinois town had neighbor crawl through his crawlspace into her garage to open door in meantime, broke some expensive things she had boxed in her garage when getting in.  Anyways, police entered her home finding out that she wasn't there.  Then when leaving, neighbor asked if he should lock her house back up and they said no.  She felt so violated and went to the town hall for the report to file a complaint and no report was filled out.  This act was comitted by the Chief of police and is the one who didn't file the report.  How can she get piece of mind about this. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know why they wouldn't relock the door, but since the police received a call about her well being, they were in the right to enter on the premises of that fact alone.\n\nPolice officers are allowed to enter if they believe that there is an emergency, which in this case, they were told by an authoritave agency that she was not answering and that there was concern for her welfare. \n\nI am sorry that this woman received damage and now feels less secure about this, but she will hopefully realize that the police were acting out of concern for her welfare and did not mean any harm. It is good that someone is looking out for her best interest; I think it shows that there are still people who care for others. \n\nSorry to hear about her damages, but at least she is alright.

State when the kingdom started and ended, and what ended it. [SEP] best_answer: The Mandé peoples settled the Sahel (including present-day Mali), and formed a succession of Sahelian kingdoms, including the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, and the Songhai Empire. Timbuktu was a key city in these empires as an outpost for trans-Saharan trade and a center for scholarship. The Songhai Empire declined under a Moroccan invasion in 1591.\n\nTimbuktu had the first university - as such it was a place of learning.\n\nIn terms of its effect on Europe, in later years, Mali like the other West African countries were affected by the slave trade and later conquered by the European powers between 1880-1900.\n\nMali was invaded by France starting in 1880, which annexed it as an overseas department of France. The colony, which at times also included neighbouring countries, was known as French Sudan or the Sudanese Republic. In early 1959, the union of Mali and Senegal became the Mali Federation, which gained independence from France on June 20, 1960. Senegal withdrew from the Mali Federation after a few months. The Republic of Mali, under Modibo Keïta, withdrew from the French Community on September 22, 1960.	Politics & Government

Yet people run red lights with cop bikes sitting there, they speed, the cops cut me up on pedestrian crossings - even they are texting whilst driving! this town is crooked man :) [SEP] best_answer: that's is totally wack!

question_title: Do you think convicted child molestors should be physically marked? [SEP] question_content: What do you think?  I say they should tatoo the crime across the forehead or across the cheeks of the offender.  Noone would ever accidently let their kids play near the guy with "Pedophile" stamped on his cheeks. [SEP] best_answer: Certainly not! It is the responsibility of parents to know where their children are and with whom. To deprive people of the ability to earn a living after conviction for ANY crime is not in the interest of justice or of society as a whole.\nThe way our laws are currently written, a 22 year old guy who loses his head over a perfectly willing and experienced 17 year old girl is catagorized right alongside the monsters who get their jollies with actual children. It would not be right.\nBesides which, any offender with the money could just go to a doctor and have it removed, or get it covered with another tattoo...and don't think there are not doctors right here in the States that would do it.

question_title: Am I an American citizen? [SEP] question_content: My grandparents were Irish US citizens but moved back to Ireland so my parents and I are Irish. Am I entitled to citizenship through them? [SEP] best_answer: It's a little more complicated than that.  Your parents may qualify for us citizenship through the blood of your grandparents.  however, you may not if your parents never lived in the u.s. prior to your birth.  When you say your grandparents are you referring to both your maternal and paternal grandparents?  It's a complicated issue.  A lot of questions need to be answered first. best thing to do is have your parents apply for the u.s. citizenship.  See if they can apply for you to derive citizenship for you.  If they cannot they should be able to immigrate you to the u.s. as a lawful permanent resident.  after that you may qualify on your own merits after 5 years.  you should speak to the u.s. consulate citizenship services division.  they will have the answers that you need.  you may or may not be.  there just isn't enough information provided by you to decide.

question_title: Should graduation be made compulsory for entering parliament? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Definately not.  \n\nWhile I'm not one to promote dropping out of school, many, many good people have succeeded very well without completing their education.  There are many good people who would be wonderful advocates for the people who dropped out of school and spent years and years running their own business.  These people are certainly bright enough and experienced enough to contribute to the democratic process, are they not? \n\nRemember that a diploma is ONLY a piece of paper.  It's a piece of paper that says you completed school--which is a good thing--but says nothing further about your qualifications.  Frankly, these days anybody who wants to can complete school.  It says nothing about what classes you took, how well you did, or what you actually know.  It's just a piece of paper.  \n\nDemocracy suffers if anybody is locked out.	Politics & Government

question_title: should a women be president?? please answer? [SEP] question_content: please answer....... [SEP] best_answer: It's not a matter of "should a woman be president." It's not important that we elect a woman, so that we can finally say we did it. What needs to happen is to elect the most effective leader, whether it is a man or a woman. That's not so easy to do. Usually, instead of a leader, we get a politician. A politician is someone who cuts deals, trades influence, and always if it will benefit him or her. That makes politicians self-serving. A leader is someone who does the right thing for the country, whether it is good for him or her personally or not. We haven't had one of those in a long time. Harry Truman 60 years ago. Or maybe John Kennedy 45 years ago.	Politics & Government

I would just like to have a discussion on why I see so many Democrats assert that Republicans are always rich and/or are only concerned about tax breaks for rich people.  I for one would still vote for and appreciate more tax breaks for middle class. [SEP] best_answer: Republicans  have historically been a wealthier contingent of voters because of one simple reason: graduated tax.\n\nThink about it, let's say that Bill Gates is going through the grocery store line behind you.  You pay $1.50 for a loaf of bread.  When they ring his up, they say, "For you Mr. Gates, that will be $1,500."\n\nMost people would say that isn't fair. Just because someone can afford to pay a certain amount, they shouldn't have to. Everyone uses the same postal system, Army, legal system, etc. Rich people shouldn't have to pay more.\n\nDemocrats, conversely, believe that rich people should pay more to support the poorer people to create a more socialist society.\n\nI do believe that if you have money to help other people, you should, government shouldn't force you to donate to programs you don't believe in.\n\nI hope that helps--Read "Atlas Shrugged."

question_title: Do police officers have the right to breathalize passengers if the driver blows .00? [SEP] question_content: And the passengers aren't outrageously drunk. [SEP] best_answer: A police officer has the legal right to breathalyze anyone he or she suspects of having used alcohol. A passenger, not driver - passenger, in a car can be charged with public intoxication if they are over the legal blood alcohol limit. Unfortunately, there are police officers in Texas who are now going INSIDE bars to breathalyze people and giving public intoxication tickets, even if they did not drive to the bar, and are not driving home. Fortunately, the vast majority of cops will not give a ticket someone riding in a car drunk, if the driver is sober. Usually this will only happen if the intoxicated person is belligerent or aggressive, and disrupting the safety and process of the traffic stop.\nAlso, if the passenger is underage, ANY trace of alcohol will result in at least a ticket for minor consumption. If under 18 years of age, each state has different laws concerning minors.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: Not only is it a possibility it is very likely. The US employees Intelligence Tatics (CIA, and secret military units) overseas. These units live in the country as nationals, speak the language, have a job and so on. They are there in case they ever needed and would be the preemptive strike in the event of war with that country. This is fact that these units are there, not conspiracy theory.\nWould not be easier in the US for people of another country to do the same thing? I mean in American we preach diversity, we teach foreign child in their own language at our tax payers expense. We embrace multi-culturism and acceptance. Would it not be easy for a Muslim terrorist group to form within a government protected Muslim church? \nI am not saying that all Muslims are terrorist, but with our acceptance of diverse cultures and the lack of assimilation that is desired by many Americans, the extreme Muslims who are terrorist could come to American and fit in quite nicely.

question_title: Can universities do this? [SEP] question_content: Is it legal for university to allocate students to university accomodation on the basis of their race? Is it legal for the university to restrict a group of students to designated area? If the university is aware of the fact that ALL of the students under a package deal are of the same race, by restricting these students to a designated area, is this intentional racial segregation? Is it legal? \n\nRestricted to a designated area means: All package deal students are only allowed in house number "this" to "that", all grouped in a small area. They are not allowed in other areas even if they requested for it or opting to pay extra. In addition to that, all the rooms in different areas has the same rental price. The rooms allocated to these students are among the smallest and least well maintained. [SEP] best_answer: Private Schools and public universities have different rules.  Private schools like private clubs can, for the most part, do almost anything they want.  State universities that accept tax-payer money have quiet strict equality rules.  The second Thing wrong with your argument is the housing is not based on race.  It is based on nationality.  Granted that if the country of origin was China most of the respondents would be Asian but a British person from Hong Kong would qualify.  The same would go for Africa.  Some of the respondents could be white South Africans.  Changing you dormitory after admission in always based on availability.  You will be able to change dorns next semester but take my advice.

[SEP] question_content: that this is a country build and based on freedom, and dont forget that there is a seperation of state and church.  What do you think after thinking about all of the aspects that this country is based on? [SEP] best_answer: With the separation of church and state, can the government even legislate what marriage is??  "Marriage" is a religious ceremony to unite 2 people.\n\nIf the government wants to have marriage be a lawful union, then they have to come up with an unbias reason (not based in religious belief) that gays should not marry.  Because it is stated to be wrong in the bible will not fly in a court of law.  Anytime that someone tries to pass a law about marriage being between a man and a woman, it gets struck down as unconstitutional because lawmakers can't come up with a good enough reason other than it's in the bible.  Thank God that someone can still look at the law without pulling the bible into the mix.\n\nI seriously think that no one ever expects the law to pass, and it is only done to make "friends" with the "moral majority".

question_title: Are, Say, Giraffes More Evolved Than, Say, Squid or Amoebas? [SEP] question_content: Are some organisms more "advanced" than others? [SEP] best_answer: You are asking two very different questions here, and I will address each seperately.\n\n"Are, Say, Giraffes More Evolved Than, Say, Squid or Amoebas?"\n\nNo. All life currently on Earth has had ancestors evolving for the same length of time, as all life shares a common ancestor. You might argue that the more generations something has been evolving, the more 'evolved' it is, in which case, bacteria like E. Coli are the most evolved. I consider generation length to be a function of evolutionary adaptation, so I would say that between two organisms which are alive at the same time, neither is more evolved than the other.\n\nAs for your second question,\n"Are some organisms more "advanced" than others?"\n\nSure. It all depends on what you mean by "advanced". Eukaryotes are certainly more complex than prokaryotes, for example, so if you defined "advancement" as "number of cells", then blue whales are probably the most advanced organisms. If you define "advancement" by the number of cell types, well, I have no idea what's the most advanced, but it might be "mammals" or something; regardless, it's probably a pretty big group.

question_title: Who names tropical Cyclones? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Hurricane Names: from the FEMA kids website\n\nAll hurricanes are given names. Why is that? To help us identify storms and track them as they move across the ocean. Remember, there can be more than one hurricane at a time and without naming them, we could get confused and which storm we're talking about.\n\nFor hundreds of years, hurricanes in the West Indies were named after the particular saint's day on which the hurricane occurred. An Australian meteorologist began giving women's names to tropical storms before the end of the 19th century. In 1953, the U.S. National Weather Service, which is the federal agency that tracks hurricanes and issues warnings and watches, began using female names for storms. \n\nIn 1979, both women and men's names were used. One name for each letter of the alphabet is selected, except for Q, U and Z. For Atlantic Ocean hurricanes, the names may be French, Spanish or English, since these are the major languages bordering the Atlantic Ocean where the storm occur. \n\nSo who decides what names are used each year? The World Meteorological Organization uses six lists in rotation. The same lists are reused every six years. The only time a new name is added is if a hurricane is very deadly or costly. Then the name is retired and a new name is chosen.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: what is meant by superconductors? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Superconductors are electrical conductors which have a very low resistance.  In the past these materials need to be at very low temperatures.  Recent advances have allowed the creation of HTS (high temperature superconductors) which can operate at very much higher tempteratures than before.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: why do people often feel fatigued before they are diagnosed with diabetes? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Diabetes occurs when the body's insulin production is impaired in some way.  When there is insufficient insulin in the body, the complex sugars in our food cannot be broken down into glucose for use by our cells.  Ironically enough, this leads to a situation where the blood has excess sugar but the cells are starved of glucose.  Since glucose is required for many cellular functions and to provide energy, the depletion of cellular glucose ultimately leads to a feeling of fatigue.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: why does magnetic field is produced when current pass through a conductor ? [SEP] question_content: Actually how dose the energy convertion takes place ? [SEP] best_answer: I'm sorry, but the previous answer was very misleading.  First of all, an electron's spin does not give it its charge.  After all, neutrons spin yet they have zero electrical charge.  Its spin gives it a magnetic moment, which is subtly different from a magnetic field.\n\nA charged object such as an electron moving in any trajectory will create a magnetic field.  A charge moving in a helical path will create an approximation to a solenoidal magnetic field.  In current carrying wires, the electrons are moving collinearly with the electric field created due to the potential difference, i.e. in more or less a straight line.\n\nNow, why does the moving charge create the magnetic field in the first place?  A good way to explain it is with an example.\n\nSuppose you have 2 protons (+ charge) placed close to each other, the pair initially being stationary with respect to you.  You know what would happen right?  They would drift apart, repelled by their like positive charges.\n\nNow picture yourself running very fast, past those two protons.  If you run fast enough, the relativistic time dilation will make it appear, from your perspective, that the protons are drifting apart more slowly... as if some force is holding them back.  If you consider that you running very fast with respect to the protons is the same as the protons moving very fast with respect to you, you can see that the two moving charges are having an effect on each other which cannot be explained by their electric field strength alone.  This is what we call the magnetic field, essentially a relativistic distortion of the electric field due to time dilation.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Found a jaw bone in my garden, can anyone identify the animal. Photo on 360 blog: 360.yahoo.com/curlybyte? [SEP] question_content: The bone is about 20 cm in length [SEP] best_answer: As SomeDude said, that's a deer.\n\nSee the high crowned teeth, folded in lamellar plates that look almost like leaves?  Those are the cheek teeth (premolars and molars) of a cervid (member of the deer family).\n\nThe long gap between those teeth and the tip of the jaw is known as the diastema.  There are no teeth in that section of the jaw.  The incisor teeth that would be at the tip of the jaw appear to be missing, but they often fall out after death.\n\nHere's a page from Montana State University that discusses how to determine the age of a white-tailed deer by examining the molars:\n\nhttp://www.montana.edu/wwwpb/pubs/mt200107.html\n\nI'm not sure yours is a white-tailed deer, but I suspect that it might be.

question_title: why do we see upside down through raindrops? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: My vision isn't good enough to actually "look" through a raindrop, but I understand your question.  Raindrops are a lot like a lens.  In fact, a raindrop is a lens.  Every lens has a focal length based on its shape and material and when objects within the focal length, they are magnified.  Raindrops, however, have a very short focal length so anything you see through them will likely be beyond the focal length.  Objects beyond the focal length are not necessarily magnified, and in fact they are flipped.  It's much easier to understand with a ray tracing diagram.  I've provided a link to the slides my professor used in his optics lecture.  Slide 5 in particular should be of help.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is the importance of the sun to the biological or physical processes? [SEP] question_content: I hope you will tell me the whole process. [SEP] best_answer: To add to Diamond's explanation, remember the food chain that you learned about in lower school?  Small animals eat plants.  Larger animals eat smaller animals and so on and so forth until the top of the food chain dies and decays back into the soil to be used in the growth of new plants.  But the plants need sunlight to live by way of photosynthesis.  And that light comes from the sun of course.\nSo in addition to the heating of the earth and being the engine that powers our weather (which distributes liquid water--another thing plants need--all over the planet) the sun also sustains the cycle of life and the food chain.

Angiosperms are more advanced that gymnosperms because gymnosperms lack which structure found n angiosperm [SEP] question_content: A. independent gametophytes\nB. pollen grains\nC. fruits\nD. roots\nE. leaves [SEP] best_answer: Here's what I learned:\n\nBoth gymnosperms and angiosperms have vascular tissue and both produce seeds. However, the seeds of angiosperms are surrounded by the wall of the ovary of the flower which forms the fruit, whereas gymnosperms do not possess this structure. Their seeds are described as naked (Gymnosperm from the Greek: gymnos - naked, sperm - seed). Botanists place the angiosperms in the group (division) Angiophyta but the Gymnosperms do not form a coherent group and are separated into four divisions.\n(from http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/ecotree/gymangio.htm)\n\nI don't really see the wall of the ovary as one of the choices you offer.  I guess the answer is C--fruits.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is Sudoku Puzzle?and how can i solve it?pls? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Sudoku also known as Number Place, is a logic-based placement puzzle. The aim of the puzzle is to enter a numerical digit from 1 through 9 in each cell of a 9×9 grid made up of 3×3 subgrids (called "regions"), starting with various digits given in some cells (the "givens"). Each row, column, and region must contain only one instance of each numeral. Completing the puzzle requires patience and logical ability. Although first published in a U.S. puzzle magazine in 1979, Sudoku initially caught on in Japan in 1986 and attained international popularity in 2005.	Science & Mathematics

But we do not usually feel it b/c it is not strong enough. They, however, can detect these slight movements w/ their sensitive equipment.\n\nThere are some other signs as well. An increase in geologic activity near a faultline can give clues. Uplifting of land is one. Increases in geothermal activity may be another.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Will we ever be able to go F.T.L.? [SEP] question_content: i know there are a lot of doubts about this because the energy required would be close to infinite, and opening up a wormhole would also be next to impossible, even in the next 200 years of scientific advancement.  But, are there any scientific optimist out there who truly believes that we'll be able to achieve FTL in the next century or so, and why?  Give some minor facts to back up your claim. [SEP] best_answer: There is a big difference between predictions that the speed of sound could not be broken and that the speed of light cannot. It was always known that *some* things can go faster than sound. Bullets for example. The question was whether we would have the technology to get people to that speed.\n\nThe speed of light is very different since we haven't seen *anything* go faster than light in a vacuum. Nothing. Ever. Furthermore, the predictions of special relativity have been verified in particle accelerators when the particles are going to within a hundred thousandth of the speed of light.\n\nAs an example, at Fermilab protons are accelerated to energies of 2TeV. This is over 2000 times the rest mass of those protons. To accelerate something the mass of a *gram* to an equivalent speed would take about the energy of the largest hydrogen bomb ever exploded. This amount of energy would be needed for each gram to get to that speed, so multiply it by 75000 for a medium sized human. And that doesn't count the spaceship they would have to travel in!\n\nNow, this is how much energy is needed to get to speed we *know* about. To go faster would require even more. Unfortunately, we have never seen a wormhole of any type. But the predictions are that the energy requirements would be even more prohibitive than what I just described.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: What about AI-artificial intelligence & Robots and Jobs? Dr Loebner: "I want to see total unemployment" [SEP] question_content: http://loebner.net/Prizef/In-response.html\n\nHe says,\n\n``2. Related to my desire to develop the Turing Test was my desire to advance AI. I have, since adolescence, been interested in the field. When I was in high school, I thought that computers and robots should do all work. I called this philosophy "automated parasitism." I was told this was impossible. To build a computer as complex as the human brain would require a computer as large as the Empire State Building, and it would require all the water of Niagara Falls to cool. Today, I remain an unrepentant utopian. I want to see total unemployment. That, for me, is the ultimate goal of AI and automation. (The problem is to design a society that can equitably distribute the fruits of automation among its members.)``\n\n......I can live off fruit any day! :D [SEP] best_answer: AI and robots, etc. would be a boon to society if they could accomplish all the jobs that ordinary people do not want to do or are too dangerous to do.  There will always remain jobs that people like to do such as compose music.  Also many people would have to "manage" the robots to accomplish what is useful to society.  You would have to manage your own personal robot.  A person relieved of all responsibilities for work (in Utopia?) could devote their entire life to learning; but would they study so hard if there were no useful applications for their knowledge because robots cared for all needs?  People also have emotional needs and it is hard to imagine that a robot could substitute for a loving spouse or the family dog.  Those are "jobs" too.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: how is a stapler assembled ? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I would suggest that you select a particular stapler that you are interested in and "reverse engineer" it in your mind.  Does it use threaded fasteners or permanent rivets?  Imagine the riveting process being reversed (like playing a film backwards).  For example, if your stapler has a plastic piece where you press down on it, would it be easier to add that piece to all the staplers in production before assembling the entire stapler?  Try to identify the sub-assemblies (like the plastic piece) to determine the order in which the entire stapler is assembled from many parts.  Sometimes the order is mandatory and irreversible and sometimes it is arbitrary.  You could perform a similar process to figure out how an entire automobile is assembled and the entire motor would be a sub-assembly in itself.  Good luck.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] best_answer: 204.23g of Tryptophan is one mole.  Hence by proportion you can find how many moles is made with 15400mg or 15.4g by: 15.4/204.23.\n\nThis number of moles of Tryptophan produced is also equal to the number of moles of serotonin produced.  As one mole of serotonin is contained in 176.22g, you can find the mass of serotonin formed by: 176.22*number of moles of serotonin.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Physics in Action!!!!! need help on these 3 three questions.? [SEP] question_content: question 1:  Why would it be beneficial for a bicycle to have a low center of mass when the rider rounds a turn?\n\n\n\n\nquestion 2:  A bicycle designer recently modified a bicycle by adding cylindrical weights to the spokes of the wheels.  He reasoned that this would make the mass of the wheel, on average, closer to the axle, in turn making the moment of inertia smaller and the wheel easier to rotate.  Where did he go wrong?\n\n\n\n\nquestion 3:  The front wheel of a penny-farthing bicyle is three times larger than the rear wheel.  How much more massive must the rear wheel be to have the same moment of inertia as the front wheel? [SEP] best_answer: 1) has been done above; I agree.\n\n2) The CoM of the wheel is already at the axis.  Adding mass will only increase the moment of intertia; only rearranging the existing mass there could potentially reduce it.\n\n3) For a wheel, the moment of interia is proportional to r squared.  So if the big wheel has 3 times the radius, the small should have 9 times the mass.	Science & Mathematics

This is why you will find elderly people in a heavy sweater when it is 80 degrees out side.  They lose that sense of feeling warm and cold.  \nAlso part of this is due to the surface skin becoming (aplastic) a condition where it is dried out and very thin.  This reduces the sensory perception as well.\nAs far as the other nerves, I am certain that when your body start to degenerate from the aging process they all are effected.  But this was an easy example to give to you.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What is the reason to put stone pieces (metal) under and around the railway lines.? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Track ballast, consisting of gravel, cinders or other aggregate, forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties are laid. It is used to facilitate drainage of water, and to create an even running surface. This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. Such a track is also used to bring the Space Shuttle to its launching pad.\nIn the early days of railroads, much material for ballast came from rock found in the local area. In the Midwest, for example, much use was made of granite, while states in the southeast, such as Florida, made use of limestone. One specific type of granite used in the Midwest earned the name "Pink Lady" due to its color; in other areas, the ballast can be a mix of light and dark colors called "Salt and Pepper".

question_title: Determine the domain, intercepts, asymptotes, critical and inflection points of the graph:     y=lnx/x? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Domain:  All the values of x that provides a defined value of y.  In the equation above if we plug 0 or less than 0 for x, we get an undefined answer.  Thus the domain is x>0.  \n\nIntercepts:  To find intercepts we plug y equal to zero and then solve for x.  So, lnx/x = 0\n                          lnx = 0\n                             x = 1\nThus the intercept point is (x,y) = (1, 0)\n\nAsymptotes:  An asymptote is a straight or curved line which a curve will approach, but never touch.  By looking at the graph of lnx/x, we can conclude that the graph approaches y = 0 but never actually touches 0.  So, the asymptotes is y = 0.  \n\nCritical point:  In mathematics, a critical point (or critical number) is a point on the domain of a function where the derivative is equal to zero. It is also called a stationary point.  Derivative of above function is: \n                        dy/dx = [(x)(1/x)-lnx](x^2)\n                           0 = (1-lnx)/(x^2)\n                           0 = 1-lnx\n                           1 = lnx\n                            x = e\nSo, the critical point is x = e.

question_title: can you test alcohol in an already basic solution using litmus paper? [SEP] question_content: if not, how might you go about it? if so, how would you do it? [SEP] best_answer: no, you cant.\n\nU cant even test the pH for alcohol even if it is slightly acidic compared to other organic compounds, because it's a weaker acid than water. Alcohol can dissolve in aqueous soln; they dont ionize but form network of hydrogen bonds with water molecules.\n\nIn aqueous solution, no matter how basic it is, (let's say 14, that's the best u can do) alcohol will not lose an hydrogen atom 'cause its conjugate base is a stronger base than hydroxide ions (strongest base in aqueous soln). pKa for water is 15, alcohol is 16-18.

question_title: what are the things required to prepare an aquarium & how to maintain it? [SEP] question_content: pl tell me the fishes that are to be used & how to maintain them. [SEP] best_answer: The water first needs to be dechlorinared if using tap-water, use products sold at pet shops.  An aquarium needs to be cycling efficiently before it can support fish properly; bacteria that converts harmful nitrogenous waste (ammonia) into less harmfull stuff (nitrate) need to build up in the water, plants and substrate.  This bacteria may already be in the tank, but you can ensure it is by getting a plant, filter medium or substrate from a well established aquarium or buying commercialy products from your pet store.\nFirst you need to buy a few hardy fish, the number depending on the size of your tank. Platys and zebra danios are able to withstand a cycling tank and are ideal.\nThe fish will produce ammonia, this ammonia will build up and is very toxic, as levels of ammonia increase bacteria capable of converting ammonia into nitrite will build up. Nitrite is less deadly but levels of nitrite will increase until bacteria populations capable of converting nitrite into nitrate which is far less toxic ( you will still nedd to carry out weekly 10% water changes, using dechlorinated water, to ensure levels of nitrate don't get too high). After a number of weeks the tank will be able to cycle the waste of your fish from ammonia to nitrate, increase numbers of fish slowly, only 2-3 at a time.\nbuy test kits from your pet shop so you can monitor the various levels. \nBe patient, test your water, add few fish at a time and you'll soon have a healthy aquarium.

What do you guys think? [SEP] best_answer: Give it a little more time. Maybe he needs time to adjust, or he's afraid you're attracted to him. If you're not, you need to tell him. If you are and he's distancing himself because of that, well that's too bad but it happens all the time with heterosexuals too.

question_title: To all overweight Christians - I have a  question? [SEP] question_content: Before I start - please let me get it straight that I am in no way picking on anyones weight or appearance.  I understand that not all weight issues are from over eating.\n\nOk\n\nThe seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, are a classification of vices used in early Christian teachings to educate and protect followers from basic human instincts.\n\nOne of the 7 deadly sins is gluttony.\n\nIf you are overweight from practising gluttony (eating too much), then are you not going against the Christian teachings? [SEP] best_answer: I have fought sin for a long time, everyone does, no one is sinless. The fact is though, that your question/statement is a very sensitive subject for many, many people. I am one of those people who has fought my weight for a very long time, and I am not even 20 yet. Yes, self indulgence is a sin, but there is something that needs to be cleared up here. Most people, including myself, do not eat just to eat. It is something that is hard to beat. It is an addiction that controls you, when you want so badly to break away. Whether it is from deppression, stress, abusive relationships, or whatever, the addiction can creep into your life as a source of comfort from the world. \n\nGod is a loving god, and he is not going to send you to hell just for fighting the battle against your weight. We have to confess our sin and ask him for forgiveness, and not let ourselves be overwhelmed by the hurt or sadness that can drive us into weight gain. \n\nI am a Catholic Christian, and being very overweight is something I have to deal with daily. I am sure that there is someone around you, someone in your life that fights the battle against weight. There are people in every religion, every society who battles weight problems, though many other societies treat the people in question differently than western society does, our society often treating overweight people with contempt and scorn. \n\nPlease know this, God created us all with love, but our sin and hatred for one another has shoved a wedge between him and us. Overeating can be a sin, yes, but not always, and to suggest to others that they are sinners because they fight a emotional,mental,spiritual, and physical battle against weight is very hurtful to them.\n\nWould you honestly be able to go up to a dear family member that is overweight and tell them that they are sinful because of that? That would hurt anyone, if they admit it or not.	Society & Culture

question_title: Who is Gracchus? [SEP] question_content: Roman [SEP] best_answer: TIBERIUS AND GAIUS GRACCHUS  \n   \n \nFew figures in Roman history had the unforeseen historical impact of these two brothers, whose careers prefigured so much of what led to the fall of the Roman Republic. Proud sons of one of Rome’s first families, each ended his life in political murder and riot. In the 100 years following their fall, the Republic, beset by the forces they helped to unleash, let slip the dogs of repeated civil wars. Caesar’s career is unthinkable without them; Augustus built upon what the Gracchi began. It is easy to make such generalizations, but many books on their lives show the truth was far more complex and interesting. No one, however, denies that their history is important in the rolls of Roman events. As the Oxford Classical Dictionary states, their careers marked ”…the beginnings of ‘the Roman Revolution’: the introduction of murder into politics and the breakdown of concordia [the tradition of not pushing legal powers to extremes] on which the Republic was based.” Or as Velleius Paterculus wrote over a century later, speaking of Gaius (though also for Tiberius),\n\n \n  " He was for giving the citizenship to all Italians, extending it almost to the Alps, distributing the public domain, limiting the holdings of each citizen to five hundred acres, as had once been provided by the Licinian law, establishing new customs duties, filling the provinces with new colonies, transferring the judicial powers from the senate to the equites, and began the practice of distributing grain to the people. He left nothing undisturbed, nothing untouched, nothing unmolested, nothing, in short, as it had been. \n  \n Velleius Paterculus History of Rome, II, vi. 3-6  \n \n \n\nSons of a famous father (twice Consul and Censor) and a patrician mother, Cornelia (daughter of legendary war hero Scipio Africanus the Elder, who defeated Hannibal), Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his younger brother, Gaius, spanned the period of roughly 137 to 121 BC Significant problems existed in the middle and later decades of the second century. Rome had finally conquered and razed Carthage after nearly a century of repeated wars of conquest. It was now acquiring the territorial dominions that would lead to worldwide Empire. Yet the machinery of Roman administration, led by the patrician Senate and plebians, was increasingly ineffective dealing effectively with overseas dominions. For a century, small landowners had been taken repeatedly from their lands into Rome’s armies, to the decline and extinction of their farms. There was frequent agitation against the perceived inequality of the agrarian laws. Wealthy landowners bought up the farms, installing slaves in the place of the independent farmer. Landless, jobless, thousands drifted into Rome where they rotted and posed increasing threats to state stability. There was debt, corruption, and lack of an assured food supply for Rome. It was becoming increasingly hard to find enough citizen soldiers to man Rome’s enhanced armies. A growing frustration both among the lower classes, who felt disenfranchised, and the related Italian cities and regions, who sought and were denied full participation in Roman affairs, was creating deep-seated resentment and hardship. \n\n\nTIBERIUS SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS, C. 163-133 BC\n\nThe elder brother, Tiberius, had started his political career under his cousin, C. Scipio Aemilianus (adopted grandson of the famous Africanus). Later, when a quaestor in Spain, Tiberius used his connections to save the army by a treaty which, on motion of Scipio Aemilianus, the Senate refused to ratify. Bitterly disappointed, the young Gracchus joined the party opposing Scipio, including some of Rome’s most prominent Optimates (the equivalent of nobles in Roman politics, with consular backgrounds). Many in this party understood the need for reform; some cynically wished merely to oppose Scipio; some wished, surely, to use Tiberius for their own ends, as a sta	Society & Culture

question_title: Why do so many people take the Bible to be the ultimate word? [SEP] question_content: We know that it has been translated from Hebrew & Aramaic; things get lost in translation.  We know that various monarchs throughout time have removed various parts of the Bible - e.g. Constantine had all references to reincarnation taken out.  Why?  Because if people thought they had a 2nd chance, they wouldn't behave in this life.  We also know that it was written by a man - and ALL men are just that - men. So their translation of spiritual into material has to be flawed.  I hear people say... "well, in the Bible it states"...  I don't care that you were able to memorize the Bible - what do you think?  What do you feel?  What is your opinion?  There is as much spiritual gain to be found in a tree, a love letter or a hug as the Bible.  So why?  Can't we let people think for themselves? [SEP] best_answer: I agree with your statements. \n\nMost people like to believe everything others accept as truths - it is so much easier that way. Not everyone has the intellect or time or truth seeking characteristic in them to make them want to find out the absolute truth (if it exists!). \n\nHere are some other things I question:\n\n1) the book of Mark was the first recorded version of the synoptic gospels (the other books follow mark) - however, early versions (about 50 AD) ended at mark 16:8 and did not include anything about the resurrection.\n\n2) I suppose you are discussing the literary christians - have people really looked at the teachings of the gnostics? Their interpretation makes a lot more sense to me. Perhaps jesus was married to Mary Magdalene....and Saul/Paul was a woman hater....\n\n3) isn't it strange that Paul ursurped the new testament (his teachings take over from those of the apostles after the gospels)? Does this make sense to anyone else - if paul was the right person to expand the religion, why did Jesuah ben joseph (Jesus to most) not accept him as an apostle? Oversight?\n\n4) Popes through the ages have committed incesteous acts, organised murders, led crusades against Christian parties (Saracens were Christians), meddled in politics, made huge errors in scientific terms (earth is flat and all that)...and people still believe that they would not edit the bible to suit their own needs?\n\n5) Most of what Christians believe today were decided at the Council of Nicea (Apostle's creed, Holy Trinity etc etc) - does this make sense? A group of old men telling future generations what to believe rather than letting them make up their own minds?\n\n6) Everything is based on faith. If you wanted to buy a stereo but you could not try it (you have to pay upfront of course), would you do so? You have to rely on faith that it is good and it works....Does this make sense? Can faith be described as ignorance and acceptance of what people tell you without being able to find out the truth? if Thomas can ask questions, are we not allowed to do so as well or is he just an exception?\n\nWhat irks me most are the bible loving people who have not read and have not bothered to do more research on the basis of their beliefs and yet come around and preach to others. isn't it a case of "blind leading the blind", and perpetuating the infallibility of the bible?\n\nI remember a Jehovah Witness telling me that he believes the bible to be true so I should as well. I asked him if a madman genuinely believed he was Napolean Bonaparte, does it make him Napolean? Of course not, this is a subjective belief. Perhaps this is it: we will never find objective evidence to prove religion either way and can only decide subjectively if we want to believe. \n\nBTW, for every example of a scholar who converted to Christianity after doing research, there are also the opposite cases, where scholars have given up their beliefs due to their findings. To quote one or the other as irrefutable evidence of the truth/untruth is probably naive.\n\nHowever, in my search for the truth, I have not come across the indication that the First Holy Roman Emperor removed all references to reincarnation. I question this quote from you.... \n\nUltimately, I ask if the teachings have harmed humanity and I think that my answer is no. The teachings of the bible are in essence good but only intellectual flyweights would believe it wholeheartedly and as literal truth.	Society & Culture

Some "Christians" are now transitioning it to "Fall Festival" but it's the same thing/same night/same concept:  Dressing up in costumes and asking for Candy.\n\nIf my child threw all our eggs out into the yard on any day except Easter, I'd be mad...but it's a tradition.  If I was pinched any day except for St. Patrick's day, I'd be mad.  \n\nI have no problem with Halloween.  I know what's in my heart.	Society & Culture
question_title: What was Napa Valley, California, like before 1970? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It was much like it is now -- it was located in the same place, the mountains looked the same, the vineyards looked the same. There was less traffic and fewer tourists. The Skyline park and campsite hadn't been built yet, but the Smothers Brothers winery was in place. \nThe big difference was you could still afford to buy property there...	Society & Culture
question_title: You're at the dinner table. You have a cold...? [SEP] question_content: Are you supposed to get up from the dinner table and leave the room every time you have to blow your nose?  What about at a restaurant? [SEP] best_answer: To blow your nose -- yes.  To wipe your nose, not necessarily.\n\nIf your nose is absolutely crazy runny, most folks will forgive you if you keep a tissue close.  Just don't touch anyone else's food or utensils, and get up a couple times to blow your nose and wash your hands.  And... don't actually BLOW your nose while sitting at the table.\n\nColds suck.  Having a runny nose that just won't stop is a decent enough excuse to wipe it with a tissue at the dinner table.  Take a good decongestant and keep a few tissues in your pocket at the dinner table.  Hope for the best.  :-)	Society & Culture

question_title: Was the Holocaust in Rwanda predicted a decade earlier? [SEP] question_content: 25th Anniversary of Apparitions to Be Celebrated \n\nKIBEHO, Rwanda, NOV. 13, 2006 (Zenit.org).- The Diocese of Gikongoro has announced a Jubilee Year to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Blessed Virgin Mary's first apparition in Kibeho. \n\nKibeho, where the Marian apparitions began in 1981, is the goal of national and international pilgrimages. \n\nAccording to the visionaries, the Blessed Virgin introduced herself in the local language as "Nyina wa Jambo" -- Mother of the Word -- inviting to conversion, prayer and fasting. \n\nOn one occasion, she showed stark images: a river of blood, people killing one another, and abandoned corpses with no one to bury them. \n\nIn the following years the vision was linked to the genocide that convulsed Rwanda in 1994-1995. Kibeho was one of the bloodiest scenes of that tragedy. \n\nIn 2003, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, then prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, consecrated the Marian shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows in the site of the apparitions in Kibeho. He expressed the hope that Kibeho would become a place in which a Rwandan people would be born renewed in faith and forgiveness. \n\nThe apparitions began on Nov. 28, 1981, and ended on Nov. 28, 1989. "These two dates are considered an important historical reference for all who are anxious to know more about the apparitions and message of Kibeho," said a diocesan communiqué, signed by Father Eugene Dushimurukundo, chancellor. \n\nRecognition \n\nThe Catholic Church recognized these apparitions officially on June 29, 2001, after years of study by two commissions, one medical and the other theological, which were established by the local bishop. \n\nDeclared valid were the apparitions to three visionaries: Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka and Marie Claire Mukangango. \n\nIn a message last Sept. 8, Bishop Augustine Misago of Gikongoro announced that the celebrations for the 25th anniversary would begin on Nov. 28, feast of Our Lady of Kibeho. \n\nIn his message, Bishop Misago says that "to celebrate worthily the Jubilee Year we must make concrete acts in the light of the message of Kibeho." \n\nAmong them, he suggests: "praying during the year for all the intentions of the Pope; increasing participation at Mass and reception of Communion; receiving the sacrament of reconciliation." \n\nThe bishop also urges "striving for reconciliation with enemies; asking forgiveness of people we have offended; respecting others; being tolerant in the family, with neighbors, at work, in meetings and other social events." \n\nTo these gestures he adds "working with courage to promote truth and justice for all, particularly in present-day conditions of the Gacaca courts" -- peoples tribunals charged with judging persons accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide -- "which must be well managed to guarantee they do not become forums for injustice and revenge, covering the law." \n\nZE06111324 [SEP] best_answer: I don't know, but we are all to be blamed for having close our eyes and shut our mouth while tousands were slaugters.\nI'm only 19 y.o. but I feel guilty for this anyway. Even the United Nations didn't act in order to stop the genocide. We ought never to forget what happened.	Society & Culture
question_title: Can an Atheist act Christlike? [SEP] question_content: One of my brothers on here asked who is more christlike, or something to this affect,  the christian who uses profanity or the respectful atheist.\n\nI don't know that I agree with my brothers premise,  that an Atheist can act Christ-like.\n\nYour thoughts please?  I suppose first you must define Christlike. [SEP] best_answer: It all depends upon what standard you apply to "Christ likeness". For instance Christ was loving and compassionate and an Atheist can certainly demonstrate those qualities.\n\nBut if by being Christlike you mean a person who not only possesses qualities like the ones I already mentioned, but who also seeks to do the will of his Father in Heaven like Jesus always did, then the answer would be "No! An Atheist cannot be Christlike although anyone can certainly "act" Christlike".	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: when my friend talk in tamil it sounds cool but the letters are to curly [SEP] best_answer: I speak 7 different languages (of 7 different countries), including Tamil. It's not hard, when you put your mind to it. \n\nThe one advantage Tamil has over most Indian languages (that I myself find difficult to learn, only because I hadn't bothered), is you needn't cough your oesophagus out while trying to pronounce words (like in Hindi/ Urdu/ Arabic).\n\nYou'll get accustomed to the curly writings. Luckily, you have Tamil speaking friends whom you can listen and speak to at every given chance.	Society & Culture

What is Reform Judaism's take on a pregnant woman attending a Chrisitian (or any) funeral? [SEP] best_answer: I'm Jewish and there's nothing wrong with attending a funeral (despite what religion it maybe.)

question_title: Why don't the farmers just stop growing tobacco and start growing more corn? [SEP] question_content: Tobacco is a drug that is very bad for our health, and we need corn to make ethanol.  I've heard that we don't grow enough corn in the U.S to make enough ethanol, so this would solve all of our problems! [SEP] best_answer: Tobacco has been a part of some farming families for generations. It is just as difficult for a Farmer to stop growing his crops and start something new, as it would be for a brain surgion to switch to auto mechinics. The tools and skilled required are differant and very costly to change. You are correct, it is not healthy. And it would make a great source of fuel, but the real deal is obscured by many issues.

question_title: question about jesus....and please, read the details and THINK about it before you respond.? [SEP] question_content: what is so logical about god letting his son get killed? why not let him live, and encourage him to travel the whole world, spreading his teachings to those who would otherwise not hear 'em for hundreds of years? he obviously was good at getting people to listen to him, and i'm sure people back then were way more stubborn and hotheaded than today. so why not let him keep working? send him all over, help him get across oceans, maybe bring some disciples along with him. wouldn't that be more helpful? and if he HAS to die like that, wouldn't it be even more powerful of a statement if he already had followers everywhere? also, people from other, distant lands would be more willing to believe in his miricles if they had actually SEEN some of them, and not just been told about them hundreds of years later. if jesus had visited the americas somehow, those people would have told stories passed down through generations. (i'm aware that america was unknown to them, but surely not to god?) [SEP] best_answer: jesus deserved to di3!! if i was around back then i woulda f*ckin killed him myself the dirty jewish b*stard. and i would laughed and pointed while he was hangin there on the cross and i would threw stones and p00p at him and whipped him until he finally d!ed.

question_title: Why is it always the woman that has to wear something sexy and dress up? What about the man? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It originates with objectification.

If so Why? [SEP] best_answer: I guess everyone has there own limits as to how far they will go to commit sin of there beliefs and to double that if they grew up in an Islamic household it was also put in there heads from birth that this is a no no,but if you continue to play around with you faith eventually nothing is forbidden to you.The Jews used to be the same and now I know many many Jews who now eat pork.
