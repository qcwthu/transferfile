question_title: what is a conjugated bridge? [SEP] question_content: part of the body [SEP] best_answer: A hfr cell (also called hfr strain) is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid (often F) integrated into its genomic DNA. Hfr is the abbreviation for high frequency recombination, which was first characterized by Luca Cavalli-Sforza. Unlike a normal F+ cell, hfr strains will, upon conjugation with a F- cell, attempt to transfer their entire DNA through the mating bridges (called pili) to the F- cell. This occurs because the F factor has integrated itself via an insertion point in the bacterial chromosome. Due to the F factor's inherent nature to transfer itself over the pilus during bacteria conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it, thus making such cells very useful and interesting in terms of studying gene linkage and recombination.\n\nA structure as fragile as a mating bridge will, however, likely break, and so the transfer is rarely complete. Thus, the F- cell uses only part of the genomic DNA of the Hfr cell for recombination. Though there is some debate on the issue, the pili themselves do not seem to be the structures through which the actual exchange of DNA takes place; rather, some proteins seem to open a channel between the bacteria.\n\nIt should also be noted that the bacterial genome's rate of transfer through the pilus is constant; this allows molecular biologists and geneticists to use Hfr strain of bacteria (often E. Coli) to study genetic linkage and map the chromosome. The procedure commonly used for this is called interrupted mating.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: if an anchor is dropped from a boat into a lake, will the water level of the lake rise or fall? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Say the anchor weighs 15 pounds in air and displaces 2 pounds of water.\nBefore the drop, the boat displaces its weight plus the 15 lb weight in air of the anchor. This is the maximum displacement situation, so the water is at maximum height.\nAfter the drop, if the anchor hits bottom, the boat displaces its weight only and the anchor displaces 2 lb of water, the minimum displacement situation, so the water is at minimum height.\nAfter the drop, if the anchor doesn't reach the bottom, the boat displaces its weight plus the 13 lb weight in water of the anchor. The anchor displaces 2 lb water. The total displacement is the same as the maximum displacement situation, so the water is at maximum height.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: Leonid meteor shower....... Anyone in Santa Barbara, CA??? [SEP] question_content: what would be the place to see it from, what time? which way do i look?? i don't want to miss it this year so just wondering if anyone can tell me where to look and stuff... [SEP] best_answer: Anyplace not cloudy and that does not have too many bright lights will do. Just look anywhere in the sky. The meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Look after midnight though, because the radiant won't rise until then. The later at night you look, the better. 4:00 AM would be the best time to look.\n\nThe predictions are not that good this year. A few years ago I saw 50 bright ones per hour. This year they are predicting 10 or 15 per hour, and maybe not bright ones either. Also, the peak time is before the radiant rises in the US, so Europe will see the best show. If the predictions are correct.	Science & Mathematics
question_title: can we trap light after the source of which is turned off so that we can open the trap and see the light in it [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Say you shine a flashlight into a mirror. Then put a mirror behind the flashlight and remove the flashlight. Given that the 2 mirrors are exactly parallel, will the light just bounce back and forth forever? No - the light travels in waves and each time it reflects back, some of the light is not hitting the mirror exactly at 90 degrees and is reflected off on an angle. The light will reflect away and eventually dissipate completely. \nIf you try to trap light in a box, as it bounces off the walls inside, it will dissipate into energy (heat). The temperature of the inside of the box will raise - but just infintestimly so.\nRemember all of this will take place at the speed of light.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What causes the movement of wind? [SEP] question_content: And what causes it to come to an end? [SEP] best_answer: Wind is the roughly horizontal movement of air (as opposed to an air current) caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It occurs at all scales, from local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting tens of minutes to global winds resulting from solar heating of the Earth. The two major influences on the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect).\n\nGiven a difference in barometric pressure between two air masses, a wind will arise between the two which tends to flow from the area of high pressure to the area of low pressure until the two air masses are at the same pressure, although these flows will be modified by the Coriolis effect in the extratropics.\n\nWinds can be classified either by their scale, the kinds of forces which cause them (according to the atmospheric equations of motion), or the geographic regions in which they exist. There are global winds, such as the wind belts which exist between the atmospheric circulation cells. There are upper-level winds, such as the jet streams. There are synoptic-scale winds that result from pressure differences in surface air masses in the middle latitudes, and there are winds that come about as a consequence of geographic features such as the sea breeze. Mesoscale winds are those which act on a local scale, such as gust fronts. At the smallest scale are the microscale winds which blow on a scale of only tens to hundreds of metres and are essentially unpredictable, such as dust devils and microbursts.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below...

question_title: How does battery-charging without physical contact work? [SEP] question_content: I thought that you need a physical contact between the charger and the battery so the electricity actually arrives inside the battery.\nNow my new electrical toothbrush seems to work differently. It has a battery, the manual confirms. It also has a charger. But all I need to do is to put the toothbrush on the charger.\n\nHow does that work? Both parts are plastic covered. [SEP] best_answer: Its using induction charge principle. Essentially the primary coil side of the transformer is built into the base and the secondary coil is built into the toothbrush. \n\nThe primary winding of the inductive charger transmits charging power to the secondary winding, inside the target device, without making direct electrical or mechanical contact with it. In the target device, power is received with a coil and then rectified by a diode. This DC voltage is used in charging the battery of the device.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: what is big bang? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In physical cosmology, the Big Bang is the scientific theory that the universe emerged from an enormously dense and hot state about 13.7 billion years ago. The Big Bang theory is based on the observed Hubble's law redshift of distant galaxies that when taken together with the cosmological principle indicate that space is expanding according to the Friedmann-Lemaître model of general relativity. Extrapolated into the past, these observations show that the universe has expanded from a state in which all the matter and energy in the universe was at an immense temperature and density. Physicists do not widely agree on what happened before this, although general relativity predicts a gravitational singularity (for reporting on some of the more notable speculation on this issue, see cosmogony).\n\nThe term Big Bang is used both in a narrow sense to refer to a point in time when the observed expansion of the universe (Hubble's law) began — calculated to be 13.7 billion (1.37 × 1010) years ago (±2%) — and in a more general sense to refer to the prevailing cosmological paradigm explaining the origin and expansion of the universe, as well as the composition of primordial matter through nucleosynthesis as predicted by the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory [1].\n\nOne consequence of the Big Bang is that the conditions of today's universe are different from the conditions in the past or in the future (natural evolution of universe constantly takes place). From this model, George Gamow in 1948 was able to predict, at least qualitatively, the existence of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) [2]. The CMB was discovered in the 1960s and further validated the Big Bang theory over its chief rival, the steady state theory.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: What happens to the body when somebody has taken an lethal overdose? [SEP] question_content: Could it be the brain shuts down first or the other organs start to fail continusoly?  If a postmorten came out with the lungs undefected, how come they didnt get affected? [SEP] best_answer: It sounds like you have a particular scenario in mind, so here goes...\n\nPeople who use street drugs develop a tolerance to them, so they need bigger and bigger doses to "get high." Sometimes they increase the dose too much and overdose. Another problem is purity. Average street drugs are only about 50% the actual drug, and 50% filler to increase the dealer's profit margin(although heroin has gotten much more pure recently...). When an addict gets drugs from a different supplier, he might get a different concentration than what he's used to and unintentionally overdose.\n\nCocaine and amphetamines ("meth") are stimulants. An OD on them can cause a heart attack, where the heart stops beating, blood flow to the brain stops, and the person dies. It would not cause any obvious lung damage.\n\nMost other drugs of abuse--opiates (heroin, oxycodone, vicodin, demerol etc.), alcohol, GHB, benzodiazepines (xanax, valium, clonapin) slow down the rate and/or depth of your breathing so you go to sleep and stop breathing. This causes lack of oxygen in the blood, and this causes brain damage leading to death.\n\nNeither of these paths will cause any visible damage to the lungs.  Most of the damage is at the cellular level, so to the naked eye, the organs look normal.	Science & Mathematics

question_title: Base triplet on T-RNA recognizing complementary base triplet on M-RNA? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: t-RNA or transfer RNA consists of short RNA coupled to specific amino acids.  mRNA is translated into protein in ribozomes, via pairing with tRNA.  The pairing takes the form of a three letter code called a codon.  The pairing bases occur on the tRNA in the stem-loop structure.  The pairing is complementary, A with U, C with G.  However, the third position of the anti-codon on the tRNA is called the wobble position because an unusual nucleotide, inosine, can be found in some tRNAs.  This nucleotide can bind to A, U, or C. This leads to a single tRNA with a single amino acid being able to recognize and bind different codons.  Evolutionarily, it means that mutations in the coding sequence of DNA will not necessarily cause a change in the protein, depending on if the mutation is a point mutation of a wobble position.

question_title: how do classification systems help us to think about and study diversity on earth? [SEP] question_content: lots of detail please [SEP] best_answer: Taxonomic classification systems are useful for a couple of significant reasons.  First and foremost, it creates a name for each living organism that ALL scientists can agree upon.  Therefore, biologists on opposite sides of the world can be confident that they are discussing the same organism when looking at the taxonomic label of that organism.  Secondly, the design of the system is useful for showing evolutionary relationships among organisms.  Generically, the breakdown is kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.  There are five kingdoms (six in some systems) and millions upon millions of species.  For any two organisms, they are more closely related evolutionarily if they share a classification more toward the species.  For example, two organisms that share a genus are more closely related than two other organisms that only share a family.  You should know that there modifications of the above system so that you get things like subphyla, superfamilies, etc.  The genus and species names are GENeral and SPECIfic for a particular organism and are always written in italics, with the genus name being capitalized and the species name beginning with a lower-case letter.  The millions of species described by the system is a testimony to the great biodiversity of life on this planet.	Science & Mathematics

[SEP] question_content: Premature atrial and ventricular contractions are considered harmless by the 3 doctors and 2 cardiologists I've seen, but what a pain in the ass!  Those of you who are as unfortunate as me to actually feel every single one of them, how do you cope?  I can't sleep, and then being tired makes them worse.  I take atenolol, but it doesn't seem to do much.  Does anyone have any favorite medicine to control them or sleep through them? [SEP] best_answer: Those doctors aren't very helpful sometimes, are they?  (  :\n\nYou're certainly not alone.  If it's serious enough that you can't sleep, then that in itself can be a real problem.  There are medications that MIGHT help, such as beta blockers (like propranolol and metoprolol), but these all have a bunch of other effects which it would be better to avoid if you can.\n\nSo you might want to try some lifestyle changes.  Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exercise can all be triggers that increase the frequency of your arrythmias.  Unfortunately, so can stress - so worrying about whether you can get to sleep will unfortunately only make it harder to get to sleep!\n\nDeep breathing will help you relax, and some people report that magnesium, calcium, and fish oil supplements can help too.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.

[SEP] best_answer: 1. He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses. He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.\n\n2. Yes. He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.\n\n3. Beat a dead horse (actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled. For example, if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind, then to keep asking can be described as  - Beating (Flogging) a dead horse. In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer. But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses :-)\n\nThe expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse (to make it work harder) if it is dead!!

question_title: henry hudson's fourth voyage? [SEP] question_content: Wat did he do on his fourth voyage help me plz. [SEP] best_answer: Henry Hudson's Fourth Voyage\n1610: The Northwest Passage\n\nMore info at link below:\n\n    Henry Hudson managed to get support from English backers for another voyage, this time in search of a Northwest Passage, one he had wanted to pursue almost since the start of his voyages. The main sponsor this time was Sir Thomas Smythe - governor and treasurer of the Virginia Company, and also of the English East India Company. Smythe desperately needed to recoup his losses after a disaster that saw his last fleet to Virginia scattered, with hundreds of men lost. He may not have paid Hudson for his services - rather, it may have been Hudson's payment for Smythe getting Hudson out of house arrest. \n\nThe voyage started inauspiciously with a company man put off the ship and a another man brought aboard - Henry Greene, a gambler who would prove a partner in trouble with Juet. Almost from the start there was trouble with the crew. Hudson's ability to manage his crew appears even weaker than in previous voyages. There were fights and almost a mutiny within the first few months, before they even reached the area Hudson intended to explore.\n\nDiscovery ended up sailing through the treacherous Arctic waters north of modern Quebec - the Furious Overfall - known today as Hudson's Strait although he did not discover it - and into a large body of water now known as Hudson Bay.\n\nBy the fall of the year the crew was stuck hundreds of miles south, unable to go further or to get home. They had to endure a harsh winter in that hostile land, during which one crewman died and most others were sickened by scurvy or lack of food. Again, Hudson's showed his inability to deal with the natives and his own crew during the cold months they spent ashore.\n\nBy late next spring, the ship was ready to sail again. Hudson wanted to continue his explorations, but the crew only wanted to head home. Fights broke out over food and Hudson accused some crew members of hoarding. They in turn accused him of the same. Eventually a large number of crew members, led by Juet and Greene, decided to mutiny. They put the captain, his son and others they didn't like into a small shallop and set it adrift while the Discovery sailed away. None of the abandoned crew were ever seen again.

If u want to get admission in TOP scholls what is the requirement of TOEFL score [SEP] best_answer: TOEFL Score Interpretation\n\nD.W. McKeon, Director, ESL & GTA Training Programs \n\nExecutive Summary \nI. Introduction\nII. Overall Scores and Subscores \nIII. Other Factors Affecting TOEFL Scores \nIV. The Old GRE Verbal Section and the TOEFL \nV. The New GRE Analytical Writing Section and the TOEFL \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language, TOEFL, developed in the early 1960’s, has become the main instrument of measuring English language proficiency for international students around the world. A total score (range of 310-677) was determined based on the scores of three subsections: Listening, Structure, and Reading; (note: an optional essay was administered at every other international testing date, the Test of Written English, TWE, with a score range of 0 to 6). \n\nIn the late 1990’s, the TOEFL Board produced a computer-based test (CBT; range: 40 to 300. Other than the supposed ease of electronic test-taking, the CBT TOEFL made a few notable improvements on the paper-based test (PBT); to mention two: (1) it includes linear testing (from easy to difficult) and computer-adaptive testing (tailoring to the proficiency level of the individual test-taker); and (2) it includes a compulsory essay, whose score is factored into the Structure section and is reported in a separate Essay Section, equivalent to the former TWE. A Concordance Table was published in 1998, providing equivalences between the familiar PBT scores and the new CBT ones. Since the CBT is not administered at every site where the PBT was, the PBT continues to be used in various parts of the world. \n\nGraduate School admissions committees have generally used a 550 (=213 CBT) cutoff score, but often without consideration of the total profile of subscores. In light of their near magical aura to the aggregate TOEFL scores, below are some recommendations on the use of TOEFL (either form) for admissions committees:\n\nRegardless of the total score, subscores must be taken into consideration \nListening subscores should not be below 50/16, regardless of the total, aggregate score \nEssay Writing subscores should not be below 4.0 (same rating as TWE scores) \nSince neither PBT nor CBT TOEFL versions measure one’s speaking ability, admissions committees considering offering teaching assistants with teaching duties should not use TOEFL scores alone in such decisions (certainly Listening scores should be a factor) \nThe number of times (and length of intervals) a prospective student has taken the TOEFL should be considered as a factor (read, test-wiseness as an issue) \nDate of last administration and activity in using English since then should be factored in the decision to accept an applicant or not \nFinally, TOEFL scores have never meant to be predictors of academic success. \nReturn to top \nI. Introduction\n\nHaving been developed in the mid 1960’s, the TOEFL has become the major standard of measuring proficiency in English as a second language throughout the world . Because of its widespread use in determining admissions into colleges and universities, TOEFL scores have taken on a sort of magical aura to them. One rather unfortunate consequence is the emergence of innumerable TOEFL preparation courses—not to mention TOEFL preparation centers—throughout the world: the tail is indeed wagging the dog. Even more unfortunate is the temptation to view one’s TOEFL scores as an indicator of general intelligence or as a predictor of academic success, despite the TOEFL Board’s insistence to the contrary. \n\nAlthough the TOEFL Board introduced a computer-based version in 1997 to replace paper-based testing, the latter is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Thus, in general, TOEFL scores in the 310-677 range (paper-based test) are still more familiar than those in the 40-300 range (computer-based test).\n\nLike the paper-based test (PBT), the c	Education & Reference

question_title: ♥What do u mostly do and learn in college? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In my humble opinion (and experience), an undergraduate college education is largely the process of training oneself to take the time to retain knowledge.  That's the point of the introductory classes in the first couple years.  They prepare you for the more in-depth major classes and perhaps research in the later years.  Ideally, it's more of training someone in how to learn more than teaching them facts.  \n\nAs far as what you do in college, it's usually a crazy balance f diverse things.  Time for classes, studying (hopefully), extra-curricular involvement, and a social life is hard to manage, but to be a job-attractive graduate, they are all necessary.	Education & Reference
question_title: understanding imagery in poetry? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Using imagery is appealing to 1 (or more) of the 5 senses.  For example:  If I give you the sentence "John is strong", you have an image in your head.  If however, I say "John is as strong as an ox" you have a much more vivid image in your mind because of the comparison that is made.  This is an example of visual imagery but often authors try to appeal to other senses for more effective writing.	Education & Reference

[SEP] best_answer: Everybody is different. People have told me that I wont grow any taller when I was 19 (I was 5'2") Especially since I was girl because girls stop growing at a younger age. But now Im 21 and I grew to 5'5 1/2. I had another growth spurt at around age 20 and grew three inches in one year. Especially after I started eating calcum chews.\n\nI think the key is to take advantage of your growth spurts. Eat more vitamins and calcium supplements. Also since I sleept on a firmer bed I lengthened my back. After a few years of sleeping like this I think It helped out alot.\n\nAnd being as young as you are, your testosterone has yet to kick into full gear! Be paitient and good luck!

[SEP] question_content: so junior prom is coming up right, and there's boy that i liked. my cousin had asked him if he wanted to take me to prom he said yes and we both agreed that we would go as friends. then the same night that my cousin asked him, we were hanging out in our development, and all of a sudden he just kisses me, tounge and everything, then he tells me that even though i did that, i am not looking for a relationship, i said neither am i. so two days after this happened, he haventh said a word to me and he seem to be ignoring me. what do you think happened? and to add he is white and i am black and we live in pennsylvania [SEP] best_answer: Two possibilities: \n- he wants to have the benefits but not the responsibility. Perhaps he was just letting you know how he'd like your friendship to be. You know, fooling around but not committing.\n- in reality, he wants to have a relationship with you, but is afraid to ask or is afraid that you would not be down with it. So by saying he doesn't want to committ, he was testing the waters to see how you thought about this. \n\nMy personal guess is that the first option is more like it. He's a guy, and guys like to think of themselves as players. Unless you have no problem with being casual friends with benefits, then no prob. But if it disturbs you that he wants the goods but not you, then you're better off with someone who wants the whole package.\n\nIn any case, make sure he still wants to go to prom with you. He sounds a bit like a jerk (sorry, but he's ignoring you!). Make sure that YOU have a date!	Family & Relationships

But this year, the tension between us seemed to pull our group of friends apart, so we decided to try to be friends.\nThe problem is, he seems to expect me to put in all the effort to be nice and friendly, only responding once i've made the first move.\nWe have our ups and downs, but i can't take it anymore. So now, i've made it clear that i'm not going to try so hard unless he decides to be a man and put in some effort. \nShould I:\n(1) wait for him to come around,\n(2) go back to putting in all the effort,\n(3) just give up on him?? [SEP] best_answer: option 3. he wasn't much of a friend before, and now that you have relationship baggage and nothing strong platonically to bind you from before, there is no friendship to revive here. too much complication and effort on your part. let him go and make different friends, see different guys, be free!!

We had long conversations and made love 3 times in a week, where as it had been almost a year since the last time. I feel like he's really not interested in me. Not emotionally, sexually nothing.... I don't want to leave him but I'm not getting any younger. I'm 46 now and I want some romance and love in my life, and yes, sex would be nice also. Someone please talk to me. He wont and I just don't know what to do anymore. [SEP] best_answer: If you're miserable in your marriage and you have tried unsuccessfully to work things out with your husband then there is only one thing you can do--SHOW HIM THE DOOR.  Trust me...I was in a dead-end marriage and was totally miserable.  The only reason I stayed in the marriage as long as I did was for the kids. But now I look back at it and realize that I should have left him long before we even got married, because there were signs there that things weren't going to be right.\n\nSo many times us women think if we just stick things out things will change, or even we can change the man.  But sadly that doesn't happen, and for you to stay in a marriage\nwhere you feel alone is only going to hurt you.  Life is short--you deserve to be happy and feel loved and like you have a partner in your relationship.\n\nRegarding your previous split with your husband, it sounds like he was almost over-doing it in fear of losing you.  It shouldn't take the fear of losing you to make him treat you like his wife.  Cut him loose, and when he comes a wooing tell him "Sorry, you had your chance."  Then get out there and find you a good man.  You'll be glad you did.	Family & Relationships

[SEP] best_answer: Hey! I understand how you must be feeling. It is better to talk to him openly with out pushing him at all. While talking to him make sure that you are giving him enough space to answer your questions. Dont ask him any close ended questions. Ask him only open end questions. I feel he must be very busy with his bussiness since it is new, he needs to pay more attension to his bussiness to grow. Generally boys are very less in talking and showing feelings. it doesnt mean that they are not sensitive. So dont jump in to conclusion and be open to him and dont try to control him or try not to doubt him too. give him time. I wish you good luck. God be with you.	Family & Relationships

I really like her, but I can't stand this anymore.

Are you girls hang out with other guys a lot when you actually have boyfriends too? [SEP] best_answer: I guess she feels good that way. Isn't it so?

question_title: my husband is NOT gay but likes it in the butt why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The organ involved in male ejaculation is the prostrate, which can be stimulated by anal play for men (about four inches in, curve towards his front, but use *lots* of lube!). It develops from the same cells which, in a female foetus, develop into the G-spot, we think.\n\nBeing open to this does *not* make a man gay, and not all gay men enjoy anal play or penetration. There are many nerve endings around the anus and, if people are open-minded enough to try, then they can find play there very enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to indulge him, try playing after he's showered, with plenty of lube, gentle at first, and see if you get into it. Some women do. The good sex sites (Good Vibrations, Scarlet Letters and Toys in Babeland for example) will have information if you want it.	Family & Relationships

question_title: What should I do about my 'mother'? [SEP] question_content: My adoptive mother has always had a problem with me. She abused me as a child, and even though I tried to forgive her for it over the years, she has continuously hurt me. She feels that I cannot be happy. She has tried to make me leave the man of my dreams, and when I sent her some ultrasound pictures of our son, she refused everything at the post office. Neither of us have spoken to her since, but what should I do? Should I leave things alone knowing that I'd probably be better off without her, or should I take yet another step to trying to include her in my life? [SEP] best_answer: How sad for you. You need to ask yourself if you and your unborn children are better off without her. If she doesn't show you any love or compassion, then she certainly won't show your children any, which will only hurt you more in the long run. Have you tried calling her and asking her why she would miss the opportunity to be in her grandchildrens lives? If she still refuses to talk to you, chalk it up to God's work and move on without her. What does your Dad have to say about all this? Maybe he could be your "rock" when it comes to dealing with Mom.\nGood Luck and remember you still have your Mother in Law to lean on and show you some support......I know because your story is the same as my daughter in laws and I love her as if she was my own.

question_title: Is it possible to think that you are divorced and then find out you really aren't? [SEP] question_content: My boyfriend said he was divorced.  Years ago, he had gone to a paralegal and had most of the divorce paper work completed. (I have seen the papers and his child custody agreement.) I found out he was still legally married.  He told me that he looked into it and that he really wasn't divorced because the paralegal didn't file the papers with the judge.  Is this possible?  Is a person stupid to not know if they are divorced or not?  Am I stupid for even wondering? [SEP] best_answer: It's possible, but unlikely.  He is not divorced til those papers are signed, sealed and delivered.  He's been lazy in finding out.  If he has no paperwork, he doesn't care whether he's divorced or not.  Or, he's just lazy.  If he's truly serious about you, he should make sure his divorce is final.  If you have to drive him to the courthouse yourself.\nI was not in a hurry to get the paperwork done, until I knew I was ready to remarry.  Well, that time came and I went to the nearest paralegal and had them get it done in time.  To make sure, I filed them myself.\n\nI hope everything works out for you.	Family & Relationships
question_title: Why do females like to flirt? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: it just pings off all the right hormones, it's (supposed to be) clever and funny conversation, that anyone can get into with anyone else because you chat about common things, and express common sentimentl. it's about paying people compliments and getting them back, enjoying someone's company and showing that you do! \n\nYou excercise your powers of observation, everything doesn't have to be true, flirting isn't supposed to make people feel bad, just happy, attractive and appreciated...\n\nanybody would love that! I just wish more people would go there.	Family & Relationships

question_title: what is love? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: According to Robert Sternberg's research, "Love" is an emotion consisting of three components: intimacy, passion & committment.\n\nIntimacy, the feeling close and connected to someone (developed through sharing and very good communications over time). Intimacy is what makes you want to share and offer emotional and material support to each other.\n-Intimacy alone is Liking (true friendship without passion or long-term commitment)\n\n\nPassion, the feeling physically aroused and attracted to someone. Passion is what makes you feel "in love" and is the feeling most associated with love. It also rises quickly and strongly influences and biases your judgment.\n-Passion alone is Infatuation (passionate, obsessive love at first sight without intimacy or commitment)\n\nCommitment, pledging to your self and each other to strengthen the feelings of love and to actively maintain the relationship. Commitment is what makes you want to be serious, have a serious relationship and promise to be there for the other person if things get tough.\n-Commitment alone is Empty Love (decision to love another without intimacy or passion)\n\nRomantic Love: Intimacy & Passion, no Commitment\n-Lovers physically and emotionally attracted to each other but without commitment\n-“As in a summer romance”\n\nCompanionate Love: Intimacy & Commitment, but no Passion\n-Long-term committed friendships or a marriage in which the passion has faded\n-I love you but I’m not IN love with you\n\nFatuous Love: Passion & Commitment, but no Intimacy\n-Commitment based on passion with without time for intimacy to develop\n-Shallow relationship such as a whirlwind courtship\n\nConsummate Love: A complete love consisting of all three components	Family & Relationships

question_title: Scooby Doo? [SEP] question_content: When I was a kid I watched this episode of "The 13 ghosts of Scooby Doo." In it an evil wizard wanted Daphne (the hot red head) to be his bride so he trapped her in this glass case and cast a spell on her to put her to sleep. While she slept he hypnotized her to want to marry him. When I was a kid I found this very cool...but as I got older the idea turned me on more and more. Does anyone here share that fantasy, hypnotizing someone to sleep or putting them to sleep and then up them awakaning seducinng them? Any females or males share this fantasy? Holla. [SEP] best_answer: no. but i do love scooby doo!	Family & Relationships
question_title: How do you manage a job, kids, and keeping the house clean?  Any methods? [SEP] question_content: I have 3 kids, 2,4,10, and work part time.  My house is a disorganized mess!  I try so hard, but I can't seem to keep it clean.  And forget making dinner.  I don't have the energy during the day!  Anyone out there in my situation with a clean house- How?  HELP!! [SEP] best_answer: My apologies. If you wanted a magic elixer to do it all, there isn't any.\n\nThe only tools available to you is discipline, get your 10 yr old to do some housework for pocket money and use your freezer to store some ready meals to pull out, nuke and put on the table.\n\nTidying up is about something that is always happening with kids. Look at what the kids play with and how and work out if a container can be used to improve tidying. For example my sons use two large containers for their Lego and soldiers and scenes. This then puts the responsibility on my boys to put there toys back in the boxes when ever it's needed. Tidying is something that should be done in a "bit here, bit there" as this is far more efficient and better appearance than leaving things and then have a large mess to clean.\n\nCleaning needs another method of "divide and conquer". Divide your house up into areas that then are completed at certain times during your week with areas like the kitchen bench completed at the begining of a cleaning session. Get yourself some labour saving devices as well to speed things up. We have 14 clothes backets, 2 or 3 spares in the laundry ready to go. One maybe for the top of the clothes hamper to stop clothes overflowing. One maybe two beside the washing machine for when washing day arrives. Clothes come off the clothes line then the folding, ironing, putting away might be a little while so their stacked and stored. Even when they are given to the kids to put away, if the kids forget or your not on top of it you limit the mess. Even putting big toys in them in the kids rooms.\n\nA dinner ready to go is about cooking your food at a time when things are easy. Examples are cooking the sauce of Spagetti Bolonaise then cool and freezing it. Buy angel hair spagetti which cooks the quickest and drag out the sauce, put it through the microwave ta-dah. There are lots of these and if you have a Croc-Pot you can load it with meat and vegies in the morning and serve with bread rolls at dinner. The very nice people in the recipe answer forum could roll out some for you as well.\n\nAs for you not having energy, would that mean your continually tired, go and see your doc about it and make sure about plenty of sleep, food and a multivitamin.\n\nHope this helps.

Now I'm not saying they're homosexual, but they are go for men and kind of at a yellow light for other girls. Don't be too black or white with this.  There's an assload of gray in between.

question_title: White minority? [SEP] question_content: Is it possible for a white person to be considered a minority? lets say a white person lives in an all black neighborhood (like the south side of chicago) and they never see anyone else but black people. would they be considered a minority? Has anyone ever been considered a minority like this? [SEP] best_answer: Sure, white people can be considered a minority; it just depends on the scale you're looking at.  If you're talking about the United States, you will never hear white people referred to as a minority category, even though I think I recently heard they have fallen below 50% of the population; it's just that no other ethnic group has a greater percentage.  But if you're looking at a neighborhood, or even a city or state, it is quite possible for white people to be the minority.  I'm white, and I used to live in Harlem, so I was definitely a minority.  I got called "whitey" quite often... but then maybe I asked for it, as I was training for long-distance road races at the time, running through Harlem in really short shorts and no shirt!  Anyway, I think it's a valuable experience for everyone to be put in the position of being a visible minority at least once in their life.	Society & Culture

question_title: man date women but has serious secret interest exclusively in men who are women from waist up? [SEP] question_content: and who wear make-up etc - is he really interested in men, and too afraid to come out of the closet or what? [SEP] best_answer: That is a tricky question.  But I have met people who have interests in crossdressers, transexuals, and women, but not in men.\n\nIt seems that in these situations, the men have a great attraction to women, but also have an attraction to the penis.  However, they feel no attraction to average men.  In this case, the person has to find people who are similar enough to women to clearly not be men, but who also have a penis.	Society & Culture

Never, never, never!"  :-))\n\nBut That Which Is always...IS. Throughout the day, my heart rises spontaneously in thanksgiving and gratitude, for my luck (Oh! No, no, no! That is ANOTHER question!)  :-)) For what I have been given, for all that I have, for the very good people who love me, for the incredible, sustaining beauty of the natural world.\n\nSometimes I am not sure to Whom I am praying, but my heart rises, anyway!\n\nThe only serious (the save-my-butt stuff isn't really serious, in my opinion) prayers I say are to ask for knowledge of God's will, and the power to carry it out.\n\nSometimes I toss in a request for strength, and understanding.

They were just shacking up and had alot of illegitimate kids...but seriously...read the following article.\n\nThe following is an Article published six or seven years ago in Green Egg.\n\n*We Are the Other People*\n\nby Oberon (Otter) Zell\n\n"Ding-dong!" goes the doorbell. Is it Avon calling? Or perhaps Ed McMahon with my three million dollars? No, it's Yahweh's Witlesses again, just wanting to have a nice little chat about the Bible... Boy, did they ever come to the wrong house! So we invite them in: "Enter freely and of your own will..." (Hey, it's Sunday morning, nothing much going on, why not have a little entertainment?) Diane and I amuse ourselves watching their expressions as they check out the living room: great horned owl on the back of my chair; ceremonial masks and medicine skulls of dragons and unicorns on the wall; crystals, wands, staffs, swords; lots of Goddess figures and several altars; boa constrictors draped in amorous embrace over the elkhorn; white doves sitting in the hanging planters; cats and weasels underfoot; iron dragon snorting steam atop the wood stove; posters and paintings of wizards and dinosaurs and witchy women, some proudly naked; sculptures of mythological beasties and lots more dinosaurs; warp six on the star-filled viewscreen of my computer; a five-foot model of the USS Enterprise and the skeleton of a plesiosaur hanging from the ceiling; very, very many books, most of them dealing with obviously weird subjects... To say nothing of the great horned owl perched on the back of my chair and the Unicorn grazing in the front yard. You know; early Addams Family decor. And then, of course, it being late in the morning, you can expect Morning Glory to come wandering out naked, looking for her wake-up cup of tea. Morning Glory naked is a truly impressive sight, and the Witlesses look as if she'd set titties on stun as they stand immobilised, hands clasped over their genitals. With the stage set and all the actors in place, the show is ready to begin.\n\nTheir mission, of course, is to save our heathen souls by turning us on to "The Word of the Lord"- their Bible. I guess they figure some of us just haven't heard about it yet, and we're all eagerly awaiting their joyous tidings of personal salvation through giving our rational faculties to Jesus. Every time they come around, I look forward to trying out a new riposte. Sure, it may be cruel and sadistic of me, but hey, I didn't call them up and ask them to come over; they entered at their own risk! This time should be pretty good. After letting them run off their basic rap while lovely Morning Glory serves us all hot herb tea, I innocently remark: "But none of that applies to us. We have no need for salvation because we don't have original sin. We are the Other People."\n\n"Hunh? What?" they reply eloquently. It's clear they've never heard this one before. "\n\nRight," I say. "It's all in your Bible." And I proceed to tell them the story, using their own book for reference: (Genesis 1:26) The [Elohim] said, "Let us make humanity in our own image, in the likeness of ourselves, and let them be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all the wild beasts and all the reptiles that crawl upon the earth." Elohim is a plural word, including male and female, and should properly be translated "Gods" or "Pantheon." (1: 27) The Gods created humanity in the image of themselves, In the image of the Gods they created them, Male and female they created them. (1:28) The Gods blessed them, saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and conquer it. Be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven and all living animals on the earth."\n\nNow clearly, here we are talking about the original creation of the human species: male and female. All the animals, plants, etc. hav	Society & Culture

So complex that  scientists cannot fully understand everything about it.

I will never understand how a person can say that there is NO evidence of God.  I mean come on... Are you blind?  LOL  To be an atheists you would have to believe that time, matter, space and energy just came from nothing....  I would rather believe that God created everything.  So much more logical than NOTHING created SOMETHING.  I don't have enough faith to be an athiest. [SEP] best_answer: Great question. I am an atheist, but have never said there is "no evidence of god" there is just not enough proof for me. Also, say god is real. Then he must of just been there, so why couldn't the world?!

It is the Tuesday just before Lent or Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holliday where people promise to give up something they really enjoy for 40 days till Easter.  It is most popularly celebrated in New Orleans.  There is a carnival atmosphere where people get very intoxicated in the streets of New Orleans.  Guys buy beaded necklaces and give them to girls for flashing their breasts.  \n\nFor me as a Christian, I think it is kinda sad.  I look forward to celebrating Easter as the time when Christ died for me and rose again.  I think that a devout Catholic should be ashamed of themself if they were to go out and act like this, then go to confession, followed by Ash Wednesday where they make a "sacrifice" to show how much they love Him.

question_title: Want to be love by my family as I am a gay person.Is it possible? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Unfortunately, even though it is wrong to reject family members for that reason, it happens alot. But tell them anyways. Don't ever hide who you are! Don't ever feel like who you are is wrong because they do not agree or approve! You never know, they could be cool with it. You can not change who you are and if anyone, family member or not, can not except you, then it is better off that that person is no longer in your life. Good luck!	Society & Culture
question_title: Are most Atheists introverts or extroverts? [SEP] question_content: Extroverts are more people-oreintated, need company of other people to feel good and thrive on rapid communications and large crowds.  Being isolated for too long drains their energy.\n\nIntroverts are opposite, they thrive on being alone with themselves and usually are very deep thinkers.  They think everything through before saying or acting on anything.   Introverts are not anti-social, but being around people for too long drains them.\n\nI am an introvert.  I am curious to see if atheists are more one or the other? [SEP] best_answer: I'm an introvert, I don't rely on approval from others and I don't like being with people who drain me, especially people who don't put any effort into being interesting or entertaining and behave like sponges.\n\nI can enjoy being quite social and extroverted in a big way for short periods but I need my down time alone to think...I'm mostly very serious and even when I ask silly questions here it's because usually they are associated to something of deeper significance...though I do throw in a red herring just for fun every so often to annoy certain people or wind them up.

question_title: Egyptian Question! And 10 Easy Points!? [SEP] question_content: Ok if you can get this question right I will pick you as the best answer. Which God and Goddess was this.\n1. Was the divine personification of the primordial waters of chaos.\n2. Was the godess of war.\n(The first one is a god)\nHere is your choices for the first one. Aker, Amun, Kuk, Atum, Baba, or Nun.\nHere is your choices for the second one. Anat, Hathor, Isis, Neith, \nNut, or Ptah.\nHave fun with this one. :). And remember 10 points to who gets it right. [SEP] best_answer: Aker is an earth god who presided over the borders of the underworld.\nAmun is associated with the primordial air.\nKuk is associated with the primordial concept of darkness.\nAtum is the primal creator, associated with the sun.\nBabi is a baboon god.\nNun (also spelt Naunet or Nu) was the deification of the primordial water abyss.\n\nAnat is a war goddess.\nHathor is the personifaction of the Milky Way, often depicted as a cow.\nIsis is most famous for being the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus.\nNeith is a goddess of hunt and war.\nNut is the personification of night.\nAnd Ptah isn't a goddess at all, but the first god.\n\nSo the answer to 1 is Nun and the answer to 2 is either Anat or Neith.  But I would have to lean more towards Anat, as Neith is also considered a goddess of weaving.\nHope this answers your question!	Society & Culture

question_title: Why police is called cop? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: That is a tough one.. There are sought to be made explanations but.. sifting through all of them, I believe it is: Around the year 1700, the slang verb cop entered English usage, meaning "to get ahold of, catch, capture." By 1844, cop showed up in print, and soon thereafter the -er suffix was added, and a policeman became a copper, one who cops or catches and arrests criminals. Copper first appeared in print in 1846, the use of cop as a short form copper occured in 1859	Society & Culture

question_title: was Hamlet in love with Ophelia? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Well, I think he was, and that was why he got so upset about her not getting too close to him.  He knew he was having a tough time mentally, and that he could not be involved with her.  He probably did not realize she would commit suicide herself as a result, but then they were, after all, pretty young.  Young people have a tendency to add so much drama to things, because a given experience is new to them, however old it is to the world.  Adolescent angst is a real thing, and I suppose it's not that surprising that suicide seems to be a major sorting mechanism among the young.  Those who believe themselves unfit for life choose death.  It's only rarely a wise choice.  I won't go into what those rare circumstances might be; each must decide.  But as I say, it is very rarely wise.\n\nTo be or not to be, that is the question.  You have heard the line so many times, you can recite it without thinking. But it pays to think about it:  are you going to go ahead with your life, and make of it all you can, or are you going to label yourself a loser and throw yourself away?  \n\nBefore you decide, please listen to me about suicide:  my loved one of over 20 years chose that way out on December 16, 2005.  I'm obviously still in the process of "getting over it," to the extent I ever will.  It is the most horrible experience of my life, and Please, God, it will always be.  I don't want to tempt any fates, but I cain't hardly get worse than being in the same apartment, and unavailable to a last-minute attempt to stop him, when someone commits suicide.\n\nBut even without that; even starting with discovering the body.  Or worse, having someone just disappear down some John or Jane Doe coroner's report, the loved ones never being sure, or only being notified after it's all been in the hands of the professionals (coroner's office being just the start, of course).  It's all heartbreaking, no matter how understanding and forgiving you can be about the person who took that way out of what they felt was intolerable.\n\nBut it was not really intolerable.  He just stopped tolerating it, and I have a hard time remembering that I forgive him for that.  But even though I do, really, I am in a far worse position now, and he probably believed he was doing me a favor, taking a burden off my hands.  That's hardly ever true in a case of suicide.  It's more an excuse.	Society & Culture
question_title: Why do people kill people to prove that killing people is wrong? [SEP] question_content: The death penalty is stupid and doesn't really punish the pertrator. Wouldn't life sentence be a better option? Life would take away their freedom, where as death gives them freedom. [SEP] best_answer: Valid point, but look at it this way. The government is already spending way over budget on its prison facilities. And who has to pay for these facilities? You and I and everyone else reading this.

question_title: why do barbershops have that blue and red circulating symbol outside? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "The modern barber pole originated in the days when bloodletting was one of the principal duties of the barber.  The two spiral ribbons painted around the pole represent the two long bandages, one twisted around the arm before bleeding, and the other used to bind is afterward.  Originally, when not in use, the pole with a bandage wound around it, so that both might be together when needed, was hung at the door as a sign.  But later, for convenience, instead of hanging out the original pole, another one was painted in imitation of it and given a permanent place on the outside of the shop.  This was the beginning of the modern barber pole."	Society & Culture

Many use it as a way of letting off steam, but all it does is give an adverse opinion of the user and sums up their capacity to communicate.  As far as their meanings, there are many but you can bet that those making use of said words do not know their exact meaning but just their twisted definition.	Society & Culture

The only way they can justify why they can't get married is what. Due to thier beliefs that it should only be man and woman.

Did they never stop to think that perhaps God put US here to teach THEM?????\ntolerance and loving one another was what  Jesus taught his whole life.\nThink about it. [SEP] best_answer: I don't know...maybe they see us as a softer target for 'saving' than say a devout muslim or hindu.\n There are so many things in the bible that are conveniantly ignored by the bible-thumping folks...like the sin of eating of shellfish, the 'good' things about slavery, the not having short hair etc.\n\nThey just pick and choose what they want to follow from the bible.. and insist on trying to control our lives with their misguided morals.\n\nIt just makes me sick the way they like to quite neatly put us in the same box as murderers, pedophiles and rapists.\nBecause these criminals 'love' their victims....\nDon't you get it you narrow-minded fools....these crimes of murder, child abuse and rape all involve one consenting person and one VICTIM.\n\nGay/lesbian relationships consist of TWO CONSENTING adults, loving or having consensual sexual relations with eachother.\n\nHow could an all knowing God punish people for loving eachother.\nShouldnt God be frowning upon you these bigoted bible-thumpers for not loving their neighbours?

question_title: If really there is God, why not God click His hand to combine all religion to give peace a chance? [SEP] question_content: How come we say a loving God if He leave His people killing each other ... leaving some people to starve while others have too much to waste. What God's power for? Is God a sadist? Then religion say ... it's people's fault of having no faith in God! Blessed are the poor & suffering for they have place in heaven. A graceful exit without any basis by moving social feeling and consolation. \n-\nNow, is it a choice to be born in Africa ... or in the rich countries? The answer is nope! Is it a choice to be a christian or muslim? Nope! Every one has no religion from our mother womb. It so happened in the environment of our upbringing. It's unimaginable to become a Pope if one was born from the hinterland of Afghanistan. And to be Osama, if one is born from pius christian family in Rome. [SEP] best_answer: God doesn't leave people to kill each other, unless they choose to.  God did not make man a robot but a creature who can choose right or wrong.  He doesn't want people to starve but many starving nations do not believe in Him, nor call on Him for intervention.  However, missionaries are going into those places and doing a good work.  Others who are Christians and being tortured are victims of an evil power over them in the form of govt.  They are martyrs for their faith.  Many of us have prayed for our brothers and sisters in Sudan for years and we see our prayers answered.  Other Christians have gone in and rescued those being tortured as slaves by the govt.  They are receiving help.  It doesn't matter where you are born, you can always chose to believe in God.  God knows us even before we are designed in our mother's womb.  I came from a non-christian home but I chose to follow after Him, seek Him, serve Him.  I am not exempt from trials, persecution and sorrows of life but I have divine joy and peace because of the hope He brings me.  It is all a matter of faith.  Either believe or not believe.  I'm one who says there are vast rewards to having faith where there is otherwise total hopelessness.  Press on!	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: What about those not raptured but saved during the Tribulaton--what kind of body will they have--any different?? Bible verses?? [SEP] best_answer: The raptured and resurrected saints will be given their own bodies, but our bodies will be perfected.  (1 Cor. 15:42-45 and 50-56.)\n\nThose who are saved during the Tribulation, and live through it, will keep their bodies and live for at least 1,000 years. A wicked person born after the Tribulation (during the Millenial Reign) will die before they're 100 years old.  See Isaiah 65:20.\n\nThose who die during the Tribulation, after having been saved, will also have their own perfected human bodies.\n\nThere are several references to the "perfected body" teaching, but our primary example is ALWAYS Jesus Christ.  We are taught our resurrection will be the same as His; we also know He was resurrected bodily and looked the same as He did during life.  The account of the Transfiguration (before His death) is a good example; read also the account of His appearance to Thomas.\n\nI hope this helps.  Peace.	Society & Culture

[SEP] question_content: patients. it found that people who were prayed for did no better then people who weren't. but oddly enough people who were prayed for and then told that they were prayed for did worse. [SEP] best_answer: An interesting study. I think there might have been an element of stress with the people who knew they would be prayed for - like performance anxiety - and stress can adversely affect heart patients. \n\nThe study you refer to was about church groups praying for strangers in hospitals, and there's a general consensus that this type of prayer has no effect whatsoever. But there seems to be a psychological benefit in well wishes from people we know - like a virtual hug - and most of us respond well to that.	Society & Culture

question_title: Christians, what do you think about these Atheists comments? [SEP] question_content: Reading the Bible is the fastest way out of believing in god. \n\nAthiesim tends to come through STUDY and THOUGHT, rather than a BLIND BELIEF system.\n\n\n  Atheists question what they don't understand, instead of blindly following others like sheep.  \n\nUs Atheists actually take time to research our beliefs instead of allowing someone in a church or anywhere else to tell us what to believe \n\nmost christians are only told about the happy fluffy benevolent god.

question_title: I do not understand how Muslims think the New Testament is corrupted but some believe some of it? [SEP] question_content: I read Muslims say the New Testament is corrupted, but then they also say that Christians have lost the way: Jesus said "I am the way, the truth and the life": notice the I AM there.  So how have Christians lost the way, and Why would God allow his word to be corrupted; or do you mean that it is misinterpreted, so much of it is clear that it could not be misinterpreted.  There is large agreement between Jews and Christians on the Old Testament, is this also true for Muslims; I think it is because a Muslim asked me if I read the book Ezekiel, so I went back and re-read it.  And I am sure they believe in the accuracy of Genesis because much of it is copied out in the Quran, even more detail is given on some stories of Genesis, which may be inaccurate details.\n\nSolution: we need to see how much we agree at least.  There are many misunderstanding on ethical values.  I agree for instance that it is wrong to make an image of the prophets, or anything; but not all Christians understand that [SEP] best_answer: I believe the content of New Testament is the revelations from Allah to us\n\nRevelation 22:7,10,13,19 \n“Behold, I come quickly.

question_title: Why do people believe in a afterlife now more than any time in history? [SEP] question_content: I was watching a show on the science channel last night that was studying near death experiences.\n\nBut they were saying more people now than any other time in history believe in the afterlife.\n\nWhy do you think this is considering we live during the technological age and know so must about everything? [SEP] best_answer: That is the misconception. Since the beginning of time people have always believed in the after life. Now, we are just more free to express. In ancient times some countrys considered it to be forbidden to speak of any such thing. Some felt if u spoke of the after life u were possessed or a witch or just 2 fries short of a happy meal. Some believe it just gives others something to believe in and makes losing someone easier to deal with. I personally believe that we all have a place to go to whether it be heaven or hell.

Maybe gay bashing is done by those who are too chicken shite to admit they really are gay, so they hate those of us who are out of the closet and fear that we will drag them kicking and screaming into the world of Gayness. lol.

question_title: Are blacks prejudice against whites? [SEP] question_content: I have noticed that there are shows, movies, etc. where black people put down white people as a joke.  If we did that to black it would be considered racist.  What is the purpose of BET (Black Entertainment Television)?  If we had a WET (White Entertainment Television) channel, it would be racist.....what a crock. [SEP] best_answer: Many African Americans are prejudiced.  I lived in Cincinnati for three years and noticed a disturbing trend of many black people blaming their problems on white people.  \n\nI agree with what you stated about there being all types of "black-oriented" channels and clubs that specifically target, and refer to, their people; this is a great example of a double standard.  I have noticed the same thing with other races having exclusitivity in regards to organizations: Asian and Hispanic television stations and social clubs for example. If there was anything that referred to white people, it would definitely be considered racist.  We have the liberal, PC-minded spineless masses to thank for not standing up for OUR rights. Amen!

question_title: Do you honestly believe that if illegals were to be given amnesty that>? [SEP] question_content: the way we live and our culture would come to an end.They are already here.So any effects that you would feel,you have already been feeling. [SEP] best_answer: The problem is that the legalization elements have been all entwined in the guest worker program which is a really bad program.  One Senator ran projections of how many poor immigrants would come here under the program (on TOP of the current rate of immigration and on TOP of the current illegal immigrants) and he came up with 185 million to 217 million poor immigrants in the next 20 years.  Even California Senators Boxer and Feinstein who have been pushing for legalization as their main goal in the program voted against this element of the program. (They lost.)\n\nCan  your school and neighborhood fit and support that many poor immigrants?  Mine can't. Do you see that many jobs around? I don't.  This is a big business idea to keep wages depressed for unskilled and semi skilled labor into the indefinite future.\n\nIf the border is truly secured, I want to deport felons and want illegal immigrants to actively start learning English as a condition of legalization.  However, as you say, they are already here.  The problem is that if you say you want legalization people now say 'I want the guest worker program' and most of them don't have a clue what is in it.\n\nIf there is a way to frame the bill during conference into qualified illegal legalization plus MAJOR border security, I would be in favor of it.  To tell the truth, though, I'd rather have no bill at all than the Senate Bill in its current form.	Politics & Government

question_title: What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching. Knowing how to take the test is more important, under this system, than knowing what is on it. Further, the act has been severely underfunded. The act requires more qualified teachers (aka ones with more education), but more education means higher pay, which is something many school districts can't do.\n\nI think more importantly than any of those problems, there's the issue of how to measure improvement. Under the act each class is compared to the previous class, meaning this year's 2nd grade is compared to last year's 2nd grade. Now, obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair. People don't like to admit it, but some people have different base levels of intelligence. Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably, but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is, on average, not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of. Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers (comparing last year's 2nd grade scores to this year's 3rd grade scores). That is obviously the better way to do it, but making the switch is going to cost money, something the act has failed to provide.	Politics & Government

question_title: who are the biggest whiners of them all? [SEP] question_content: hippies?  democrats? [SEP] best_answer: I would say hippies, but on the grand scale it is the Democrats. They all seemed to like The Patriot Act when it first came out after 9/11 and then as soon as there started to be questions and a little bit of an uproar, the Democrats turned their backs on it and started to complain about it. But even while they only whined they never came out with a counter bill or proposal to The Patriot Act. If they disliked the Patriot Act so much then why not come up with their own plan to secure the US. Sure, Bush might not have done the most wonderful job but at least he did something. The Democrats after almost 6 years after 9/11 has announced that they are drawing up a plan to secure the US. That's very nice but where were they 6 years ago? It's time they stop whining and actually think before they jump on the "let's all hate Bush" bandwagon.	Politics & Government

I mean i pay as much taxaes as any other american and recieve less benefits. So why is it that my being here is such  a problem for so many people. [SEP] best_answer: It doesn't matter where you go in the world most immigrants are treated the same, people don't know who else to blame when the there country isn't doing so well. And most immigrants are prepared to work and study really hard and some people are jealous when they see immigrants doing really well.	Politics & Government

question_title: In New York State is 17 years old now considered an adult or is it still 18 ? I was told it changed last year? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: In the state of New York the age of consent is 17, and has been for a number of years. Which just means that it is legal for a 17-year old to be sexually active.\n\nBut, in New York you still have to be 18 to be considered an adult. This did not change to 17. You need to be 18 to vote, purchase tabacco, serve your country, obtain credit without a co-signer, and live on your own without obtaining an emmancipation.\n\nBut, you can be tried as an adult before you turn 18. So long as the court feel that you were acting as an adult when you committed the crime.\n\nHope this answers your question.	Politics & Government

question_title: Can a president be vice president after two terms in office? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: NO HE CANNOT.  \n\nThe Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution reads:\n\n"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."\n\nNow, it may not be as cut-and-dried as it looks.  The 25th Amendment says that a 2-term President ineligible to be *elected* again ... but it doesn't explicitely say that he is inelligible to *be* President again (i.e. if he were in the line of succession).  So he may not be disqualified from being Vice-President.  However, most constitutional scholars agree that the intent is to disqualify a third-term President by any means.  It is amazing to me that people who draft Amendments don't fix the wording so these things are completely unambiguous.\n\nInteresting Trivia:  Before the 12th Amendment (1804), the Vice-President was the second-place finisher in the Presidential election ... so the President and Vice-President were invariably from opposite parties.

I dont know I dont think we can solve the problem but I think we should in no way send more troops I think we should train the  Iraqi troops to do what our troops are doing and then leave. Because if we left right now all at once I feel like everything that we have accomplished will become a waste and speaking as a military fiance the soldiers who are fighting and the ones that have died all the hard work we dont need to go to waste.

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I don't know if he will, but he shouldn't pull out until Iraq is ready.  Like it or not, people die in war.  The truth is that the casualties of this war are miniscule compare to vietnam which took over 700 Americans on average each day.\n\nThe United States is not the conquering nation that it is portrayed to be in the media.  If we were we would own Japan, half of Germany, and we would still have the panama canal.  We actually have a history of rescuing the people of countries from dictators.  Japan was under an Emperor and in five years after WWII we unilaterally helped the people form a democratic government run by the people of Japan. West Germany took longer (30 years) because we chose to work with the UN, but we formed a democracy there too and then left.    There are many more problems to deal with in Iraq than in Japan or Germany.  We are actually getting things done quickly in Iraq despite enormous difficulties caused by warring sects and the restrictions of the religion of Islam.	Politics & Government

[SEP] best_answer: PRINCETON, N.J. -- April 1999 -- More than 100 protesters denounced Princeton University on Saturday for hiring a philosopher whose extreme views include allowing parents to end the lives of their severely disabled infants. \n\n"Nazi Germany did the same thing to the disabled, judging their lives not worth living. We object to that," said John Scaturro, 49, who protested near the Ivy League school along with his wife and young daughter. \n\nUniversity officials stood by the appointment of Peter Singer, a professor whose academic work they say will contribute to scholarship and ethics debates at Princeton. \n\nSinger, a professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, was appointed last year to the Ira W. DeCamp Professorship of Bioethics at the university's Center for Human Values. He is to begin work in July. \n\nThe 52-year-old academic is widely considered the father of the international animal rights movement yet has argued parents should have the right to euthanize newborn children who have severe handicaps. \n\nIn his books, Singer has said that children less than one month old have no human consciousness and do not have the same rights as others. \n\n"Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person," he wrote in one book. "Sometimes it is not wrong at all." \n\nHis appointment at Princeton has drawn fierce opposition from pro-life groups, the disabled and others.	Politics & Government

question_title: Are you think human right is observed in Iran? [SEP] question_content: What is the human right for iranian?Are you think human right is observed in Iran [SEP] best_answer: No religious state is observant of human rights.  The rights of humans as human beings begins with separating religion from the state.  People cannot be forced to participate in or contribute to a religion that they do not believe in, and cannot be prevented from practicing a religion that they believe in.  When the state demands that all its people practice a religion and forbids any other, it not only is violating human rights, but is totalitarian and dictatorial.\n\nThat is why the US Constitution's list of things that are forbidden to the government begins right away with "Congress shall pass no law establishing a religion, nor prohibit the free exercises thereof."\n\nOther human rights that a government is wrong to prohibit include but are not limited to: freedom of speech, of the press, of peaceable assembly, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances.\n\nYou will find more information on the rights of humans here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights\n\nI don't think Iran meets the criteria for a state that recognizes human rights, and I don't think that it recognizes that it doesn't.

question_title: Why do non-smokers want to be around smokers, just to have it banned in clubs and pool halls???? [SEP] question_content: In the Chicagoland area it is a ban in nightclubs, bars, pool halls and every where else that smokers goto to have fun. Its the same in Madison, Wis. There is a smoking ban just about everywhere you go. If you are a non-smoker then dont frequent places where smokers are and vice-versa for smokers. Everyone has the right to smoke if they want. They say smoking causes second hand Canser, well if that is so then seeing people eat to much causes eye canser. You all know what I mean. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think that smoking should be banned in bars and in clubs. If they are banning things that are bad for you they wouldn't be able to drink there either. I think that if you are so health oriented you shouldn't be in the bar so if you don't want to be around smokers don't go in the bar. Drinking and smoking go hand in hand and some people that drink like to smoke only when they drink. I think it should be up to the bar owner. If the waitresses don't like being around it , get another job at a bar that doesn't allow smoking.	Politics & Government

question_title: Did you know One Million Sex Crimes Committed by Illegal aliens in the United States-? [SEP] question_content: Would you like to know about the dark side of Illegal Immigrants in the United States ? \nhttp://www.drdsk.com/articles.html#ImportingViolence\nAfter conducting a 12 month in-depth study of illegal immigrants who committed sex crimes and murders for the time period of January 1999 through April 2006 , it is clear that the U.S. public faces a dangerous threat from sex predators who cross the U.S. borders illegally. \n\nThere were 1500 cases analyzed in depth. They included: serial rapes, serial murders, sexual homicides, and child molestation committed by illegal immigrants. Police reports, public records, interviews with police, and media accounts were all included. Offenders were located in 36 states, but it is clear, that the most of the offenders were located in states with the highest numbers of illegal immigrants. California was number one, followed by Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, New York, and Florida. How many are here for a better life and how many are not? [SEP] best_answer: I'm not at all shocked. In fact, I've seen it happening in my area for many years. Illegal hispanic men 'dating' and impregnating girls from the age of ten on up. Not to mention that I've heard many of them say that any unescorted female going about her business was 'asking for it'.  But things are changing a little around here. Every pregnant girl under the age of sixteen is referred to the DA as a rape victim and perpetrators are getting an average of five years in prison. I'm glad something is being done to stop this.\n\nSome of the ones going to prison did not impregnate the girl. Many of the idiots freely admit to having sex with underage girls because they think nothing will be done.\n\nCrazybird's answer reminded me of something my ex-husband told me. He is from a small village in Mexico. He said that when a man wanted to find a wife (if he couldn't find one at home) he and his friends would go to a neighboring village and take a woman. They would bring her back and force the 'marriage' on her. Her family would not object because they considered it to be too late to do anything about it.	Politics & Government

question_title: Do illegal immigrants get all these benefits that people claim they do? [SEP] question_content: If thats the case, where do I turn in my citizenship and join the rich? How ignorant can one be to believe that they get all of these claimed benefits?  Shame on you and your lies. [SEP] best_answer: Illegal immigrants -- or legal foreign tourists for that matter -- get Constitutional guarantees (Bill of Rights) like anyone else in the USA -- unless Pres. George W. Bush has designated them "enemy combatants".\n\nThey do not get very many "benefits" of financial value, except emergency health care (mainly: traffic accidents and childbirth). Their children born in the USA are US citizens, and the US Supeme Court held, particuarly with respect to education -- free schooling -- that they cannot be denied benefits based on their parents' status. Which makes sense apart from the Constitutional issue because it would mean raising a generation of illiterate citizens!\n\nParents of babies born in the USA get no benefit (other than as above) from that fact -- they can be and are deported. In one case (you can Google "Myrna Dick") a judge held that a woman alleged to be in the US illegally (she had been brought to the USA from Mexico at age 9 and married an American and was pregnant) could not be deported until after her baby was born. A good -- but charitable -- holding I think; difficult to justify on the grounds given (that the "fetus" is American). But it delighted some anti-abortion activists.	Politics & Government

They seem to forget it was blacks who sold them into slavery and white's who fought to free them. Not all whites supported slavery!  I think it was horrible but I am also sick of them thinking they are entitled because of it.  What about the jews? They were wronged too, what do they get?

I think it is unfair that they can have all black beauty pageants, all black colleges, all black scholarships, we cannot have an all white anything or we would be in big trouble for discrimination, not that I would want to anyway, but how fair is that????!!!!!  I think everyone should have the same rights and I am sick of hearing how they think they have less rights when they actually have MORE.  They will get a job even if less qualified and I have seen first hand how they can sit around and do nothing and cannot be fired, by law, because company would be in trouble if they fired them.  I like black people, but it angers me to no living end that they get away with stuff like that!  I have black friends and have heard them make remarks about getting retribution one day.

question_title: From oregon to cali? [SEP] question_content: I was in a accident on the I-5 in oregon. My wife fell asleep at the wheel. Now i got rushed to the er because i had glass all over my face, the nurses cleaned me up and said i was good to go and checked me out, I came home and found a piece of glass still lodged in my head, and another still in my lip now my question is do i have grounds for a lawsuit against the hospital for not removing the glass from my head, btw the glass is located just above my eye, and in the inside of my lip that was the most horrible day of my life. and whats worse is that they just didnt even fix me now i am being charged 500 dollars for the doctor in san diego to take that out, because my insurance doesnt cover it. so i am just curious because i feel that the first hospital should cover my bill for not doing their job. [SEP] best_answer: Have the hospital submit the bill to your auto insurance carrier (your wife's if it's different). It is still the same accident. And while you could sue the hospital for not getting the glass out I'm fairly sure you wouldn't win. Think about it - your face was covered in blood and glass is clear. They probably couldn't see the glass for the blood and swelling. Just be glad that enough people can pay for health care and insurance (you included if you pay for these things) so that there was someone available to take you to the hospital, check your injuries and then a hospital with a doctor on staff who could treat your injuries. Not every country has such care. \n\nI'm not an advocate of biting the hand that feeds you - on in this case, the hand that treated you.	Politics & Government

question_title: Army ROTC? [SEP] question_content: I applied to ROTC, and they sent a packet to my school. It says I have to pass the President's Challenge Physical Fitness Test. But this test is incredibly hard. The army has lower standards for new active duty recruits. What the deal? [SEP] best_answer: OK Check this out, 4 year scholarships are for some unknown reason hard to get, probably because everyone applies for them right out of high school and because of that they can raise their standards to whatever they want.\n\n2 and 3 year scholarships are given out by the PMS (professor of Military Science) a LTC at each school.  So go to college, take the first year ROTC classes and you WILL get a 3 year scholarship.\n\nIf you are in it for the money you can do what I did and enlist in the National Guard and get a 2 year scholarship in the SMP Program (simultaneous membership program).  There is a chance you will deploy during the first 2 years but when you become a Scholarship Cadet you can not be deployed but the gives you more college money than the 3 year scholarship (or did when I went to school)	Politics & Government
question_title: Jail Time?? [SEP] question_content: Im due anytime now and the father of this baby is in trouble with the law. 2 weeks ago he saw a man he was having problems with walking down the street, he stops the truck, grabs him by the back of his shirt and starts going no more than 20mph. He lets go of the mans shirt and the man is holding onto his arm. Finally he grabs onto the bed of the truck. The father of my baby slams on the breaks and makes the man loose his grip, he falls to the ground and the father of my baby drives on and runs over his legs (accidently) with the back tire. He has had around 10- 15 assaults in the past 8 years. This charge is Assault with a deadly weapon Inflict serious injury. The charge is a felony now. I guess where he has had so many. My question is, what do you think he will get? I live in the state of NC, House arrest? Jail time? Probabtion? Im so worried Thanks Ya'll [SEP] best_answer: No, not jail time, PRISON TIME.  Felonies with priors, especially violent prior, also may be considered in most states with enhanced sentencing.  In other words, they can add years to a sentence for alleging their priors, same type crimes, and frequency of crimes.  \n\nBasically, the dad is a REPEAT OFFENDER and will be subject to the court designating it as aggravated assault with multiple priors.  \n\nI am sorry to say, dad is looking at a few years in the State Penitentiary, not just local county jail. Good luck with the baby and I hope things work out well for you both.	Politics & Government

question_title: Do you think globalization is at risk as the West has second thoughts? [SEP] question_content: I saw today that Democrats are saying they might need to 'revisit' the idea of free trade agreements, and I know I sure no longer think globalism is an automatic good, as I had assumed it to be.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nhttp://www.globalenvision.org/library/8/1266/1/ [SEP] best_answer: The reality is that globalization is a positive for all players involved.  Right now, the rich countries are enjoying all the benefits without taking any of the risks and globablization does not benefit every single person anyway.  The concept is that if country A can make everything cheaper than country B, both countries can benefit by letting each do what it does best.  A may pay more to B for some things than they could make it themselves for, but A will make more money by selling other products to B.  B makes money, both by selling its goods and by purchasing A's products.  The down side is that each country must focus on its specialty and re-deploy resources from industries where it doesn't have a significant advantage.  That means that you really shouldn't be making clothes or growing wheat in N. America or Europe.  That is something that can be done better in S. America and Africa, freeing up American and European capital and labor to focus on industries where it has an overwhelming advantage.  But if you are a farmer or work in a clothing factory, you probably see if differently.	Politics & Government

question_title: do you think World War III will be coming soon? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: yes...Look people the next big one will start with nukes going off at the same time in Tel Aviv, NY, DC, and London. That will be from Iran's Hamas, next will be freighters in all of the US shipping ports having nukes in lead shielded boxes in the fuel oil tanks of merchant ships. That will effectively take the US completely out of it in the first 30mins of WW3 Now after that North Korea will take South Korea and China will take Japan and as much of Russia as possible. Europe will wisely sue for peace with China as the new World Super power. After things calm down a bit negotiations between the EU and China will take place. The former US will be divided up between the two based upon the premise that France will not nuke what is left. During these negotiations the EU and China will also plan a lightning take over of the middle east which will also be divided up between the two powers. When all is said and done there will be peace and technological progress unheard of before.	Politics & Government

question_title: Why is the president in Washington D.C and not in any other city? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The President's Residence (first called the White House by Teddy Roosevelt) was placed in Washington, D.C. because of a deal made when the US was very young...\n\nAs I understand it, originally the two major candidates for the Capitol City of the new Republic were Philadelphia (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) and New York City (which was - and is - our largest city) - both in the North. At the same time, there was a problem concerning the war debts the Thirteen States had (remember, they considered themselves 13 COUNTRIES back then). So a deal was struck: in exchange for the rich states allowing national "assumption" of the war debt (and so helping the poorer states out), they would move the Capitol to a (then) brand new location in the South, on the Potomac River.

question_title: are bail bondsmen archaic and should they be eliminated from the criminal justice system? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I think we need them because most people that use them have to put up most of what they own to get out of jail and if the person want to try and flee the bail bondsmen have bounty hunters that will go after them at no cost to the tax payers,  it is less of a problem the police are over worked and short handed as it is so it can be hard for them to go after someone not that the don't try.  but it helps out the police because there are people actively hunting the guy that fled.  Most officers that recover a fugitive end up not knowing they have the person until they check there id with dispatch.  so it is a great help in recovering people that have fled.  Also by being able to bail out of jail a person is better able to actively work on there case.	Politics & Government

question_title: In a legal case, say, A Company V. B Corp.,does that imply A wins the case? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The order of the parties in case reporting is quite a complex question.\nUsually for the trial level case the party listed first if the party bringing a legal motion and the party listed second is the one defending.\n\nThe same is often true for the appeal level cases, The party who lost on the trial level and is now bringing a motion to appeal, is listed first. This leads to interesting namings:\nSay A sued B (case is called A v. B)\nSay A won and B appealed the case to the Court of Appeals -- now the case is called B v. A. \nSay the court of appeals reversed and held that B wins. Now A appeals the case to the Supreme court -- now the case is A v. B again.\n\nHowever there are weird cases -- when the party that won appeals the case (say because they think that the damages are inadequate)\nOr when both parties appeal the decision.\n\nIn cases like this each court has it's own policies.

And for you ultra-conservative narrow-minded idiots get a life. [SEP] best_answer: I don't think the government needs to be in the business of telling people how to rear their children.....or educating them, for that matter.  I believe that is one reason our public (government run) schools are so bad today.  The other reason is that people do not know how to discipline their babies.  They either them them run wild or they yell at the to shut the f**k up. This is beginning to really get out of hand when children are having babies.  The fathers are many times no where around.   Who suffers?  The child.\n\nThe elderly pay into the medicare system their whole life and when they need help caring for themselves, we "shelve" them in a nursing home.  Some, but not all,  of these places are nasty and the staff is mean.  A senior either has to be wealthy and pay for private care, have excellent long term care insurance, or apply for medicare.  I have never understood why we treat our elderly worse than animals.\n\n\n\n\nArmygirl91--remember you will be old one day.	Politics & Government

Doug had just rescued Claire from Carroll (exploding ambulance, etc...) and they were in her apt. when she pulled a gun on him and said "You're not really a cop... how did you know about my clothes, etc..." and she called his office to see if he was really an agent... Then the fire alarm went off and we left.  \n\nWe would REALLY appreciate a detailed description of what happened after this... I don't think it was very far to the end... \n\nHelp, PLEASE!  ;) [SEP] best_answer: First after she pulled the gun, she called his office and another cop gave a description of him. Then they rush to the ferry and plan on trying to get the bomb out. The girl was supposed to wait until the ferry left, while D.W. went on board to stop the bomb. As the bad guy left, D.W. went abroad the ferry. But while the bad guy was getting ready to leave on his motorcycle, he noticed the SUV and went back to the ferry. The girl saw this and in return jump back abroad the ferry.\n Now with all three of them on the ferry, D.W. was told by security to get up top, that the bottom was off limits. He agrees and looks for another way. The girl tryin to alert D.W. is caught by the bad guy. She is once again tied up and put in the SUV. D.W. now returns back to the SUV and begans a shoot out with the bad guy. With the security also firing at them both, D.W. ended up killing the bad guy with a shot in the head, with his last bullet. Then security comes at D.W. and he jumps in the SUV with the girl, now they only have a couple of minutes until the bomb goes off. So while the cops are trying to stop the SUV, they take off fliping over the edge. While under water the girl is saved by D.W. but he didn't get out and drowns or blows up with the blomb, which miss the ferry. So after all this, the present day D.W. shows up. And she asked him the same question he ask her while she was holding the gun. He responded the same and stop a second thinking that he felt Deja Vu but then shook it off and the movies end with them living the docks. I hope this helps	Entertainment & Music

question_title: How do you put in a new string in a squire telecaster? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Take a replacement string of the same gauge (thickness) and push it through the spare hole at the end of the metal bridge plate. Pull through until the stopper blocks it moving any further and then feed the end through the tuner peg hole. Ensure that the string is aligned into the groove at the end of the neck and allow some slack into the string before tightening - about enough to get a finger between the string and the fretboard. Tighten the string around the pole using the tuning peg - I tend to wrap it once above the string then the remaining times below. Tune up, then stretch the string by placing your palm over it near the lower frets and pulling the string gently away from the fretboard with your playing hand. Tune up again, repeat the process, then plug in and rock out!	Entertainment & Music
question_title: Does anyone know any jokes or even riddles? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: An old guy walks into a bar and asks for a bottle of forty-year old Scotch. The bartender, not wanting to give up the good liquor, pours a shot of ten-year Scotch and figures that the guy won't be able to tell the difference. The guy downs the Scotch and says: "This Scotch is only ten years old! I specifically asked for forty-year old Scotch." \n\nAmazed, the bartender reaches into a locked cabinet underneath the bar and pulls out a bottle of twenty-year old Scotch and pours the man a shot. The guy drinks it down and says, "That was twenty-year old Scotch. I asked for forty-year old Scotch." \n\nSo the bartender goes into the back room and brings out a bottle of thirty-year old Scotch and pours the guy a drink. By now a small crowd has gathered around the man and is watching anxiously as he downs the latest drink. Once again the guy states the true age of the Scotch and repeats his original request for forty-year old Scotch. \n\nThe bartender can hold off no longer and disappears into the cellar to get a bottle of prime forty-year old Scotch. Soon, the bartender returns with the bottle and pours a shot. The guy downs the Scotch and says, "Now this is forty-year old Scotch!" The crowd applauds his discriminating palate. \n\nAn old drunk who had been watching the proceedings with interest, raises a full shot glass of his own and says, "Here, take a swig of this." \n\nThe guy takes the glass and downs the drink in one swallow. Immediately, he chokes and spits out the liquid on the barroom floor. "My God! That tastes like piss," he yells. \n\n"Great guess," says the drunk. "Now, how old am I?"	Entertainment & Music

question_title: who loves axl rose? i do and who else? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: Actually, to put it simply, he is a little bitch. He broke up Guns N' Roses, which could have been the greatest hard rock band ever. They were never even allowed to flourish. Even though I love the Use Your Illusions, I'm still mad at Axl for moving away from the "I'll Kick Your Ass" hard rock of Appetite for Destruction. He has been promising an album for ten years, but he never does release anything. I admire the man as a lyricist, musician, and a vocalist. His range is amazing, but I'll never respect the dude as a man. he's not really a man anymore anyway. Have you seen the amount of plastic surgery that he has gotten? He looks like that thing from the Alien series.	Entertainment & Music

question_title: Which do you prefer Yahoo or Google? Why? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: It depends for what purpose. Overall, I think one needs to assess what it is that they want. I think yahoo for e-mail purposes is extremely user friendly and I like the new BETA format that e-mails can be viewed and accessed in. I am able to organize my e-mails and my spam for that matter alphabetically in yahoo and can just select several e-mails at once to delete or easily drag e-mails into folders. I also like that yahoo has made it really easy to compose e-mails. As you start to type someone's name, yahoo will automatically narrow down the possibilities of who you are trying to e-mail and bring up a drop down menu of names you can select. On google, I like the fact that I can chat directly within gmail. I also like the fact that my instant message exchanges are automatically saved on gmail. Overall, I think the searching is more extensive on google. It really just depends on what you want to use them for. Good luck!	Entertainment & Music

Why are you never really wanting to eat...is it because you have no appetite or because you are afraid of gaining weight? Have you seen a consultant about this.  Basically, you need to eat little and often to get your stomach used to food....eating a lot in one go will overload the stomach and could cause you to vomit.  You  need a well balanced diet, plenty of fibre, fresh fish,  fruit and veg and lots of fluid, preferably water, though fruit juices and herbal teas are good too. There is no quick fix remedy....you need to take your time with this and maybe  your gp can help? Good luck	Health

question_title: what is the cure for R.L.S. (restless leg syndrome)? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: How is restless legs syndrome treated?\n\n\n\nAlthough movement brings relief to those with RLS, it is generally only temporary. However, RLS can be controlled by finding any possible underlying disorder. Often, treating the associated medical condition, such as peripheral neuropathy or diabetes, will alleviate many symptoms. For patients with idiopathic RLS, treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. \n\nFor those with mild to moderate symptoms, prevention is key, and many physicians suggest certain lifestyle changes and activities to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Decreased use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco may provide some relief. Physicians may suggest that certain individuals take supplements to correct deficiencies in iron, folate, and magnesium. Studies also have shown that maintaining a regular sleep pattern can reduce symptoms. Some individuals, finding that RLS symptoms are minimized in the early morning, change their sleep patterns. Others have found that a program of regular moderate exercise helps them sleep better; on the other hand, excessive exercise has been reported by some patients to aggravate RLS symptoms. Taking a hot bath, massaging the legs, or using a heating pad or ice pack can help relieve symptoms in some patients. Although many patients find some relief with such measures, rarely do these efforts completely eliminate symptoms \n\nPhysicians also may suggest a variety of medications to treat RLS. Generally, physicians choose from dopaminergics, benzodiazepines (central nervous system depressants), opioids, and anticonvulsants. Dopaminergic agents, largely used to treat Parkinson's disease, have been shown to reduce RLS symptoms and PLMD and are considered the initial treatment of choice. Good short-term results of treatment with levodopa plus carbidopa have been reported, although most patients eventually will develop augmentation, meaning that symptoms are reduced at night but begin to develop earlier in the day than usual. Dopamine agonists such as pergolide mesylate, pramipexole, and ropinirole hydrochloride may be effective in some patients and are less likely to cause augmentation. \n\nIn 2005, ropinirole became the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of moderate to severe RLS. The drug was first approved in 1997 for patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n\nBenzodiazepines (such as clonazepam and diazepam) may be prescribed for patients who have mild or intermittent symptoms. These drugs help patients obtain a more restful sleep but they do not fully alleviate RLS symptoms and can cause daytime sleepiness. Because these depressants also may induce or aggravate sleep apnea in some cases, they should not be used in people with this condition. \n\nFor more severe symptoms, opioids such as codeine, propoxyphene, or oxycodone may be prescribed for their ability to induce relaxation and diminish pain. Side effects include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and the risk of addiction. \n\nAnticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and gabapentin are also useful for some patients, as they decrease the sensory disturbances (creeping and crawling sensations). Dizziness, fatigue, and sleepiness are among the possible side effects. \n\nUnfortunately, no one drug is effective for everyone with RLS. What may be helpful to one individual may actually worsen symptoms for another. In addition, medications taken regularly may lose their effect, making it necessary to change medications periodically.

They just told me to basically do anything to get her in. I don't want to wait until she hurts herself. She moved out and took all of my belongings. I was trying to help her, my family sent her up here for me to deal with, after I had just lost my 5 1/2 year old daughter that she and I both were in our car and got hit by a drunken driver. He didn't serve any time, just has to go to DUI classes and tell his story as a disciplinary action towards him. I just didn't see any remorse from him when he said sorry to me. I have to grieve over the loss of the love of my life and then my sister is sent to me because they know that I have a big heart and won't give up. But I don't know what else to do but file a police report. What should I do dashweiler. I miss her, but she drives me crazy with the way she acts. My mom was murdered when I was twelve, and would not want me to give up on my sister. Now i'm cryin [SEP] best_answer: once you file a police report, an ATL (attempt to locate) bulletin will go out for her, and if she is an adult once the police (or someone who knows they are looking for her) finds her then the most they can do is a welfare check to make sure she is not a risk to harm herself or others. if they see that she is based on any actions by her or on the info they have from you, they will take her to a facility to be evaluated and the doctors there will determine whether or not to commit her.

question_title: Is 125 pounds normal for a 5'1'' tall 22-year old girl? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: "A recommended weight according to height is the wrong answer. Thats right weight is extremely overrated. It's about your muscle to fat ratio. What matters is keeping your body fat percentage under about 35% for a woman and 25% for a guy. \nWhy? Muscle weighs more than fat. If your body composition is 80% muscle then you may possibly weigh more than the recommended weight. This doesn't mean you are overweight, and it certainly doesn't mean you are unhealthy. \n\nI am an example of that, I am 6'6 250 lbs with 13% body fat (good for a guy). According to the charts I'm overweight, but if you see me you would guess I am about 200 lbs. Thats what muscle mass does it makes you look a lot smaller than what you weigh.\n\nThink of this a muscle cell is a thick dense heavy rubber band.\nThink of a fat cell as a water balloon that can shrink or expand with no limit as to how big it can be.\n\nThe water balloon would take up way more space than rubber bands, but wouldn't weight as much. This is how people can look small but if they are muscular they could weigh more. \n\nIn truth the height and weight chart was something created in the 1950's and it was based on a 150lb person who was sedentary and lived near the equator. Which means its relevance to most Americans is none. Trust the BMI ratio more, which is the ratio of muscle to fat, that gives a more accurate measurement of how much weight is appropriate for you. \n\n\nBMI indicates your health risks by comparing your height and weight. Males with a BMI above 27.8 and women over 27.3 are considered overweight. Males with a BMI less than 20.7 and women below 19.1 are classified as underweight.\n\nThere are limitations to BMI so it's important to realize that it is only an estimation of body fat. People who have valid reasons for maintaining weight outside of normal ranges (pregnant or breast feeding women, competitive athletes, body builders and people who are chronically ill) may experience inaccurate BMI values. People with a high percentage of muscle mass may appear overweight using BMI because muscle is more dense than fat.\n\nHere is a link to calculate your BMI: http://apexfitness.com/html/tools/fit_calc/bmi/ "	Health

question_title: sleeping problems? [SEP] question_content: i have a problem with getting a recouperative sleep. i sleep alot, on weekends i can sleep for 12 hrs one day and then not at all for the next 3 days.. and im always tired in the day time.. is there any reason for this or am i just being a domber azzel? [SEP] best_answer: I don't normally promote products but in this case, I believe it might benefit you. It is not a pill or any consumable product. In fact, it's an ebook called, Powerful Sleep. I am only recommending the book because it's from a legitimate author and has worked very well for several people who have visited my website (which is about men's fitness). \n\nLet me explain what the book is about and why it might be worth considering. It is written by Kacper Postawski, a sleep science researcher. He studied insomnia to try to find a cure for this very common and life-disrupting problem. During the course of his research, he made some intriguing discoveries about why some people sleep 8, 10, 12 hours a day and still feel tired and why oversleeping like this is actually bad for you. \n\nHe points out in his book that controlling sleep quality, sleep cycles, light-dark cycles, circadian rhythms and lifestyle factors (exercise, stress, light exposure, drugs, alcohol, caffeine, etc.), are possibly more important than the quantity of sleep itself. In other words, it's not so important that you get "X" amount of sleep per night as it is to get quality sleep per night. In his book, he reveals information on psychological "triggers" and simple techniques that will help you fall asleep instantly, sleep soundly and wake up energized - automatically. \n\nPeople who have read the book have told me that they actually get less sleep than they did before and yet they feel more awake and energized. The reason is because they are getting quality sleep for the first time. Just because you get 8+ hours of sleep does not mean those are quality hours of sleep. Most people can get the quality of sleep they need with as little as 5 or 6 hours. This book explains how that is possible and teaches you how to get the quality sleep you need.\n\nKacper also points out that for some people they truly do need 8 hours of sleep. Sleep is an individual matter and in this book, he shows you how to determine what your ideal sleep time is and how to get that quality sleep every night.\n\nIf you're curious about the book at all, visit his website (link provided below), and you'll get the first two chapters of the book for free. All you have to do is answer the question on the home page and then the first two chapters are emailed to you instantly. You'll be able to tell after reading the first two chapters if it's right for you or not. Good luck to you!\n\nTravis	Health
question_title: gas and bloating relief? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: OK -- the bloating is not in your stomach, which is where the simethicone helps.  Instead, the bloating is in the intestines, which could be 1 of several things.  For me, it was too much carbonation.  I drank 3-4 cokes a day.  By knocking soda out of my life, gas and bloating are pretty much gone.  It could also be iron supplements, lactose intolerance, or gluten intolerance.  I suggest you try 1 week elimination diets ... no soda for a week, etc. ... and find the culprit.  Last resort, it could be IBS, but only after a doctor checks you out.	Health

We were at a highway rest stop and a pickup pulled up beside us. It was obviously overheating and when the owner popped the hood, smoke came pouring out and we saw flames. My husband quickly emptied the trunk to get the extinguisher and was able to put out the fire. Look, the cost of a first aid kit is very small and if you never use it--no harm done. But you never know when it might come in handy, and then you'll be glad you had it.	Health

question_title: Cash Flow Streams Same Amounts but different NPV? [SEP] question_content: I asked this yesterday:\nHow can you compare the calculated PV in light of the fact that the undiscounted cash flow totals $150,000 in each case?????\n\n15%\nCash Flow Stream\nyear a b\n1 .... 50,000 ....10,000\n2 .....40,000 .... 20,000\n3 .... 30,000..... 30,000\n4 .... 20,000 .... 40,000\n5 .....10,000 .... 50,000\n\n      ..150,000 ..150,000 totals \n\nFor "A" using financial tables total NPV is $109,856.33 and using Excel an function the total NPV is $109,856.33\n\nFor "B" using financial tables total NPV is $91,290.00 and using Excel an function the total NPV is $91,272.98\n\nHere is the answer I got:  \nYou compare $109.9K vs $91.3K. Given the choice you would select Option A as this yields the higher result, reflecting the fact that you have a higher amount of $$ in the early period of the cash flow stream.\n\nThe question remains:  why the same totals but different NPV [SEP] best_answer: It's only common sense. It is better to get 50,000 (more money) in the first year so that you can invest it elsewhere for additional profit, than to have 10,000 (less money)in the first year.  Money has time value. A dollar in year one worth more than a dollar in year five. Mathematics calculation only confirm this common sense.	Business & Finance

question_title: What was the worst job you ever had?  Or, who was your worst boss? What happened? [SEP] question_content: At a place that I worked, they actually took away your vacation time if you were late coming to work because of a snowstorm.  They said they had no idea if you were being truthful, for all they knew you could have been applying for another job.  Once, when the building had no power because a transformer blew, and they were told everyone had to leave the building, they told us were would be docked or have to use vacation time, because we could be using that time to look for other jobs.  \n\nThe worst ever was when there was a bomb threat.  They never told the workers, we only knew when we noticed everyone was outside (it was a multi-office building) and someone went out and asked.  They said there was a bomb threat, and management left the building "as a precaution" but we were to keep working.  Needless to say, we all left the building, then we were told we were being charged vacation time for the time we did not work until the building was cleared for everyone to go back in. [SEP] best_answer: i worked for a doctor that had medical supplies that expired in the early 80's in his office that he would not let me throw away. (this was in 2001). he would also take the use latex gloves out of the biohazard bag, and put them back in the box to be reused. there are alot of other things, but i could be here all night. needless to say, i only worked there about 2 months, until i could find a new job.

question_title: Just married - need to change witholdings? [SEP] question_content: We just got married last month. I already owe this year, because when my son got a job and moved out last year, I forgot to change my witholdings at work (my fault). I was claiming Single 5 (Head of Household).\n\nIf I change my status to Married at this point, will I be taxed more heavily or will it be better for me?  What would work best for me?  Thanks. [SEP] best_answer: You should probably change your withholding so that it is more in line with your new situation.  If done correctly, it will end up so that you get more in your paycheck each week, but a smaller refund next year.\n\nBecause you are now married, you need to either file "married filing jointly" or "married filing separately".  It is tough to tell whether your tax will go up or down without more information, it you were going from single to married, total tax between you/spouse would probably go down.  But since it's HOH->married, it might go up.\n\nTypically, couples are better off filing jointly than separately, but that must be decided based on your circumstances.  I'd try both ways, and file whichever way gets you the lowest taxes.	Business & Finance

The Latin phrase Annuit Cœptis (He [God] has favored our undertaking) is located above the pyramid. NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM (New Order of the Ages) is shown on a ribbon below the pyramid.

If you can produce economic value (outcome) worth $1,000 a week, then they will pay you that amount.\n\nPeople make the mistake of going into business while NOT focusing on the value they must create. It's like a guy who's trying to date women, and has on his forehead the words "I want sex."\n\nWell, that's not the way to attract women, and so, similarly, someone who only wants to make money will NOT attract neither customers, investors nor business partners.

You could also ask when they are planning on making a decision. After that, I would call once a week.

question_title: what is the best way to get a first time morgage that is afortable? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I am actually a mortgage consultant. You can goto my site if you would like, and enter your info, and I can email you with any info. But for now, to make a mortgage affordable, put down as much as you can. The more down, the less the payments will be. Most people cannot put down 20% these days, which is fine. It is very common to do two mortgages, one for 80% of the sale price, and then another for the rest minus down payment, using two over one that is more than 80% removes PMI, which is Private mortgage insurance, which is almost always required for a loan above 80% of the value of the home. Also, with an adjustable rate mortgage, like a 3/1, which means the rate is fixed for 3 years at a low rate and then can fluxuate once a year after that, that is good for first time buyers. Or even a 5/1 , working the same way. That way, you get a lower rate, and if you move within 5 years great, whihc is the average for first time home buyers, and if you decide to stay, you can always refinance, when the rates are low again. If you want some more information, just goto my site, and I will email you back. In the box down the bottom, make sure you let me know that you got the link from here. I cannot help in all states, but I can def. help you out informationally.	Business & Finance
question_title: Do you think high quality,large,well cut diamonds are a good investment??? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: No, diamonds are not a good investment if you plan to buy an "investment grade" diamond, and lock it away in a dark safe deposit box. First of all, you are investing in a commodity that is controlled by a benevolent dictator (monopoly) in a foreign land. I'm talking of course about Debeers company that controls the price and distribution of over 80% of the world's diamonds. There is no free market price at the source of diamonds. Debeers sets the price and controls the quantity of diamonds available. No one knows how many diamonds are stored in Debeers' vaults.\n\nPeople who buy investment diamonds from a broker, friend or relative usually pay such a high price over true wholesale, that it might to take forever to see any real appreciation; this is especially true for those laymen who believe they really know the four C's and a lot about the diamond market. Wheeling and dealing in diamonds should only be attempted by experienced, professional diamond dealers. Diamonds pay no dividends or interest. My opinion is that diamonds are for wearing, not investing.	Business & Finance

question_title: What happenes if you default on a 401K loan? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you fail to pay your 401k loan, then you are taxed on it as if you would have taken a regular distribution. (Tax + Penalty for early distribution).\n\nThe amount that you owe is deducted from your total 401k amount.\n\nFor example.  If you take a 401k loan for $1000, and you have $3000 in your 401k and you quit your job, then the $1000 is deducted from your $3000 leaving you with a $2000 401k total.\n\nThe $1000 is also treated like a "distribution".  In other words, it's treated like an early withdrawal.  So at the end of the year, you owe a 43% penalty on the $1000, or $430 in taxes.  (33% income tax [or whatever your income tax rate is], 10% penalty).\n\nFurther more, since that $1000 is treated like regular income, it may push you into a higher tax bracket.	Business & Finance

This is not too expensive to do.\n\n2) Contact a major corporation who plays in the area of your idea/invention, to partner with them (they will typically (caveat) not steal your idea like some smaller companies may).\n\n3) Have the major corporation make the investment in product development by negotiating a contract for royalties on any sales of the final product, plus prohibition on selling the idea to any third party.\n\nYou're in business!!

With the resources and technology that we have, I can augment my income and improve our living status.

question_title: can you really make money on the internet? [SEP] question_content: So far, I've invested a few hundred dollars and have not made any money.  are reseller accounts good? and affeliate accounts?  i've tried lots of things...nothing works....is anyone doing something that works and is willing to share that info? [SEP] best_answer: First, you have to determine what you want to do on the Web. There are many ways to make money on the Web, and you need to choose the best way - what you can do, what your resources can afford, and what you think is needed. \n\nThe Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\n\nHere are the main business models you can adopt:\n\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \n\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\n\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or PowerHomeBiz.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\n\na. Advertising - From the article "How to Generate Advertising Revenues for Your Web Site" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol28/adrevenues.htm , there are several ways you can earn money from advertising:\n\n1. Join an advertising network. Advertising networks are organizations that aggregate Web sites that offer advertising space, and sell banner ads (and other advertising options) across them. Traffic requirement is often a minimum of 5,000 monthly impressions, although many do not accept sites hosted by free page services. \n\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \n\n2. Participate in contextual advertising networks. Contextual advertising are text ads delivered based on the content of the web page using an automated system. \n\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/\nYahoo! Publishing Network (currently in beta and available to US publishers only) http://publisher.yahoo.com/ \nIntellixt http://vibrantmedia.com/site/web_01a5.htm \nQuigo Adsonar http://www.quigo.com/adsonarexchange.htm \nIndustryBrains http://www.industrybrains.com \nCommission Junction Evolution http://www.cj.com\n\n3. Sell advertising for your site directly. This is admittedly a more difficult route for a small business site wanting to earn advertising revenues. But hey, as they say: "no pain, no gain!" \n\nb. Affiliate Programs - you sell other people's products that your audience may be interested in; and you get a certain commission after the desired action was done (whether a sale, a lead, subscription to email newsletter, or however this is defined)\n\nc.

question_title: How do you feel about people with HIV? [SEP] question_content: How do you feel about people with HIV? Do you try and understand them, help them, stay away from them? What are your feelings on this. [SEP] best_answer: You know, I think the best way to answer that is to know someone going through it.  For instance, say your sister is your best friend in the world.  Everthing is fine until one day you get a call from her saying that she has be tested positive for HIV.  What's the first thing that will go through your mind?\n\nNow add the fact that the reason she has HIV is because she was in a collision a year or so prior and was injured. She needed a blood transfusion and showed no symptoms.  She and her wonderful husband decide to have a child and as a routine check finds out that she was HIV positive.  Now what do you think?\n\nWell, I think that if the person I've known all my life suddenly came down with a disease like cancer or had a heart attack, I wouldn't stay away from him or her, but try to understand them and help them if they need help.  I also imagine what it would be like not having them in my life just because I stayed away from them knowing they had heart disease.  \n\nYes, I know that things like HIV can be passed on. But seriously, how are they going to pass it on to me?  \n\nIn essence, I think that if someone has HIV, I should treat them as someone who doesn't, as long as I'm not planning on sleeping with them:)\n\nI hope that answered your question. :)	Business & Finance
question_title: How does one deal with companies who buy old debt and try to get you to pay? [SEP] question_content: I have an old credit card account from 6 1/2 years ago that apparently an attorney orgagnization bought the debt and is now trying to collect. I have to question the validity since the original amount was about $1,800 now that are trying to say I owe $10,000. [SEP] best_answer: Dealing with old debt \nBy Lucy Lazarony • Bankrate.com \nDon't let an old debt come back to haunt you. \n\n\nSome debt collectors are unearthing old debts, debts that are five to 10 years old or more, in the hope of squeezing some fresh money out of unsuspecting consumers.\n\n"I had one guy who got a call on a debt 14 years later," says Gerri Detweiler, author of "The Ultimate Credit Handbook."\n\nA collection call on an old debt can be tricky to handle, and if you handle it wrong it could lead to big trouble down the road. \n\nFirst off, it's important to realize that an old unpaid debt can't hurt you nearly as much as a new unpaid debt. \n\n- advertisement - \n \n \nAn unpaid credit account will mar your credit report for seven years. But once your debt passes the seven-year mark, you're in the clear. \n\nWith newer debts, debt collectors may call and threaten to sue you day in and day out. With an older debt, any debt collector that threatens to take you to court is breaking the law.\n\nThat's quite a difference and it all hinges on whether the debt a collector is haranguing you about is beyond the statute of limitations for delinquent debt in your state.\n\nOnce a debt is older than the statute of limitations for debt in your state, a debt collector no longer has the right to sue you for payment. You may still have a moral obligation to pay back the debt, but you can't be sued over it.\n\n"They can still ask you to pay, but they can't threaten to sue. If they do, it's a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act," says John Ventura, a consumer attorney in Brownsville, Texas, and author of the e-book Stop Debt Collectors Cold.\n\nLet's say you still owe some money on an old credit card account left over from your college days, 10 years earlier. And let's say the statute of limitations for credit card accounts in your state is five years. \n\nA debt collector may call you and ask you for payment for this forgotten account, but he can't take you to court or threaten to sue you over it. If he does, he's violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. \n\nAnd since the debt is more than 7 years old, it's no longer listed on your credit report.\n\nWatch your step\n\nEven though a debt collector won't ever admit it, you're the one with the advantage here. But one little misstep could change all that.\n\nIn some states, making a partial payment to a debt collector or even acknowledging that you owe the money is enough to make an old debt new again.\n\nIf this happens, the five-year statute of limitations on your debt starts all over again. A debt collector has five more years in which to sue you for payment. And a non-payment on your new-again debt could be reported on your credit report. Then the advantage transfers to debt collectors.\n\nThe best way to handle a collection call for an old debt is to say as little as possible. Don't agree to pay. Don't acknowledge the debt. \n\nIn her book, "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts," attorney Robin Leonard offers the following advice: \n\n"You should never talk to the collection agency about it at all, even if they call at a permitted hour of the day. Just hang up the phone or put the receiver down and walk away."\n\nThe best way to respond to a collection notice on an old debt is in writing.\n\nUnder the law, a debt collector must send you a written notice telling you the amount of money you owe and the name of the creditor. If within 30 days of receiving this collection notice you write a letter back disputing the debt, a debt collector may not contact you.\n\nIt's a good idea to send this letter via certified mail so you'll have proof that the debt collector received it. Under the law, a collector may only renew collection activities if proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill, is sent to you. \n\n"Definitely seek a	Business & Finance

question_title: how to make partitions 4 ur pc hard disk? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: For my PC HDD for the very first time i did it by booting my pc with a windows 98 boot cd. From the boot option i chose boot with cd-rom support. Then in the command prompt i typed fdisk. When it ran i chose to create primary partition first and then i chose no to use part of my HDD and gave a size like 25%. When it was done i chose extended DOS partition to create other three logical DOS drives. For the extended DOS partition i chose to use the rest of my HDD for it. When done it asked me to create logical drives in it. I gave 33% for the 1st and 2nd one and the rest for the last one. when done i exited the fdisk program and rebooted the system and started installing windows 98.\n\nNow the above option is for the first time if u have no other PC. If u have one more HDD with operating system in it or another PC then u can attach ur new HDD to that PC and partition it with third party softwares like PQ Partition Magic.\n\nIf u want to install Windows 2000 or Windows XP in that HDD just boot ur PC with ur Windows 2000 or Windows XP bootable CD and do partitions in it when prompted. It is very easy. It will show u what to do in detail on ur screen.\n\nPlay Safe...	Computers & Internet

Anyone can help? =) [SEP] best_answer: This is my new standard format response for myspace users. First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldn’t have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more “internet friends” you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they won’t mind. Lastly, if this standard format response does not apply to your particular myspace question, oh well, I guess I won’t have you on my top five list, huh?

If you have anything else inside like sound cards or TV capture or anything, remove it temporarily.  Try to re-install XP like that.  If that fails, go into your system BIOS (usually press F2 key right at computer startup time) and select safe defaults for all your BIOS settings.  Reboot and try installation once again.  I assume you are using an original certified copy of Windows XP on CD.  If all this fails, you may very well have something wrong with your motherboard.  It is also possible, though very unlikely, that both your RAM sticks had something happen to them at the same time.  You can get a RAM tester to run from a floppy disk.  See the sources below.

I like this site cuse you can look at the FAQs and see if you really need to reformat. If you have options set not to save, it will not save. Reformatting doesn’t “erase” anything; it just changes the file extensions so that they can’t be found in the conventional way. The only way for files not to be found is to destroy the hard drive itself. Yeah, you can get wipe Disk, that would take care of any spyware, worm or trojan problems.	Computers & Internet

(i would prefere to do it this way if possible due to the fact i have to move the mini disc player from another room which is hooked up thru my amp. but can i just do it the way discribed above.if you suggest going thru my amp would be better...what leads do i use and where do i put them in and out? (i would have to move this also).. if you have any other ideas i would be very grateful. thanks all. [SEP] best_answer: OK... this is called Sound Capture. The way it works is this: you connect an audio lead from the headphone jack socket of your MiniDisc player to the Line In jack socket on your computer's sound card.\n\nYou then start up the "Windows Sound Recorder" program. Find it by going to All Programs > Accessories > Entertainment > Sound Recorder\n\nNow, as a test, start playing a track on your MiniDisc player - the sound should come out of your PC's speakers - make sure your sound is turned on with the volume up.\n\nNow go back to the beginning of the MiniDisc track you want to capture. Click the round red Record button in Windows Sound Recorder, then within a few seconds press Play on your MiniDisc - the capture should begin... and when the MiniDisc track ends and fades out, click the Stop button in Windows Sound Recorder.\n\nNow click File > Save As in Windows Sound Recorder, and save the file as a WAV wherever you like.\n\nThis is the general way of capturing sound. It isn't a transfer of the original digital file, so there may be a small drop in quality, but it will still be good.\n\nPlease post again if you need more detail.\n\nDC :)	Computers & Internet

question_title: csma/cd jam signal? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If a collision is heard, both of the senders will send a jam signal over the Ethernet. This jam signal indicates to all other devices on the Ethernet segment that there has been a collision, and they should not send data onto the wire. (A second indication of a collision is the noise created by the collision itself.) \n\nAfter sending the jam signal, each of the senders will wait a random amount of time before beginning the entire process over. The random time helps to ensure that the two devices don't transmit simultaneously again.	Computers & Internet

question_title: how to use openGL in C#? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: The C# Graphics Library (hosted on Sourceforge), has code which wraps the OpenGL Application Programming Interfaces.  Another option is to use "SharpGL", another wrapper written by Dave Kerr and hosted on CodeProject.\n\nIf you wish to create your own wrappers for OpenGL in C#, you will need to use Platform/Invoke to call the API functions that are exported from the GL Dynamic Link Libraries.  This requires using the System.Runtime.InteropServices library and special declarations for the function exports (and parameters) using attributes to declare them.\n\nSeveral of these Platform/Invoke declarations have been provided by the community on the PInvoke.NET Wiki.  I've included the links to all three resources below.	Computers & Internet

question_title: Looking for the easiest Martial art to learn. Any recommendations? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: If you're looking for a hard (striking) style, any of the variant forms of karate will fit the bill (kempo karate and shotokan karate are fairly popular).\nIf you're looking for a soft (throws, locks, etc) style, I agree with the aikido recommendation.  Especially if you just want to defend yourself and not strike people (Much easier to let the pavement, a convenient table, or bookcase strike them instead).  Aikido is very laid back and has a natural, non-aggressive feel to it.\nIf you want a little more aggression, try jiu-jutsu (the Gracie forms are great for winning tournaments) or judo.\n\nAnd if you want to have fun and try something really different, try capoeira.\n\nAll these styles and more are available for view at wikipedia.org, and most of the major styles have websites (ie. www.aikiweb.com for aikido)	Sports

question_title: Why is Michael Jordan the best basketball player ever? [SEP] question_content: I don't agree that he is... but tell me WHY YOU think he is.  Is it the number of 'rings'? Is it his scoring? Was it the shoes? What was it that made you believe Michael Jordan was the best basketball player in the history of the NBA?  I don't hear a lot of substanitive argument, just statements that people seem unwilling to defend or debate.\n\nSo come on, give it your best shot!   \n\n(After over 700 answers, this is my first question, and I'd really like to know why people believe what they do).  Thanks in advance for your responses! Have a good one!!! [SEP] best_answer: Well, let's see..... he can jump really high. Or maybe it's because he doesn't miss any shots. No, that can't be it. Perhaps, he's the best because he won slam dunk contests. Plus he pioneered the long baggy shorts. No, no, no....I think I got it:  ITS BECAUSE ESPN SAYS SO !!!!  Yeah, thats it.\n\nSeriously, sorry to break it to you folks, but Michael Jordan is not the best player of all time. There is no legitimate argument, period. He might be one of the most exciting players to watch, but in terms of all around talent, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are far and away much better. \n\nThe reason some people say Jordan is the best is because there has been no athlete in the past two decades who has been more over-hyped, more promoted, and more marketed than Michael Jordan. He could not possibly live up to those standards. Between movies, shoes, cereal boxes, fast food and everything else he's advertised, who hasn't heard of Michael Jordan ? \n\nHe came along at just the right time. David Stern became commissioner and heavily marketed the NBA to corporate America. What better face to put on it but Jordan. He played a flashier style of b-ball, be was polite and accesible to writers and fans. In other words, he was family friendly. But he played for the lowly Chicago Bulls.\n\nSo maybe if we increased the number of playoff teams from 12 to 16, the Bulls might make the playoffs and we can have Michael on t.v. more. And maybe if we added a slam dunk contest to the all-star game, people can see even more of Michael. Plus, we now have a 24 hour sports channel so nobody can possibly miss his high flying dunks and acrobatic moves.\n\nNow, I 'm not trying to take anything away from Jordan. He was a great player FOR HIS TIME. He had great talent and was exciting to watch. But as far as dominating the league, that didn't happen until Bird and Magic had gone and the league expanded to 27 and 29 teams, thereby depleting the talent pool.	Sports

Of course its not just that the Yanks have a new CF and lead-off man, but the signing took away from the Red Sox. Doesn't look like they're missing him yet though . . .\n\nIf the Yanks win it all and Damon contributes with some heroics, then yes, it'll have been all worth it of course.	Sports

question_title: pacman pacman.? [SEP] question_content: Does anyone agree with me that the pacman will eat barerra alive? manny Pacquiao ofcourse. [SEP] best_answer: Barrera will definitely avoid being knocked out.  He won't fight like Morales did.  Morales was too aggressive.  Pacman and Roach called it correctly that Morales would try to finish the match early because he fears he wouldn't have the stamina for an extended battle.\n\nBarrera however is a different case.  Remember when Pacman beat him the first time, it wasn't a knock down.  The man was standing when his corner threw in the towel.  I'm guessing this means he can take Pacman's punches (although it reduced him to a punching bag).\n\nI think Pacman will get UD victory over Barrera this time.  The judges will probably not look very favorably to Barrera running away.\n\nSantana-\nWhy did you say that Pacman is avoiding Marquez.  As I recall, Pacman did ask for a rematch and it was Marquez who said no.  But in any case, I am willing to concede that Pacman might have lost that fight.  But he has learned a lot since.  He came into that fight overconfident thinking that he has nothing left that needs improvement.  But that fight and the fight against Morales showed him what the skills are that he lacked.	Sports

question_title: Why are the Detroit Pistons losing to the Miami Heat, Detroit is a far better team, but they are being beaten? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I may not get the best answer for this, because you are obviously a Pistons fan and I am not, but there are several reasons, and if you are open minded, you will see that I am right.\n\n1.  Detroit is the 2006 version LA Lakers of the 2004 NBA Finals. A favorite to win, yet so cocky that they believe that they cannot lose.  The media has only perpetuated this. i.e. Even after almost falling to the Cavs (the Cavs?!) most people had them as favorites against the Heat.  Had the media pegged the Pistons as even or underdogs, that may have motivated them some, but as Flip Saunders has said himself, Detroit feels like the "Fat Cats."  \n\n2.  Miami only had their "core" together for 9 games (8 or 9, im not sure) this entire season.  Thats not much for a team that was assembled about 7 months ago.  They are just now finding out how to play as a team.\n\n3.  No one thinks about the fact that Detroit and Miami have the same record in the second half of the season.  Thats right, Detroit DOES NOT have a better record than Miami in the second half of the season, and the Heat, have a far better playoff record than the Pistons.  As Shaq has said, "the regular season don't mean nothing."\n\n4.  Miami is a deeper team than Detroit.  Look at Detroit, after McDyess and maybe Hunter, they have no one coming off the bench that is a threat.  Detroit was deeper last year, but foolishly made a trade with the Magic that only made them worse.  In effect, Detroit gambled that their starting five would not get injured or fatigued.\n\n5.  As a Piston fan, you're tired of hearing this, I'm sure, as I am tired of saying it, but lets face the facts, Wade and O'neal would have gone to the Finals last year, had they not BOTH been injured.  \n\n6.  The Pistons never admit that they need to adjust anything.  Example, whenever the Pistons lost games this year it was attributed to "boredom" with the NBA.  C'mon, boredom?  Their "If it aint rought it aint right" slogan is a cop out.  And whenever they lose (especially to the Heat) they give no credit to Miami, which has infuriated, and motivated them.  Admittedly, the Pistons ARE the best comeback team in the NBA, but do they LIKE going down 3-2 or 3-1, I dont think so.\n\n7.  The emergence of a true superstar.  Dwyane Wade is becoming a super-superstar in front of their very eyes.  The best defense cannot stop him, no one can stop him.  Dwyane Wade is becoming the Flash.\n\nHaving said all that, I will also tell you what every other Heat fan won't.  I am scared shitless, that SOMEHOW Detroit will win the series.  I mean if they win the Next 2 games, game 7 is up for grabs, and Phoenix did it earlier this year, and San Antonio almost did it.  So although it is not likely, it is possible, that Detroit will win.  I know it and every Miami fan on the planet knows it.  But thats where we differ, Miami fans and players admit that they can be beaten, whereas, Detroit fans and Pistons will still think they can win, even after they've lost.  I hope this is Miami's year, and it SEEMS like it, but if anyone can beat them, it's Detroit.\n\nGO HEAT!	Sports

Cependant, il y a des différences de définitions selon qu'on utilise l'un ou l'autre mot. Du moins pour ceux qui pratiquent, c'est l'usage.\nFaire du jogging signifie que l'on coure régulièrement mais sans but autre que la forme. Toujours la même allure sur un temps donné (30, 40 ou 60 minutes).\nFaire de la course à pieds signifie plutôt qu'on s'entraîne d'une manière diversifiée. Plusieurs fois par semaine et à allures variées sur des distances et durées différentes à chaque fois. Tout ça pour améliorer ses performances et faires des compétitions.\nVoilà, personnellement, la différence que je fais entre les deux.\n\nAu fait, El Pechin, fartlek, c'est suédois.\n\nPetit ajout à propos de ton autre question, Cordelia, un type qui fait de la course à pieds selon la définition sur laquelle nous somme d'accord, fais du jogging (ou un ptit footing :-)) POUR RÉCUPÉRER !

[SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: I played college baseball at Eastern Conn. St.  University. My sophomore year (This was March of 2002), we were down by two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning with two on and two outs. They tried to intentionally walk our cleanup hitter, and he reached out and stroked a homer to right field for a walk off.  I know its not the majors or anything, but a great story nonetheless.

question_title: Why does Puma soccer shirt cling on the skin so much? [SEP] question_content: I noticed the teams wearing the Puma soccer shirts look more sweaty than the teams that wear other brand such as Nike or Adidas.  Wouldn't it slow you down if the shirt was clinging to your body? [SEP] best_answer: no its more stream line.. they have different fabrics in both of their uniforms.. (reserves and homes).. because the heat reacts differently in different countries.. but when it clings to your body the air doent flow through it causing a reduced draft (meaning they dont get held back as much and they can run faster)	Sports

question_title: Which MLB stadiums are considered hitters parks? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: espn.com has a link that provides park factors for each season from 2001 to 2005. This is an objective measure and can be broken down by runs, hits, 2b, 3b, HRs or bbs.\n\nPark Factor compares the rate of stats at home vs. the rate of stats on the road.\nA rate higher than 1.000 favors the hitter. Below 1.000 favors the pitcher.\nPF = ((homeRS + homeRA)/(homeG)) / ((roadRS + roadRA)/(roadG))\n\nFor the 2005 season the top 5 hitter ballparks for runs were:\n\n1. Coors field (Rockies)       1.285\n2. Citizens Bank (Phillies)    1.161\n3. Great American (Reds)       1.128\n4. Turner Field(Braves)        1.095\n5.

question_title: i have a shimano deore mega 9 crankset. can i use an xt 8 speed rear mech or does it have to be a 9 speed? [SEP] question_content:  [SEP] best_answer: You probably need to repost and clarify a few things-  do you mean crankset (which is the front three gears) or cassette (which is the gearing on the rear wheel, usually 7 - 9 speeds)? Also, by rear mech, do you mean derailleur, or rear cassette?\n\nI can tell you this - when Shimano moved from 8 to 9 speeds they changed the chain, so a 9 speed crankset and an 8 speed cassette might be problematic.\n\nIf you are only worried about your rear derailleur, then you should not have much of a problem - just set your adjustment screws correctly and go.

Look at Dever (Tatum Bell and Mike Anderson) and Kansas City (Priest Holmes and Larry Johnson). Reggie Bush is going to be a great running back and the Texans can't afford to pass up on him.	Sports

question_title: Do you think Jere Lehtinen will win the Frank J. Selke Trophy again? [SEP] question_content: He's won it 3 times before, and he put on an amazing performance again this year, but will they give it to Rod Brind'Amour almost entirely because he was on the team that took home Lord Stanley's cup? Or perhaps you think they'll go the other way with Mike Fisher of the Senators? [SEP] best_answer: I think Brind'Amour will get it simply because of his leadership and play all the way up to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  Generally teams that go further in the NHL Playoffs do get a higher look at being given awards.  It's more prestigious for them, they worked harder for it.  And you gotta remember- hockey is a team sport, not an individual sport.  So the better a player's team makes him look- the better chance he also has at winning it.	Sports
